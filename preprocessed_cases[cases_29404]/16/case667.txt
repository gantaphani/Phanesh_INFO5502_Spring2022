plaintiffs appellants bayerische landesbank bayerische and bayerische landesbank new york branch filed this action against defendant appellee aladdin capital management llc aladdin for breach of contract and gross negligence based on aladdin alleged disregard of its obligation to manage the portfolio in favor of the investors.aladdin purportedly gross allegedly caused plaintiffs to lose their entire million investment in the cdo.on january,plaintiff bayerische landesbank,new york branch filed its original complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking to recover damages for the loss of its investment,and later filed an amended complaint joining its parent,bayerische landesbank,as.aladdin moved to dismiss the amended complaint,and,by order dated july,the district court granted the motion.the district court held that,because of a provision of the contract limiting intended beneficiaries to those specifically provided herein,plaintiffs could not bring a beneficiary breach of contract claim,and held also that plaintiffs could not recast their failed contract claim in tort.for the reasons described below,however,we conclude that plaintiffs have properly alleged both a breach of contract claim and a tort claim.
factual allegations 
the pertinent allegations in plaintiffs amended complaint,together with those documents incorporated in it by reference and matters of which judicial notice may be taken,chambers time warner,cir internal quotation marks omitted,are as follows 
plaintiff bayerische landesbank is a publically regulated bank incorporated in germany with its principal place of business in munich,germany.bayerische landesbank,new york branch is the new york branch of bayerische landesbank and is a federally chartered bank licensed by the united states office of the comptroller of the currency.defendant aladdin is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in stamford,connecticut.aladdin is a registered investment adviser under the investment advisers act of,and is a subsidiary of aladdin capital holdings llc ach,an investment bank.
in december,plaintiffs invested million in a collateralized debt obligation structured and marketed by defendant aladdin and by goldman sachs and goldman sachs international collectively,goldman sachs.a cdo is a financial instrument that sells interests here in the form of notes to investors and pays the investors based on the performance of the underlying asset held by the cdo.the cdo at issue in this case,called the aladdin synthetic cdo ii aladdin cdo was a synthetic cdo,meaning that the asset it held for its investors was not a traditional asset like a stock or bond,but was instead a derivative instrument,an instrument whose value was determined in reference to still other assets.the derivative instrument the aladdin cdo held was a credit default swap entered into between the aladdin cdo and goldman sachs capital markets,gscm based on the debt of approximately one hundred corporate entities and sovereign states that were referred to as the reference entities and comprised the reference portfolio.
a credit default swap cds is a financial derivative that allows counterparties to buy and sell financial protection for the creditworthiness of specific corporations or sovereign entities,here the reference entities.a counterparty taking the position that the reference entities would not experience a credit event such as bankruptcy,default,restructuring,or failure to pay a defined obligation is said to be the protection seller,similar to an insurance underwriter.a counterparty taking the position that the reference entities would experience a credit event is the protection buyer,similar to an individual purchasing insurance.a credit default swap differs from traditional insurance in that the protection buyer need not actually own the underlying asset or security in order to purchase protection on it.more to the point,the protection seller is,in effect,taking a long position and betting that there will be no credit event,while the protection buyer is taking a short position and betting that there will be a credit event.
here,aladdin and goldman sachs created a shell entity,the issuer of the aladdin cdo,to serve as the protection seller,while gscm served as the protection buyer.thus,gscm was to pay premiums to the issuer in order to purchase protection against the occurrence of a credit event.the issuer was also authorized to establish a separate short reference portfolio,which would reverse the counterparties positions the issuer would be the protection buyer and gscm would be the protection seller.
since the issuer was just a shell entity,aladdin and goldman sachs,in order to fund the cdo and have money available to pay gscm in the event of a credit event,marketed interests in the cdo to investors in the form of notes.the notes were formally issued by the issuer,aladdin synthetic cdo ii spc,and the co issuer,aladdin synthetic cdo ii delaware llc,which are limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and delaware,respectively.aladdin,as portfolio manager,used the money received from investors who purchased the notes to purchase securities that,together with the payment of premiums by gscm,were intended to pay quarterly interest payments to noteholders until the cdo matured in december,when the principal would be returned to the noteholders.the principal that investors paid to purchase the notes was available to cover payments to gscm as the protection buyer if there were a credit event.
the issuer split the notes into separate series,each with different levels of risk and return.each series of notes had a specific level of risk,or subordination,that protected each series of notes against possible losses to the invested principal.for each series issued,a separate indenture spelled out the relationship between the noteholders of that series and the cdo.if a reference entity in the reference portfolio,the securities underlying the cds suffered a credit event,gscm would reduce the level of subordination for the affected series by a certain percentage amount,depending on the weight of the relevant reference entity in the reference portfolio.the plaintiffs here purchased notes in both series b and series c.the level of subordination for plaintiffs series b notes was and the level of subordination for the series c notes was.
the structure of the cds entered into by the issuer and gscm allowed the issuer to change the composition of the overall reference portfolio by trading reference entities into or out of the reference portfolio.this trading also affected the level of subordination.if the issuer replaced a reference entity reflected by a smaller spread or insurance premium with a reference entity reflected by a larger spread,that would increase the level of subordination for the noteholders,and vice versa.
if the level of subordination for a series went more than below zero,the entire amount invested by the noteholders in that series would go to gscm,and the notes would become worthless and no longer deliver interest payments.plaintiffs allege that the series they invested in could sustain credit events with respect to approximately ten or eleven reference entities before their subordination levels fell to more than below zero.additionally,if aladdin purchased protection for reference entities through the short portfolio,the noteholders subordination levels would be increased if those short reference entities experienced a credit event.thus,the financial interests of gscm and the noteholders were adverse.
since the issuer was just a shell entity,the noteholders needed someone to manage the reference portfolio,and,according to plaintiffs,protect the noteholders by minimizing the occurrence of losses and avoiding credit events.here,goldman sachs and aladdin structured the cdo so that aladdin would manage the cdo as an independent investment manager on behalf of the noteholders.
plaintiffs allege that they purchased their notes in the aladdin cdo after aladdin and goldman sachs came to the offices of bayerische new york branch to present marketing materials regarding the aladdin cdo and to solicit plaintiffs investment.in the marketing book defendant provided to plaintiffs,defendant aladdin allegedly represented that its interests were aligned with the noteholders interests and that it would manage the reference portfolio in a conservative and defensive manner to avoid credit events and thus losses to noteholders.aladdin formal responsibilities,however,were spelled out in the portfolio management agreement pma,an agreement between aladdin and the shell issuer that was not signed by the noteholders.plaintiffs purchased million of the total million worth of notes from goldman sachs,which underwrote the cdo,goldman used its own money to purchase the notes from the issuer before reselling those notes to investors like plaintiffs.
plaintiffs did not enter into any direct contract with aladdin.aladdin,as the portfolio manager,selected the initial approximately reference entities that comprised the reference portfolio.plaintiffs allege that,following the issuance of the aladdin cdo on december,aladdin managed the portfolio in a grossly negligent fashion,culminating in the reference entities sustaining credit events just three years into the cdo term,thereby causing plaintiffs notes to default.as a result,plaintiffs lost their entire million principal investment and any future interest from the remaining four years of the cdo term.plaintiffs allege that,had aladdin simply left the initial reference portfolio in place,plaintiffs would not have suffered any losses whatsoever.
on the basis of the foregoing allegations,the amended complaint asserts two claims a claim in contract alleging that aladdin breached its obligations under the pma and a claim in tort alleging that aladdin conduct was grossly negligent,resulting in harm to the noteholders.on may,aladdin moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.on july,the district court held oral argument on defendant motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint from the bench.the district court confirmed its ruling from the bench by order dated july,and judgment dated july.on july,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the district court ruling,which the district court denied by order dated september.plaintiffs timely appealed the district court judgment and orders.
discussion 
jurisdiction.at the outset,we have an independent obligation to determine whether federal jurisdiction exists in this case.in the district court,the parties asserted that federal jurisdiction over this action existed pursuant to,which provides for diversity jurisdiction for disputes between,inter alia,citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.id.a.this form of diversity jurisdiction is often referred to as alienage jurisdiction.see,jpmorgan chase bank traffic stream b vi infrastructure,describing history of alienage jurisdiction.despite the parties agreement that such jurisdiction exists here,however,we are obliged to satisfy ourselves that jurisdiction exists.usha india,honeywell int l,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.

for corporate citizenship,the version of section c that was in effect at the time this action was commenced read a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.c.state,with a capital s,clearly refers only to the states of the united states.the diversity statute repeatedly distinguishes between such states and a foreign state with a lowercase see,id.a,d b c.state capital s is also referred to in connection with the state in which the action was originally filed.id.d.and section e expands the definition of state to territories,the district of columbia,and the commonwealth of puerto rico.id.e see also dyers,united states,noting the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.
we have not previously decided whether,under this prior version of section c,a corporation incorporated in the united states also takes the citizenship of its foreign principal place of business but three out of four of our sister circuits and two district courts in this circuit that have confronted this issue have concluded that a domestic corporation with a principal place of business abroad should be treated,for diversity purposes,as a citizen of only the state in which it is incorporated.see mas capital,biodelivery sciences int l,cir holding that,for a domestic corporation,the foreign principal place of business does not count torres peru copper,cir absent congressional amendment to section c to the contrary,we must conclude that for diversity purposes a corporation incorporated in the united states with its principal place of business abroad is solely a citizen of its state of incorporation.cabalceta std.fruit,cir holding that if a domestic corporation principal place of business is abroad,the foreign principal place of business can not be considered for diversity jurisdiction purposes lebanese am.evangelical synodof syria,civ.rjh,wl,at,holding c does not apply to a domestically incorporated corporation with its principal place of business abroad willems barclays bank,same.that is to say,under the prior version of section c that is applicable to this case,companies incorporated in the united states could not be dual citizens of the united states and a foreign state for diversity purposes.willems.at.but see nike,comercial iberica de exclusivas deportivas,cir noting,in dicta,w e draw no distinction between corporations incorporated in a state of the united states and those incorporated in a foreign country when determining the corporation citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.
we agree with the majority interpretation of the version of section c in effect at the time this action was commenced the statute does not treat domestic corporations with foreign principal places of business as aliens.although in past decisions we have simply cited section c and stated that a corporation is deemed to be a citizen both of the state in which it has its principal place of business and of any state in which it is incorporated,see,universal licensing,at,a corporation foreign principal place of business has never before been a dispositive issue that forced us to squarely address whether the text of the prior version of section c applied to foreign principal places of business.before congress enacted the dual citizenship provision of section in,corporations were treated as citizens only of the state or foreign state in which they were incorporated.see danjaq,pathecommc ns,cir citing.tugman.thus,a foreign corporation,even under the text of section c which makes no reference to foreign states should logically continue to be treated as a citizen of its place of incorporation.indeed,this is the ultimate conclusion we reached in franceskin credit suisse,in determining that one of the defendants,a corporation incorporated in switzerland with a place of business in new york,was a citizen of switzerland,such that it remained an alien corporation,cir.because the only plaintiff in franceskin was a citizen of argentina,diversity was destroyed and we dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.id.the opposite view that the foreign principal place of business of a domestic corporation makes that corporation an alien for diversity purposes has no prior grounding in historical practice,nor in the text of section.see torres,at outside of section c,we are aware of no authority for classifying a corporation as a citizen of the place where it has its principal business.we therefore resort to our traditional legal framework in which a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of its place of incorporation.
it is true that congress has since amended section c to include foreign state in the dual citizenship provision.federal courts jurisdiction and venue clarification act of,stat.to be codified at c.every corporation is now treated for diversity purposes as a citizen of both its state of incorporation and its principal place of business,regardless of whether such place is foreign or domestic.id.thus,if this case had been commenced in the district court after the effective date of the amendment,we would not have jurisdiction,as aladdin would be considered an alien for diversity purposes.see franceskin,at.but congress did not make the amendment to section applicable to cases pending when the act was enacted on december.instead,congress made the amendment applicable to cases commenced only after january,stat.this case was commenced on january,almost a year prior.the amendment is thus not applicable.
accordingly,we treat the delaware corporation with its principal place of business in japan as a citizen of the state of delaware only.thus,defendant aladdin is a citizen of the various states of the united states of which its member,ach,is a citizen through ach various members.plaintiffs are aliens defendant is a citizen.plaintiffs allege damages in excess of.we have jurisdiction over this case.
standing.while not challenging jurisdiction,aladdin argues that bayerische new york branch lacks standing to sue,and thus is not a proper party to this case.we agree.bayerische new york branch is merely a branch of bayerische german headquarters that is licensed to do business in the,through its charter with the office of the comptroller of the currency,pursuant to the international banking act.it is not separately incorporated,has no legal identity separate from bayerische landesbank,and therefore has no standing to assert a claim against aladdin independent of bayerische claim.see first bank of bos.int l banco nacional de cuba,cir greenbaum handlesbanken,d,sotomayor,t he law seems fairly that the domestic branch of a foreign bank is not a separate legal entity under either new york or federal law.it does not appear that this has any effect on the case in any material way,since bayerische landesbank is a proper plaintiff,and any actions affecting the new york branch in this case likewise affect bayerische proper.accordingly,we will treat the claims of bayerische landesbank,new york branch and bayerische landesbank as one and the same.

bayerische alleges that aladdin breached its duty to manage the reference portfolio in the noteholders favor and failed to perform its obligations using a degree of skill,care diligence and attention consistent with the practice and procedures followed by reasonable and prudent portfolio managers,in such a manner that its actions amounted to gross negligence and reckless disregard of its obligations.but,as already noted,bayerische was not a party to the pma,which sets forth aladdin duties as portfolio manager.only the shell issuer and aladdin signed the pma.accordingly,bayerische seeks to hold aladdin liable through two avenues that bayerische,as a noteholder,was an intended beneficiary of the pma that can enforce the contract or that,in the alternative,the contract created a legal duty in tort that aladdin owed to the noteholders,and bayerische can therefore sue for damages based on aladdin gross negligence.the district court rejected both theories of recovery but we disagree.
breach of contract third party beneficiary.the pma is governed by new york law.under new york law,a third party may enforce a contract when recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.levin tiber holding,cir quoting restatement second of contracts.the contract must clearly evidence an intent by the parties to permit enforcement by the third party,premium mortg.equifax,cir internal alteration omitted,such that the benefit to the third party was sufficiently immediate,rather than incidental,to indicate the assumption by the contracting parties of a duty to compensate the third party if the benefit was lost.madeira afordable hous,cir internal quotation mark omitted.in determining whether the parties intended to benefit the third party,a court should consider the circumstances surrounding the transaction as well as the actual language of the contract.subaru distribs.subaru of am,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting restatement second of contracts,reporter note,cmt.a.d ismissal of a claim is appropriate where the contract rules out any intent to benefit the claimant,or where the complaint relies on language in the contract or other circumstances that will not support the inference that the parties intended to confer a benefit on the claimant.id.internal citations omitted.
here,aladdin argues that section of the pma expressly rules out any intent to benefit the noteholders,trinity,cir under new york law,where a provision in a contract expressly negates enforcement by third parties,that provision is controlling.section reads 
beneficiaries 
this agreement is made solely for the benefit of the issuers and the portfolio manager,their successors and assigns,and no other person shall have any right,benefit or interest under or because of this agreement,except as otherwise specifically provided herein.the swap counterparty shall be an intended third party beneficiary of this agreement.
pma emphasis supplied.aladdin argues,and the district court found,that because section expressly names gscm,the swap counterparty,as an intended beneficiary,but does not expressly name the noteholders anywhere in the section,the noteholders were not otherwise specifically provided herein,and therefore the parties to the agreement did not intend for the noteholders to be beneficiaries of the pma.bayerische argues that reading otherwise specifically provided herein as limited to the names expressly listed within section,reads the wording too narrowly and ignores the other provisions of the contract that,in bayerische view,show a specific intent by the shell issuer and aladdin to benefit the noteholders.
against this background,we must first determine whether the language of section unambiguously excludes any intent to benefit the noteholders.see subaru,at greenfield philles records,noting that if complete,clear and unambiguous on its face,such an exclusion must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.in so deciding,we must also keep in mind that this inquiry here accrues in the context of a motion to dismiss,for u nless for some reason an ambiguity must be construed against the plaintiff,a claim predicated on a materially ambiguous contract term is not dismissible on the pleadings.eternity global master fund morgan guar.trust of,cir.

on its face,we can not conclude that section precludes an intent by the parties to benefit the noteholders.the herein in except as otherwise specifically provided herein is not defined.while it might be read to refer,as aladdin argues,to only section,it could just as reasonably be read to refer,as bayerische argues,to the pma as a whole.indeed,the latter interpretation seems more likely.the clause at issue comes at the end of a sentence that states no other person shall have any right under this agreement,except as otherwise specifically provided herein.emphasis supplied.the following sentence,which identifies the swap counterparty as an intended third party beneficiary emphasis supplied has no language of limitation and could reasonably be read as clarification that,whomever else might be a beneficiary,the swap counterparty is for certain.see also sony computer entm t express,d,holding specifically provided otherwise herein broad enough to refer to full contract between sony and common carrier,but not to provision in separate contract between a subcontracted carrier and railway company.
by contrast,in one of the cases the district court relied on,india.com,dalal,the parties negating clause read 
neither this agreement or any provision hereof nor any schedule,exhibit,certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto,nor any agreement to be entered into pursuant hereto or any provision hereof,is intended to create any right,claim or remedy in favor of any person or entity,other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and any other parties indemnified under article xi.
cir.this language definitively precluded any intent by the parties to confer a benefit on a third party.here,by contrast,the text of section does not,on its face,specifically foreclose bayerische theory of recovery.
accordingly,we must look beyond section to the contract as a whole to determine whether provided herein should be read as limited to the swap counterparty or whether it can be fairly read to include the noteholders like bayerische.see ja apparel,at cautioning against reading contractual terms in isolation.as it happens,other portions of the pma evince an intent to benefit the noteholders by defining aladdin obligations and delineating the scope of its liability to the noteholders.for example,section of the pma states that the portfolio manager shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that it takes no action that would adversely affect the interests of the holders of the notes in any material respect other than as permitted under the transaction documents.even more tellingly,section of the pma,entitled benefit of this agreement limit on liability,states,in relevant part 
the portfolio manager shall perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the terms of the transaction documents applicable to it.the portfolio manager agrees that such obligations shall be enforceable at the insistence of each issuer,the trustee on behalf of the holders of the relevant notes,or the requisite percentage of holders of the relevant notes on behalf of themselves,as provided in the relevant indenture.
together,these sections plausibly demonstrate an intent to benefit the noteholders.
other sections of the contract further support this plausible interpretation.section c of the pma,for example,allows a majority of the noteholders or majority of the holders of each series to remove the portfolio manager for cause,where cause is defined,inter alia,as a material breach of the pma.it would be odd to conclude that the parties intended to allow the noteholders to remove aladdin as portfolio manager for breaching its duties,but not allow them to sue aladdin for damages resulting from that breach.
defendant cites our affirmance in banco espirito santo deinvestimento,as allegedly rejecting this very same argument.banco espirito santo deinvestimento,citibank,civ.mbm,wl,at,aff,app x cir summary order.we disagree.in banco,the plaintiff had invested in a structured finance fund,called captiva,which in turn invested in the senior debt obligations of corporations.id.at.the limitation of liability clause between the captiva fund which was similar to the issuer here and citibank which was similar to aladdin here stated 
citibank shall not have any liability to captiva,or to its shareholders or creditors,for any error in judgment,mistake of law,or for any loss arising out of any investment,or for any other act or omission in the performance of its,his or her obligations to captiva except for liability to which it would be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,bad faith,gross negligence or reckless disregard of its,his or her duties and obligations hereunder.
id.at.the district court concluded that this provision did not make plaintiff,a shareholder,an intended beneficiary of the contract,because t his clause acknowledges only that citibank may owe some duty to besi in besi capacity as a shareholder of captiva,not as a beneficiary of the administrative agreements.id.at emphasis supplied.here,by contrast,section of the pma shows an intent to benefit the noteholders directly and section expressly acknowledges that aladdin obligations shall be enforceable at the insistence of the requisite percentage of holders of the relevant notes on behalf ofthemselves,as provided in the relevant indenture.pma emphasis supplied see also a limiting liability to gross negligence but distinguishing between issuer,the trustee,the swap counterparty,and the holders of notes.
drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff,a plausible reading of the parties agreement is that the pma expressly requires the portfolio manager to perform various obligations including managing the reference portfolio on behalf of the noteholders the limitations on liability that discuss the noteholders suggest that the parties intended that the noteholders be able to sue aladdin directly,albeit only for acts of gross negligence.such a reading of the contract does not,as aladdin argues,fail to give effect to the language of section,for section would still prevent from suing on the pma.moreover,given section limitation on enforcement directly by the noteholders to the requisite percentage in the indenture,section could plausibly be read as intended to exclude small noteholders,or secondary market noteholders,from suing aladdin directly.
in short,it is more than plausible that the parties intended the pma to inure to the benefit of the noteholders.see eternity global master fund,at holding contract with ambiguous terms should not be dismissed on pleadings.otherwise,to read the ambiguous language of specifically provided herein as not encompassing these express obligations undertaken by aladdin would leave these obligations enforceable only by the shell issuer and the swap counterparty,gscm,that,as the counterparty,had interests that were directly opposed to those of the noteholders.
thus,although section is ambiguous,we need not look beyond the four corners of the contract as a whole to conclude that,drawing all inferences in bayerische favor,it is plausible that the parties intended the noteholders to benefit from the pma.nonetheless,where the contract language creates ambiguity,extrinsic evidence as to the parties intent may properly be considered,ja apparel,at,and in the context of a motion to dismiss,if a contract is ambiguous as applied to a particular set of facts,a court has insufficient data to dismiss a complaint for failure to state claim,eternity global master fund,at.
here,the allegations set forth in the amended complaint regarding bayerische decision to invest in the cdo plausibly indicate that the parties intended the pma to benefit the noteholders such as bayerische.the complaint alleges that aladdin and goldman sachs came to bayerische office in new york to present marketing materials regarding the aladdin cdo and to solicit bayerische investment.in the marketing book,aladdin represented that its interests were aligned with investors interests in the cdo and that it would manage the reference portfolio in a conservative and defensive manner to avoid losses to the noteholders,and gave some specifics as to the parameters it would use to manage the portfolio conservatively.the offering circular that was included among the marketing materials specifically detailed how aladdin could trade out reference entities,and explained that aladdin and the cdo would use the pma to define aladdin obligations.these allegations further support bayerische interpretation that aladdin obligations under the pma were intended to protect the noteholders.
these allegations also show the sharp contrast between this case and,the other case the district court primarily relied on in dismissing plaintiffs breach of contract claim.in,plaintiff,morse was retained as the general contractor to build the times square hotel.id.at.in turn,morse subcontracted several other entities to perform specific jobs for the construction,pursuant to provisions of the general contract that contemplated subcontracting.id.at.morse sued one of its main subcontractors,trinity,for failing to complete its work in a timely and competent manner.id.trinity,in turn,filed counterclaims against other subcontractors and an architect,alleging,inter alia,that they negligently performed their obligations under their separate subcontracts such that trinity was unable to complete the job on time and competently.id.at.
although trinity alleged a claim for negligence against the other subcontractors,trinity did not like bayerische here allege a breach of contract claim.thus,in,we analyzed only whether trinity could bring a negligence claim against a party with whom it lacked contractual privity.we concluded that new york law did not allow for a construction subcontractor to sue another subcontractor or architect based on the facts presented,as nothing in the parties obligations to perform discrete,circumscribed roles in the overall construction project indicated that the subcontracts were intended to benefit the other subcontractors,as opposed to the general contractor,at.
in reaching our conclusion in,we also noted that each of the subcontracts contained a negation clause,which read 
article no third party beneficiary 
except as otherwise provided herein,no provision of this agreement shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person including the public at large so as to constitute any such person a third party beneficiary of this agreement or any one or more of the terms hereof or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
id.at.in addition to our reading of the facts and new york case law that the subcontractors did not generally intend to benefit each other,id.at citing james mckinney son,lake placid olympic games,dep t,modified on othergrounds,northrup contracting,village of bergen,misc d,modified on other grounds,dep t,we further reasoned that although various provisions of those subcontracts reflect and envision coordinated effort by the various subcontractors,the explicit negation of beneficiary obligations in article weighs far more heavily in the balance.id.at internal citation omitted.concluding that article further tipped the balance against an intent for the subcontractors to have a duty to each other,we noted that u nder new york law,where a provision in a contract expressly negates enforcement by third parties,that provision is controlling.id.at.
the instant case is far different from,particularly as pertains to bayerische breach of contract claim.first,although the subcontracts in envision ed coordinated effort by the subcontractors as one would expect by the nature of dividing up construction tasks to various subcontractors,we concluded that the subcontractors were working on behalf of the general contractor who in turn,was working on behalf of the,not on behalf of each other.id.at.by contrast,here,the pma expressly contemplates that aladdin will undertake an obligation to manage the reference portfolio on behalf of the noteholders.see pma,see also i aladdin obligation to minimize occurrence of losses to noteholders.second,because was a tort case,we did not decide whether,as a matter of contract interpretation,except as otherwise provided herein referred to provisions of the contract outside of the party beneficiary clause,or whether it was limited to article.third,even the titles of the relevant provisions reflect different intents by the parties in as compared to here.in,article was captioned no third party beneficiary.id.at.by contrast,here,section is captioned beneficiaries.in short,does not conflict with our conclusion that the provisions of the pma plausibly evinces an intent by the issuer and aladdin to provide a benefit to the noteholders,namely,aladdin management of the reference portfolio on behalf of the investors.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing bayerische contract claim.
duty of care gross neligence.we turn then to bayerische second,alternative,claim that aladdin breached a duty of care,in tort,to the noteholders,by engaging in acts that amounted to gross negligence in its management of the reference portfolio.under new york law,a breach of contract will not give rise to a tort claim unless a legal duty independent of the contract itself has been violated.see,clark fitzpatrick long island.such a legal duty must spring from circumstances extraneous to,and not constituting elements of,the contract,although it may be connected with and dependent on the contract.id.where an independent tort duty is present,a plaintiff may maintain both tort and contract claims arising out of the same allegedly wrongful conduct.see hargrave.okinursery,cir citing channel master aluminumltd.sales.if,however,the basis of a party claim is a breach of solely contractual obligations,such that the plaintiff is merely seeking to obtain the benefit of the contractual bargain through an action in tort,the claim is precluded as duplicative.see,new york continental ins.
in the present case the district court held that,as alleged in the complaint,bayerische tort claim relies upon the contract to define the duties and,therefore,its theory of negligence arises from duties created by the contract,and that since,where there was an underlying contract that was creating the duties,a plaintiff can not circumvent a bar created by the contract by restating a claim as one for negligence,the tort claim was impermissibly duplicative of the contract claim.we disagree.
drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the complaint,bayerische may be taken plausibly to have alleged the following bayerische was induced to purchase the notes at issue by aladdin representations,inter alia made in marketing materials and at a meeting among representatives of bayerische,aladdin,and goldman sachs that aladdin interests were aligned with investors,that the reference portfolio underlying the cdo would consist of investment grade,high quality reference entities,and that aladdin would manage the reference portfolio of cds in a conservative and defensive manner to avoid credit events and tranche losses.and bayerische was further induced by the statement of aladdin duties and responsibilities as portfolio manager for the cdo set out in the pma,which,inter alia,required aladdin to act in good faith using a degree of skill,care,diligence and attention consistent with the practice and procedures followed by reasonable and prudent institutional managers of national standing for similar investment portfolios.bayerische placed its trust in aladdin to perform its duties as portfolio manager as aladdin had represented that it would and committed to do,and aladdin understood that bayerische had placed its trust in aladdin to perform its duties as portfolio manager as it had committed to do,and that if aladdin failed to do so,bayeriche would be injured.and bayerische,having thus reasonably relied on aladdin representations of contractual performance,lost its entire investment due to aladdin alleged gross negligence in managing the reference portfolio.
these allegations are sufficient to withstand a.b motion to dismiss.under new york law,we think that,in light of bayerische allegations that it detrimentally relied on aladdin representations of how it would select the reference portfolio and manage the portfolio for the life of the cdo,bayerische has sufficiently established that a legal duty independent of contractual obligations may be imposed by law as an incident to the parties relationship in this case.sommer fed.signal.this legal duty,though assessed largely on the standard of care and the other obligations set forth in the contract,would arise out of the independent characteristics of the relationship between bayerische and aladdin,and the circumstances under which bayerische purchased the notes linked to the reference portfolio that aladdin,under the pma,was to manage.as such,this duty,though certainly connected with and dependent upon the contract,would nonetheless sufficiently spring from circumstances extraneous to,and not constituting elements of,the contract,clark fitzpatrick,at,to render it.
this conclusion is not the end of our inquiry,however.under new york law,in the absence of privity,the scope of the orbit of duty to third parties must be carefully examined to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree and protect against crushing exposure to liability.strauss belle realty,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we consider,in particular,the requirements for recognizing liability of professionals to third parties that new york courts have developed in the analogous context of negligent misrepresentation claims.
to meet these requirements,as set out in credit alliance arthur anderson,and ultimately derived from glanzer shepard,cardozo,c,and ultramares touche,cardozo,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant had awareness that its work was to be used for a particular purpose there was reliance by a third party known to the defendant in furtherance of that purpose and there existed some conduct by the defendant linking it to that known third party evincing the defendant understanding of the third party reliance.credit alliance,at the new york court of appeals has described this burden as requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate a relationship between plaintiff and defendant that is so close as to approach that of privity,if not completely one with it.id.at emphasis omitted quoting ultramares,at.put another way,plaintiff must show that the benefit to the was the end and aim of the transaction.id.at emphasis omitted quoting glanzer,at.in short,a plaintiff that can satisfy these requirements will,we think,also be within the limits established under new york law for tort claims sounding in negligence that are brought by third parties.
here,bayersiche has plausibly alleged facts sufficient to meet the test of credit alliance and its precursors.as discussed above,the amended complaint alleges,in effect,that aladdin was aware that its work as portfolio manager would be relied on by bayerische,a to the contract.before bayerische invested in the cdo,aladdin met with bayersiche at its offices in new york to explain the many ways that aladdin,as portfolio manager,would competently and effectively protect bayerische interests as investors in the aladdin cdo.bayerische alleges that it relied on these representations,and the pma,in protecting its interests.in such reliance,bayerische committed to a million investment,or of the total value of the cdo.the amended complaint thus plausibly alleges facts evincing aladdin understanding that noteholders would rely on aladdin care and competence in managing the reference portfolio.
aladdin maintains,however,that bayerische fails to satisfy the criteria set out by judge cardozo in the seminal case of ultramares touche.we are not persuaded.in ultramares,the defendants were accountants who had prepared and certified a balance sheet for a business.id.at.the business borrowed money to finance its purchases of rubber from the plaintiff,who requested a certified balance sheet before it would provide the loan.id.at.after the business went bankrupt,the plaintiff sued the accountants for negligently certifying the balance sheet.id.at.chief judge cardozo concluded that the accountants could not be held to have a duty to anyone who relied on the company balance sheet,as the the indeterminate class of persons who,presently or in the future,might deal with the company in reliance on the audit did not have a relationship with the accountants that approached privity.id.at.this was because the service was primarily for the benefit of the rubber company,a convenient instrumentality for use in the development of the business,and only incidentally or collaterally for the use of those to whom the company might exhibit it.id.
by contrast,chief judge cardozo noted,in glanzer shepard in which he had previously established a basis for finding a duty in tort to a,the service rendered by the defendant was primarily for the information of a third person,in effect,if not in name,a party to the contract,and only incidentally for that of the formal promisee.id.citing glanzer.likewise,in this case there was allegedly no service being provided to the formal promissee the issuer,which was merely a shell entity.to the contrary,aladdin is alleged to have been aware that its management of the reference portfolio would run specifically to the benefit of bayerische,which aladdin solicited to invest in the cdo.the end and aim of the pma was to install aladdin as the manager of the reference portfolio,on behalf of the noteholders,and as relevant here,to bayerische in particular.
we acknowledge that this is not quite as close as the relationship in glanzer.bayerische had already purchased the notes,and was free to sell its notes on the secondary market subject to specific transfer restrictions,and the offering circular indicated that goldman would make efforts to list the cdo on the irish stock exchange,further increasing the liquidity of the notes such that they could be resold to investors beyond those aladdin specifically solicited,such as bayersiche even so,it is clear that bayerische has properly alleged that aladdin was aware that the pma had the particular purpose of installing aladdin as the portfolio manager to manage the reference portfolio on behalf of the noteholders bayerische was known to aladdin and relied on aladdin to perform its obligations pursuant to the pma and aladdin conduct in soliciting bayerische investment and its representation that it would manage the cdo in bayerische favor evinced an understanding by aladdin that bayerische would rely on its performance.thus,bayerische has properly alleged a relationship between aladdin and the noteholders sufficiently close that recognizing a duty running from aladdin to bayerische would not offend the limitations imposed by new york law on tort liability to third parties.
finally,aladdin argues that,even if such a relationship exists,the noteholders have failed to allege facts that plausibly show aladdin conduct amounted to gross negligence.again,we disagree.
on a motion to dismiss,a claim for gross negligence will be sustained only if the plaintiff alleges facts plausibly suggesting that the defendant conduct evinces a reckless disregard for the rights of others or smacks of intentional wrongdoing.m j savitt,savitt,civ.dlc,wl,at,quoting at t city of newyork,cir.recklessness in the context of a gross negligence claim means an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,such that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.amw materials testing,town of babylon,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
it is true that many of bayerische allegations in the amended complaint,standing alone,fail to meet this high bar.the allegations about how aladdin added specific reference entities to the reference portfolio that were recklessly exposed to the housing market and that experienced credit events appear to be pleading gross negligence by hindsight.novak,cir w e have refused to allow plaintiffs to proceed with allegations of fraud by hindsight.corporate officials need not be clairvoyant internal citation and quotation marks omitted mosher simons county of allegany,cv,wl,at,aff,cir holding plaintiff can not plead gross negligence through hindsight.nor do such allegations suggest that defendant engaged in an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.even accepting that aladdin trading caused bayerische notes to default,bayerische does not allege what,at the time,aladdin did in selecting these reference entities that was an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,rather than simply a bad bet.aladdin had discretionary authority to manage the reference portfolio in accordance with the trading restrictions.an investment particularly the kind of complex derivative instrument in which bayerische,a sophisticated financial institution,invested is not a guarantee of a return.simply adding the conclusory word reckless to aladdin trading does not transform an investment decision into something approaching intentional misconduct.
some of bayerische more specific allegations,however,are sufficient to allege gross negligence by aladdin.the most egregious allegation that appears to smack of intentional wrongdoing is that the defendant added reference entities to the reference portfolio at spreads that were substantially below the market spreads.bayerische alleges that,over four days in november,defendant added reference entities at average spreads of between and basis points,when the objective,spread for that time period was approximately basis points.additionally,bayerische alleges that defendant failed to adjust the subordination levels to reflect the risk the market had priced greater than basis points,and instead used the spreads to adjust subordination.in essence,bayerische alleges that b ecause defendant accepted spreads that were well below market spreads,the reference portfolio acquired greater risk and received less protection through subordination than it should have had.
defendant conduct in these regards may plausibly be said to have been an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care,most obviously because there is no apparent reason why defendant would want to take this risk,especially since bayerische alleges that the cdo was created with trading restrictions that were supposed to prevent defendant from adding reference entities to the reference portfolio with spreads of greater basis points.accepting spreads with a subordination adjustment appears to have allowed defendant to bypass the trading restrictions designed to protect bayerische and keep the reference portfolio oriented on reference entities.
furthermore,accepting spreads on risky entities appears to have been contrary to how defendant explicitly represented it would manage the portfolio on behalf of the noteholders.the stated objective of aladdin role as portfolio manager,according to the pma,was to minimize the occurrence of any losses to the noteholders.pma i.further,in the marketing presentation goldman and aladdin pitched to bayerische in new york,aladdin represented that,although its typical trading for the portfolio is defensive aladdin can also take a view on a credit by taking out a tight spread name and replacing it with a wider name where aladdin believes that the new credit is trading wider than is reflected by the fundamental credit risk.these trades will result in an increase in subordination.see decl.of jason mogel in opp to mot.to dismiss,cv,doc,ex.c,at june.in effect,the representation was that where aladdin believed the market spread for a given entity was too high,it could substitute that entity into the reference portfolio,thus increasing bayerische protection from default by increasing subordination at the market spread,without a proportional increase in riskiness given the difference between the market spread and what aladdin thought the proper spread should be.but,according to bayerische allegations,here,aladdin did the exact opposite.by substituting reference entities at a spread below the market spread,aladdin increased what the market would have perceived as the riskiness of the reference portfolio without a proportional increase in protection to the noteholders through subordination.even if aladdin had thought these entities were not as risky as the market spread suggested,adding them to the reference portfolio did not give bayerische any corresponding benefit through increased subordination.by adding these entities to the reference portfolio at a below market spread,aladdin in effect transferred the benefits of any bet on the market overpricing the riskiness of the reference entities from the noteholders to gscm,the swap counterparty.
the pma outlines the specific trading procedures for swapping reference entities.first,aladdin was to propose adding a new reference entity to the portfolio.gscm,the swap counterparty,would provide in good faith what it thought was the appropriate and commercially reasonable spread for the reference entity.aladdin could either accept gscm spread or seek a market quotation spread from a neutral reference dealer,which would be binding on goldman.once the trade was completed,gscm would make the appropriate adjustments to the noteholders subordination levels that reflected the change in the riskiness of the reference portfolio,but aladdin had the responsibility to challenge gscm on behalf of noteholders when gscm acted improperly.throughout this pricing and subordination adjustment procedure,it was aladdin role to protect the noteholders interests their adverse counterparty,gscm.further,given that bayerische alleges that the market based spreads were in fact above the basis point trading restriction,it is reasonable to infer these were particularly risky trades in the context of the overall cdo that would demand some level of heightened scrutiny on the part of aladdin.
admittedly,bayersiche does not allege with particularity what the source of an objective spread would be.bayerische also does not allege whether aladdin ever challenged gscm pricing on
