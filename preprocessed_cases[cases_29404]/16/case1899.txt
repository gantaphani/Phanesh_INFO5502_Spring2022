the question in this case is who decides who decides.the district court granted appellee international association of machinists and aerospace workers,local lodge motion for summary judgment,in which the union sought to compel the arbitration of the question of whether grievances against appellant ak steel corporation were substantively arbitrable under their agreement.the company argues that the district court erred because the parties did not clearly and unmistakably state their intent to submit to an arbitrator the question of the substantive arbitrability of the grievances.
the company and the union entered into a return to work agreement transition agreement that did not provide for arbitration of grievances except for certain claims arising during the transition period,to be followed by a collective bargaining agreement agreement with a more expansive grievance and arbitration procedure.the transition agreement governs grievances which arise during the transition period and are based on violations of the transition agreement.the transition agreement did not include a clear and unmistakable provision that the substantive arbitrability of the union grievances would be determined by an arbitrator.instead,the transition agreement explicitly exempted the transition agreement from the agreement grievance and arbitration procedures,which does clearly state than an arbitrator would determine the question of substantive arbitrability of claims arising under that agreement.thus,the issue of substantive arbitrability of grievances arising under the transition agreement,as well as the antecedent question of whether a grievance arises under the transition agreement,must be determined by a court.
we therefore reverse the district court order and remand the case to agreement and to determine the substantive arbitrability of those grievances governed by the transition agreement.
the company operates a facility in middletown,ohio,known as the middletown works.the union represents a bargaining unit consisting of production and maintenance workers at the middletown works.this unit was previously represented by the armco employees independent federation.the company and armco were parties to a collective bargaining agreement,the agreement,which was effective from november,until february.the agreement provided that,to determine issues of procedural and substantive arbitrability,

article vii,section f the company and armco negotiated for a successor agreement,but were unable to do so prior to the expiration of the agreement in.
upon the expiration of the agreement,the company commenced a lockout that lasted approximately one year,during which armco affiliated with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers,which became the new representative for the bargaining unit.the company continued negotiations with the union during the lockout and the parties reached a tentative decision upon a new agreement on february.the agreement was ratified and became effective on march.the agreement contained language relating to grievance procedures and substantive arbitrability of issues that was virtually identical to that included in article vii,sections b and f as reproduced above.
as part of the new agreement,however,the parties also negotiated and entered into the transition agreement,which was intended to provide for the orderly transfer of work upon the return of employees to work and of production after the lockout.the parties tentatively agreed to the transition agreement on february and it was ratified on march,along with the agreement.the transition agreement established a transition period,from march through september,during which the transition agreement would govern.under section k of the transition agreement,the terms and conditions of this agreement take precedence over the labor agreement during the transition period.for example,the forty hour work opportunity of the employment security plan is not applicable during the transition period.section l of the transition agreement provided that 
all matters covered by this agreement the transition agreement or other matters that occur during the transition period shall not be subject to challenge under the grievance and arbitration procedure,or otherwise,except for the following specifically identified issues 
these narrow types of issues included whether an employee discharged from employment for failure of alcohol and substance abuse testing or for work stoppage misconduct had tested positive or committed an act of work stoppage whether the disciplinary suspension or disciplinary discharge of an employee following return to work was with just cause and due consideration whether the employee was paid the correct standard hourly wage and whether the employee was properly determined ineligible for healthcare coverage.the transition agreement did not contain its own grievance and arbitration procedure.
the union filed separate against the company that the company argues pertain to events arising during the transition period or under the transition agreement and are,thus,governed by the transition agreement and is arbitration provisions.the company denied each grievance and refused to submit the disputes to arbitration,arguing that none of the disputes was substantively arbitrable because it either arose under the terms of the transition agreement or occurred during the transition period.for each grievance,the company issued a step ii grievance answer asserting that the grievance was not arbitrable and that it would not process the grievance further unless its position should be determined erroneous by a final,order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
the union then filed this action in district court pursuant to section of the labor management relations act,seeking an order to compel the company to arbitrate the substantive arbitrability of the grievances,as well as an award of attorney fees for the company alleged bad faith refusal to submit these grievances to arbitration.the union argued that the transition agreement was a part of the agreement,which included a clear and unmistakable provision that an arbitrator,and not a court,will determine both substantive and procedural questions of arbitrability 
the company responded by arguing that the transition agreement explicitly takes precedence over the agreement during the transition period and clearly and unmistakably states that matters covered by the transition agreement or other matters occurring during the transition period shall not be subject to challenge under the agreement grievance and arbitration procedure.the company argued that,because each of the grievances arose during the transition period or under the transition agreement,the issue of their substantive arbitrability must be determined by a court rather than by an arbitrator because the transition agreement is silent on that issue.
the district court granted summary judgment to the union,ordering the parties to submit the question of the substantive arbitrability of the grievances to an arbitrator.the district court denied the union request for attorney fees,finding that the company had not acted in bad faith.the company timely appealed.
