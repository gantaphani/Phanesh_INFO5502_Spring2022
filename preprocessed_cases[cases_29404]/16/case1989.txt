the collective bargaining agreement contains a process for resolving grievances.the union grievances proceeded without complication through steps one,two and three.on march,the company issued a written denial of both grievances,which the union received on april.the agreement gave the union days,excluding weekends and holidays,to appeal the company decision to step.if the union failed to appeal within the time limit,the agreement provided that the union forfeited its right to arbitrate the grievance.the union appealed the denials by letter dated may,and the company received the appeals on may.the company informed the union that the appeals could not proceed to arbitration step because it had received them after the deadline.

when an employer and a union agree to submit grievances arising from a collective bargaining agreement to arbitration,the limited function of the federal courts is to ascertain whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.united steelworkers am,d.whether a collective bargaining agreement commits a dispute to arbitration,the supreme court has held,is a question of arbitrability for the courts to decide.see howsam dean witter reynolds,d john wiley sons,livingston,d.whether the parties have complied with the procedural requirements for arbitrating the case,by contrast,is generally a question for the arbitrator to decide.howsam,at.john wiley sons,at.if doubt exists over whether a dispute falls on one side or the other of this line,the presumption in favor of arbitrability makes the question one for the arbitrator.at t,commc ns workers,d see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d recognizing a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.
two supreme court cases illustrate this dichotomy and show how it should be applied to debates about the application of a provision.the threshold question in john wiley sons,as in today case,was who shall decide a series of disputes arising under a collective bargaining arbitrator or a judge at.the first dispute dealt with whether a collective bargaining agreement applied to a company wiley that had not signed the agreement but had merged with a company that had signed it.because this dispute asked whether wiley was bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbitrate,the court determined that it was one for judicial determination.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the duty to arbitrate being of contractual origin,the court reasoned,a compulsory submission to arbitration can not precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty.id.
the court reached a different conclusion about two other disputes presented in the case whether the union had satisfied steps and of the agreement grievance procedure,which preceded the company duty to arbitrate in step,and whether the union had complied with a bar.id.at.notice of any grievance,the time rule said,must be filed with the employer and with the union shop steward within four weeks after its occurrence or latest existence.the failure by either party to file the grievance within this time limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an abandonment of the grievance.id.quoting the rule.once it is determined that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration,as it had been in that case,the court reasoned that procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition such as questions about the application of a bar should be left to the arbitrator.id.at.a different interpretation,the court feared,would produce delay attendant upon judicial proceedings preliminary to arbitration,and,what is more,the r eservation of procedural issues for the courts would not only create the difficult task of separating related issues,but would also produce frequent duplication of effort.id.at.in the end,the court explained,it best accords with the usual purposes of an arbitration clause and with the policy behind federal labor law to regard procedural disagreements not as separate disputes but as aspects of the dispute which called the grievance procedures into play.id.at.the court accordingly ordered the company to comply with its duty to arbitrate,leaving it to the arbitrator to decide whether the and requirements had been satisfied.
nearly years later,the court addressed a similar issue and followed a similar path.the question at hand in howsam was whether a judge or an arbitrator should apply a rule of the national association of securities dealers nasd.no dispute,the rule said,shall be eligible for submission to arbitration where six years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute.at.quoting nasd code of arbitration procedure.the company opposed arbitration on the ground that application of the rule presented a threshold question of arbitrability for a court to decide because a dispute that was more than six years old was ineligible for arbitration.id.at.
linguistically speaking,the court began,one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a question of arbitrability,for its answer will determine whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits.id.at.but the court case law makes clear that the phrase question of arbitrability has a far more limited scope.id.it instead refers to the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so,and where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.id.at.
giving content to this distinction,the court gave two examples of threshold questions of arbitrability that courts should decide whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.t he phrase question of arbitrability,by contrast,is not applicable in other kinds of general circumstance where parties would likely expect that an arbitrator would decide the gateway matter,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition,id.quoting john wiley sons,at,and which are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide,id.this latter category,the court noted,included debates relating to whether the prerequisite steps of a grievance procedure have been followed,id.citing john wiley sons,at,relating to waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability,id.quoting moses cone memorial,at,and relating more generally to whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled,id.at.quoting the revised uniform arbitration act of ruaa c cmt,supp see also id.i n the absence of an agreement to the contrary,issues of substantive arbitrability are for a court to decide and issues of procedural arbitrability,whether prerequisites such as time limits,notice,laches,estoppel,and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate have been met,are for the arbitrators to decide.quoting ruaa,cmt,at emphasis added by howsam int l union of operating eng rs,local flair builders,d concluding that whether particular grievances are barred by laches is an arbitrable question.
consistent with this reasoning,the court held that the applicability of the nasd time limit rule is a matter presumptively for the arbitrator,not for the judge.howsam,at.and because nothing in the arbitration agreement or the nasd rules rebutted that presumption,the court held that the application of the rule was for the arbitrator to decide.
what emerges from john wiley sons and howsam is a fairly straightforward rule a provision involves a matter of procedure it is a condition precedent to arbitration,id.internal quotation marks omitted and it thus is presumptively a matter for an arbitrator to decide,id.in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,in the absence in other words of language in the agreement rebutting the presumption,arbitrators rather than judges should resolve disputes over provisions.
under this rule,the bar in this collective bargaining agreement should be resolved by the arbitrator.here is what the provision says 
both parties mutually agree that grievances to be considered must be filed promptly as set forth above after the occurrence thereof.grievances not appealed within the time limits set forth in steps,or shall be considered settled on the basis of the decision last made and shall not be eligible for further discussion or appeal.grievances not answered by the company within the time limits specified in any step of this procedure shall be allowed without precedent.
ja emphasis added.the highlighted language plainly amounts to a bar,and there is no statement to the contrary in the arbitration agreement,howsam,at,that rebuts the presumption that disputes over the meaning of these types of condition s precedent to arbitrability should be resolved by the arbitrator,id.internal quotation marks omitted.
that a party failure to satisfy the requirement means that the grievance shall not be eligible for further discussion or appeal,ja emphasis added,does not alter this conclusion.the same could have been said in john wiley sons and in howsam.in john wiley sons,the language was to the same effect,as it said that failure to satisfy the time limitation shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the grievance.at.in howsam,the language was not only to the same effect but indeed used the same root word,as it said that failure to satisfy the time limitation made the dispute in eligible for submission to arbitration.at.
far from rebutting the presumption that this provision should be decided by an arbitrator,other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement support it.the introductory sentence to all of the provisions in article of the collective bargaining agreement,including the provision,says should disagreements arise as to the meaning and application of or compliance with the provisions of this agreement,there shall be no cessation of work at any time but the matter shall be settled promptly in the following manner ja.this language is quite consistent with the underlying assumption of john wiley sons and howsam that parties to collective bargaining agreements would anticipate that disputes over conditions precedent to arbitration,like disputes over the merits of a grievance,would be resolved by the arbitrator.instead of rebutting the presumption that an arbitrator should decide the meaning of a provision,in short,this language in the collective bargaining agreement strengthens it.
what gave the district court and the original panel pause about this case was not the meaning of the supreme court decisions in this area,and it was not the language of the collective bargaining agreement.it was the existence of our decision in moog and the question whether it could with john wiley sons and howsam.since moog,the supreme court has decided howsam,which reinforces the presumption that questions about the meaning of a bar are for arbitrators to decide.and since moog,two panels of this court,one of them the panel that heard this case,have expressly concluded that moog was wrongly decided,see raceway park,local,serv.employees int l union,cir moog represents a grave departure from supreme court doctrine mandating that issues of procedural arbitrability be determined by arbitrators not judges.united steelworkers saint gobain ceramics plastics,cir w e would prefer to take a path not open to or overrule moog,while another panel has expressed doubt about moog validity,see armco employees indep.fed ak steel,cir observing that raceway park offers a thoughtful critique of moog and noting that,regardless of what we may think of the moog exception to wiley,this panel can not overturn a published decision of a previous panel.
a brief description of moog shows why the criticism of these two prior panels and the skepticism of the third panel are on the mark.after the employer discharged one of its workers,it refused the union demand to submit the matter to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement because the union had not filed the arbitration request within the period provided in the agreement.i f,the rule said,the union fails to notify the company within calendar days after the company gives its answer in writing to a grievance at step b of the grievance procedure,then the union shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the company answer thereto and said grievance shall not thereafter be arbitrable.at emphasis added.because this contractual language in the court eyes clearly indicate d that the particular grievance in dispute was excluded from arbitration,the court held that it had the duty first to decide whether the union met the conditions precedent to arbitration that the application of this timeliness provision in other words presented a question of arbitrability for the court to decide.id.at.
there is no difference,however,between the clarity of the consequences of failing to file the grievance on time in moog on the one hand and john wiley sons and howsam on the other.all three provisions came to the same clear end in moog,the grievance shall not thereafter be arbitrable,id.at in the other two cases,the dispute shall not be eligible for submission to arbitration,howsam,at,and shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the grievance,john wiley sons,at.there thus is no basis for saying that the language at issue in moog somehow rebuts the presumption that the matter should be resolved by an arbitrator while the language at issue in these other cases does not.
also unavailing is saint gobain related attempt to distinguish article from the clauses at issue in john wiley sons and howsam.article,the company says,supplies a narrow agreement to use a grievance resolution procedure culminating in arbitration if there has been a timely appeal to arbitration,and the grievance has not been otherwise settled,supp l br.at,while the clauses in the other two cases involved broad,agreement s to arbitrate all disputes,id.at.but neither john wiley sons nor howsam draws any such distinction,nor do they limit the presumptive arbitrability of provisions to situations in which the parties agreed to arbitration clauses.and even if they did,it is far from clear why the introductory sentence of article does not satisfy this proposed requirement should disagreements arise as to the meaning and application of or compliance with the provisions of this agreement,there shall be no cessation of work at any time but the matter shall be settled promptly in the following manner,which culminates in arbitration.ja.
the problem with moog is not the existence of some unusual feature of the collective bargaining agreement or of the provision in that case but that moog turned on its head the presumption that disputes should be resolved by an arbitrator.instead of treating a dispute over the meaning of a rule as a condition precedent to arbitrability that is presumptively for the arbitrator,not the judge,to decide,howsam,at.internal quotation marks omitted,moog does the it as a condition precedent to arbitration that the judge must decide,at.whether moog should have appreciated the point after john wiley sons makes no difference the fact remains that howsam,decided fourteen years after moog,leaves no doubt about the presumption and its applicability here.moog is overruled.
there is more common ground between the dissent and our opinion than the dissent suggests.we do not establish a rule that timeliness questions must inexorably go to the arbitrator.as with all arbitration matters,the matter is one of contract just as two parties need not enter an arbitration contract in the first place,they need not enter an arbitration agreement that submits questions of timeliness to arbitration.parties who wish to steer timeliness disputes to the courts remain free to do so,and nothing in this opinion is to the contrary.
the problem here is what happens when the parties are silent on the they set up an arbitration procedure to resolve their grievances,as was true here,but when they do not indicate a preference for judicial or arbitral resolution of a dispute over the meaning of a timeliness provision in the collective bargaining agreement,as was also true here.in that setting,there is nothing unusual about courts establishing default rules or presumptions about the meaning of such silence for the purposes of the case before them and for the purposes of future cases.that is all we have done.
in embracing a presumption that disputes over a timeliness provision are for an arbitrator to decide,we take some comfort from the following that is what john wiley sons and howsam did that is what the supreme court has said we should do,see howsam,at.i n the absence of an agreement to the contrary,issues of substantive arbitrability are for a court to decide and issues of procedural arbitrability,whether prerequisites such as time limits,notice,laches,estoppel,and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate have been met,are for the arbitrators to decide.quoting ruaa,cmt,at emphasis added by howsam that is what makes sense in light of the background general presumption in favor of resolving collective bargaining and other disputes through arbitration,see moses cone mem l,at.noting that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration at t,at.and that is what every other court of appeals in the country has done,see local,serv.employees int l union,nonotuck res,cir rochester.commc workers,cir chauffeurs,teamsters helpers,local union stroehmann,cir local,int l longshoremen ass stevedores ass n,cir smith barney shearson,boone,cir beer sales drivers,local union metro,cir,petroleum allied indus.employees union,local town country ford,cir toyota of berkeley auto.salesmen union,local,cir denhardt trailways,cir aluminum,brick glass workers int l union aaa plumbing pottery,cir.hosp.ctr.serv.employees int l union,local.
nor do the two cases cited by the printing pressmen union international paper,cir,and united steelworkers cherokee electric cooperative,wl,bna,aff,cir say otherwise.in philadelphia printing,the third circuit distinguished between procedural default issues,including delay in filing a grievance,and the total failure to file a grievance at all.at internal quotation marks omitted.disputes arising from the former were for the arbitrator,and disputes arising from the latter were for the courts.id.today case involves a dispute about delay and is therefore for the arbitrator,says philadelphia printing.cherokee electric is no more helpful,for there the union conceded that it did not comply with the collective bargaining agreement timeliness no dispute to submit to arbitration.see cherokee,wl,at.under that court reasoning as well,today dispute would be for the arbitrator.id.at i n order to be entitled to present the issue of the timeliness of a grievance to an arbitrator,the issue must have been legitimately raised by the union so that there is a bona fide procedural timeliness question to be determined by the arbitrator.
for these reasons,we reverse and remand the case to the district court to enter an order referring the grievance to arbitration.
the majority unjustifiably attempts to reduce the dissent to a concern about questions of timeliness,but the legal and factual issues addressed here can not be so narrowly confined.instead of improperly reframing the issues in an attempt to diminish the dissent,the majority should have meaningfully engaged the merits of the arguments presented by this opinion.the majority insists on imposing an obligation to arbitrate disputes even where parties never agreed to submit a particular dispute to arbitration.the general presumption in favor of arbitration can not be interpreted so broadly.in this case,the majority violates the express terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement inasmuch as the parties simply did not contemplate that questions of timeliness would be submitted to an arbitrator.instead of effectuating the parties collective bargaining agreement,the majority blithely ignores the express intent and understanding of the parties,and the plain language of the parties agreement.
the principal difficulty with the majority opinion is that it wrongfully insulates decisions regarding arbitrability from judicial adjudication even when there is no basis for believing that the parties have contractually agreed to submit the subject matter of a particular dispute to arbitration.in addition to being unrestrained and overbroad in its implications,the majority opinion is problematical on two,it improperly determines when a matter should be subject to arbitration,and whether the parties have agreed that there should be a judicial or arbitrable decision to adjudicate the dispute.
background 
the facts of this case are relatively simple.plaintiff united steelworkers of america,is a union which represents employees of defendant saint gobain ceramics plastics.the parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement which sets forth a grievance appeal process.in pertinent part,the collective bargaining agreement contains a period to appeal a grievance decision from step to arbitration 
adjustment of grievances 
should disagreements arise as to the meaning and application of or compliance with the provisions of this agreement the matter shall be settled promptly in the following manner 
it is agreed that the union shall have thirty days from the time of the written step decision to notify the company in writing that it is appealing a grievance to arbitration.
formatting added.the period excludes saturdays,sundays,h olidays and off days including vacations or s hutdown for repairs.article of the collective bargaining agreement limits the authority of the arbitrator 
an arbitrator to whom any grievance shall be submitted shall be authorized only to interpret and apply the provisions of the agreement insofar as shall be necessary to the determining of such grievances,but he shall not have authority to alter in any way the provisions of this agreement.
the parties also conditioned the right to arbitrate a grievance decision on strict compliance with the time limits set forth in the collective bargaining agreement 
adjustment of grievances 
both parties mutually agree that grievances to be considered must be filed promptly as set forth above after the occurrence thereof.grievances not appealed within the time limits set forth in steps,or shall be considered settled on the basis of the decision last made and shall not be eligible for further discussion or appeal.
emphasis added.notably,the collective bargaining agreement contains no provision for the determination of arbitrability.nothing in the collective bargaining agreement indicates that a dispute concerning timeliness should be submitted to arbitration.indeed,the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement indicate that the parties simply did not contemplate submitting such disputes to arbitration rather,the plain language of the collective bargaining agreement shows that the parties contractually agreed that the failure to pursue a timely appeal constitutes a substantive bar to arbitration.

the rationale that underlines the presumption of arbitrability is that arbitrators are well situated to answer question s related to contract interpretation and arbitration procedures,green tree fin.bazzle,d,and in a better position than courts to interpret the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,wright universal.serv,d citing at t,commc ns workers of,d emphasis omitted.nevertheless,the presumption of arbitrability is rebuttable.w here the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.at t,at.quoting warrior,at.alteration in original.w hen courts decide whether a party has agreed that arbitrators should decide arbitrability,c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.first options,at.quoting at t,at.courts are also charged with determining whether the parties intended to have a court,rather than an arbitrator,interpret and apply an arbitration provision.howsam,at.

ii.analysis 
essentially,the issue in this case is whether,under the collective bargaining agreement,the thirty day period to refer a grievance to arbitration begins to run as of the date of receipt of defendant written plaintiff contends,thus,making the grievance timely and therefore the date of its issuance,as defendant argues,thereby rendering the grievance untimely and therefore not arbitrable.the facts in this case are analogous to the facts in moog.the defendant in moog 
discharged a member of the plaintiff union who protested his discharge through the procedurally defined grievance steps up to the final stage of arbitration.defendant refused the demand for arbitration,contending that the request made was untimely and therefore rendered the grievance not arbitrable.the union brought an action to compel defendant to arbitrate.
at.the language of the collective bargaining agreement in moog provided that 
if the union fails to notify the company within calendar days after the company gives its answer to the grievance,then the union shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the company answer thereto and said grievance shall not thereafter be arbitrable.
id.at emphasis added.the collective bargaining agreement in moog stipulated that an untimely grievance was not arbitrable.the plain language of the agreement shows that submitting disputes concerning timeliness to arbitration was simply never contemplated by the parties.
in light of the language contained in the collective bargaining agreement,moog held that a grievance was not properly arbitrable because the union had not submitted its grievance within the time frame dictated in the collective bargaining agreement.armco employees indep.fed ak steel,cir.indeed,moog found that,under the parties collective bargaining agreement,timeliness was a question of substantive arbitrability that should be presented to a court and not an arbitrator.see id.at noting that moog concluded that th e collective bargaining agreement language indicated substantive not procedural arbitrability.emphasis in original.the holding in moog is clearly fact specific the court simply interpreted and applied the language contained in the parties collective bargaining agreement.
under moog,courts are charged with reviewing the collective bargaining agreement to determine whether the time limitations are procedural or substantive provisions based on the language contained therein.moog,at.simply put,the language set forth in the parties agreement is dispositive and must be used to determine whether a particular dispute was intended by the parties to be arbitrable.express contractual provisions,to the extent that they are available,must be consulted to determine whether the failure to follow the procedures outlined in the agreement constitutes a procedural issue that may be presented to an arbitrator or a substantive issue that precludes arbitrability.id.expressly holding that this court examine s,therefore,the agreement that sets out the mutual understanding of the parties.in short,contractual provisions and the parties express intent are the guiding principles in this inquiry.this approach presumably makes sense because parties may negotiate different collective bargaining agreement provisions and may contractually decide whether to treat time limitations as procedural or substantive matters.
in green tree fin.bazzle,a case concern ing contracts between a commercial lender and its customers,each of which contain ed a clause providing for arbitration of all disputes,the parties disputed whether the contracts forbid class arbitration.at.the supreme court held that i n certain limited circumstances it is appropriate for courts to assume that the parties intended courts,not arbitrators,to decide a particular matter in the absence of clea r and unmistakabl e evidence to the contrary.id.at.citing at t,at.the court explained that 
t hese limited instances typically involve matters of a kind that contracting parties would likely have expected a court to decide.howsam dean witter reynolds,d.they include certain gateway matters,such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy.see generally howsam,supra.see also john wiley sons,livingston,d whether an arbitration agreement survives a corporate merger at t,supra,at whether a layoff controversy falls within the scope of an arbitration clause.
id.the court found that 
t he question the contracts forbid class not fall into this narrow exception.it concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties.unlike first options,the question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter.at.rather the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.
id.at.emphasis in original.although the court found that th e matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide,this outcome was clearly based on the arbitration contracts sweeping language concerning the scope of the questions committed to arbitration.id.at.as in moog,the supreme court determined whether the dispute should be presented to an arbitrator or to a court based on the underlying facts and the language contained in the parties agreements.
the majority cites a plethora of cases in support of its position in this case.however,the cases are plainly distinguishable from this matter.see,local,serv.employees int l union,nonotuck res,cir court found that the language in the collective bargaining agreement was almost identical to the arbitration agreement in wiley chauffeurs,teamsters and helpers,local union stroehmann,cir parties selected an arbitrator to fill in the interstices of the written text.the arbitration clause refers,after all,to any difference in opinion regarding the interpretation or application of any provision of this agreement rochester.commc workers of,cir finding that the parties collective bargaining agreement included broad provisions for the arbitration of disputes local,int l longshoremen ass stevedores ass n,cir employer made no effort to factually distinguish the parties collective bargaining agreement from the arbitration agreement in wiley toyota of berkeley auto.salesman union,local,united food and commercial workers union,cir the principal issue was not whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the dispute,but rather whether he could proceed without a party present.denhardt trailways,cir the parties collective bargaining agreement expressly state d that arbitration is the exclusive means for resolving grievances aluminum brick and glass workers int l union aaa plumbing pottery,cir employer made no effort to factually distinguish the parties collective bargaining agreement from the arbitration agreement in wiley washington hosp.ctr.serv.employees int l union local,finding that the employer has not even attempted to distinguish wiley and that wiley is indistinguishable.
notably,cases the majority purportedly relies on clearly support a finding that not all disputes should be submitted to arbitration.see smith barney shearson,boone,cir plainly holding that the district court must determine whether the subject matter of the dispute was subject to arbitration under the parties agreement and interpreting the express language in the parties collective bargaining agreement to determine whether the grievance was arbitrable beer,soft drink,water,fruit juice,carbonic gas,liquor sales drivers,helpers,inside workers,bottlers,warehousemen sch.sightseeing,charter bus drivers,promotional employees of affiliated,local union metro,cir noting that it may be proper for a court to determine whether one party to a collective bargaining agreement has waived its right to arbitration because it has pursued its dispute in administrative or judicial proceedings rather than in arbitration,petroleum and allied indus.employees union,local town and country ford,cir discussing wiley and philadelphia printing and finding that t he essential inquiry when determining the arbitrability of an issue should be the intent of the parties to the contract.
contrary to the majority averments,as illustrated in the cases cited above,the circuit courts of appeals are divided on the question of whether a union may compel a company,or vice versa,to arbitrate a grievance appeal filed after the time period set forth in the collective bargaining agreement.it is clear,however,that at least two courts have found that disputes concerning the interpretation of collective bargaining agreement provision may be properly presented to a court.see,philadelphia printing pressmen union int l paper,cir see also united steelworkers of,cherokee,wl,at,aff,cir.
in philadelphia printing,a case where a union waited for approximately ten months to submit a written grievance challenging the termination of an employee,the parties were not in agreement that the underlying dispute was arbitrable.when the employer denied the grievance,the union sued to compel arbitration.the third circuit found that in order to rule on whether the parties are obligated to submit the matter to arbitration,it must first determine whether or not the company was bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbitrate.philadelphia printing,at quoting atkinson sinclair refining,d.the court noted that a lthough the parties could have provided that any dispute over whether there is an arbitrable dispute would be for the arbitrator,this was not done.id.footnote omitted.the court found that under the parties collective bargaining agreement,the procedure was not a mere procedural formality to be dispensed with unilaterally.id.at.the third circuit held that the failure to proceed with the grievance procedures,as required by the collective bargaining agreement,substantively precluded an order to arbitrate.id.as the court aptly stated 
w hat the union seeks is to skip the entire grievance machinery established by the collective bargaining agreement and to proceed directly to arbitration of a controversy that has not ripened into a grievance.this it may not do.
id.at footnote omitted.contrary to the majority averments,the court simply did not base its decision on the timeliness of the grievance rather,the court found that the parties never agreed to arbitrate the underlying dispute.id.at.
in cherokee,a case where a grievance was not filed within the time frame stipulated in a collective bargaining agreement,the eleventh circuit affirmed the district court finding that a dispute concerning the timeliness of a grievance was not arbitrable.contrary to the majority arguments,timeliness was not the principal issue in cherokee rather,t he issue before th e court wa s whether the parties to the collective bargaining agreement intended to arbitrate all grievances or whether,because of an express exclusion or other forceful evidence,the employer intended to exclude from arbitration those grievances that are untimely filed.cherokee,wl,at.
the parties collective bargaining agreement stipulated that a ny grievance not reported within five working days of first knowledge of the occurrence causing the grievance shall be deemed wiaved sic and.id.at.as in the instant case,t he contract in cherokee clearly state d that if the time limitations are not complied with,the grievance is deemed waived,and a settlement of the grievance in favor of the party to whom the default runs is required.id.at.since the time limitation provision substantively barred the grievance from being referred to arbitration,the collective bargaining agreement expressly exclude d untimely arbitration grievances from arbitration.id.in cherokee,whether the time limitation provision was a substantive bar to arbitrability was determined based on the parties intent and the language contained in the parties contractual agreement.the district court aptly recognized that the question of a collective bargaining agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular undeniably an issue for judicial determination.id.at quoting at t,at.cherokee,like philadelphia printing,supports an affirmance of the district court decision in this case.in the instant case,the parties never agreed to submit the underlying dispute to arbitration,philadelphia printing,at,and the time limitation provision at issue in this case is a substantive bar to arbitrability,cherokee,wl,at.
contrary to the majority contention,moog can be reconciled with wiley.in wiley,a union sued to compel a company to arbitrate pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that provides for arbitration as the final stage of grievance procedures which are stated to be the sole means of obtaining adjustment of any diferences,grievance or dispute between the employer and the union arising out of or relating to this agreement,or its interpretation or application,or enforcement.at.citation omitted emphasis added.the company argued that the union failed to follow the procedural steps set forth in the collective bargaining agreement to commence an arbitration,and that a court should determine whether the failure to adhere to the procedural requirements precluded arbitration.the company urged the supreme court to find that the question whether procedural conditions to arbitration have been met must be decided by the court and not the arbitrator.id.at.based on the express provisions of the parties collective bargaining agreement,the supreme court declined to adopt the company position.rather,the court found that 
labor disputes of the kind involved here can not be broken down so easily into their substantive and procedural aspects.questions concerning the procedural prerequisites to arbitration do not arise in a vacuum they develop in the context of an actual dispute about the rights of the parties to the contract or those covered by it.
id.at.emphasis added.contrary to the majority argument,wiley expressly left open the possibility that,depending on the facts,the intent and understanding of the parties,and the language contained in the collective bargaining agreement,procedural issues and disputes may be properly presented to a court rather than an arbitrator.id.at.w hether or not the company was bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbitrate,is a matter to be determined by the court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties.quoting atkinson sinclair refining,d.indeed,the supreme court bluntly discouraged the compartmentalization of disputes and issues as procedural or substantive.this approach is compatible with moog because a distinction between procedural and substantive issues must be grounded in the facts surrounding the dispute and the language contained in the parties collective bargaining agreement.the outcome in wiley makes sense because the broad language in the parties arbitration agreement made all disputes under the agreement in that case arbitrable.
in howsam,a case concerning whether a court or an arbitrator of the national association of securities dealers nasd should enforce a nasd time limit rule for the submission of arbitration claims,the supreme court found that 
the applicability of the nasd arbitration time limit rule is a matter presumptively for the arbitrator,not for the judge.the time limit rule closely resembles the gateway questions that this court has found not to be questions of arbitrability,moses cone memorial hospital,supra,at,referring to waiver,delay,or a like defense.such a dispute seems an aspec t of the controversy which called the grievance procedures into play.john wiley,supra,at.
at.notably,howsam is distinguishable from this case and moog,in part,because it did not involve a labor arbitration matter and did not concern the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.furthermore,the majority misconstrues the holding in howsam.
admittedly,the supreme court expressly held that the nasd time limit rule is a procedural inquiry that is properly presented to an arbitrator.however,nothing in howsam supports the majority proposition that all time limit of parties intent and the language contained in the parties collective bargaining procedural issues.as in moog,the holding in howsam is fact specific.unlike this case,in howsam the parties expressly agreed to submit all disputes to arbitration 
a ll controversies concerning or arising from any account,any transaction,or the construction,performance or breach of any agreement between us shall be determined by arbitration before any organization or exchange of which dean witter is a member.
id.at.citation omitted alterations in original.since the language in the parties arbitration agreement was extraordinarily broad,the supreme court simply could not conclude that the parties intended to have a court,rather than an arbitrator,interpret and apply the nasd time limit rule.id.at.
the majority is wrongfully attempting to expand howsam to this case.the supreme court guidance with respect to nasd time limit rules simply can not be imposed and grafted onto this case because there are special policy considerations that apply in nasd arbitrations.see,howsam,at.finding that the nasd arbitrators are comparatively more expert about their own time limitation rule,and are comparatively better able to interpret and to apply it.concededly,this court has found that howsam governs the issue of the timeliness of submission of claims for a nasd arbitration.see smith dean witter reynolds,wl cir per curiam unpublished case applying howsam and noting that howsam made it clear that the validity of the defense raised in a nasd arbitration case was a matter for the arbitrator to determine.this court should continue to confine the application of howsam to nasd arbitration cases because nothing in howsam stands for the proposition that the arbitrability of disputes concerning time limitation provisions in collective bargaining agreements is governed by that case.consequently,there is no legal or factual basis for extending and imposing the holding in howsam to the insta
