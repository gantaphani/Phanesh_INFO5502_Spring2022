ii.statement of the case 
beatrice crocker crocker seeks to recover from national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pa national union on the basis of the default judgment that crocker obtained against national union insured,richard morris morris.in may,crocker sued morris and morris former employer,emeritus corporation emeritus,for injuries suffered in when crocker was struck by a swinging pushed negligently by morris acting in the course and scope of his a nursing home,where crocker resided,owned by emeritus morris initially refused service of process but was eventually served in september.crocker claims against emeritus were covered by the commercial general liability insurance policy issued by national union in which emeritus was a named insured.because he was an employee of emeritus acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the underlying accident morris was an additional insured under the terms of the national union policy and was also entitled to defense and indemnity thereunder.national union provided a defense for emeritus but did not provide a defense for morris,apparently because morris failed to forward the suit papers to national union or otherwise inform it of the suit against him and did not request it to provide a defense.morris never answered crocker suit and crocker moved for a default judgment on september.the case was called to trial on october,but morris did not enter an appearance.at the conclusion of all the evidence,the trial court,on crocker motion,severed the claims against morris into a separate suit before submitting the charge to the jury.on october,the jury rendered a verdict against crocker,specifically finding that emeritus,acting through its agents,including morris,was not negligent the conditionally submitted damage question issue was not answered.on november,the trial court granted a default judgment for crocker on the severed claims and entered judgment against morris in the amount of.sometime shortly after november,the trial court entered final judgment on the jury verdict in favor of emeritus.
in april,after both of the judgments had become final,crocker sued national union in state court as a beneficiary of emeritus liability policy that covered morris as an additional insured.national union removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.
it is not disputed that crocker original claims against both emeritus and morris were covered by national union liability insurance policy and that national union knew that morris was a named defendant in the lawsuit.in addition,national union knew or should have known that morris had been served in the lawsuit it is also undisputed that morris was not aware of the terms and conditions of the emeritus policy,did not know that he was an additional insured under the policy,did not forward the suit papers to national union or otherwise inform it that he had been sued,and did not request a defense from either national union or emeritus.finally,it is undisputed that national union did not inform morris that he was an additional insured and did not offer to defend morris against crocker claims.
national union did,however,attempt to contact morris.national union claims investigator sent a certified letter to morris at the address where he lived dated february,prior to crocker lawsuit,expressing the investigator desire to speak with morris about crocker claims.the letter was returned unclaimed.in addition,well prior to the beginning of trial,an associate at the law firm hired by national union to defend emeritus attempted to reach morris by telephone.on one such call,the associate was apparently told by morris,with whom and in whose trailer home morris lived,not to call again.none of the phone messages the associate left for morris were returned.national union admits,however,that none of these attempts to make contact with morris included attempted notification to morris that he was an additional insured or that national union would provide morris with a defense.
jonathan lamendola,lead counsel hired by national union to defend emeritus,was present on october,when morris was deposed by crocker attorney.prior to the deposition,morris spoke in private with crocker attorney but refused to speak in private with lamendola.when morris deposition began,lamendola learned that morris was not comfortable proceeding without a lawyer.lamendola did not inform morris that he was an additional insured or that national union would provide morris with a defense.in his affidavit,lamendola stated i asked william sic morris before the deposition if i could speak to him and he refused on the basis that he was waiting for a call from his attorney.i assumed that william sic morris had an attorney and did not want to talk to me on that basis.
in crocker suit against national union,both parties moved for summary judgment.national union argued that crocker,who stands in morris shoes,can not recover under texas law as national union duty to defend morris was never triggered because morris did not forward the suit papers to national union or otherwise notify it that he had been sued and he did not ask or authorize national union to defend him national union relied on its policy provisions that 
before coverage will apply,you must notify us in writing of any claim or suit against you as soon as possible.you must 
immediately record the specifics of the claim and the date you received it 
send us copies of all demands,suit papers or other legal documents you receive,as soon as possible.
crocker argued that national union was not prejudiced by morris failure to forward the suit papers because national union was aware of the lawsuit against both its named insured,emeritus,and its additional insured,morris,and national union was on notice that morris had been served.thus,according to crocker,because national union breached its duty to defend morris as a matter of law,it is liable to crocker for the full amount of the default judgment.the district court agreed with crocker,finding first that national union failed to meet its burden under texas law to show prejudice in order to assert a policy defense and therefore it had a duty to defend morris,and also that national union breached this duty by failing to notify morris that it would defend the claims against him.the district court granted crocker motion for summary judgment and awarded crocker.national union appeals.
iii.legal issues 
weaver hartford accident indemnity company 
in,the supreme court of texas considered a case involving an additional insured that was apparently ignorant of the policy and did not excuse the additional insured failure to comply with the policy notice of suit provision.see weaver hartford acc.indem.weaver was injured in an accident in september with busch while busch was driving a truck owned by his employer,thomas enterprises thomas.id.at.in march,weaver served busch with process in a suit seeking damages of busch did not file an answer.in september,weaver amended his suit,increasing the damages sought to,adding thomas as a defendant,and alleging that busch was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident.although thomas was served with the amended petition,busch was not.weaver subsequently thomas,obtained a default judgment against busch for,and sued liability that hartford was liable for the default judgment because busch was an additional insured under the hartford policy.answering a special issue,the jury decided that busch was an insured under the hartford policy,and the court rendered judgment for weaver for,which was hartford policy limit.hartford appealed and the court of civil appeals reversed and rendered a judgment.id.the supreme court of texas affirmed the court of civil appeals after noting that busch failed to forward the suit papers and because of busch statement that he was not operating the vehicle with the permission of thomas enterprises,hartford had no reason to believe that busch expected hartford to defend him.id.at.the court stated that the basic purpose of the requirement that the insured forward suit papers to the insurer is to advise the insurer that an insured has been served with process and that the insurer is expected to timely file an answer.id.emphasis added.in affirming the judgment for hartford,the court concluded 
under the facts of this case,hartford would have been gratuitously subjecting itself to liability if it had entered an appearance for busch,who had failed to comply with the policy conditions,who had stated he was not a permissive user,and who had never been served with process,in a suit which sought damages in excess of the policy limits.therefore,we hold that hartford had no duty to voluntarily undertake a defense for busch.id.at.
although the majority opinion in weaver does not explicitly address the additional insured ignorance of his rights and duties under the hartford policy,both dissenting opinions do.t here was no showing that busch had ever seen the insurance policy,or was advised that he should do anything to comply with it.id.greenhill,dissenting.chief justice greenhill dissent was based largely on his observation that t he omnibus insured is really a stranger to the actual provisions of the written insurance policy.id.justice mcgee dissent included the same concern t here is nothing in the record that would have led busch to believe that there was a possibility of him being covered under the policy.id.at mcgee,dissenting.the issue of whether the insurer had a duty to inform the ignorant additional insured was apparently argued in weaver 
at oral argument,hartford took the stance that it was under no duty to inform busch that he might be covered by the policy,although hartford was apparently aware that busch possessed a somewhat minimal education and might not have comprehended the extent of the coverage of an insurance agreement between his employer and the insurer.id.mcgee,dissenting.
the weaver majority did not directly address the dissenters concerns regarding busch apparent ignorance of the policy combined with hartford knowledge of the suit,nor did the majority explicitly address the issue of whether hartford was under a duty to inform busch that he might be covered by the policy.nonetheless,weaver implicitly holds that such ignorance on the part of the additional insured does not excuse failure to comply with the policy provision requiring notice of service of citation and also that an insurer has no duty to cure such ignorance,even when the insurer has prompt and actual knowledge of the accident,notice of the accident from the named insured,and has the suit papers in hand giving the names of all the defendants,well in advance of trial.id.at greenhill,dissenting.
justice mcgee also disagreed with the weaver majority conclusion that the basic purpose of the notice provision is to advise the insurer that an insured has been served with process and that the insurer is expected to timely file an answer.id.at mcgee,dissenting.instead,justice mcgee would have held that the main purpose of the notice provision is to enable the insurer to control the litigation and interpose a defense against any claims on the merits of the case,and that this purpose was satisfied in weaver when the named insured forwarded the suit papers to hartford.id.this particular objection,however,unlike the objection,was met directly by the weaver majority 
different purposes are served by the requirement that the insured immediately forward to the insurer every demand,notice,summons or other process received by him or his representative.it is undoubtedly true,as some cases hold,that one purpose of the provision is to enable the insurer to control the litigation and interpose a defense however,a more basic purpose is to advise the insurer that an insured has been served with process and that the insurer is expected to timely file an answer.id.at citations omitted emphasis added.
emphasizing this more basic purpose of the notice provision,the weaver majority focused on the fact that hartford had no reason to think it was expected to defend busch 
if we applied the implicit holding of weaver to the facts in this case,then morris ignorance of his rights and obligations under the policy would be no excuse for his failure to comply with the notice provisions,national union would have had no duty to inform morris of his rights and obligations as an additional insured,and national union actual and timely notice of the accident and the suit would not have satisfied the purposes of the notice provision because national union did not know it was expected to defend morris however,changes in texas insurance law since the weaver opinion lead us to question whether weaver controls.
b.the prejudice requirement 
the principal change in texas insurance law that may call into question the applicability of weaver to the facts of this case is the requirement,mandated in by the state board of insurance,that an insurer be prejudiced by an insured failure to provide notice before the insurer can avoid liability due to such failure this prejudice requirement was implemented by the board mandating the following endorsement for all general liability policies 
as respects bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage,unless the company is prejudiced by the insured failure to comply with the requirement,any provision of this policy requiring the insured to give notice of action,occurrence or loss,or requiring the insured to forward demands,notices,summons or other legal process,shall not bar liability under this policy.state bd.of,revision of texas standard provision for general liability,order march,quoted in chiles chubb lloyds ins,dist.writ denied.
subsequent supreme court of texas cases discussing prejudice or weaver 
in liberty mutual insurance company cruz,per curiam,the insurer became aware through a newspaper article that its named insured had been involved in an accident.the insurer did not,however,receive notice of the resulting lawsuit against its insured until days after entry of an adverse default judgment.id.at.the court observed that a lthough notice,the condition precedent to the policy,was not given according to the policy,the insurer does not escape liability,unless it was prejudiced because of the lack of notice.id.it went on to hold that the insurer had been prejudiced as a matter of law a n insurer that is not notified of suit against its insured until a default judgment has become final,absent actual knowledge of the suit,is prejudiced as a matter of law.id.at emphasis added.apparently,the finding of prejudice as a matter of law was based on the insurer inability to prevent the default judgment due to the lack of notice.see id.had the insurer known of the suit,it might have chosen to answer for the insured and litigate the merits of the underlying suit.in cruz,the court did not discuss the purpose of the notice provision as it had in weaver,nor did it cite weaver.
in hernandez gulf group lloyds,the court again addressed the issue of prejudice.in hernandez,however,the court was dealing with the insured failure to comply with the exclusionary provision.although the board of insurance mandatory endorsement did not by its terms apply to the provision and the policy in question did not otherwise contain a prejudice requirement,the court held that the exclusion is unenforceable unless the insurer was prejudiced by the settlement made without its consent.id.at.the court held that the stipulated facts in hernandez established,as a matter of law,that the insurer had not been prejudiced by the unconsented settlement.the hernandez court described the prejudice faced by the insurer in the cruz case decided a few months before hernandez the insured failure to comply with the notice provision prejudiced the insurer by denying its opportunity to answer for the insured and litigate the merits of the suit or to appeal any adverse judgment.hernandez,at.
one year later,in harwell state farm mutual automobile insurance company,the court again,as it had in cruz,addressed the prejudice resulting from a failure to comply with the notice of suit provisions of a policy.the case involved a two car collision in which one of the drivers hubbard died and the other leatherman was seriously injured.hubbard had been an additional insured under her mother automobile liability insurance policy issued by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm.almost two years after the accident,leatherman sued hubbard estate.on the same day,leatherman attorney,groce,filed an application with the probate court seeking the appointment of groce legal secretary,harwell,as administrator of hubbard estate.after harwell was appointed temporary administrator of hubbard estate,leatherman served harwell with citation in the lawsuit.harwell,however,at the time of service,had not yet qualified as administrator.groce informed state farm of the suit against hubbard estate by a letter with,inter alia,a copy of the petition enclosed,and advised state farm to answer the suit to prevent a default judgment.groce later called state farm attorney,anderson,to tell him that leatherman would amend the petition when harwell became the estate permanent administrator and harwell.after harwell qualified as administrator of hubbard estate,leatherman filed his first amended petition.harwell waived service and filed a general denial,but she never forwarded any papers pertaining to the leatherman suit against hubbard estate to state farm.when the case went to trial,harwell appeared pro se and offered no defense.judgment was rendered against hubbard estate.however,groce waited to notify state farm,and it did not otherwise become aware,of the judgment,until after the time to appeal or file a motion for a new trial had expired.state farm then sued harwell and leatherman seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not liable for the judgment against hubbard estate.
in the unanimous harwell opinion,the court reiterated its weaver observation that o ne of the purposes of a notice of suit provision in an insurance policy is to notify the insurer that the insured has been served with process and that the insurer is expected to defend the suit.at citing weaver,at.although state farm agent had notice from groce of leatherman claim against the estate,the court observed that notice of a claim is not notice of a suit.at citing cruz,at.in addition,the court stated that state farm notice of leatherman intent to serve harwell when she qualified as administrator was not the same as actual knowledge of service of process i t was harwell duty to notify state farm of the suit against its insured when she received service of process it was not state farm duty to determine when or if harwell was served.at.the court stated,until state farm received notice of the suit,it had no duty to undertake hubbard defense.id the court further observed that state farm would have gratuitously subjected itself to liability if it appeared on the insured behalf before it received notice that harwell was joined in the lawsuit and properly served,or that she had accepted service and appeared in the suit.id.citing weaver,at.
the court then stated,the insured failure to notify the insurer of a suit against her does not relieve the insurer from liability for the underlying judgment unless the lack of notice prejudices the insurer.at.citing cruz,at.the court found that harwell failure to notify state farm of the suit prevented state farm from undertaking a defense and minimizing its insured liability,and it prejudice d the insurer as a matter of law.at.the court also observed in a footnote,however,that this is not a case in which the insurer received actual knowledge of a suit against the insured from a third party,id.at emphasis in original,arguably implying that the insurer actual knowledge of the served suit might result in a different outcome.
knowledge of the suit by the insurer 
texas courts of appeals have reached different conclusions when dealing with cases in which the named insured failed to comply with the policy provision but the insurer nonetheless had actual knowledge of the suit.in allstate insurance company pare,the evidence showed that the named insured notified the insurer of the accident and that the insurer had been sent a copy of the pleadings by the plaintiff attorney,not by the insured,writ ref.the evidence in pare showed that,even though the insurer had actual knowledge of the suit,it let the matter go to default.id.at.the court held this evidence was sufficient to support the jury findings that the named insured failure to give notice of the lawsuit to the insurer did not prejudice the insurer.id.at.in members insurance branscum,on the other hand,a different court of appeals held that the insurer was prejudiced as a matter of law where the named insured failed to comply with the policy provisions and suffered a default judgment,even though the plaintiff attorney told the insurer adjuster that the lawsuit had been filed,no writ.based on this holding,the court reversed the trial court judgment for the insured and rendered judgment for the insurer.the court distinguished pare by noting that there were more communications between the plaintiff attorney and the insurer in pare,and that the plaintiff attorney in pare sent a copy of the petition to the insurer.id.at.the court also emphasized that no duty was created when the plaintiff attorney informed the insurer that suit had been filed,noting instead,
it is the service of citation upon the insured which imposes on the insured the duty to answer to prevent a default judgment.no duty is imposed on an insurer until its insured is served and sends the suit papers to the insurer.this action by the insured triggers the insurer obligation to tender a defense and answer the suit.id.at.
more recently,in ohio casualty group risinger,the named insured never forwarded the suit papers to the insurer but the evidence showed that the insurer had actual knowledge of the filing of the lawsuit against its insured because the plaintiff sent it a complimentary copy of the petition,writ denied.the court relied on pare and cruz to support its statement that proof of the insurer actual knowledge of suit would show that the insurer was not prejudiced by its insured failure to comply with the policy condition precedent.id.at.it also noted that such proof would defeat the insurer affirmative defense of under the policy.id.although this risinger language suggests that the insurer actual knowledge means that it is not prejudiced as a matter of law,the risinger court actually only concluded that the evidence was sufficient to affirm the trial court fact finding of no prejudice and consequent judgment against the insurer.
in struna concord insurance services,the insurer was granted summary judgment on the argument that it was prejudiced as a matter of law by its named insured failure to provide notice of the suit and subsequent default judgment,dist,no pet.the court of appeals reversed and remanded for a factual determination of whether the insurer had been prejudiced because the insurer evidence did not establish prejudice as a matter of law.id.at.specifically,there was uncontroverted evidence of their actual notice.id.as seen by its remand,the struna court did not treat the insurer actual notice as sufficient,as a matter of law,to defeat the insurer claim of prejudice 
although the insurers in both risinger and struna had actual knowledge of the suit,the opinions do not addr
