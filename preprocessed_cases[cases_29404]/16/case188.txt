background 
balser work at river works 
ge,a multinational company that does business in the commonwealth of massachusetts,is composed of several divisions.one of its divisions is general electric aircraft engines,which manufactures jet engines for both commercial and military use and has a manufacturing facility,river works,in lynn,massachusetts.ge hired balser in july to work as a zyglo inspector at the river works facility this position required her to engage in the nondestructive testing of parts to be used in the construction of aircraft engines.in preparation for this position,balser was required to undergo approximately four hundred hours of training,after which she became certified to perform work.
local is a labor union that exclusively represents ge employees at the river works facility.since the start of her employment at river works,balser has,by virtue of her position,been a member of local and subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba between ge and local that governs the basic terms and conditions of employment for all union members employed at river works.the cba consists of three agreements the national agreement between ge and iue cwa,the industrial division of the communications workers of america,afl cio,clc and its affiliated locals,which include local national agreement the local understanding upgrading and job posting agreement and the supplemental agreement layoff and transfer supplement.the third agreement,the layoff and transfer supplement,provides that employees who have been laid off will be transferred to any equally rated or higher rated open classification in the river works plant,exclusive of upgrading,for which they are qualified considering their river works plant employment record.
balser layoff and the search for zyglo 
it is common practice for ge to complete requests for help when it anticipates needing additional employees in a particular field or position,whether due to increased need or in order to replace a retiring or temporarily absent employee.ge also commonly tries to fill such positions in advance of the expected vacancy.
in january,ge predicted a need for two zyglo sorters,a position that also involved the testing of aircraft engine components.zyglo sorter positions generally were highly coveted in ge because employees were paid according to the amount of work completed and not on an hourly basis,creating the potential to earn significantly more money than other positions.for this reason,zyglo sorter openings typically were filled by senior employees eligible for an upgrade however,such positions also could though in practice tended not to be filled by employees transferring from one job to another due to lack of work.
at that time,ge management believed two current zyglo sorters robert murciak murciak and john doherty doherty would be retiring soon it filed two requests for help and on january,and officially posted the positions on february.
on approximately february,balser received a lack of work notice informing her that she was going to be laid off because there was not sufficient work to be divided amongst the zyglo inspectors on february,balser met with ge manager for union relations,richard sampson,to discuss other jobs for which she might be qualified and which might be available to her on account of her layoff,pursuant to the cba layoff and transfer supplement,see supra part sampson informed balser of three jobs for which she might be eligible due to her layoff.one of the offered employments was the recently posted zyglo sorter position sampson explained that the zyglo sorter position was an option for balser,not only because of her recent layoff,but also because of her prior zyglo certification.sampson,understanding the job to be permanent at that time,informed balser as such.
balser expressed an interest in the zyglo sorter position and an interview was arranged with zyglo sorter manager,thomas towey towey.before her interview,sampson prepared an interview referral form stating that balser was applying for request for help and that she would be replacing skip doherty in the zyglo sorter position.sampson informed balser that doherty name on the interview form had no actual significance,it did not affirmatively mean that she would be doherty replacement if she were hired.
on february,balser interviewed for and was offered the zyglo sorter position.balser accepted the position that same day.she was scheduled to start work on february,balser in fact did not start work until february,a pivotal fact that will be addressed subsequently.
c.the ides of february 
the following events transpired between sampson february job opening meeting with balser and her february punch in or start date.
union member to casilli balser is a sorter 
on or around february,union business agent rick casilli casilli received a phone call from a union member expressing frustration that balser either had been offered accepted the recently posted zyglo sorter position.the union member,speaking on behalf of himself and other members,was upset that balser,who at the time only had approximately seven months of service with ge,had been offered a position typically reserved for only the most senior employees.because it is local duty to investigate how ge fills its positions particularly if a hiring might contradict the cba or ge past practice and to process grievances if it determines that a position was not filled according to cba procedures or ge custom,the union decided to investigate ge possible hiring of balser,a lack of work employee,for the zyglo sorter position 
casilli to sampson lack of work gets priority over upgrade 
according to casilli deposition testimony,on receiving the february call from the union member,he i mmediately contacted sampson to investigate the possible hiring of balser.casilli informed sampson as to the disgruntled rumblings from union members.casilli asked sampson how balser,having only worked at the company for less than a year,could have been offered or hired for a position typically reserved for more employees.casilli stated that sampson told him he did not believe balser hire was due to upgrade as was generally the practice for such a position but rather,lack of work.casilli said he told sampson during that conversation that t his could be a big problem because the zyglo sorter positions only had been posted as of february.further,ge generally only posted jobs it intended to fill by upgrade,and it went against company practice to post an opening for a position only to fill it on a lack of work basis.
casilli testified that he informed sampson he would need additional information concerning balser potential hiring as a zyglo sorter,including details about the postings,balser layoff,and the positions themselves,to assess whether balser or another union member had a right to the position.casilli stated he conferred with sampson on wednesday february,thursday february,the following tuesday february,and the following wednesday february regarding the matter 
according to the record,casilli met with sampson in person on february,and engaged in subsequent email correspondence with him that day.during these interactions,casilli informed sampson that local would not support the placement of a employee in the zyglo sorter position.casilli told sampson that he intended to file a grievance on two accounts ge had not placed lack of work employees into high paid jobs,like the zyglo sorter position,in over ten years and it was accepted ge practice for posted piecework positions,like the zyglo sorter job,to be filled by upgrades,and not lack of work employees.casilli additionally advised sampson to fill the zyglo sorter positions by seniority among upgrades and to place balser on a temporary ir for herbert sutherland position.
sampson,in turn,noted that he had advised balser during their initial meeting of union members discontent concerning ge potential filling of a typically position with a employee that if she were hired for the zyglo sorter position,it might be grieved and she might not stay and that despite this,balser expressed an interest in continuing to work until informed otherwise.casilli informed sampson,also on february,that he would be writing the grievance tomorrow if you placed her on a permanent position.if you placed her on a temporary position for sutherland and are placing other recommended employees on sic other two jobs then you do not get the grievance.
murciak to merchant not retiring and too many zyglo sorters 
on february,murciak one of the zyglo sorters whom ge initially believed was on the verge of retiring and for whom it generated the requests for help at issue contacted local executive board member fred merchant merchant.during this phone conversation,murciak complained about ge february posting of the zyglo sorter positions because he feared it would interfere with the distribution of work among himself and the other zyglo sorters.murciak conversation with merchant confirmed that he was not planning on retiring soon,contrary to ge initial belief.merchant promptly informed ge human resources manager,matthew scagnelli scagnelli of this information.based on this information,ge cancelled its request for help.
doherty to ge not retiring and ready to be back in the zyglo sorting game 
doherty,who had been out on sick leave since the end of january due to heart problems,provided ge with a letter from his doctor,dated february,stating that he would be able to return to work with no restrictions as of march,the specific date when doherty informed ge of his anticipated march,return is not clear from the record,although doherty testified at deposition that he believed it was likely around.sampson subsequently informed scagnelli that merchant had said doherty would be returning to work following his medical leave.
scagnelli to sampson reclassified 
sampson testified that two or three days after his february,meeting with balser,sampson received notification from human resource manager scagnelli that the zyglo sorter position had been changed from a permanent to a temporary position because the person balser was intended to replace,doherty,was now scheduled to return from sick leave.sampson additionally testified that scagnelli informed him that he had to tell balser that,on account of reclassification,she could go to a different position versus going to a temporary job.
sampson to balser the times they are a changin 
approximately two or three days following his february meeting with balser,sampson stated he met with balser to inform her that the zyglo sorter position,initially believed to be permanent,had been reclassified as temporary because the person she was intended to replace now was returning from sick leave a different position that was permanent was available to her she still could accept the zyglo sorter position,provided that she understood it was temporary and she also had the right to refuse that job without any penalty,given that it was a temporary position.according to sampson,balser stated that she wished to remain in the temporary zyglo sorter position.although balser acknowledges that she spoke with sampson at least twice prior to her february start date concerning the position,she denies that she was told of the position reclassification before february.
balser was scheduled to start work on february.however,she called in sick that day,fearing other employees and union members reactions,and did not punch in to the zyglo sorter position until february.on february,balser expressed her concerns to sampson.the parties dispute the content of that conversation.
specifically,sampson testified that during that conversation,he again informed balser that ge had reclassified the zyglo sorter position from permanent to temporary.although balser asserts sampson never informed her she was filling a temporary position and that she always believed it was permanent before starting work on february,balser also confusingly testified that on february she spoke with sampson who recommended that she accept the zyglo sorter position as temporary.balser also subsequently submitted a grievance form on april,prepared by a union official,gary poland poland,in which she stated that sampson notified her on february,that the job was no longer permanent and that it was temporary.at deposition,balser did know why she had submitted a grievance with information that she now alleges was incorrect.
construing the facts in balser favor,as we must,we accept that when she started work on february,balser did not have actual knowledge as to ge reclassification of the zyglo sorter position,and that,at the very least,balser and sampson had some form of communication concerning the position on february.
february email illness temporary 
on february,casilli sent an email to a member of the union executive board stating that ge had informed casilli that same day that balsar sic was an illness temporary for doherty being out on disability,but that sutherland and another senior employee would be permanent addition s.thus,as of february at the latest one day prior to balser actual punching in at work as a zyglo sorter ge officially had taken the position that balser position was temporary.
february ge cancels the zyglo sorter positions 
on february,scagnelli sent an email to sampson regarding the zyglo jobs.in the email,scagnelli advised sampson to cancel the two zyglo jobs they were backfills for doherty murciak,the individuals whom ge initially believed were retiring when it posted the positions.scagnelli additionally provided that ge would keep sutherland once he is released from his former position trained,and that ge can let the temp zyglo woman go.the february email reaffirmed ge position that balser position was not viewed as a permanent one by ge.
reporting for duty and aftermath 
balser first reported for work as a zyglo sorter on february.on or about march,doherty returned from medical leave and resumed his zyglo sorter position.because ge had not yet released sutherland from his prior position,balser was able to remain in her position after doherty return.
sutherland first reported for his zyglo sorter position on march.once sutherland punched in for work,there were nine zyglo sorters,including balser,doing the work generally done by seven or eight employees.of the nine zyglo sorters,balser as she herself concedes was the least senior factoring in the time required for sutherland to undergo zyglo training,and considering that balser was the least senior of all the zyglo sorters,ge informed balser that her position as a zyglo sorter would end on or about march.it is undisputed that it was company policy to lay off employees according to their seniority levels.
ge offered balser a position as a stock keeper on or about april.balser first reported to work as a stock keeper on april.ge rates a stock keeper position,r,and a zyglo sorter position,ir.pursuant to the cba layoff and transfer supplement,if an employee transfers as a day worker to an open job with the specific intent of remaining in her department,the employee will be recalled only to previously held high rated classifications in her department.further,under the cba,a ny classification with the name numerical ir or r designation constitutes an equally rated classification.thus,if an employee moves between two equally rated classifications,she will have no recall rights to the previous position.applying these provisions to balser,because both the zyglo sorter position and stock keeper position were equally rated classifications under the cba,she did not have any recall rights to the zyglo sorter position.
e.the grievance 
following her layoff from the zyglo sorter position,balser decided to file a grievance.she turned to union official poland for assistance.poland requested that balser provide him with information confirming that the position from which she had been laid off had been an open,permanent position.balser was unable to provide any hard copy evidence confirming that her position had been permanent.instead,balser discussed her initial meeting with sampson,in which he had stated he believed the position would be permanent provided a copy of the documents she brought to her interview with towey,which had doherty name on them as the individual she was scheduled to replace asked poland to look into a paper that she had misplaced and to look up the job code and match it against the paperwork that sampson gave balser to bring to towey to see that the coding was the same to show it was an open job and asserted that sutherland had been hired for the zyglo sorter position after her,confirming she was entitled to the position.
on april,poland submitted a grievance on behalf of balser.the grievance stated that ge had no right to change balser zyglo sorter position to temporary status for their sic convenience.balser reviewed and approved the grievance before its submission to local,even though balser presently disputes some of the information contained in the grievance specifically,that sampson informed her the zyglo sorter position would no longer be permanent.
the union reviewed balser grievance and investigated her claim.it determined,first,that sutherland was the successful bidder on an upgrade for a zyglo piecework position that was awarded to him in january,before balser was laid off from her prior position second,sutherland was not released earlier to the zyglo piecework position because of departmental needs associated with his prior position and third,the cba permits ge to hold an employee in a previous position up to thirty days.the union informed balser of its findings and requested additional evidence supporting her claim.on receiving no additional evidence,local decided not to proceed to arbitration because it did not have sufficient evidence to support balser claim that the contested position was permanent.the union made this determination on or about may.
seeking zyglo sorter justice 
on august,balser filed a complaint in the district court for the district of massachusetts against ge and local.balser asserted two counts in her complaint.first,she argued that local,her collective bargaining representative,had breached its duty of fair representation owed to her as a union member.second,she contended that ge breached the terms of the cba between ge and local.ge and local filed motions for summary judgment on may.the district court heard arguments on the motions on october,on october,the district court entered an order granting ge and local motions for summary judgment in their entirety because balser could not show that ge reclassification of the zyglo sorter position constituted a violation of the cba by ge.balser,wl,at.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is properly granted where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party while ignoring conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.sutliffe epping sch,cir quoting sullivan city of springfield,cir.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the must tender significant probative evidence brash conjecture,coupled with earnest hope that something concrete will eventually materialize,is insufficient to block summary judgment.dow united of carpenters joiners of,cir quoting first bank cities serv.
here,we are confronted with a hybrid claim pursuant to section of the lmra,that consists of two inextricably interdependent causes of action,balser alleges violations of her rights by both her employer,ge,and her union,local.delcostello int l of teamsters,u,quoting united parcel,mitchell,see also fant new eng.power,cir hybrid claims involve alleged wrongdoing on the part of both the employer and the union with respect to the rights of employees.to prevail,the plaintiff must prove both that the employer broke the cba and that the union breached its duty of fair representation,in order to recover against either entity.chaparro febus int l longshoremen ass n,local,cir fant,at noting that the court must resolve whether the union failed in fairly representing the employee and whether the employer acted in violation of the cba terms emphasis added.
thus,in this case,balser bears the burden of showing that ge reclassification of the zyglo sorter position from permanent to temporary,prior to balser assumption of the position duties,violated the cba and the union actions constituted a breach of its duty of fair representation.delcostello,at the employee may,if he chooses,sue one defendant and not the other but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one,the other,or both.if balser can not firmly plant each cause of action foot on legally and ground,her hybrid claim will topple.see goulet new penn motor,cir laurin v.the providence,cir stating that f ailure to establish either prong is fatal to a plaintiff hybrid claim.
from permanent to temporary did ge reclassification violate the cba 
balser essential argument is that her employer exercise of discretion in reclassifying her position at the allegedly improper and bad faith request of local constituted a violation of her rights under the cba.balser first step is to show that ge reclassification of the zyglo sorter position contravened the cba.see mulvihill top flite golf,cir.for the following reasons,balser claim fails.
it is undisputed that the cba between local and ge governs balser employment at river works.the cba specifically provides in paragraph b of article xxix of the national agreement 
subject only to any limitations stated in this agreement,or any other agreement between the company and the union or a local,the union and the locals recognize that the company retains the exclusive right to manage its business,including but not limited to the right to determine the methods and means by which its operations are to be carried on,to direct the work force,and to conduct its operations in a safe and effective manner.
emphasis added.
thus,under the express terms of the cba,ge has the exclusive right to determine how it will manage all operations of the company,including its direct ion of the work force.stated differently,the cba imposes no restrictions on ge right to assess staffing needs for positions at the river works facility at any time,either before or after an employee has punched in to his or her position.sworn statements of several ge management officials and local officials further affirm the significance and mutual company understanding of this provision of the cba.
specifically,both ge human resources manager scagnelli and ge union relations manager justin warskinskey warskinskey stated that if ge learns before an employee punches in that a position originally posted as permanent might result in increased headcount unsupported by the available work,ge may cancel the position altogether or change the position from permanent to temporary,provided that it does so before an employee selected for the opening punches in.similarly,if ge determines that there is not sufficient work to distribute amongst the staffed employees after an employee punches in,ge has the right to conduct layoffs pursuant to the layoff and transfer supplement of the cba ge manager of union relations sampson testified that,pursuant to the cba,ge has the exclusive right to determine the number of employees in a given position to fill a position after an employee retirement and to change a position from permanent to temporary,even after a position has been posted.
local further affirms ge interpretation of the governing agreement between itself and the union.local business agent casilli stated that ge has the right to determine the number of employees in a position,and that ge does not violate the cba by cancelling positions,whether before by reclassifying or cancelling the position or after by conducting a layoff an employee has punched into the position.
ge and the union,on showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case,celotex catrett,have swung the evidentiary pendulum back towards balser for her to show a genuine issue of material fact pursuant to.balser falters in her burden.
balser does not point to competent evidence or specific facts to counter ge or the union interpretation of the cba.wilson moulison no,cir quoting tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir internal quotation marks omitted.instead,balser invites the court to engage in the dangerous game of considering conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,or rank speculation,a game from which we always abstain.id.specifically,balser asserts the following arguments to deflect the swing of the summary judgment scythe.ahern shinseki,cir quoting mulvihill,at internal quotation mark omitted.
creation of doherty fiction violated cba 
balser asserts ge and local colluded to create the pure fiction that she had been hired as a temporary injury replacement for doherty,and such collusion was in violation of the cba.balser points to no evidence in the record,however,undermining ge assertion that when the company initially posted for the zyglo sorter positions,it did so in the belief that doherty and murciak would be retiring soon.
ge first sent out its requests for help to fill the zyglo sorter positions on january,doherty was not out on sick leave until january.the fact that doherty subsequently was absent due to sickness creating an immediate and actual zyglo sorter vacancy that quickly needed to be filled does not change the evidence unrebutted by balser showing that when ge first recorded the anticipated vacancies,it did so in the understanding that these respective individuals would be retiring soon.in fact,the record reflects that it was accepted practice for ge to file requests for help in advance of an anticipated vacancy to ensure the filling of a position before an employee absence.while the record does not clearly show why ge at first anticipated such individuals retirement,o ur role is not to the business decisions of an employer.rossy roche,cir.the evidence shows that on receiving information from both murciak and doherty that neither had immediate plans to retire,ge promptly reevaluated its needs for zyglo sorters and acted accordingly.
specifically,murciak informed merchant on february,of his intention to remain in the zyglo sorter position.doherty received a doctor note on february,and informed ge by of his intent to return to work as of early march.both of these communications occurred mere days after ge had officially posted the zyglo sorter openings february.sampson testified that two or three days after his february meeting with balser during which he first offered the zyglo sorter position he received notification from human resource manager scagnelli that the zyglo sorter position which had been offered to balser needed to be reclassified from permanent to temporary as the individual for whom she was to serve as a replacement now would be returning to work.
balser unsupported allegations that ge and local conspired to reclassify her position by subsequently creating the fiction of her serving as a temporary illness replacement for doherty are insufficient to counter the record showing of ge objective reassessment of company staffing needs following a change in employee information.indeed,balser points to no testimony,email or letter correspondence,internal memoranda,or other documentation or communication supporting her contention that the union and ge improperly schemed to reclassify rather,the evidence shows that on learning of doherty subsequent and unpredicted absence despite learning of his plans ge reevaluated its staffing needs in the zyglo sorter field.
at most,balser points to the fact that the initial documentation she received on or around february when applying for the position provided that she would be replacing doherty.however,the evidence shows that balser herself conceded at both deposition and in her statement of undisputed facts that sampson expressly informed her that doherty name on her employment documents did not mean that was the person she ultimately would be replacing,and that sampson had given upgrades with other people names on the paperwork before,but that does mean that was who she would be replacing on the job.additionally,balser stated that at the time of her zyglo sorter interview,she was not under the impression that she was replacing anyone specifically thus,given that balser knew before her formal offer and acceptance of the zyglo sorter position that doherty name on the form did not affirmatively establish that he was the individual whom ge explicitly intended for her to replace cuts in favor of ge practice of continually monitoring staffing needs even after job postings and not towards a ge union conspiracy to justify reclassification.
ge exercised discretion to enable the union to deprive balser of the zyglo sorter position 
balser argues that ge exercise of discretion,which she asserts was for the sole and improper purpose of allowing the union to deprive her of the zyglo sorter position,violated her rights under the cba.balser points to no provision in the cba that supports her assertion that ge exercise of discretion in reclassifying the zyglo sorter position on acquiring updated information concerning staffing needs in that department weighing the union view that hiring balser for that position would contradict ge practice cba procedures and considering the union advisement that hiring a lack of work employee for a typically position would create conflict among more employees,constituted a violation of the cba.
balser references the following provisions to support her contention that ge reclassification violated the cba art.iv,section,providing that the union shall not intimidate or coerce an employee art.xxix,section a,providing that ge acknowledges the union obligation to fairly and effectively represent its employees art.xxviii,section,providing that ge will,to the extent practical,give first consideration for job openings and upgrading to present employees with the necessary qualifications and c of the layoff and transfer supplement,providing that a ffected daywork employees will be transferred to any equally rated or higher rated open classification,exclusive of upgrading,for which they are qualified considering their employment record.
none of these provisions expressly or implicitly restricts ge exclusive right to consider workforce requirements and,if necessary,to reclassify a position from temporary to permanent,or vice versa,when information concerning staffing needs has changed.articles iv and xxix specifically address the union obligations to ge employees,and are more applicable to balser second argument concerning the union duty of fair representation the latter articles acknowledge ge right to consider an employee qualifications and overall employment record when transferring or filling a position.although balser tries to bolster her argument that she was eligible for and thus entitled to the zyglo sorter position effectively preventing,as she asserts,ge reclassification of the position by citing to article c of the layoff and transfer supplement,the issue is not whether balser met the position requirements on which we pass no judgment,but simply,whether ge had the right to reassess its staffing needs for the position and subsequently reclassify it before balser first punched in.the cba granting of the exclusive right to manage the work force to ge affirms that it did.
