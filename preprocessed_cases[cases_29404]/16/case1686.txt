factual background and procedural history 
on april,police officers arrested palmer outside his apartment in houston,texas.they then went to the apartment,where rhonda patterson,who identified herself as palmer girlfriend,provided consent to a search.an initial search turned up rocks of crack cocaine above the kitchen sink,rocks on top of the bedroom television,a firearm holster,a caliber glock magazine,rounds of winchester ammunition,rounds of caliber federal ammunition and a safe.the officers obtained palmer consent to search the safe,which they did.it contained an unloaded lorcin caliber pistol and rocks and a quarter cookie of crack cocaine.in total,the apartment contained grams of cocaine base.
on august,following his indictment,palmer and the government entered into a plea agreement.its waiver of appeal clause included the following 
the defendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined.the defendant may appeal only a the sentence imposed above the statutory maximum or b an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines,which had not been requested by the united states as set forth in title b.additionally,the defendant is aware that title,affords the right to contest or collaterally attack a conviction or sentence after the conviction or sentence has become final.the defendant waives the right to contest his conviction or sentence by means of any proceeding.
the defendant,by entering this plea,also waives any right to have facts that the law makes essential to the punishment either charged in the indictment or proven to a jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.the defendant explicitly consents to be sentenced pursuant to the applicable sentencing guidelines.the defendant explicitly acknowledges that his plea to the charged offense s authorizes the court to impose any sentence authorized by the sentencing guidelines,up to and including the statutory maximum under the relevant statute s.
the same day,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,the district court conducted a hearing at which palmer pleaded guilty.the following colloquy took place

the court well,why did you buy the firearm 
the defendant why did i buy it protect myself.
on december,the district court sentenced palmer to consecutive months incarceration,for the controlled substances charge and for the gun charge.palmer timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,palmer argues that the plea agreement and colloquy do not provide a sufficient factual basis to support either of his convictions.the government disputes this,and also claims that palmer appeal waiver bars our consideration of his claims.
appeal waiver 
as a preliminary matter,we must address whether the waiver in palmer plea agreement bars his appeal.our review in this regard is de novo.united states baymon,cir.a defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal provided his or her waiver is knowing and voluntary,and the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand,based on the plain language of the agreement.united states bond,cir dismissing appeal of sentence as barred by waiver in determining whether a waiver applies,we employ normal principles of contract interpretation.united states mckinney,cir.given the significance of the rights they involve,we construe appeal waivers narrowly,and against the government.united states harris,cir citing united states somner,cir.
palmer argues that his waiver does not bar a direct appeal of conviction.he claims that the second and third sentences are limited to appeal of a sentence and the following two to collateral attacks neither,he asserts,apply to a direct appeal of a conviction.the government does not,in truth,respond to this argument.rather,its briefing assumes that the plea agreement constitutes a general waiver of all of palmer appeal rights.after reviewing the agreement itself and the communication between the district court and palmer,we disagree with the government assumption.
the main waiver paragraph of the agreement,quoted above,refers to sentencing appeals and collateral attacks.the first question is whether the language barring a sentencing appeal bars appeal of a conviction.we have rejected reading sentencing appeal waivers that broadly in the past.see united states lopez,slip op.at,wl,at cir.may,the waiver has no effect on his ability to appeal,or seek relief from,his conviction the provision affects only his ability to appeal,or seek relief from,his sentence.the government does not argue why this situation calls for a contrary reading.the two main cases on which it relies to enforce the waiver both involve appeals challenging sentences,not convictions.see united states melancon,cir united states portillo,cir.a defendant waiver of his right to appeal a sentence is just that it does not also constitute a waiver of his right to challenge a conviction.
nor do the fourth and fifth sentences of the first paragraph of the appeal waiver section of the plea agreement bar palmer direct appeal.they refer to a collateral attack on a sentence or conviction.the government does not dispute that this appeal is direct and not a collateral attack.nor does the phrase any proceeding apply to a direct appeal.contextually,the phrase follows a sentence stipulating palmer awareness of his rights.reading the phrase broadly is inconsistent with our distinguishing between direct appeals and proceedings.see,united states johnson,table,wl at cir per curiam.
the second paragraph of the appeal waiver also does not bar this appeal.that paragraph includes two stipulations a waiver of palmer right to have the facts supporting his sentences charged in the indictment,proven to a jury or proven beyond a reasonable doubt and a consent to be sentenced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines.in neither paragraph do we find reference to a waiver of a right to directly appeal a conviction.
there are two lines in the plea hearing colloquy between the district court and palmer potentially suggestive of a general appeal waiver,but they ultimately fail to establish the generality of palmer waiver.following direct questioning regarding his waiver of sentencing appeals and collateral attacks,the court asked palmer have you talked to your attorney about giving up your right to appeal and giving up your right to collaterally attack your sentence or judgment palmer replied yes,sir.the use of the phrase right to appeal could be read broadly to include appeal of a conviction but its parallel placement to mention of the collateral attack suggests it was a reference to the waiver of sentencing appeals,especially given the fact that the phrase followed specific questions about both explicit waivers.given our duty to construe appeal waivers narrowly,we read palmer agreement as having preserved his right to challenge his conviction 
adequacy of factual basis for convictions 
palmer challenges the adequacy of the factual admissions to support his convictions under both sections and.because he raises this argument for first time on appeal,w
