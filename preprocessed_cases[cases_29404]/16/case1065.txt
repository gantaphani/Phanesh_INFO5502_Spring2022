in this case we analyze the reach of the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction under.the supreme court has emphasized the narrowness of this exception,explaining that it encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce,alimony,or child custody decree.ankenbrandt richards,d.because the instant case does not involve the issuance of a divorce,alimony,or child custody decree,we hold that the district court erred by dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we further hold that abstention under either burford sun oil.or younger harris,d would be inappropriate in this case.
background 
appellant jacqueline matusow matusow and appellee lyle rosenbaum lyle married in january and separated in.the superior court of new jersey,chancery division,issued a dual judgment of divorce judgment on june.
the judgment included a property separation agreement agreement.the agreement,in relevant part,directed matusow to sign a deed and provide an appropriate affidavit of title transferring all of her right,title,and interest in and to the former marital premises,which is known as unit,located at the winston towers condominium.the agreement directed lyle to pay matusow per month in child support for the couple two children and by way of equitable distribution.he also assumed sole responsibility for mortgages on the winston tower condominium winston property.in the judgment,the court ordered matusow and lyle to carry out the terms of the agreement.matusow alleges that,in spite of the court order,lyle failed to pay the proceeds for equitable distribution,several child support payments,and defaulted on certain winston property mortgages.she further avers that she failed to sign a deed transferring her interest in the winston property to lyle.
bergen commercial bank,the lender on the winston property,secured by a mortgage,sought foreclosure on the winston property.a judgment was entered on april,but litigation continued for several more years pursuant to a writ of execution,appellee bergen county sheriff the sheriff scheduled and advertised a foreclosure sale of the winston property for october.the sale,however,was postponed numerous times over the next three years.matusow alleges that the sheriff failed to publically advertise the date of any foreclosure sale after the first scheduled date and that,although matusow was listed as an owner on the deed,she never received any notice of sale.on july,bergen commercial bank assigned its interest in the foreclosure judgment to appellee rose rosenbaum rose,lyle mother.appellee arthur linderman linderman represented rose throughout the transaction.on april,rose purchased the property at a foreclosure sale.rose then sold the property to appellee jun chan kim kim on october.appellee title agency,llc subsequently issued a title insurance policy to kim.
in december,matusow assigned of her judgment against lyle to holder,holder.holder subsequently brought suit against lyle,rose,kim,and washington mutual in state court,claiming fraudulent transfer of the property.matusow intervened in july,but then asked the court to dismiss her complaint without prejudice in.on january,the court dismissed her complaint without prejudice as to lyle,rose,and kim,and with prejudice as to washington mutual.on march,holder,kim,and washington mutual stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice,and the court dismissed the action between those parties.the record does not reveal the result of the action between holder,lyle,and rose,but appellees represent that there is no case pending in state court.
in,and continuing throughout the litigation,a separate proceeding was underway in state court.lyle moved the court to reduce his child support payments,and matusow moved for enforcement of the court prior orders directing lyle to pay child support and equitable distribution.the court issued a final order on october,directing lyle to pay sums to holder,as matusow partial assignee,and matusow.
on november,matusow filed a complaint in the district court for the district of new jersey on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.in counts i and ii,matusow,a pennsylvania resident claims that,a new jersey corporation not domiciled in pennsylvania,negligently issued a title insurance policy to kim for the winston property and that violated new jersey statute,which requires a title insurance company to conduct a reasonable examination of the title before issuing a title insurance policy.count iii is a quiet title action against kim,a new jersey resident.in count iv,matusow claims that the sheriff violated new jersey statute,during the sale of the winston property.in count v,matusow contends that linderman,a new jersey resident,fraudulent ly and improper ly represented rose in the foreclosure sale.finally,count vi charges lyle,a new jersey resident rose,a florida resident and linderman with conspiring to defraud matusow and others of lyle creditors.
by order dated april,the district court dismissed all of matusow claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court held that matusow claims were barred by the domestic relations exception to diversity subject matter jurisdiction and,alternatively,declined to exercise jurisdiction under the burford and younger abstention doctrines.matusow timely appeal followed.
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.o ur review of a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is plenary.vanterpool,cir.
ii.the domestic relations exception 
while conceding that the property at the heart of her claims is the same property discussed in the agreement,matusow argues that her claims can not fall within the domestic relations exception because they do not involve the issuance or modification of a divorce decree.she also contends that the domestic relations exception can not apply to her claims against,the sheriff,kim,linderman,and rose because they are not parties to the judgment.
appellees contend that the domestic relations exception applies because matusow seeks a modification of a divorce decree,and because any judgment in her favor would necessarily alter the rights and obligations of matusow and lyle under the judgment and agreement.
we agree with matusow.because matusow does not seek modification of the judgment between her and lyle,the fact that the winston property is both subject to the agreement and related to the present suit does not divest the federal courts of diversity jurisdiction.
the supreme court has long recognized a domestic relations exception to federal diversity jurisdiction.ankenbrandt,at.the exception has its roots in barber barber,how.in barber the court held that the enforcement of an alimony decree was within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,id.at,but also noted that federal courts have no jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony,id.at see also marshall marshall,d discussing the court holding and dicta in barber.the modern rule,as expressed in ankenbrandt,provides that the domestic relations exception encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce,alimony,or child custody decree.at.the court in marshall recently affirmed that only divorce,alimony,and child custody decrees remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds.at.quoting ankenbrandt,at.
the plaintiff in ankenbrandt sued her and her girlfriend in federal court,alleging that the defendants sexually and physically abused her daughters and seeking damages.at.the court concluded that the plaintiff did not seek the issuance of a child custody decree rather,she alleged that the defendants committed torts against her children.id.at.thus,the court held,jurisdiction pursuant to was proper in this case.id.
matusow similarly does not seek the issuance of a divorce decree or alimony.in five of six claims counts and matusow seeks damages,and the remaining count count iii is an action to quiet title.the claims for which matusow seeks damages sound in tort,and,as such,they clearly fall outside of the domestic relations exception.matusow claims that was negligent in conducting a title search and writing a title insurance policy count i.she further contends that violated new jersey s
