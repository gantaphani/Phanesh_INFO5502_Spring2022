section app.
on august,the pharmacy plaintiffs,for themselves and all other similarly situated pharmacies that contracted with advancepcs to dispense and sell brand name and generic prescription drugs for any prescription drug benefit plan s,complaint,and the association plaintiffs filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania captioned bellevue drug,et advancepcs,the complaint alleged that advancepcs used the combined economic power of its plan sponsors to reduce the contractual amount it pays to retail pharmacies below the levels that would prevail in a competitive marketplace.it also alleged that the agreements impose certain limitations on drug refills and charges to plan members.the complaint asserted that the foregoing actions constituted an unlawful conspiracy among advancepcs and its plan sponsors to restrain competition in violation of section of the sherman act,
on september,advancepcs moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing.advancepcs also argued that,even assuming arguendo that plaintiffs had standing,they had not sufficiently alleged either horizontal collusion to state a per se violation of the antitrust laws or sufficient injury to competition to allege a rule of reason violation advancepcs submitted with that motion a binder of exhibits of allegedly judicially noticeable materials.the materials included three lengthy studies of the efficiency enhancing effects of pbms,as well as advancepcs own form and other materials.
in an opinion dated march,judge robreno denied advancepcs motion,finding that the plaintiffs suffered antitrust injury and had antitrust standing.the district court further held that the allegations of horizontal collusion were sufficient to allege both a per se violation and to state a claim for restraint of trade under the rule of reason based upon alleged price suppression 
on march,advancepcs filed an answer to the complaint and moved to reconsider the march,order or to certify it for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b on april,the pharmacy plaintiffs and the association plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion.on may,judge robreno denied advancepcs motion.
on may,advancepcs submitted a revised corporate disclosure form to reflect the fact that it had been acquired in march by caremark.see,supra.
on june,some ten months after the plaintiffs complaint was filed but before any discovery began,advancepcs filed a motion to compel arbitration in which it asked the district court to enforce the arbitration clause in the pharmacy provider agreements and enter an order compelling arbitration of all of the plaintiffs claims.in the alternative,advancepcs asked for an order compelling arbitration of the claims of the pharmacy plaintiffs and staying the claims of the association plaintiffs pending the completion of arbitration.
plaintiffs based their opposition to the motion to compel on two distinct grounds.first,they contended that advancepcs waived any right to arbitrate by actively litigating the plaintiffs claims for ten months.second,they contended that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it precluded them from pursuing statutory antitrust remedies.the plaintiffs also claimed that they would not be able to afford arbitration,particularly in light of the provision in the agreements that costs and attorneys fees are to be paid by the party who loses the arbitration.
in a memorandum order entered august,judge robreno granted advancepcs motion to compel arbitration and stayed the district court action.he found that the pharmacy plaintiffs had entered into enforceable arbitration agreements that encompassed any antitrust claims,and that advancepcs had not waived its right to seek arbitration.
on september,the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider or,in the alternative,for certification of an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.plaintiffs urged the district court to reconsider its decision on the enforceability of the arbitration agreement alternatively,they requested that the district court dismiss the case so that they could file an appeal.on june,judge robreno denied reconsideration and certification and ordered that the case remain stayed in accordance with the federal arbitration act faa.
however,the plaintiffs did not thereafter initiate arbitration proceedings.advancepcs contends that on april,the plaintiffs filed a motion before the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl panel for transfer of this and certain other cases under for coordinated pretrial proceedings.the plaintiffs dispute this claim and insist that they did not file the motion before the mdl panel.they contend that the plaintiffs in the brady action,see,supra,filed that motion.
in any event,on may,the plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and dismiss the complaint so that they could pursue an appeal of the district court august,and june,orders.in that motion to dismiss,the plaintiffs represented that they did not intend to arbitrate their claims but desired to obtain appellate review of the orders compelling arbitration.
as we noted at the outset,this case was transferred to judge fullam by the mdl panel.that transfer occurred on august,before judge robreno ruled on the plaintiffs motion to lift the stay and dismiss their complaint.in re pharmacy benefit managers antitrust,d.
on august,judge robreno transferred this action to judge fullam pursuant to the mdl panel august,transfer order.on december,judge fullam convened a status conference in the mdl proceedings,which then included this action.at that conference,judge fullam heard argument on the plaintiffs motion to lift the stay and dismiss the complaint.
on december,judge fullam sua sponte signed an order and supporting memorandum vacating judge robreno august,order compelling arbitration and staying litigation judge fullam then dismissed the motion to dismiss the complaint as moot.in re pharmacy benefit mangers antitrust litig.bellevue drug advancepcs,wl.in doing so,judge fullam explained that judge robreno orders compelling arbitration were clearly appropriate under the federal arbitration act and the congressional policies reflected in that statute.id.at.however,judge fullam believed that,in ordering arbitration,judge robreno did not actually decide that the issues involved were arbitrable,or even whether the arbitration agreement relied upon was enforceable he merely,in accordance with the general policy of favoring arbitration,required that all issues be submitted initially to the arbitrator for decision.id.noting the action of the mdl panel which clearly assumed that the stay or proceedings did not preclude coordinated pretrial proceedings,judge fullam reasoned that he could therefore diverge from judge robreno orders to the limited extent of considering whether any useful purpose would be served in submitting all preliminary determinations to the arbitrator.id.judge fullam believed the task assigned to me as transferee judge can best be performed by expediting the decision which,i believe,would necessarily have been reached by the arbitrator with respect to the procedural aspects of this litigation.id.at.
in deciding the procedural aspect of th e litigation,judge fullam found that because the arbitrator must follow the rule of law,and may only award remedies provided in the agreement,the arbitrator is precluded from considering the antitrust claims asserted by plaintiff in this litigation.id.thus,judge fullam had no difficulty in concluding either that the parties never intended this type of litigation to be submitted to arbitration,or that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it violates public policy.id.at advancepcs then filed this appeal 
ii.discussion 
advancepcs makes a number of arguments.it contends,inter alia,that judge fullam order vacating judge robreno order compelling arbitration violates the federal arbitration act faa that the claims of the pharmacy plaintiffs and the association plaintiffs are subject to arbitration and that the arbitration clauses in the pharmacy provider agreements are valid and enforceable.however,we need not address the merits of any of those arguments because we agree with advance pcs that judge fullam order vacating judge robreno orders compelling arbitration can not stand under the law of the case doctrine.
in arizona california,d,the supreme court noted 
unlike the more precise requirements of res judicata,law of the case is an amorphous concept.as most commonly defined,the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.

the doctrine does not restrict a court power but rather governs its exercise of discretion.pub.interest research group of nj,magnesium elektron,cir citations omitted.the supreme court has explained the scope of this discretion as follows 
a court has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance,although as a rule courts should be loathe to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as where the initial decision was clearly erroneous and would make a manifest injustice.
