roger and louise neuhoff hereinafter jointly referred to as the neuhoffs brought a diversity action against marvin lumber cedar company and marvin windows of tennessee,hereinafter jointly referred to as marvin for breach of an oral contract,breach of implied warranty,violation of.laws ch,and promissory estoppel.the district court granted marvin motion for summary judgment on all four claims.we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment on the first three claims,but inappropriately granted summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim.we,therefore,affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
in,the neuhoffs purchased and installed sixty windows manufactured by marvin.in,the neuhoffs noticed that many of the windows were decaying and notified simon hickman,the contractor who installed the windows,of the decay.
the parties disagree as to when marvin was notified of the decay.the neuhoffs contend that marvin was notified in or early when marvin area distributor came to examine the windows.marvin contends that it did not learn of the decay until late when the area distributor contacted marvin regarding the decay.
in,marvin sent roy holthusen to inspect the windows.the inspection showed that windows had either obvious decay or incipient decay.in march,marvin sent the neuhoffs a letter promising to replace windows for free.several weeks later,after inquiring about the remaining windows,the neuhoffs claim that marvin agent,greg muirhead,orally informed them that the remaining windows would be replaced for free,but that marvin could not replace them yet due to production problems.in,marvin replaced of the windows that were in the most advanced state of decay.
in june,the neuhoffs contacted marvin again because the windows that had not been replaced had reached an advanced state of decay.marvin sent another inspector to the neuhoffs home.this inspector concluded that windows,including four of the newly installed windows,had obvious decay.in january,marvin informed the neuhoffs that their windows would not be replaced for free,but that the neuhoffs could purchase replacement windows at a discount.the neuhoffs filed suit in july.

iii.analysis 
breach of oral contract 
the neuhoffs allege that marvin breached an oral contract to provide replacement windows for free.the oral contract was allegedly made in march when greg muirhead informed the neuhoffs that their decaying windows would be replaced once marvin production problems were fixed and the windows reached a more advanced stage of decay.
the district court held that there was not a breach of an oral contract because the promise to replace the defective windows constituted a remedy,not a new contract.see neuhoff marvin lumber cedar,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,citing new england power riley stoker.as a result,the district court granted marvin summary judgment motion on this claim.although we disagree with the district court reasoning,we do not disagree with the result.
the district court reliance on new england power and the cases cited therein was mistaken for several reasons.first,in new england power,the promises to repair were viewed as remedies rather than as an independent or separate warranty because the warranty and the promise to repair were included in the same contract.new england power,at.the logic behind new england power is that a promise to repair does not create a contract independent from the warranty because if it did,then limitations periods could be extended for virtually infinite time.id.in this case,however,the initial contract was executed in.the promise to repair did not allegedly occur until and was not a part of the original contract or warranty in effect.marvin went to great lengths to emphasize that the original contract warranty had expired and the ten year warranty was inapplicable.thus,the promise to repair was independent of the warranties and could,therefore,be breached.
second,by applying new england power,the district court confuses a promise to repair warranty from a promise to repair that is made after a product defects are known.a promise to repair warranty refers to a type of warranty that stipulates the remedy to be invoked if the product purchased becomes faulty.see standard alliance,black clawson,cir.if the promisor does not abide by the promise to repair,then the promisee has a cause of action for the underlying breach of warranty for the defective product.new england power,at.in this case,the promise to repair made by marvin was not the type of promise that stipulates the remedy to be invoked in case of a defect,rather it was an independent promise addressing a known defect.
nonetheless,the neuhoffs breach of contract claim fails because marvin alleged promise to repair lacked consideration.see geffon micrion,cir court of appeals may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.a contract must have consideration to be enforceable and i n order for a contract to have valid consideration,the contract must be a exchange in which there is a legal detriment of the promisee or a corresponding benefit to the promisor.see hinchey nynex,cir quotations and citations omitted.
the neuhoffs allege three types of consideration forbearance of their legal claims,the time and labor expended assisting marvin in connection with marvin promise to replace the defective windows,and the benefit marvin received to their reputation by agreeing to replace the windows.
it is that abandonment of a claim believed to be well founded is the surrender of a thing of value and is a sufficient consideration for a contract.blair cifrino,quotations and citations omitted.the claim need not be of such character in law or fact or both as finally to commend itself to the judgment of the tribunal of last resort,rather it need only be well founded and made in good faith and not frivolous,vexatious or unlawful.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.but,m ere forbearance to sue a claim,without any promise either in express terms or by fair implication from all of the circumstances,does not form sufficient consideration merrimac chem.moore.it is undisputed that the neuhoffs never expressed their willingness to forbear suit before or after the promise to replace the defective windows was made.nonetheless,the neuhoffs argue that their willingness to forbear suit could be implied.an agreement to forbear to sue may be implied when the circumstances are such as to lead to the reasonable conclusion that the thing of value was given to induce the other party to forbear.id.the record shows that the alleged promise to replace all of the windows was not given to induce the neuhoffs to relinquish a claim against marvin.thus,the neuhoffs claims of forbearance is not sufficient for consideration since such forbearance was neither express nor could be found by fair implication from all the circumstances.
the neuhoffs also claim that the time and labor expended assisting marvin in connection with marvin promise to replace the defective windows was consideration.actions can constitute consideration when a promisee gives up something which immediately prior thereto the promisee was privileged to retain,or doing or refraining from doing something which he was then privileged not to do,or not to refrain from doing.graphic arts finishers,boston redevelopment,internal citation omitted.the record contains scant evidence indicating any time or labor expended assisting marvin in connection with muirhead promise to replace the remaining defective windows.rather,the record demonstrates that the actions taken by the neuhoffs were a result of muirhead letter stating that marvin would replace the first windows.pursuant to marvin letter,for example,the neuhoffs obtained construction bids,but only for the first windows.
the only effort expended by the ne
