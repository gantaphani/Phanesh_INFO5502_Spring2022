this is an appeal from an order of the district court vacating an award of compensatory damages rendered by an arbitration panel adjudicating claims pursuant to the rules of the national association of securities dealers nasd the award was in favor of three financial advisors,appellants thomas bishop bishop,steven hamant hamant,and timothy scanlon scanlon against the appellee,raymond james financial services,raymond james,a member of nasd.the appellants contend that the district court erred in exceeding the narrow scope of review prescribed by the federal arbitration act.see a.we are mindful that vacatur of an arbitration award is,and must be,a rare occurrence because a federal court employs a standard of review among the narrowest known at law.apex plumbing supply,supply,cir.nonetheless,we conclude,as did the district court,that this case presents one of those rare instances.accordingly,for the reasons stated within,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the appellants are registered representatives working as financial advisors in the securities industry in the richmond,virginia,area.in early,bishop departed from his then firm and entered into a written independent sales associate agreement with appellee raymond james financial services,raymond james,a registered.bishop became the branch manager at a raymond james richmond office.at about the same time,apparently at bishop urging,hamant and scanlon each entered into a separate written financial advisor agreement with raymond james and practiced their trade out of the richmond office headed by bishop.
each of the three agreements described the individual financial advisor as an independent contractor.moreover,each of the three agreements contained the following termination of agreement provision permitting any party to terminate the agreement on five days notice 
either party may terminate this agreement by providing the other party no less than five business days prior written notice of intent to terminate this agreement.given the unique transactional nature of the securities business,there is no need for a liquidated damages provision should either party voluntarily terminate the agreement before the end of its term as neither party would be significantly damaged by such termination.
the agreements contained no general arbitration provision as a member of nasd,however,raymond james was required to resolve certain disputes with its registered representatives by arbitration.
during,raymond james received several serious complaints of misconduct from competing financial advisors with respect to the operation of the office headed by bishop as a result of the mounting complaints,on april,raymond james notified bishop and his at the richmond branch,michael finnie,that the branch would be closed and that their registrations with raymond james were being terminated in five days.raymond james acted specifically pursuant to the termination of agreement provision in its independent sales associate agreement.raymond james left open the possibility that the representatives in the richmond branch,including appellants,could affiliate with another raymond james branch.indeed,bishop,finnie,promptly with another raymond james branch.on june,however,after a two month extension of time by raymond james in effecting the branch closing,the appellants voluntarily terminated their respective agreements and they did not with raymond james 
meanwhile,prior to the appellants resignations,a lawyer from raymond james legal department,terrance bostic,had assumed representation of the appellants jointly with his representation of raymond james in the nasd arbitration proceedings arising from some of the complaints lodged against the richmond office staff.such representation of the appellants continued after the richmond branch closed.in due course,the arbitration proceedings against scanlon concluded in his favor while he was represented by bostic,whereas hamant personally paid in respect to a nasd arbitration award against him.
the arbitration proceeding involving bishop was ongoing as of december.on that date,bostic withdrew as counsel for bishop while continuing as counsel to raymond james based on an incipient conflict of interest.specifically,the conflict of interest arose when raymond james discovered that someone had obtained unauthorized access to its computer system legal action against bishop was contemplated in connection with the incident in any event,within just a few days after bostic withdrew from his representation of bishop,the parties to the pending arbitration proceeding reached a global settlement resulting in no liability to bishop.
in july,the appellants filed a consolidated arbitration demand against raymond james pursuant to nasd rules.specifically,the appellants sought damages on the basis of the following legal theories wrongful discharge breach of contract tortious interference with contract common law and statutory conspiracy violation of the virginia retail franchising act and violation of just and equitable principles of trade.thereafter,raymond james submitted its answer,affirmative defenses,and,and a motion to dismiss,which the appellants opposed.
on may,the arbitration panel denied raymond james motion to dismiss.then,on december,following a hearing extending over several days,the arbitration panel found raymond james liable.in its award,the arbitration panel summarized the appellants claims as follows 
breach of fiduciary and legal duties violation of just and equitable legal principles of trade breach of promises and inducements interference with,and unlawful termination of the appellants prospective economic advantages interference with the performance of contractual promises and inducements tortious and deceitful termination of the appellants legitimate and high business expectations violation of statutory virginia public policy set forth in virginia code and common law and statutory conspiracy.
the panel granted the following substantial compensatory damages to the appellants bishop,hamant,and scanlon.
by way of explanation for its award,the panel cited raymond james unauthorized practice of law sic by employing staff counsel to advise and represent appellants in their individual capacities in nasd arbitrations.the panel also found that raymond james failed to warn the appellants that they were subjected to heightened scrutiny after raymond james received complaints about them.id.the panel further found that bostic withdrawal from bishop representation in the arbitration prejudiced some or all appellants litigation interest and made their transfer to other raymond james financial services,branch offices impossible as a practical matter.id.
on january and,raymond james filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia a timely motion to vacate the award,and an amended motion to vacate,respectively.the appellants filed timely motions to confirm the award.
on july,the district court held a hearing.the court noted the lack of clarity in the arbitration panel explanation for its award,and in particular,among other things,the peculiar manner in which the arbitration panel seemed to treat the claims of all three of the appellants identically,although the factual circumstances and background as to bishop,on the one hand,and hamant and scanlon,on the other hand,were quite different.when the district court asked counsel for the latter two to identify raymond james actionable conduct as to his clients hamant and scanlon,counsel indicated that the actionable conduct was wrongful termination.when the court asked counsel how any termination could be wrongful in light of the termination of agreement provision included in each written agreement,which on its face provided for termination on five days notice,counsel argued that the law in the nasd securities industry requires that,irrespective of the parties agreement,termination of a registered representative could only be for cause.
ultimately,despite its best efforts to discern some coherence in the award,the district court concluded that it could not do so and remanded the matter to the arbitration panel appellants filed an interlocutory appeal to this court from the district court remand order.on april,we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
on april,the arbitration panel issued a supplemental letter opinion in response to the district court remand order.therein,the arbitrators stated the following bases for its award 
raymond james provided legal representation to the appellants in a matter involving a business relationship between the employer and the appellants that was also adversarial with a clear conflict of interest raymond james attorney favored the interest of raymond james to the disadvantage of the appellants,who were also his clients if a corporation employs a lawyer to provide legal services that corporation is then engaged in the practice of law as such,it is held to the same standard as a law firm and owes to its client the highest degree of fiduciary duty.if it chooses to engage in the business with such clients,it is obligated to place the interest of those clients ahead of its own.raymond james failed in that obligation and the appellants suffered losses pertaining to the issues for which raymond james provided its lawyer.
on april,raymond james filed a renewed motion to vacate in the district court.then,in a june,letter,the arbitration panel supplemented its supplemental opinion,stating that t he unauthorized practice of law was one among other factors considered by the panel and that considering the case as a whole it believes the liability decision to be just and appropriate.
after further briefing by the parties,the district court issued its memorandum opinion on december.the court summarized its earlier reasoning that had prompted it to remand the matter to the arbitration panel.the court went on to find that l ike the original award,the letters of clarification are not really very clear at all respecting the legal basis for the finding of liability.nor do they articulate the causal link between the perceived liability and the monetary award.
noting that the arbitration panel had expressly stated that any and all claims sic relief not specifically addressed herein,including claimants requests for punitive damages,are denied,quoting arbitration award,the district court concluded that the following legal theories had been rejected by the arbitration panel breach of promises and inducements interference with the performance of contractual promises and inducements violation of statutory public policy set forth in and common law and statutory conspiracy.consequently,the court concluded,the award must have been based on one or more of the following theories breach of fiduciary and legal duty violation of just and equitable principles of trade and interference with,or unlawful termination of,the appellants respective economic advantage.id.
the court identified the precedents from this court setting forth the statutory and grounds on which an arbitration award might be found infirm.under the federal arbitration act,it noted,an award may be vacated where the arbitrator exceeded his powers,or so imperfectly executed them,that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.see a.moreover,consistent with longstanding precedent in this circuit,the court observed that an award might be vacated on grounds where an arbitrator displayed a manifest disregard of the law and where the award failed to draw its essence from the parties agreement.
ultimately,the court concluded that the award here should be vacated on all three grounds.first,the court concluded that the arbitration panel exceeded its powers as proscribed by a.this conclusion was grounded in the court determination that the arbitrators clearly based their award of compensatory damages to the appellants on raymond james alleged breach of fiduciary and legal duties surrounding the termination of their affiliation with raymond james.consequently,the court analyzed the award under zandford,cir,and concluded the arbitrators clearly exceeded the authority granted them by that case to adjudicate a dispute arising out of the termination of a financial advisor in the securities industry.the court found this alone to be reason enough to vacate the award.
next,the court concluded that,even assuming a claim for breach of fiduciary duty could be prosecuted separately from the appellants claim of wrongful termination,the panel demonstrated a manifest disregard of the law.this conclusion was based on the court finding that the arbitrators were aware of and understood the legal maxim that,under florida law which the parties agree governs the written agreements at issue,in order for a claimant to recover on a claim of breach of fiduciary duty,the claimant must have suffered damages citing patten winderman,so d.thus,the court found that the arbitrators were aware of the law,understood it correctly,and found it applicable to the case before them.the court found that the arbitrators knowingly failed to apply the law here,however,because the only evidence of damages presented to the arbitration panel related to their alleged wrongful termination by raymond james and not to any breach of fiduciary duty.
finally,the court concluded that the award failed to draw its essence from the written agreements between the parties because the arbitrators either disregarded or modified unambiguous contract provisions or based the award on their own personal notions of right and wrong.that is,the court concluded that the written agreements between the parties were contracts.the arbitration panel award,however,inappropriately seemed to compensate the appellants for termination of their employment.accordingly,the court held that any damages award based on the termination of the appellants affiliation with raymond james or their inability to transfer to another raymond james branch would have to be vacated.
ultimately,the court concluded that to the extent the panel award was based on a breach of fiduciary duty,the mere fact that raymond james counsel provided representation to the appellants in the arbitration proceedings did not transmute raymond james into a law firm.the district court recognized that the arbitration panel was not required to state the reasons for its award,but that it had voluntarily done so.and,given that the panel award had no basis in law,the court found that the panel award merely reflected the panel personal views of right and wrong.even if there was a breach of some duty,the court found no discernable damage caused by this breach.
accordingly,raymond james renewed motion to vacate was granted and the award was vacated.the appellants have timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

as we have made clear repeatedly 
judicial review of an arbitration award in federal court is substantially circumscribed.patten signator ins.agency,cir.in fact,the scope of judicial review for an arbitrator decision is among the narrowest known at law because to allow full scrutiny of such awards would frustrate the purpose of having arbitration at quick resolution of disputes and the avoidance of the expense and delay associated with litigation.apex plumbing supply,supply,cir.indeed,as we have emphasized,in reviewing such an award,a district or appellate court is limited to determine whether the arbitrators did the job they were told to whether they did it well,or correctly,or reasonably,but simply whether they did it.remmey painewebber,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

on appeal,the appellants emphasize the highly circumscribed standard of federal courts review of arbitration awards.they argue that,although no error by the arbitration panel is shown in any event,at most what the record shows are mere errors of fact of law which provide no basis for judicial intervention.they argue,further,that when the parties submitted their dispute to the process of arbitration,they agreed to accept the arbitration award as final,save extraordinary circumstances.the appellants argue that no such extraordinary circumstances existed here.raymond james urges affirmance on any or all of the grounds identified by the district court.we conclude that raymond james has the better of the argument and find that the award can not withstand the deferential review mandated by a.
we conclude first that the district court did not abuse its discretion in remanding the award to the arbitration panel for clarification of the bases of the award.like the district court,we believe the original award is sufficiently inscrutable that it was reasonable to seek clarification of the basis for the award from the arbitration panel.it is true,of course,that an arbitrator need not explain her award.united steelworkers of am.enterprise wheel car.furthermore,we are mindful of a potential danger in such remands courts must approach remand to the arbitrator with care lest the arbitrator believe that a remand is equivalent to retrial with an expectation of an opposite result the second time around.randall,a div.of textron,lodge,int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers,cir.at the same time,however,as one court has noted,r emand to an arbitrator for clarification and interpretation is not unusual in judicial enforcement proceedings.mcclatchy newspapers central valley typographical union,cir.
given the evident incoherence of the explanation that was volunteered by the arbitration panel in this instance,we do not fault the district court in its commendable efforts to seek guidance through a remand,guidance that would enable the court to conduct the limited judicial review to which raymond james was entitled.
o nce the reasons that are given by an arbitrator strongly imply that the arbitrator may have exceeded his or her authority under the submission and contract whether that implication appears in the form of vague or inconsistent results or possible extensions beyond the terms of the contract the device of remand is appropriate to avoid having courts rather than the arbitrator clarify the bases for the initial determination.

as described above,the appellants crafted a veritable smorgasbord of legal theories in support of their quest for compensatory damages.this seems to have been a sound tactic.nevertheless,the record is clear that the appellants have insisted throughout these proceedings that the gravamen of their claims for damages was an alleged wrongful termination of their affiliations with raymond james.to be sure,on the face of the record,it is exceedingly obscure,to say the least,as to how a wrongful termination might arise inasmuch as their respective agreements with raymond james were independent contractor agreements containing the termination of agreement provision quoted above in part i of this opinion,and under circumstances in which the appellants voluntarily terminated the agreements themselves.
notwithstanding that the appellants fundamental claim was one for wrongful termination,we agree with the district court that the award in this case can not be understood as based on anything other than the arbitrators finding that raymond james committed a breach of fiduciary and legal duties when its lawyer,bostic,provided legal representation to the appellants in arbitration proceedings.in so concluding,the arbitration panel clearly exceeded its power within the contemplation of a 
the appellants correctly contend that,although the parties agreements allowed raymond james to terminate each agreement without cause and at will,all of the parties here were covered by former nasd rule rule provides a measure of protection for registered representatives affiliated with such as raymond james.it was on the authority of the expansive language of rule that the appellants asserted their claims against raymond james.
in zandford securities,we examined the scope of claims asserted under new york stock exchange rule nyse rule,which,in language identical to that in rule,provided for arbitration of a ny controversy arising out of the employment or termination of employment of registered representatives.cir.

upon zandford appeal to this court from the confirmation of the award,we affirmed and held that all of zandford tort and contract claims were covered by the nyse rule arbitration clause because they arose out of zandford employment with prudential.id.at 
we adopted a test fashioned by the eighth circuit and embraced by many courts to hold that arbitration of a dispute is,that a dispute arises out of employment or termination of employment,where the claims involve significant aspects of the employment relationship,including but not limited to explicit contractual terms.id.at quoting morgan smith barney,harris upham,cir.under morgan significant aspects test,the source from which arbitrable disputes arise is not the employment or termination of the employment contract but simply employment or termination of employment.id.at citing morgan,at.we reasoned that the proper question is whether resolution of the claim depends upon evaluation of a party performance either as a broker or as an employer of brokers during the time of the contractual relationship.id.at citing aspero shearson american express,cir fleck hutton group,cir.
in the case before us,the district court applied zandford and concluded that issues surrounding raymond james alleged practice of law and the resulting alleged breach of fiduciary and legal duties did not fit within the framework of arbitrable claims under the rule analogue to nyse rule.thus,it determined that the arbitrators lacked the authority to address this cause of action,the very claim on which the panel premised the award of compensatory damages to the appellants.
we agree with the district court.as we have noted,here the arbitrators based their award on raymond james alleged breach of fiduciary and legal duties in connection with their joint representation with raymond james by bostic,the lawyer.under the zandford significant aspects test,the appropriate question here is whether resolution of the claim depends upon evaluation of a party performance either as a broker or as an employer of brokers during the time of the contractual relationship.at citations omitted.the panel assertion that raymond james acted improperly as a lawyer is inconsistent with the notion that raymond james was acting as an employer of brokers during the time of the contractual relationship.there is nothing whatsoever in the serial explanations provided by the arbitration panel to support the conclusion that the legal theory the panel found sustained required an evaluation of any party performance.even after the district court ordered a remand to the panel,the panel simply reiterated what seemed inescapable from the original award that the panel had adjudicated a tort claim that fell outside of the expansive interpretation of arising out of employment we adopted in zandford.
thus,the arbitration panel committed no mere error of law.rather,by rendering an award whose underlying legal basis exceeded the bounds of arbitrable disputes cognizable under nasd rule as interpreted by analogy in zandford,the panel exceeded its powers under a 
the appellants seek to avoid this result with two arguments,each of which we find unpersuasive.first,they seem to contend that once the arbitration panel jurisdiction was established pursuant to rule,the panel was entitled under the expansive rubri
