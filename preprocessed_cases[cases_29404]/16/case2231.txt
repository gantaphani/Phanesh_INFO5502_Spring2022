this case presents a relatively rare appeal of an issue that arises frequently in district courts two parties file identical lawsuits,each a of the other,in different federal districts.to prevent duplication of this sort,district courts may transfer,enjoin,or dismiss one of the lawsuits.we take this opportunity to provide additional guidance on this issue for district courts and for litigants.
the parties in this case filed lawsuits in two different district courts,each claiming the other had breached their contract for the manufacture and sale of an industrial cleaning machine.shortly after seller research automation,an illinois corporation,delivered the machine to the virginia manufacturing plant of buyer,a dispute arose as to whether the machine met the contract specifications.each party filed suit in its home state courts.after both cases were removed to their respective federal courts,each defendant moved to transfer the competing lawsuit to its preferred venue.research automation also asked the illinois court to enjoin the virginia proceedings on the ground that the illinois suit should receive priority for having been filed first.the illinois district judge ruled on that motion together with transfer motion,finding that a transfer to virginia under a was the most appropriate resolution of the parties competing motions.
we affirm the district court decision to deny the injunction and to transfer the illinois action to the western district of virginia.where a district court gives thoughtful consideration to the factors applicable to a transfer analysis under section a,we give its decision substantial deference.that deference applies regardless of whether there is only one lawsuit between the parties or whether there is a second case pending in the other forum.
facts and procedural background 
in,plaintiff research automation,entered into an agreement with defendant international,to manufacture a high pressure water jet deburr and cleaning machine,which planned to use to clean and deburr its automotive valves and stems.the machine was to be completed in,but alleged that the machine failed to satisfy the requirements specified in the agreement and filed a lawsuit alleging breach of the agreement in a virginia state court on november.as the parties attempted to work out their differences,the state court litigation was not pursued and eventually was on february,due to lack of service 
four days later,research automation sued in an illinois state court.research automation alleged that breached the parties amended agreement by failing to pay.on february,filed its own suit in a virginia state court alleging that research automation breached the same agreement.each case was removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction removed the illinois suit to the northern district of illinois on february,and research automation removed the virginia action to the western district of virginia on march.the parties agree that these suits are mirror images of each other,with the exception that the virginia action also names as a defendant a north carolina corporation that served as research automation agent in the parties original negotiations.
on march,one day after removing the virginia action,research automation filed a motion in illinois to enjoin from prosecuting its action in virginia.two days later,on march,moved to transfer the illinois case to the virginia court pursuant to a.on april,the illinois court denied research automation motion for an injunction and granted motion to transfer.this appeal followed.
under a,we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the district court order denying research automation motion for an injunction.a decision granting or denying a section a transfer is ordinarily a interlocutory order.hill potter,cir.the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction,however,allows us to review an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order if it is inextricably intertwined with an appealable one.montano city of chicago,cir,quoting jones infocure,cir.here,the district court two rulings are inextricably intertwined.both the denial of the injunction and the district court transfer order concern the same single issue whether this case should be litigated in illinois or in virginia.we exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court order transferring the case to virginia.
the parties agree that we review the district court decision on both motions for an abuse of its discretion.see coffey van dorn iron works,cir reviewing a transfer order under an standard martin graybar electric,cir applying an standard to an injunction to halt proceedings in identical lawsuits.this standard implies a very limited scope of appellate review.cot√© wadel,cir.we do not simply engage in a perfunctory of the district court decision,but we give that decision substantial deference.american hospital supply hospital products,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties disagree with respect to the scope of the district court discretion and the manner in which it was applied.research automation contends that the judicial doctrine known as the rule defines the bounds of the district court discretion,limiting the court analysis under section a to a determination of which case was filed first.argues that the district court has the discretion to depart from the rule where a transfer analysis otherwise warrants.based on the weight of authority and principles of sound judicial administration,we conclude that the filing order is only one factor among many and in this case was not entitled to control the district court evaluation.
as a practical matter,we address the section a issue first because,like the district court,we find it to be decisive in this case.
transfer under a 
in,congress enacted the federal change of venue statute,codified at,to allow a district court to transfer an action filed in a proper,though not necessarily convenient,venue to a more convenient district.subsection a provides for the convenience of the parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.
recognizing that what is convenient for one litigant may not be convenient for the other,the supreme court has taught that section a is intended to place discretion in the district court to adjudicate motions for transfer according to a consideration of convenience and fairness.stewart organization,ricoh,quoting van dusen barrack,see also in re joint eastern southern districts asbestos litigation,cir the section statutory transfer power was clearly intended to vest in the transferor court more discretion than it had been permitted to exercise under the common law doctrine.by the same token,we grant a substantial degree of deference to the district court in deciding whether transfer is appropriate.see tice american airlines,cir.the statutory language guides the court evaluation of the particular circumstances of each case and is broad enough to allow the court to take into account all factors relevant to convenience the interests of justice.the statute permits a flexible and individualized analysis and affords district courts the opportunity to look beyond a narrow or rigid set of considerations in their determinations.stewart,at.
with respect to the convenience evaluation,courts generally consider the availability of and access to witnesses,and each party access to and distance from resources in each forum.see,schumacher principal life insurance,d,jaramillo dineequity,d.other related factors include the location of material events and the relative ease of access to sources of proof.see,sassy,berry,d,brandon apparel group,quitman manufacturing,d.
the interest of justice is a separate element of the transfer analysis that relates to the efficient administration of the court system.see van dusen,at.for this element,courts look to factors including docket congestion and likely speed to trial in the transferor and potential transferee forums,see chicago,rock island pacific railroad igoe,cir each court relative familiarity with the relevant law,van dusen,at the respective desirability of resolving controversies in each locale,allied van lines,aaron transfer storage,d,and the relationship of each community to the controversy,see hanley omarc,d.the interest of justice may be determinative,warranting transfer or its denial even where the convenience of the parties and witnesses points toward the opposite result.see coffey,at.
taking each of these factors of convenience and public interest into account,the district court determined that the sum of the interests among the parties weighs more heavily toward adjudication in virginia.first,the court concluded that neither party established that the other forum would pose an overwhelming hardship for the parties themselves.next,the court evaluated the convenience of party and witnesses and found that neither forum would be more convenient for the witnesses overall.the court then considered the locations of sources of proof and determined that this factor slightly favored virginia.finally,the court listed the material events taking place in virginia the negotiation of the original agreement,performance of the amended agreement,and the ultimate testing of the machine.the district court also noted the fact that the purpose of the original and amended agreements was for research automation not only to deliver but also to install the machine in virginia facility,where it was supposed to work successfully.these material events in virginia formed the basis of the court transfer decision.the court conclusion was reasonable.
where the balance of convenience is a close call,merely shifting inconvenience from one party to another is not a sufficient basis for transfer.see,gueorguiev max rave,llc,d,gillon,d,enviroplan,western farmers electric cooperative,kendall,central printing.here,however,while the district judge determined that no one element clearly indicated that one forum would be more convenient than the other,the totality of the factors pointed to virginia stronger nexus to the relevant events.
although the district court discretion is not unlimited,we adhere to the supreme court directive that,where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,as in this case,its decision deserves substantial deference.piper aircraft reyno,citing gulf oil gilbert.even if we agreed with research automation that the northern district of illinois would be a very convenient forum,that is not enough to show that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the western district of virginia is more convenient.and even if we were inclined to reach a different outcome by way of our own review of the record,we would still conclude that the district court,by evaluating factors appropriate to resolve both motions,did not abuse its discretion in deciding to transfer.
ii.the rule 
in an effort to defeat the transfer analysis,research automation maintains that motion must fail because a plaintiff choice of forum is afforded deference so long as the chosen forum is related to the case.see gilbert,at u nless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.but where,as here,the case involves two identical suits in distinct venues,this factor loses its significance entirely each case has a plaintiff,and one of them will necessarily be disturbed.the district court was right to discount this element in this context.
upon examining the facts and circuit precedent on the issue,the district court was uncertain about whether a rule should apply,but it found that the transfer analysis provided sufficient grounds for a transfer.research automation argues that the district court erred by not taking into account a presumption in favor of the illinois action,relying on this court general rule as stated in martin graybar electric,cir,that,absent unusual circumstances,a party filing later in time should be enjoined from further prosecution.we do not read graybar electric the same way.
graybar electric involved an action seeking coercive as opposed to declaratory relief filed in the northern district of illinois and a parallel declaratory judgment action in the northern district of iowa filed six days later.the illinois district judge in that case expressed reluctance to issue an injunction to block the iowa action,believing erroneously that he did not have the power to do so.we reversed and remanded,holding that a district court has discretion to issue an injunction where the parties are prosecuting parallel actions in different districts.the general rule prescribed in graybar electric was intended to empower the district courts with respect to their injunctive authority,not to mandate any particular standard or approach.
since graybar electric,we have made clear that where the facts of that case are is,where the parallel cases involve a declaratory judgment action and a action seeking coercive ordinarily give priority to the coercive action,regardless of which case was filed first.in those cases,we have repeatedly taught that this circuit does not rigidly adhere to a rule,trippe manufacturing american power conversion,cir affirming dismissal of declaratory judgment action in favor of coercive action tempco electric heater omega engineering,cir finding that the mere fact that a plaintiff filed its action first does not give it a right to choose a forum see also tamari bache lebanon,cir teaching that there is no rigid chronological rule but that the timing of filing may be one factor affecting discretion.even in graybar electric,we noted that any mechanical solution of such a problem would not be w ise judicial administration.at,quoting kerotest manufacturing fire equipment.
courts have also departed from a rule where one party files its lawsuit in anticipation of an impending suit by the opposing party.see,schwarz national van lines,d,finding that where a plaintiff files an action in the face of a clear threat that the opposing party will sue,a court will dismiss a argument.this type of behavior only exacerbates the risk of wasteful litigation 
this court has never laid down an inflexible rule that the prior filing controls.warshawsky arcata national corp,cir see also graybar electric,at declining to lay down a judicial fiat that the prosecution of the subsequent suit must or must not be enjoined as a matter of law.research automation relies on language from asset allocation management western employers insurance,cir,stating that there is a rebuttable presumption that the first case should proceed,subject to the principles that govern requests for transfer to a more convenient forum.at.the asset allocation opinion also said that a district court has a power,but not a duty,to enjoin a case.id.at.in our view,the asset allocation court intended meaning is clear the case may proceed where the principles that govern requests for transfer do not indicate otherwise.we reiterate our holding in tempco electric that,although a rule would have the virtue of certainty and ease of application,the rule which will encourage an unseemly race to the courthouse is simply too high.at.
our approach is not unique in this respect.the other circuits have developed similar practices.though the eleventh circuit has made reference to a strong presumption across the federal circuits that favors the forum of the suit under the rule,and has require d that the party objecting to jurisdiction in the forum carry the burden of proving compelling circumstances to warrant an exception to the rule,manuel convergys,cir citations omitted,we do not find as strong support among our sister circuits.most maintain the rule as a guiding principle to be left to the discretion of the district court.for example,though the third circuit refers to a rule,it is not a mandate directing wooden application of the rule district courts have always had discretion to retain jurisdiction given appropriate circumstances justifying departure from the rule.eeoc university of pennsylvania,cir.the sixth and circuits have adopted the same reasoning.see certified restoration dry cleaning network,te
