the present appeal requires us to determine whether a covenant not to compete,entered into in connection with the acquisition of a portion of the stock of a corporation that is engaged in a trade or business,is considered a section intangible,within the meaning of d e,regardless of whether the portion of stock acquired constitutes at least a substantial portion of such corporation total stock.for the reasons stated below,we answer in the affirmative.
petitioners appellants recovery group,recovery group and thirteen individuals who held shares in said corporation appeal the united states tax court decision in recovery group,comm r of internal revenue,memo,cch tax,which found in favor of respondent commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner concerning the correctness of certain income tax deficiencies assessed by the united states internal revenue service the irs against the appellants these deficiencies resulted from the finding that a certain covenant not to into by recovery group in connection with the redemption of of the shares of a former a section intangible,and,consequently,that recovery group had to amortize the payments it made under such covenant not to compete over the period prescribed by a,and not over the duration of the covenant,as recovery group had reported in its corresponding income tax returns.because we find that the aforementioned covenant not to compete was an amortizable section intangible,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the relevant facts in this appeal are not in dispute.during the tax years in question,recovery group was an s corporation that engaged in the business of providing consulting and management services to insolvent companies.
in,james edgerly one of recovery group founders,employees and minority shareholders informed its president that he wished to leave the company and to have the company buy out his shares,which represented of recovery group outstanding stock.as a result of the subsequent negotiations,edgerly entered into a buyout agreement whereby recovery group agreed to redeem all of edgerly shares for a price of.in addition,edgerly entered into a noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreement that prohibited edgerly from,inter alia,engaging in competitive activities from july,through july.the amount paid by recovery group to edgerly for this covenant not to compete the covenant amounted to,which was comparable to edgerly annual earnings.
in its corresponding income tax returns,recovery group claimed deductions for its payments under the covenant by amortizing such payments over the duration of the covenant.thus,because that term straddled the two tax years and,recovery group allocated the over those two years.
after a subsequent investigation,the irs determined that the covenant was an amortizable section intangible,amortizable by recovery group over fifteen years beginning with the month of acquisition and not over the duration of the covenant,as had been reported by recovery group in its corresponding income tax returns.consequently,the irs partially disallowed recovery group deductions for the cost of the covenant,allowing amortization deductions of only for and for,and disallowing for and for.this disallowance increased recovery group net income for each year,and thus each shareholder share of recovery group income.accordingly,the irs issued notices of deficiency to both recovery group and its shareholders 
recovery group and its shareholders filed timely petitions in the tax court,alleging that the covenant was not considered a section intangible,and,consequently,that it was not subject to amortization period,but rather that it was amortizable over its duration.specifically,recovery group alleged that,in order for a covenant not to compete to be considered a section intangible under d e,the covenant must be entered into in connection with the acquisition of either the totality of such corporation stock or a substantial portion of such corporation total stock.the tax court rejected recovery group interpretation of and found in favor of the commissioner,concluding that d e substantiality requirement only applied to asset acquisitions and not to stock acquisitions,and,consequently,that a covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the acquisition of any corporate stock,even if not substantial,was considered a section intangible amortizable over fifteen years.the tax court also opined,in the alternative,that even if the aforementioned conclusion was incorrect and d e substantiality requirement indeed applied to stock acquisitions,recovery group claim nonetheless failed because the court found the stock redemption in question of recovery group total stock to be a substantial portion of the company stock.this appeal ensued

iii.discussion 
on appeal,recovery group contests the tax court decision on the tax deficiencies by challenging the court interpretation of specifically,recovery group avers that the tax court erred by concluding that the covenant is a section intangible within the meaning of d e.
in interpreting the meaning of d e,we begin our analysis with the statutory text and determine whether the same is plain and unambiguous.see carcieri salazar.in so doing,we accord the statutory text its ordinary meaning by reference to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.mullane chambers,cir quoting robinson shell oil.if the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,we must apply the statute according to its terms,carcieri.at,except in unusual cases where,for example,doing so would bring about absurd results.see in re hill,cir.if the statute is ambiguous,we look beyond the text to the legislative history in order to determine congressional intent.united states vidal reyes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a statute is ambiguous only if it admits of more than one reasonable interpretation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin our discussion by providing a brief background of and then turn to sketching both the commissioner construction of,which was adopted by the tax court as its primary holding,and recovery group interpretation.
background 
section entitles taxpayers to claim an amortization deduction with respect to any amortizable section intangible.a.the cost of an amortizable section intangible must be amortized ratably over the year period beginning with the month in which such intangible was acquired.id.no other depreciation or amortization deduction is allowed with respect to any amortizable section intangible.id.at b.on the other hand,intangible assets not classified as amortizable section intangible s are not within the purview of and are not subject to this section mandatory amortization period.rather,depreciation and amortization for such intangible assets may be allowed under the rules of other code provisions,such as,provided the asset complies with the requirements set forth therein.
relevant statutory language 
section d e defines the term section intangible as including,among other things,any covenant not to compete entered into in connection with an acquisition directly or indirectly of an interest in a trade or business or substantial portion thereof.recovery group does not contest that,under d e,a redemption of stock is considered an indirect acquisition of an interest in a trade or business.see frontier chevrolet comm r,cir.rather,the parties dispute over the construction of this section deals primarily with the antecedent of the word thereof and the definition of an interest.
the tax court held and the commissioner asserts that the phrase an interest in a trade or business refers to a portion all or a part of an ownership interest in a trade or business,and that the phrase trade or business is the antecedent of the word thereof.thus,the tax court essentially read d e as follows the term section intangible means any covenant not to compete entered into in connection with an acquisition of an interest in a trade or business or a substantial portion of a trade or business.it is noteworthy that,under this interpretation,the question of whether an acquisition is substantial arises only where the acquisition is of a trade or business,of assets constituting a trade or business,and not where the acquisition is of an interest,a stock or partnership ownership interest in a trade or business.in other words,under this reading,a covenant not to compete executed in connection with a stock acquisition of any size substantial or not would be considered a section intangible.meanwhile,in the context of asset acquisitions,a covenant not to compete would only be considered a section intangible insofar as it is entered into in connection with the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of assets constituting a trade or business.accordingly,the tax court held that year amortization is required when a covenant is entered into in connection with an acquisition of either an interest,an entire or fractional stock interest in a trade or business or assets constituting a substantial portion of a trade or business.recovery group,memo.
recovery group,on the other hand,argues that the words an interest in a trade or business refer to the entire interest in a trade or business,and that the phrase an interest in a trade or business is the antecedent of the word thereof.accordingly,recovery group maintains that d e should be construed as follows the term section intangible means any covenant not to compete entered into in connection with an acquisition of the entire interest in a trade or business or a substantial portion of an interest in a trade or business.recovery group further alleges that the phrase an interest in a trade or business should be read to include both assets constituting a trade or business and stock in a corporation that is engaged in a trade or business thus,under this interpretation,section amortization would apply to covenants issued in connection with a stock acquisition only insofar as the acquires at least a substantial portion of stock in a corporation that is engaged in a trade or business.in other words,under this reading of d e,the question of whether an acquisition is substantial would arise both in stock and asset acquisitions.
as an initial matter,we note that recovery group construction of d e makes a portion of the statutory language seem redundant,and thus fails to give effect to the entire statute.see in re baylis,cir in construing a statute we are obliged to give effect,if possible,to every word congress used.quoting reiter sonotone.specifically,if,as recovery group alleges,the textual definition of a section intangible includes a covenant not to compete entered into in connection with,the entire interest in a trade or business or a substantial portion of an interest in a trade or business,then the first category may be considered redundant because any acquisition falling under would presumably also satisfy the second category.nevertheless,this weakness,by itself,is not sufficient in the present case to discard recovery group interpretation as unreasonable or to dispel the ambiguity that otherwise arises from the statutory language.see lamie united states,noting that a court preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.rather,we find that the relevant statutory language is ambiguous,as both the commissioner and recovery group interpretations of the same are reasonable within the context of the statute accordingly,we proceed to analyze the statute legislative history in order to determine congressional intent.see vidal reyes,at.
purpose and legislative history 
prior to the enactment of,as part of the revenue reconciliation act of,stat,taxpayers were not allowed an amortization deduction with respect to goodwill,but were allowed an amortization deduction for intangible assets that had limited useful lives that could be determined with reasonable accuracy.see newark morning ledger united states,citing a.as a result,taxpayers and the irs engaged in voluminous litigation concerning the identification of amortizable intangible assets and their useful lives 
the legislative history of identified the following three types of disputes arising between taxpayers and the irs whether an amortizable intangible asset exists in the case of an acquisition of a trade or business,the portion of the purchase price that is allocable to an amortizable intangible asset and the proper method and period for recovering the cost of an amortizable intangible asset,at.
the legislative history referred to the severe backlog of cases in audit and litigation as a matter of great concern,and made explicitly clear that t he purpose of was to simplify the law regarding the amortization of intangibles.id.at the committee believed that much of the controversy that arose under pre section law with respect to acquired intangible assets could be eliminated by specifying a single method and period for recovering the cost of most acquired intangible assets and by treating acquired goodwill and going concern value as amortizable intangible assets.id.at.accordingly,the bill required the cost of most acquired intangible assets,including goodwill and going concern value,to be amortized ratably over a fixed period.id in reaching this simplified approach,the committee recognized that certain acquired intangible which have useful lives that would not coincide with the amortization period prescribed by the statute.id.
in the particular case of a covenant not to compete,congress made applicable only where the covenant was entered into in connection with an acquisition of an interest in a trade or business or substantial portion thereof d e.this category was included in because of the immense volume of litigation regarding the value properly assignable to covenants not to compete.see generally annette nellen,bna tax management portfolio amortization of intangibles.
in the context of asset acquisitions,if d e had not been included,a buyer of assets constituting a trade or business would have had a significant incentive to allocate as covenant cost and amortize over the covenant useful life what was in fact purchase price attributable to section intangibles such as goodwill and going concern,which are amortizable over a period pursuant to this incentive would have inevitably given rise to much litigation,since the value of goodwill and going concern is notoriously difficult to determine,see sanders jackson,cir noting that due to its transitory nature,goodwill is extremely difficult to quantify and value with any certainty,thus allowing for much latitude and uncertainty in the allocation of amounts between the covenant and these intangibles.section attempts to eliminate this incentive and avoid litigation by applying to the covenant not to compete the same amortization period and rules applicable to section intangibles such as goodwill and going concern transferred under the sale of the business,thereby making it less relevant for a buyer of a business whether a payment to the seller is classified as covenant consideration or goodwill purchase price.however,because goodwill and going concern are presumably only transferred where at least a substantial portion of assets constituting a trade or business is sold,the opportunity to classify as covenant consideration what is in fact goodwill purchase price is generally not present where a covenant is entered into in connection with the acquisition of less than a substantial portion of assets constituting a trade or business.this explains why,in the context of asset acquisitions,congress made d e applicable only where the covenant not to compete was entered into in connection with the acquisition of at least a substantial portion of assets constituting a trade or business.
in the context of stock acquisitions,however,the uncertainty and consequently the possibility for much litigation between taxpayers and the irs caused by the inherent difficulty in valuing goodwill and going concern is generally present even where the purchased stock does not constitute a substantial portion of the corporation total stock.this is due to the fact that goo
