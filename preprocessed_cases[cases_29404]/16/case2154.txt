plaintiff the andersons,plaintiff appeals the district court award of summary judgment for defendant consol,defendant on plaintiff claims of unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,and intentional negligent misrepresentation on the ground that genuine issues of material fact exist to support such claims.because we find that,taking plaintiff factual allegations as true,no genuine issues of material fact exist to support any of those claims,we affirm the district court award of summary judgment to defendant.
jurisdiction and procedural history 
plaintiff filed this action against defendant in the lucas county court of common pleas.defendant removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio based on diversity jurisdiction.plaintiff complaint alleged claims of breach of commitments and understandings,unconscionable conduct,unjust enrichment,reasonable estoppel,and intentional negligent misrepresentation arising out of the parties negotiations for defendant lease of rail cars from plaintiff.on january,the district court granted defendant renewed motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiff claims.plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment only with respect to its claims of unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,and intentional negligent misrepresentation.
the following is plaintiff version of the facts in support of its claims.defendant is currently a corporation that mines,processes,and markets coal from various locations throughout the united states.during the relevant period for purposes of this litigation,defendant was a corporation.plaintiff is a corporation that,among other business activities,sells,leases,and repairs railroad cars.
nationsbank,a lender of plaintiff,notified plaintiff of defendant need to lease rail cars.on july,plaintiff representatives met with james dillon,defendant employee,to discuss defendant possible lease of plaintiff rail cars.dillon informed plaintiff representatives that defendant was interested in lease pricing for up to rail cars because defendant wished to bid on a coal requirements contract with potomac electric power company pepco,which would require defendant to furnish the rail cars necessary for coal transportation.on august,plaintiff sent defendant a lease proposal for rail cars at a rental rate of per rail car per month.on september,per dillon request,thomas connolly,plaintiff employee,sent dillon a copy of plaintiff standard,lease agreement and rider.in reviewing the lease agreement to determine if it contained any provisions that would affect the coal transportation,gerald rutka,defendant employee,found none.rutka used the pricing information in plaintiff lease agreement to calculate defendant requirements regarding the lease of the rail cars for the pepco bid.in of,dillon informed charles brown,plaintiff employee,that defendant had not received the pepco bid but that defendant intended to bid on another pepco coal contract requiring up to rail cars.
plaintiff submitted a new lease rate of per rail car per month,which defendant used in formulating its second bid to pepco.in early november of,defendant learned that it had received the pepco contract.on november,dillon sent brown a letter confirming defendant intent to lease specified rail cars from plaintiff for a term of six years at a rental rate of per rail car per month,with an option to end the lease after three years.however,in that same letter of intent,dillon expressly conditioned any such lease transaction upon pepco formal execution of its agreement with defendant,giving rise to defendant need to lease the rail cars,and upon the successful negotiation of a definitive lease agreement containing terms and conditions that are acceptable to defendant senior management.at this point,dillon still retained plaintiff standard,lease agreement and rider.plaintiff began to prepare for placing the rail cars into defendant service.dillon declined plaintiff offer to allow defendant to inspect the rail cars at their storage site in indiana.per dillon request,plaintiff sent some rail cars to a shop in altoona,pennsylvania to repair them before they went into service.plaintiff also moved some rail cars to various shops throughout ohio and pennsylvania.
at defendant request,plaintiff agreed to allow defendant to inspect the rail cars at the altoona repair shop.dillon testified that defendant desired this inspection before the rail cars repair because pepco and defendant were concerned that the rail cars would be in poor condition.on december,plaintiff leased an airplane,flew to pittsburgh,pennsylvania to pick up defendant representatives,and then flew to altoona.during the inspection,plaintiff first learned that defendant intended to rotary dump the rail cars rather than unload them from the process that would require plaintiff to bolt the bottoms of the rail cars shut.although plaintiff reasonably believed that the rail cars only needed patching,defendant demanded that plaintiff the rail cars,a repair which is considerably more expensive than patching.plaintiff ultimately agreed to bolt the bottoms and the rail cars without raising defendant lease rate.because of this work,defendant agreed to extend the lease start date from january,to march.
while plaintiff and defendant were working through the mechanical issues regarding the rail cars,they were negotiating a written lease.on november,dillon sent plaintiff defendant requested changes to the standard,lease and rider.on december,after reviewing these proposed changes,plaintiff sent dillon a revised lease incorporating a number of those requested changes which were acceptable to plaintiff.dillon and connolly spoke over the telephone concerning the december,lease revisions.in of,defendant learned that the public utility of new hampshire,bow terminal,was not renewing its contract with defendant and,consequently,that the rail cars that defendant leased from gatx at the rate of per car per month for coal transportation to the public utility would become available on december.according to plaintiff,when defendant learned that rail cars were available at a cheaper lease rate from gatx,defendant no longer desired to lease the rail cars from plaintiff and,thus,frustrated and then unilaterally terminated its lease negotiations with plaintiff.to accomplish this alleged end,dillon faxed a letter dated december,to plaintiff stating 
on two occasions,consol has had phone conversations with the andersons to elaborate on one another positions rectifying some points but leaving consol with the impression that the andersons will not acceptably alter or remove several provisions to which consol will not agree.
if this impression is correct,we need to recognize this fact,part company and go our separate ways.if this impression is not correct,we need to come to agreement by december.
on december,connolly faxed dillon a revised version of the lease,incorporating additional changes,but not all of those that defendant requested.after being unable to reach dillon to discuss these revisions,connolly left dillon a message that the department was closing at noon on december,but provided his home phone number so that dillon could reach him.on december,after pm,dillon left a message in connolly voice mail that a deal no longer existed due to plaintiff december,version of the lease that left several of its provisions still in dispute.four of the lease provisions that defendant disputed involved approval tax liability indemnification,property and liability insurance,and change in defendant ownership.according to plaintiff,defendant fabricated these issues,which should not have been in dispute at all,by misrepresenting and withholding facts so as to frustrate any reasonable chance to reach agreement between the parties.

in diversity cases,the district court is to apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the court sits.klaxon stentor.the district court held that ohio law governs plaintiff claims.plaintiff does not appeal this determination.
unjust enrichment 
to recover for unjust enrichment under ohio law,a plaintiff must prove that the plaintiff conferred a benefit upon the defendant the defendant knew of such benefit and the defendant retained the benefit under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.obert,ohio app d.the plaintiff must show that the substantial benefit to the defendant is causally related to the substantial detriment to the plaintiff.gaier midwestern group,ohio app d.in determining whether a defendant received an unjust or unconscionable benefit,we must consider whether the defendant was the party responsible for the plaintiff detrimental position.health practices,blake,wl,at ohio app.march,holding that the plaintiff responsibility for his detrimental position breaks the requisite causal connection between the defendant benefit and the plaintiff loss.the doctrine of unjust enrichment provides an equitable remedy imposed to prevent injustice.giles hanning,wl,at ohio app.may.thus,the plaintiff must show enrichment that is unjust.id.it is insufficient for the plaintiff to prove merely that he conferred a benefit upon the defendant.katz banning,ohio app d.rather,the plaintiff must prove that,under the circumstances,the plaintiff has a superior equity so that,as against the plaintiff,it would be unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiff claims that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether plaintiff conferred the benefit of securing the pepco contract on defendant when plaintiff gave defendant a lease rate for rail cars because defendant needed that rate to calculate its pepco bid and plaintiff has superior equity rendering defendant retention of that benefit unconscionable because defendant had declined plaintiff request for defendant to inspect the rail cars in indiana plaintiff,at defendant request,sent some of the rail cars to altoona,pennsylvania,for repair plaintiff picked up the defendant representatives in pittsburgh in its chartered airplane so that defendant could conduct its requested inspection in altoona and,lastly,plaintiff,per defendant demands,agreed to bolt the bottom of and the rail cars without raising defendant lease undertaking that cost.in short,plaintiff argues consol took andersons lease rate and negotiated a sales contract for coal with pepco,then dumped andersons when it learned it could lease rail cars for a cheaper rate,leaving consol with a windfall of profit and andersons with a pile of damages.
even taking all of plaintiff factual allegations as true,we find that plaintiff unjust enrichment claim fails as a matter of law.assuming arguendo that defendant ability to secure the pepco bid were a cognizable benefit that plaintiff had conferred on defendant by giving it a lease rate,plaintiff has not demonstrated the requisite causal connection between this benefit and any alleged detriment to plaintiff.rather,the only detriment that plaintiff establishes is the expenses that it incurred in preparing to lease its rail cars to defendant yet,such a detriment stems from defendant failure ultimately to enter into a lease agreement with plaintiff,not from defendant use of plaintiff tendered lease rate in its pepco bid.if,after plaintiff had incurred these expenses,defendant had actually entered into a lease agreement with plaintiff in executing its pepco contract,defendant use of plaintiff lease rate would not have harmed plaintiff.as the requisite causal chain between the alleged benefit that plaintiff conferred on defendant and plaintiff alleged detriment is absent,plaintiff unjust enrichment claim necessarily fails.alternatively,we note that it is hardly unconscionable or unjust for a company to secure a requirements contract by using the estimate that a supplier provided without compensating that supplier for such an estimate.see holt v.a e,a subcontractor to which a general contractor did not award a bid is not entitled to compensation in quantum meruit for its efforts in assisting that general contractor prepare a price on a negotiated project because it would unfairly hamstring general contractors and owners in their negotiation of contracts and their solicitation of subcontractors proposals rather,the subcontractor efforts are merely an attempt to obtain business and its incurred costs are merely costs of doing business that may or may not result in the subcontractor obtaining the contract.
promissory estoppel 
under ohio promissory estoppel doctrine,a promise that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and that does induce such action or forbearance is binding if one can avoid injustice only by enforcing the promise.mccrosky ohio,ohio,adopting restatement second of contracts internal quotation marks omitted.to establish a claim of promissory estoppel,the plaintiff must prove a promise,clear and unambiguous in its terms reliance on the promise by the party to whom the promise is made that the reliance was reasonable and foreseeable and that the party claiming estoppel was injured by the reliance.rigby fallsway equip,ohio app d,connolly malkamaki,wl,at ohio app.
as to the first element,plaintiff contends that,as of november,plaintiff and defendant had agreed that defendant would lease from plaintiff specified rail cars at a rate of per car per month,with defendant ability to end the lease after three years and with the anticipated lease start date of january,in support of this argument,plaintiff simply cites to dillon letter of intent,which plaintiff received on november,and which informs plaintiff of defendant intention to lease the cars under the terms.revealing the and uncertain outcome of such negotiations,however,dillon,in that same letter,states that defendant is in the process of reviewing plaintiff lease form and that defendant will provide its comments and suggestions for plaintiff consideration shortly.the intent letter explicitly conditions defendant entrance into a lease agreement on successful negotiation of a definitive lease agreement.the word successful means having the desired effect.webster third new international dictionary.thus,the broad and amorphous condition of successful negotiation would presumably allow defendant to abandon negotiations if defendant no longer desired to enter into a lease agreement with plaintiff.at that point,any negotiations with plaintiff would no longer have defendant desired effect.moreover,by the letter express terms,defendant need not have entered into a lease agreement with plaintiff if the proposed lease contained a term or condition that defendant senior management deemed unacceptable.the word definitive means serving to supply a final answer,solution,or evaluation and to end an unsettled,unresolved condition.webster at.the condition of a definitive lease agreement suggests that defendant intention to enter into the specified lease agreement,per the intent letter,was not yet settled,resolved,or was not,itself,the definitive lease agreement towards which the parties were to negotiate.because defendant intent letter,at a minimum,is ambiguous as to whether defendant promised to enter into a lease agreement with plaintiff,any such promise is not clear and unambiguous for purposes of promissory estoppel.
presumably,given this conditional,letter,plaintiff contends that defendant conduct created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant clearly and unambiguously promised to lease rail cars from plaintiff.as evidence,plaintiff asserts that it had to move the rail cars from storage to rail shops for repair and then into consol service so as to meet the lease starting date,and that plaintiff,in complying with defendant demands,used defendant preferred repair shop and made costly repairs,which plaintiff believed unnecessary.according to plaintiff,this reveals that consol did not act as if its promise to lease the rail cars from andersons was conditional until consol did not need to consummate the lease with andersons.yet,in its brief,plaintiff argues that it relied on defendant promise in beginning to prepare the rail cars for lease by moving,and storing the rail incurred injury via such reliance.however,plaintiff submission to defendant demands can not serve as the requisite clear and unambiguous promise on which plaintiff relied in submitting to such demands in the first place as,following that logic,plaintiff alleged reliance would precede any such promise.alternatively,defendant demands that plaintiff bolt and the rail cars and that plaintiff use defendant preferred repair shop can not constitute a clear and unambiguous promise that defendant would enter into a lease agreement with plaintiff,especially given the context of the conditional letter of intent expressly disclaiming any such per se promise.rather,such demands simply reflect that the parties were,in fact,in the process of negotiating toward their possible entrance into a lease agreement.for example,in demanding that plaintiff bolt and the rail cars,defendant was simply setting out the minimum physical requirements that any rail cars must meet for defendant to desire to lease them.plaintiff had the choice of whether to accommodate defendant demands so as to generate good will further the execution of any definitive lease agreement.
plaintiff underscores that defendant sabotaged the parties lease negotiations so as to avail itself of the lower lease rate from gatx,and that defendant senior management did not genuinely find the lease terms unacceptable.this is tantamount to an argument that defendant,in promising to enter into the lease agreement subject only to specified conditions,thereby promised to negotiate in good faith and not to fabricate the existence of one of these conditions nullifying such entrance into the agreement.the district court rejected plaintiff claim of negotiations,upon which plaintiff claim for breach of commitments and understandings hinged,on the ground that plaintiff had not shown that ohio recognizes such a cause of action and that,in any event,plaintiff amended complaint did not allege such a claim.plaintiff did not appeal from the dismissal of that claim.consequently,we will not entertain plaintiff promissory estoppel claim sounding in negotiations,regardless of whatever merits it may have under ohio law.
even if we were to construe plaintiff promissory estoppel claim to be that,per the intent letter,defendant made a clear and unambiguous promise to enter into the lease agreement subject only to specified conditions and that those conditions never,in fact,occurred because pepco executed its contract and defendant senior management truthfully found acceptable the lease contested terms and conditions,such a promissory estoppel claim would still fail.in incurring preparatory expenses without securing defendant indemnification,plaintiff could not have reasonably relied on any promise by defendant to enter into a lease agreement subject only to specified conditions given the possibility that defendant senior management could have genuinely found unacceptable at least one term or condition that plaintiff would be unwilling to modify see nilavar osborn,ohio app d,concluding that where the defendant made a clear and unambiguous promise to submit a bid of employment to a hospital on behalf of plaintiff and other doctors,plaintiff,as a matter of law,did not reasonably rely on the defendant submission of the bid given that the bid might have been rejected csx,occidental chem,d,granting summary judgment for plaintiff as no genuine issue of reasonable reliance existed.
intentional negligent misrepresentation 
the law of misrepresentation protects a plaintiff interest in formulating business judgments without being misled by others into making unwise decisions that result in financial loss.carpenter ins.agency,ohio app d.to establish a claim for intentional under ohio law,the plaintiff must show 
a a representation or,where there is a duty to disclose,concealment of a fact,b which is material to the transaction at hand,c made falsely,with knowledge of its falsity,or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred,d with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,e justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment,and f a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.

plaintiff contends that defendant made certain misrepresentations and omissions that were critical to the lease transactions between the parties.plaintiff clarifies that such misrepresentations were material to the lease negotiations.as damages resulting from defendant alleged misrepresentations and omissions,plaintiff points to its lost profit or rental income as well as the costs of travel,resheeting the rail cars to satisfy defendant requirements,freight and switching to move the rail cars to the repair facilities,and storage of the rail cars as a result of defendant failure to enter into the lease.
first,plaintiff claims that defendant failed to disclose that defendant had received verbal approval to run the rail cars on the railroad where the rail cars were to be in service.according to plaintiff,defendant wanted to delete the lease provision that required defendant to obtain such approval.yet,plaintiff took the position that,although plaintiff was responsible for the rail cars mechanical conditions,only defendant,not plaintiff,was able to demonstrate to the railroad granting approval that defendant had track storage capacity for rail necessary requirement for obtaining and retaining approval.plaintiff claims that,in any event,defendant had obtained verbal approval from the railroad before defendant unilaterally terminated lease negotiations with plaintiff.however,even assuming that defendant failed to inform plaintiff that defendant had received verbal approval where it had a duty to do so,plaintiff negligent intentional misrepresentation claims concerning such an omission necessarily fail.plaintiff intentional misrepresentation claim can not lie because plaintiff has not shown that plaintiff ever relied on defendant alleged omission concerning approval.per plaintiff own concession,at issue is defendant unreasonable refusal to accept plaintiff proposed lease language concernin
