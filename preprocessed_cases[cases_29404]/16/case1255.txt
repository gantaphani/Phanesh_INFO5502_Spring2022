in this appeal,we primarily consider whether certain and disability benefits plans provided by an employer unambiguously confer discretionary authority on the plan administrator,requiring judicial review of the administrator benefits determinations under an standard.
upon our review,we conclude that the language at issue in both plans is ambiguous and does not clearly confer discretionary authority on the plan administrator.therefore,we hold that the administrator eligibility determinations denying benefits to a covered employee are subject to de novo judicial review,and that the district court erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.we further hold that the district court erred in concluding that the employer group insurance plan requires objective proof of disability in order for an employee to qualify for plan benefits.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
beth cosey was employed as a senior clinical marketing manager for biomerieux,a large medical diagnostics company.biomerieux has a group insurance contract with the prudential insurance company of america prudential,which acts as claims administrator for disability std and disability ltd benefits under employee welfare benefits plans collectively,the benefits plans issued by prudential.cosey was a participant in the std and ltd benefits plans.under both plans,a participating employee is entitled to disability benefits if she is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of her regular occupation due to her sickness or injury emphasis omitted.
near the end of may,cosey did not report for work and submitted a claim for disability benefits,citing fatigue,hypotension,weight loss,and sleep apnea prudential initially approved cosey claim and allowed benefits covering about a period,after which prudential determined that cosey had presented insufficient evidence of an impairment preventing her from performing the material and substantial duties of her regular occupation.biomerieux eventually terminated cosey employment in june,and cosey filed a civil action in federal court to recover std and ltd benefits.
biomerieux cosey in august,allowing her to work from home and assigning her to a limited travel schedule.several months later,biomerieux and cosey reached a settlement agreement in cosey lawsuit.
in march,after cosey had been working at biomerieux in a limited capacity for about seven months,cosey took unscheduled leave and filed another claim for disability benefits.in support of her claim,cosey complained of fatigue,sleep disorder,fibromyalgia,dysautonomia,myoclonus,and dizziness.prudential initially approved cosey claim and paid her std benefits for about seven weeks.
cosey consultations with various physicians produced varying medical opinions with regard to her condition.for instance,cosey initially was evaluated for overwhelming fatigue by a primary care physician in may,but that physician noted that cosey had n o established.later that month,a different doctor diagnosed cosey with hypersomnia despite her normal sleep at night,an essential tremor that was currently asymptomatic,and chronic disequilibrium despite there being no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.
further consultations yielded similarly inconclusive impressions.a neurologist diagnosed cosey with sleep apnea,but stated that the disorder was not severe enough to explain the degree of day time sleepiness.an endocrinologist remarked that cosey had lost more than thirty pounds in six months,but also noted that cosey had improved over the last few months of that period and was spontaneously getting better.
although cosey reported experiencing dizziness,fatigue,and tremors,one neurologist stated that an examination of cosey was relatively unremarkable after a near complete workup,and a neuropsychologist stated that there are not suggestions of neurocognitive impairment.a cardiologist reported that cosey had experienced a temporary drop in blood pressure,but opined that she otherwise was in normal cardiovascular condition.cosey initially told the cardiologist that she was experiencing overwhelming fatigue,but later told the same doctor that she was able to play golf on the weekends,and was no longer having the dizziness or lightheaded episodes.
on the basis of this mixed record,the various physicians reached different conclusions about cosey ability to return to work.in support of cosey claim for disability benefits,cosey primary care physician opined that t here is no occupation that cosey can sustain at this time and i deem her condition permanent.also,cosey chiropractor thought that cosey suffered from a structural deficit in her cervical spine and doubted whether cosey could handle the everyday needs of work.
in contrast,four medical reviewers hired by prudential studied cosey patient records and concluded that cosey test results did not support a finding of impairment,that there was no medical explanation for cosey symptoms,and that cosey condition did not preclude her from engaging in work.additionally,prudential hired a company to conduct surveillance of cosey,which revealed that cosey had opened a business in myrtle beach,south carolina,less than one month after she most recently had stopped working for biomerieux.also,cosey was observed outside her house standing,walking,bending,entering and exiting a vehicle and driving.
on may,prudential notified cosey that it would not authorize further payments unless cosey submitted additional medical information supporting her continued disability.cosey did not timely submit additional evidence in response to that request.prudential informed cosey that it had determined that the evidence of her claimed impairment was insufficient,and that,therefore,she was not entitled to further std benefits.
cosey filed an administrative appeal of prudential termination of her std benefits,but the plan administrator upheld the earlier decision and also declared cosey ineligible for ltd benefits.cosey retained counsel and filed a second administrative appeal,requesting reconsideration of both decisions.the plan administrator again upheld its earlier determinations,stating its finding that cosey symptoms are out of proportion to the medical evidence.
after exhausting her administrative remedies,cosey filed the present civil action against prudential and biomerieux.the district court applied an standard of review to prudential denial of ltd and std benefits.the court held that the plan administrator decisions did not constitute an abuse of discretion,and that cosey had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact for the court determination.the court alternatively held that even applying a de novo review standard,the court would still find that cosey failed to meet the definition of disability under the benefits plans.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of prudential and biomerieux,and cosey timely filed the present appeal.
before considering the district court award of summary judgment,we first must determine whether the district court employed the appropriate standard of review in examining the plan administrator denial of ltd and std disability benefits.we consider the ltd and std benefits plans in turn.
the ltd benefits plan before us is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,through.in the erisa context,courts conduct de novo review of an administrator denial of benefits unless the plan grants the administrator discretion to determine a claimant eligibility for benefits,in which case the administrator decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also williams metro.life ins,cir.
this court explained in gallagher reliance standard life insurance that no specific words or phrases are required to confer discretion,but that a grant of discretionary authority must be clear,cir see also sandy reliance standard life ins,cir neither the parties nor the courts should have to divine whether discretion is conferred.we further have stated that any ambiguity in an erisa plan is construed against the drafter of the plan,and it is construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured.gallagher,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the ltd plan administered by prudential states that benefits only will be paid to a claimant who submit s proof of continuing disability satisfactory to prudential emphasis added.prudential and biomerieux collectively,prudential argue that under our decision in gallagher,we are required to determine that this language in the ltd plan unambiguously confers discretion on the plan administrator.we disagree.
in gallagher,we observed that plan language requiring a claimant to submit satisfactory proof of t otal d isability to us was ambiguous,and could be interpreted as requiring either an objective or a subjective standard for determining whether a claimant proof was satisfactory.id.emphasis added.therefore,we held that the plan language did not clearly convey that the plan administrator had discretionary authority in deciding benefits claims.id.at.
in explaining our decision in gallagher,we provided an example of a subjective standard different from the language at issue in that case.we noted hypothetically that a requirement that a claimant submit proof that is satisfactory to the plan administrator would refer to proof that the administrator finds subjectively satisfactory,and would occasion review.id.at.however,because the language provided in the above hypothetical example was not before us for decision in gallagher,we hold that our discussion of that language was dictum and does not bind our consideration of the plan language before us.accordingly,we consider as a matter of first impression whether the phrase proof satisfactory to the plan administrator unambiguously confers discretionary authority on a plan administrator.
we observe that five of our sister circuits recently have held that this language does not unambiguously confer such discretionary authority.in fact,earlier this year the first circuit followed the seventh circuit example in departing from its own precedent to join a growing consensus of circuit courts that require stricter clarity in plan language before insulating insurance companies from full judicial review.see gross sun life assurance of,wl,at cir,diaz prudential ins.of,cir see also viera life ins.of,cir feibusch integrated device.emp.benefit plan,cir kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.
we agree with the conclusions reached by our five sister circuits.three major themes pervade the opinions of those courts and are relevant to our analysis.we consider the inherent ambiguity in the wording of the phrase proof satisfactory to us the likelihood that such language will fail to provide sufficient notice to employees that their disability claims will be subject to a plan administrator discretionary determination and the responsibility of insurance companies to draft clear plan language.
first,we conclude that the phrase proof satisfactory to us is inherently ambiguous.as the second circuit has explained,such language could be construed as simply stating the truism that the administrator is the who initially must be persuaded that benefits should be paid before any amounts actually are paid.see kinstler,at.or,as the first,third,and seventh circuits have observed,the phrase could be interpreted as describing the inevitable prerogative of a plan administrator to insist that the form of proof complies with prescribed standards,on the theory that an administrator ought to be able to require production of particular types of proof that the administrator deems most reliable.diaz,at,e very plan requires submission of documentary proof,and the administrator is entitled to insist on one form of proof over another.citations omitted see also viera,at in other words,it is not clear whether satisfactory to us means proof of loss in a form satisfactory to us or proof of loss substantively and subjectively satisfactory to us.brackets in original gross,wl,at explaining that satisfactory to us wording reasonably may be understood to state an administrator right to insist on certain forms of proof rather than confer discretionary authority over benefits claims.similarly,the phrase could mean that the plan administrator is entitled to require that the quantum of proof meets some objective standard that the administrator ultimately has no power to change.kearney standard ins,cir.
another possible reading,of course,is that the evidence must comply with the plan administrator subjective notions of eligibility,disability,or other terms in the plan.diaz,at.from this perspective,the administrator would be vested not only with the power to insist on proof in a certain form or quantum,but also with the discretion to interpret the rules,to implement the rules,and even to change them entirely.id.
in view of the ambiguity of this plan language,a decision here in favor of prudential would violate our requirement of clear plan language that expressly creates discretionary authority.feder paul revere life ins,cir gross,wl,at requiring an administrator to offer more than subtle inferences drawn from such unrevealing language to support the administrator claim of discretionary authority.thus,we can not accord prudential such an expansive inference regarding its plan administrator authority.
the second reason for our conclusion that the phrase proof satisfactory to us does not confer discretion on an administrator involves the notice function of plan language.we identified this notice function as an important consideration in gallagher,in which we held in part that a plan did not clearly confer discretion because such a construction of the plan language would not be an insured employee most likely interpretation of that language.at.
we are concerned that insured employees who read prudential ambiguous plan language are not given sufficient notice whether their plan administrator has broad,unchanneled discretion to deny claims.diaz,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.it is critical that employees understand the broad range of a plan administrator authority because of the impact that this information can have on employees own decisions.for instance,as the seventh circuit has noted,employees may choose a particular employer based on their understanding of the insurance benefits provided by that employer,including whether any award of benefits is subject to a plan administrator discretionary authority.see id.at s ome may prefer the certainty of plans that do not confer discretion on administrators,while others may think that the lower costs that are likely to attend plans with reserved discretion are worth it.
additionally,without clear language notifying employees that an administrator denial of benefits is insulated from plenary judicial review,employees who file claims for benefits may not be fully aware of the gravity of administrative proceedings or the necessity of developing as complete a record as possible early in the claims process.even a claimant decision whether to be represented by counsel in administrative proceedings can be affected if the claimant is aware that once administrative avenues of appeal are exhausted,federal courts will review the administrator determinations under a highly deferential legal standard 
the third basis for our conclusion that the phrase proof satisfactory to us is insufficient to confer discretion on a plan administrator is the principle that ambiguities in an erisa plan must be construed against the administrator responsible for drafting the plan.see gallagher,at.as the first circuit recently observed,it is not difficult to craft clear language granting discretion to a plan administrator.gross,wl,at see also feibusch,at same kinstler,at counseling courts to decline to search in semantic swamps for arguable grants of discretion given the ease in drafting clear language.
we acknowledge that no magic words are required to ensure discretionary,rather than de novo,judicial review of a plan administrator decision.gallagher,at.however,we also agree with the first circuit observation that drafters of erisa plans have had every opportunity to avoid adverse rulings on this issue,especially in ligh
