sucampo pharmaceuticals,appellant or sucampo appeals the dismissal of its breach of contract claims against astellas pharma,appellee or astellas on the basis of a clause contained in the parties licensing agreement.because we find that the safety agreement under which sucampo sued was at least incidental to the licensing agreement,and thus governed by the clause requiring sucampo to bring suit in japan,we affirm the decision of the district court.
the immediate relationship between the parties dates back to,when a corporate predecessor to sucampo signed an agreement development agreement with a corporate predecessor of astellas.the development agreement concerned sucampo development and testing of a drug based on astellas compound.the development agreement was written in japanese and executed in japan,but did not contain a clause.the development agreement contained a provision mandating that the parties agree to guidelines for the exchange of safety information relating to.later in,the parties executed an agreement relating to the exchange of safety information.this agreement was executed under the development agreement,contained detailed terms dictating the exchange of information relating to,and was effective until the termination of the development agreement,unless otherwise agreed.
in,the parties executed another agreement basic agreement with respect to the continued development and commercialization of.like the development agreement,the basic agreement contained a provision mandating that the parties develop guidelines for the exchange of safety information.in addition,the basic agreement provided that a s for each item to be developed and commercialized in accordance with this agreement,the parties shall separately enter into an individual agreement pursuant to the provisions hereof as a basis.the basic agreement contained a japanese provision and a provision governing t his agreement and specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of the japanese courts.
following the execution of the basic agreement,the parties executed a new agreement concerning the exchange of safety information safety agreement.the safety agreement provided that it was executed u nder the basic agreement,and was intended to provide a general guide for the safety information exchange on the compound between the parties.the term of the safety agreement unless otherwise agreed upon between the parties was until the termination for whatever reason of the basic agreement.the safety agreement did not contain either a or provision.
in,the parties executed a license agreement basic license agreement and agreed that the total legal relationship between them with respect to this compound shall be governed by this agreement.the basic license agreement contained a provision regarding the exchange of safety information,which provided that the parties shall enter into an agreement concerning the exchange of such safety information through separate discussion.following the execution of the basic license agreement,the parties continued to exchange safety information under the protocols specified by the safety agreement.the basic license agreement contained a provision specifying japanese law and a clause specifying that a ny dispute in relation to this agreement or any agreement incidental hereto be brought in osaka,japan.
in,wishing to make certain changes with respect to the manufacture of any codeveloped drugs,the parties executed a successor agreement to the basic license agreement amended basic license agreement,which was identical in all relevant respects,but was drafted in english and changed the exclusive forum for suit to tokyo,japan.
on february,the united states food and drug administration fda issued two alerts regarding a link between cancer and the use of protopic,a drug marketed by astellas,and containing.the following day,the fda pediatric advisory committee advisory committee recommended that protopic carry a black box warning about the potential cancer risk.prior to the february meeting of the advisory committee,astellas sent a background document regarding protopic to the committee.there is no indication in the record that astellas informed sucampo about the document sent to the advisory committee.on march,the fda adopted the advisory committee recommendation and required that protopic carry a black box warning.the fda also issued a public health advisory concerning protopic potential cancer link.sucampo subsequently suspended development of its ophthalmologic product containing.
on march,sucampo brought a breach of contract action against astellas,alleging that astellas had breached the safety agreement by failing to disclose the fda concerns over protopic and,as a result of such failure,sucampo suffered serious damages relating to the development of products based on.astellas filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of federal rule of civil procedure b,and.astellas based its b and objections on the clause contained in the amended basic license agreement.astellas argued that the safety agreement was at the very least considered incidental to the amended basic license agreement,therefore sucampo claims were subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of tokyo,japan,and the district court either lacked subject matter jurisdiction or was an improper venue.in addition,astellas argued that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over astellas.
on november,without ruling on the personal jurisdiction objection,the district court held that the safety agreement was incidental to the amended basic license agreement and granted astellas motion to dismiss on the basis of the clause in the amended basic license agreement.this appeal followed.
this circuit has not decided the appropriate treatment of a motion to dismiss based on a clause.see,in re millennium studios,there is currently no procedural mechanism specifically tailored to handle a motion to dismiss based on a clause.the fourth circuit has not decided the issue of what approach to take and which subsection of rule b is most appropriate for the situation.other circuits have characterized such motions as motions under.b,or.see,silva encyclopedia britannica,cir treating motion to dismiss based on clause as a rule b motion to dismiss lipcon underwriters at lloyd,london,cir holding that motions to dismiss based on clause should be analyzed under rule b avc nederland atrium inv.cir affirming dismissal of action under rule b on basis of clause.
the district court dismissed sucampo complaint on the basis of the clause contained in the amended basic license agreement before resolving appellee motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.accordingly,we must resolve whether a dismissal based on a agreement is under rule b,because the dismissal of a case on an issue relating to the merits of the dispute,such as failure to state a claim,is improper without resolving threshold issues of jurisdiction,including personal jurisdiction.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d personal jurisdiction is an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district court,without which the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.quoting employers reinsurance bryant.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir the validity of an order of a federal court depends upon that court having jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the parties.internal quotation marks omitted.
to analyze a motion to dismiss based on a clause under rule b,a court must engage the legal fiction that the clause affects the power of the court to adjudicate the dispute.see bremen zapata,d the argument that clauses are improper because they tend to oust a court of jurisdiction is hardly more than a vestigial legal fiction.lipcon,at t he basis upon which the defendants seek,that the agreement of the parties prohibits the plaintiff from bringing suit in the particular unrelated to the actual basis of federal subject matter,federal question jurisdiction or diversity of citizenship,as the case may be.
in addition to this theoretical incongruence,treating a motion to dismiss on the basis of a clause under rule b presents practical difficulties that under
