oxford aviation oxford is a corporation that refurbishes and repairs aircraft in oxford,maine.in late,oxford contracted with airlarr,a pennsylvania corporation,for oxford to perform various repairs and installations on airlarr airplane the work was estimated to cost close to.airlarr picked up its airplane from oxford facility in january after oxford finished its work,and flew it back to pennsylvania.
in march,airlarr sued oxford in maine superior court for breach of contract,breach of express and implied warranties,and other claims.the complaint alleged that one of the plane side windows cracked during the flight home due to oxford negligence and faulty performance,and also listed in a separate paragraph a slew of defects and other substandard work,including uncomfortable seats,leaking fuel injectors,a cracked turbocharger,and an improperly installed carpet.the complaint included as an exhibit an estimate sheet representing the specific tasks undertaken by oxford for airlarr.
oxford then notified global aerospace global an insurance company that had issued oxford a commercial general liability cgl policy that it had been sued,and requested that global defend it.global disclaimed both coverage and any duty to defend oxford filed suit in state court in maine requesting a declaratory judgment that global was required to defend it in airlarr suit.oxford also alleged breach of contract and unfair claims settlement practices,me.stat.ann.tit.a,a.
asserting diversity jurisdiction,global removed the case to federal district court.both parties filed summary judgment motions,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of global.oxford aviation,global aerospace,d.without deciding whether the claims were within the general coverage provisions of the policy,the district court held that no duty to defend existed because airlarr claims fell within listed policy exclusions,most of which barred or limited insurance for damage relating to the insured repairs and work id.at.
oxford appealed to this court.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,and while factual inferences are drawn in favor of oxford,mandel bos.phoenix,cir,the issues on which this case turns are legal rather than factual.the main issues the scope of an insurer duty to defend and the proper interpretation of the insurance contract are both governed by maine law.as various cgl policies issued by different insurers often employ standard language,precedent from other jurisdictions may be considered where maine law is not definitive.baywood me.bonding cas,me.
the insurer duty to defend is ordinarily broader than its duty to indemnify.penney capitol city transfer,me.in maine,the insurer must defend so long as the claims in the complaint create even a remote possibility of coverage.me.bonding cas.douglas dynamics,me.the complaint need only disclose a potential for liability within the coverage and contain no allegation of facts which would necessarily exclude coverage.travelers indem.dingwell,me.the duty to defend exists even if only one of the claims stated satisfies this test.mitchell allstate ins,me.
although the district court largely bypassed the issue of initial coverage and relied primarily on the exclusions,oxford aviation,d at,global argues on appeal that lack of coverage also negates any duty to defend.coverage provisions broadly delineate the risk or risks insured against the exclusions carve out exceptions that qualify coverage.global is entitled to defend a judgment on any adequately preserved ground that supports that judgment even if the district judge ignored or rejected that ground.haley city of boston,cir.
the policy at issue insured oxford for liability based on claims arising between may,and may,and oxford asserts coverage under two of the four coverage provisions.coverage a,the principally relevant one of the two,applies to claims for bodily injury or property damage resulting from your aviation operations.it applies only if the injury or damage is caused by an occurrence and takes place in the coverage territory.property damage is defined to include p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property,and an o ccurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.
global argues that coverage a does not apply because airlarr complaint can not be read to allege property damage that is caused by an occurrence.some courts have read the commonly used terms property damage,accident or occurrence to exclude faulty workmanship by the insured entity,while others have looked instead to exclusions,common in cgl policies and present in global policy here,that are specifically directed to faulty workmanship.am.home assurance agm marine contractors,cir describing case law see also sheehan constr.cont l cas.neither party has cited a maine case directly in point.
perhaps common parlance might not describe an uncomfortable seat one of the problems alleged by airlarr as an accident,but a sudden unintended crack in a plane window fits comfortably within that term.in all events,maine construes coverage terms like accident or occurrence generously,me.mut.fire ins.gervais,me vigna allstate ins,me,in contrast to courts that rely on such terms to exclude coverage for faulty workmanship,lyerla amco ins,cir essex ins.holder,per curiam.
thus,in peerless insurance brennon,me,builders sued for faulty construction asked the insurer to defend and it refused,saying there was no duty to defend because the damages were not caused by an occurrence and also because certain exclusions applied.id.at.in deciding whether or not a duty to defend existed,the maine court focused its analysis exclusively on the applicability of the exclusions,and termed that t he principal question in the case.id.at.
further,the court quoted favorably from a dissent in a prior maine case whose majority decision peerless overruled,suggesting that at least certain kinds of harm from faulty workmanship could come within the coverage of a cgl policy and even avoid its exclusions 
if a contractor performs unsatisfactory work,repair or replacement of the faulty work is a business expense for which insurance coverage is not provided.conversely,if the faulty work causes an accident resulting in physical damage to others,coverage is afforded and the exception to exclusion a liability assumed by the insured under a contract preserves coverage even if the claim is based upon a warranty theory.
we conclude that at least the damage to the plane side window is within this coverage provision of the policy,and if the duty to defend in this case is negated,this would have to be because of the exclusions.
in determining the duty to defend,the five exclusions invoked by global must be read against the complaint allegations of harm and asserted causes of action,and global bears the burden of demonstrating their applicability.patrons oxford ins.harris,me.much of the damage may have occurred during the period when oxford had possession of the plane and so be barred by exclusion j,which excludes from coverage p roperty damage to p ersonal property in the care,custody or control of the insured.
but while uncomfortable seats and an improperly installed carpet almost surely had to occur while oxford was in control of the plane,the crack in the window as alleged in the complaint just as surely falls outside that exclusion.and it is enough to preserve the duty to defend so far as this exclusion is concerned that the exclusion can not apply to the cracked window since the crack occurred when airlarr had reclaimed the plane.thus,we need not tarry over other listed harms in airlarr complaint,such as the leaking fuel injectors or cracked turbocharger 
we turn then to four exclusions that focus primarily on excluding or limiting insurer coverage for business risk these are included in cgl policies for the express purpose of excluding coverage for risks relating to the repair or replacement of the insured faulty work or products,or defects in the insured work or product itself.russ et,couch on insurance.they reflect the
