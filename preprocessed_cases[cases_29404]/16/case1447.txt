appellee robert lee,an attorney,represented appellant sylvester griffin in the underlying lawsuit in this case,in which griffin sought reformation of a trust of which he was a beneficiary the trust.griffin also advanced various state law claims,including fraud,against defendants below,who included successor trustee jpmorgan chase bank,trustee,and its officers.after lee was allowed to withdraw from his representation of griffin,he sought recovery of attorney fees.lee filed a motion for leave to intervene under federal rule of civil procedure a and motion for additional conservatory relief.he sought imposition of a statutory lien upon griffin recovery,pursuant to a contingency fee agreement the agreement and louisiana revised statute.the district court granted the motion and permitted lee intervention.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of lee and against griffin on the petition of intervention,and awarded lee in attorney fees based on the agreement.because we find that the district court lacked supplemental jurisdiction over lee claim in intervention against griffin,we vacate and remand with instructions that the district court dismiss the petition of intervention for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
factual and procedural background 
griffin originally brought this action in louisiana state court,by filing his petition for fraud and unjust enrichment and for return of monies on or about august.defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana,monroe division,on september,based solely on the court diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.on april,the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment and dismissed all of griffin claims against them with prejudice.the district court entered judgment in defendants favor on april.the same day,lee filed his motion to intervene.
on april,the district court granted lee motion to intervene.the district court concluded that lee was entitled to intervene as of right pursuant to rule a.lee filed his petition of intervention for attorney fee s and costs the same day.lee sought of all accrued but unpaid interest,dividends,growth,accumulated but undisbursed upon the principal amount deposited in the trust fund,of the initial principal endowment of placed in the trust,of any damages recovered by griffin against trustee or other parties for breach of trust or other fault,and in costs incurred.in his motion to intervene,lee calculated his attorney fees to be,in addition to the in costs incurred.
the district court initially enjoined the trustee from disbursing to griffin the sum of,the amount which lee claimed as attorney fees and costs in his motion to intervene.on april,at the conclusion of a preliminary injunction hearing,the district court granted lee motion for preliminary injunction and ordered the trustee not to disburse of the amount in trust pending final adjudication of lee petition of intervention.the court scheduled a bench trial on the merits of lee petition for june.
for reasons not germane to the district court jurisdiction,neither griffin nor his new attorney appeared at the june,bench trial.the district court entered judgment on july,in favor of lee and against griffin,in the amount of,with legal interest from the date of judgment,in the form of a privilege on the funds in the trust.the judgment directed that the trustee shall hold and conserve said monies as a debit item upon the trust and pay said monies from the trust to lee out of the funds ultimately determined to be available for distribution to griffin upon finality of griffin appeal of his claims against defendants.the judgment also ordered that,per the contract for legal fees entered into by lee and griffin,lee holds a privilege on future funds,if any,paid by defendants to griffin for damages suffered by griffin.griffin appealed.though he does not dispute that lee is owed some fees for his work in successfully having the trust reformed,griffin disputes the amount awarded,and that any award should exist as a lien or encumbrance on the trust.
our review of this appeal raised the question of whether supplemental jurisdiction existed over lee claim in intervention pursuant to.we requested additional briefing from the parties on this point.lee and griffin have each filed supplemental briefs.

iii.analysis 
at the time this case was removed from state court,original jurisdiction in the underlying lawsuit was founded solely upon diversity,pursuant to.this statute provides,in relevant part,that 
a the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and is between 
citizens of different states 
a.thus,requires that the matter in controversy exceed,and that the action be between citizens of different states.see exxon mobil allapattah,d noting that the supreme court has consistently interpreted as requiring complete diversity.
at the time of removal,plaintiff griffin was a mississippi citizen.defendant jpmorgan chase was a citizen of both delaware and new york.defendant jp morgan chase bank,was a citizen of ohio,as was defendant bank one trust.the individual defendants,walter busby,drew detraz,and charlotte ray,were louisiana citizens.there was complete diversity of citizenship,and the record is clear that the amount in controversy exceeded,fulfilling the requirements of a.
the district court subsequently granted lee motion to intervene as of right,pursuant to rule a.lee was aligned as an intervenor plaintiff,as he asserted claims for attorney fees against his former client griffin,and further sought to impose a lien upon the trust.the record reflects that lee was a citizen of louisiana,and that the amount in controversy on his claim was clearly less than,as his initial pleadings sought only.
because lee was aligned as a plaintiff,the petition,on its face,was not consistent with the jurisdictional requirements of.complete diversity of citizenship was lacking between lee and defendants,and the amount in controversy was less than.the question presented is whether there was supplemental jurisdiction over lee claim.we conclude that there was not.
applicability of to lee claim 
if a district court has original jurisdiction over at least one claim in a case,it must look to what was traditionally known as pendent or ancillary jurisdiction to assess whether it has jurisdiction over any remaining claims over which it would otherwise lack original jurisdiction.see,city of chi.int l coll.of surgeons,d federal question context.congress has codified the concepts of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction in the supplemental jurisdiction statute.id.at congress has codified those principles in the supplemental jurisdiction statute,which combines the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction under a common heading.walter fuller aircraft sales,republic of,cir t he intent of a was to codify the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction.citations omitted.
lee argues in his supplemental brief that b is not applicable to his claim,because the suit was removed to the district court pursuant to a,and not directly pursuant to a.we are not persuaded by this argument.a provides for removal of certain actions,but it does not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the district cour
