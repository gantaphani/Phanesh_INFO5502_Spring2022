nano argued before the district court that canon breached the pla when it permitted sed to use the licensed patents.because of this breach,nano sought termination of the pla and damages based upon the value of a prospective license with sed the district court granted the former,and the jury denied the latter.canon argues here that the district court erred in its underlying finding of breach and in permitting nano to terminate the pla.specifically,canon argues that the district court erred by finding that sed was not a subsidiary of canon under the pla,such that sed was not entitled to use of the licensed patents sed use of the licensed patents was an impermissible sublicense constituting breach of the pla and nano was entitled to terminate the pla notwithstanding that the pla granted a perpetual and irrevocable license to canon.for the reasons explained below,we find assuming that canon breached the can not recover any of the relief it seeks,termination of the pla or damages based upon the value of a prospective license.accordingly,we assume,without deciding,that the district court properly found that sed was not a subsidiary of canon and canon breached the pla via an impermissible sublicense.we now turn to address the termination and damages issues.
