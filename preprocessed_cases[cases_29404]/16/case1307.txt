this action arises from the district court holding that certain disputes between alms and associates,incorporated and steven alms appellants and eric levin appellee were not subject to mandatory arbitration.following the filing of this appeal,appellants asked this court to stay the district court proceedings on the underlying claims pending resolution of the appeal.on september,we issued an interim order staying proceedings pending resolution of the motion.upon further consideration of the motion,for the reasons detailed below,we joined the majority of the circuits to have decided the issue in holding that the filing of the arbitrability appeal,as would be true of appeals generally,divested the district court of jurisdiction over the underlying claims.accordingly,on december,we issued an order extending the stay pending resolution of the appeal.having reviewed the merits of the appeal,we now hold that the district court erred in finding that the underlying claims were not subject to mandatory arbitration.
beginning in,appellants provided financial advisory services to appellee.in,and the parties entered into agreements referred to as cfo advisory agreements,which governed the advisory relationship and the payment of fees.
according to appellee,his relationship with appellants was plagued by irregularities.for example,he asserts that in early appellants advised him to invest more than in a land development company called silverdeer olde liberty,llc.that same year,appellants also advised appellee to invest in a related real estate venture known as silverdeer lakebound fixed return,llc.appellee alleges that,in so doing,appellants failed to disclose that they were paid consultants for the silverdeer entities and that they had an advising agreement with silverdeer under which they were entitled to receive in annual fees.appellee further alleges that there is reason to believe that appellants knew that silverdeer was having financial difficulties as early as.appellee br.at.appellee asserts that appellants neither informed him about the blatant conflict of interest nor disclosed silverdeer financial problems.id.
appellee also alleges that,from to,appellants received fees from a financial firm known as lydian wealth management in exchange for placing appellee investment account with that firm.according to appellee,the cfo agreements with appellants required them to fully disclose the commission to appellee and to reduce their yearly advising fees based on that commission.appellee asserts that appellants did not inform him about the commission and did not reduce their fees.finally,appellee alleges that,in,appellants misled him into giving them a loan that contained terms unfavorable to him.
in,appellee filed suit against appellants based on the allegations described.the complaint raised claims for negligence,negligent misrepresentation,violation of the investment advisers act of,and breach of contract.
appellants moved to dismiss the action or to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.they alleged that the cfo agreement with appellee dictated that any dispute between the parties would be submitted to binding arbitration.they further noted that the agreement also purported to encompass and embod y all terms,understandings and agreements by and between those parties.on that basis,appellants argued that all of appellee claims were subject to arbitration.
the district court ordered appellee to pursue any claims accrued after january,in arbitration,but found that the arbitration agreement did not cover the claims.the court reasoned that the arbitration clause in the agreement was not worded such that it would apply retroactively to claims accrued before the agreement was signed.
appellants filed a notice of appeal with this court and moved the district court to stay all proceedings pending appeal.the district court specifically found that the appeal was not frivolous.it nevertheless denied the motion in part,explaining 
plaintiff has a strong interest in avoiding delay of the ultimate resolution of the case.in addition,defendants certainly will not suffer undue prejudice from allowing proceedings in the instant case to continue,at least through discovery.moreover,in view of the apparent presence of threshold limitations issues pertaining to the claims,it would appear beneficial to all concerned to proceed expeditiously.
levin alms.filed,ecf.the district court therefore allowed discovery regarding plaintiffs claims to proceed.appellants petitioned this court to stay the proceedings.
on september,we issued a temporary order staying the proceedings pending resolution of the stay motion.we scheduled the motion and the merits of the case for oral argument on december.immediately following oral argument on the motion,we issued an order granting the motion and extending the interim stay pending resolution of the appeal,with the panel reasons to be explained in this opinion.
appellants assert that the filing of this appeal challenging the district court arbitrability decision divested that court of jurisdiction over the underlying claims.they further argue that the district court erred in holding that the cfo agreement did not bind the parties to arbitrate any claims that accrued prior to.we address each contention in turn.
as a general rule,the filing of an appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.griggs provident consumer disc,d.section a a of the federal arbitration act faa,a a,authorizes an appeal from a district court denial of a petition to stay an action pending arbitration under of that act appellants motion required us to decide whether the general rule applies in an appeal under a a to divest the district court of jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the underlying claims.the third,seventh,tenth,and eleventh circuits have held that an appeal regarding arbitrability of claims does divest the district court of jurisdiction over those claims,as long as the appeal is not frivolous.the second and ninth circuit have held that no such divestiture occurs.for the reasons explained below,we join the position adopted by the majority of the circuits.we first discuss the issue of divestiture and then examine the frivolousness exception.
the seminal case adopting the majority position is data physician computer network,cir.there the court held that a district court was automatically divested of jurisdiction by the filing of an appeal that alleged that the claims before the district court were subject to mandatory arbitration.id.at.the court explained that t he filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.id.quoting griggs,at.it further found that the underlying claims before the district court were necessarily involved in the appeal because w hether the case should be litigated in the district court is not an issue collateral to the question presented by an appeal under a a i t is the mirror image of the question presented on appeal.id.the court also noted that c ontinuation of proceedings in the district court largely defeats the point of the appeal and creates a risk of inconsistent handling of the case by two tribunals.id.finally,the court explained how the principles underlying arbitration supported its rationale 
arbitration clauses reflect the parties preference for dispute resolution,which may be faster and cheaper.these benefits are eroded,and may be lost or even turned into net losses,if it is necessary to proceed in both judicial and arbitral forums,or to do this sequentially immediate appeal under a helps to cut the loss from duplication.yet combining the costs of litigation and arbitration is what lies in store if a district court continues with the case while an appeal under a is pending.cases of this kind are therefore poor candidates for exceptions to the principle that a notice of appeal divests the district court of power to proceed with the aspects of the case that have been transferred to the court of appeals.
id.at.three other circuits have adopted the rationale.see ehleiter grapetree shores,cir mccauley halliburton energy,cir blinco greentree servicing,llc,cir.
the ninth circuit and the second circuit have taken the contrary view.in britton banking group,cir,the court found that the district court was not divested of jurisdiction,reasoning that because arbitrability was the only substantive issue presented in the appeal the claims before the district court were not the subject of the appeal.id.at.in motorola credit uzan,cir,the second circuit adopted the ninth circuit holding.see id.at we explicitly adopt the ninth circuit position that further district court proceedings in a case are not involved in the appeal of an order refusing arbitration,and that a district court therefore has jurisdiction to proceed with a case absent a stay from this court.
the courts adopting the majority position have expressly rejected the contrary rationale.the seventh circuit explained that although arbitrability is distinct from the merits of the litigation,an appeal under a a presents the question whether the district court must stay its own proceedings pending arbitration and therefore w hether the litigation may go forward in the district court is precisely what the court of appeals must decide,at.similarly,the eleventh circuit explained that t he only aspect of the case involved in an appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is whether the case should be litigated at all in the district court and thus t he issue of continued litigation in the district court is not collateral to the question presented by an appeal under a a.blinco,at.
we find the majority view persuasive.the core subject of an arbitrability appeal is the challenged continuation of proceedings before the district court on the underlying claims.therefore,because the district court lacks jurisdiction over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal,it must necessarily lack jurisdiction over the continuation of any proceedings relating to the claims at issue.griggs,at.that the present case involves only the continuation of discovery does not change that rationale.discovery is a vital part of the litigation process and permitting discovery constitutes permitting the continuation of the litigation,over which the district court lacks jurisdiction.see,at p reparation for trial must be suspended until the court of appeals renders a decision.furthermore,allowing discovery to proceed would cut against the efficiency and purposes of arbitration.see id.at blinco,at t he principal benefits of arbitration,avoiding the high costs and time involved in judicial dispute resolution,are lost if the case proceeds in both judicial and arbitral forums.also,allowing discovery to proceed could alter the nature of the dispute significantly by requiring parties to disclose sensitive information that could have a bearing on the resolution of the matter.if we later hold that the claims were indeed subject to mandatory arbitration,the parties will not be able to unring any bell rung by discovery,and they will be forced to endure the consequences of litigation discovery in the arbitration process.
the approach discussed above is subject to certain safeguards against frivolous appeals.as the ninth circuit noted in britton,it would be inadvisable to allow a defendant to stall a trial simply by bringing a frivolous motion to compel arbitration.at.for this reason,each of the circuits adopting the majority view has created a frivolousness exception to the divestiture of jurisdiction.the seventh circuit found that the frivolousness concern is met by the response that the appellee may ask the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal as frivolous or to affirm summarily,at.it further held that e ither the court of appeals or the district court may declare that the appeal is frivolous,and if it is the district court may carry on with the case.id.the tenth circuit elaborated on the mechanics of the frivolousness exception as follows 
u pon the filing of a motion to stay litigation pending an appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration,the district court may frustrate any litigant attempt to exploit the categorical divestiture rule by taking the affirmative step,after a hearing,of certifying the a appeal as frivolous or forfeited.that certification will prevent the divestiture of district court jurisdiction.appellant may then move this court for a stay pending appeal,asserting that the district court finding of frivolousness is not supported by the record.if this court determines that the appeal is not frivolous,we will stay the litigation in the district court pending the appeal of the denial of the motion to compel arbitration.
mccauley,at internal citations omitted see also ehleiter,at agreeing with the majority rule of automatic divestiture where the section a appeal is neither frivolous nor forfeited blinco,at when a litigant files a motion to stay litigation in the district court pending an appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration,the district court should stay the litigation so long as the appeal is.
we find the frivolousness safeguard as articulated by the tenth circuit to be not only sensible but also consistent with our approach in other areas of the law.for example,in the context,this court has recognized a dual jurisdiction rule,which allows a district court to proceed with trial while a defendant pursues a double jeopardy appeal,where the district court has concluded that the appeal is frivolous.united states montgomery,cir in recognizing this doctrine,we noted that it was not legally foreclosed by the divesture of jurisdiction rule because that rule is not based upon statutory provisions or the rules of civil or criminal procedure but rather is a judge made rule originally devised to avoid confusion or waste of time.id.at.the frivolousness exception adopted by the majority of the circuits is analogous to and consistent with this dual jurisdiction doctrine.
we therefore hold that an appeal on the issue of arbitrability automatically divests the district court of jurisdiction over the underlying claims and requires a stay of the action,unless the district court certifies the appeal as frivolous or forfeited.in the event that such certification occurs,the party alleging arbitrability may move this court to stay the district court proceedings pending a review of the frivolousness determination.given that the district court here specifically held that the appeal was not frivolous,a stay of the action during the pendency of this appeal was required.it is for these reasons that we granted appellants motion to stay the proceedings below,pending resolution of this appeal.
we turn now to the merits of this appeal.the issue before us is whether the district court erred in holding that the arbitration clause in the cfo advisory agreement did not apply to claims that accrued prior to january.we review de novo the district court conclusions regarding the arbitrability of the disputes.am.recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir.
whether a party has agreed to arbitrate an issue is a matter of contract interpretation a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.id.at quoting united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation,d.however,the supreme court has consistently encouraged a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.this federal policy is based on the faa,which establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.id.at.the heavy presumption of arbitrability requires that when the scope of the arbitration clause is open to question,a court must decide the question in favor of arbitration.peoples sec.life ins.monumental life ins,cir.it is through this lens that we must evaluate the languag
