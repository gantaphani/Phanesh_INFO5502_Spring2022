background 
delaney began working for boa predecessors in and continued to be employed by them through multiple mergers and acquisitions until his termination in september.at all relevant times,delaney remained an employee.from to,delaney worked in the high yield sales group in which he predominantly sold high yield products.his compensation included a base salary and,where applicable,an annual award of discretionary incentive compensation.
in,delaney was transferred to the fixed income middle markets sales group middle markets.although employees of this group were expected to sell a wider array of products and cover smaller accounts,delaney continued to sell the same high yield products.he also remained in the same physical location with other members of the high yield group.delaney,however,was assigned to a different reporting line and became eligible for compensation under the middle markets sales compensation plan whereby he received an annual salary and quarterly commission on the basis of his production credits.while working for middle markets,his commissions exceeded million in.that same year,delaney also received a rating of expectations on his annual performance review.
in march,delaney was transferred back to the high yield group.according to delaney,this transfer was a reward for his outstanding work developing middle markets accounts into higher revenue,institutional accounts.appellant br.delaney also claims that boa agreed that his compensation would not suffer from the transfer because he would be awarded sufficient accounts to generate production credits so that his compensation would remain at least level and,hopefully,increase.id.at.for boa,however,this transfer was the result of an institutional aimed at removing all high yield sales personnel from middle markets,which closed in.as a result of this transfer,although delaney remained in the same physical location and continued to manage the same accounts,his compensation reverted to the one associated with high yield employees,a base salary and,if eligible,a discretionary incentive compensation award.delaney also received two additional accounts upon his transfer.
in july,delaney received a negative performance review.according to the review,his production had decreased by seven percent,while the high yield group production as a whole had increased by twenty percent.the weaknesses cited included that he was a momentum sales man,who could improve his credit skills,had difficulty,should cover less accounts,and need ed to focus.the review also noted a concern as to whether delaney was able to handle the accounts assigned to him.
the following month,as part of a rif,high yield managers were instructed to select underperforming employees whose dismissal would have the least impact on the business going forward.delaney performance continued to suffer.he was ranked across all boa sales personnel for the year in september,and his performance in the high yield group was the worst of all employees at his level.delaney,along with other boa employees,was selected for inclusion in the september rif process.boa terminated delaney employment that same month.at the time,delaney was years old,the oldest member of the high yield group and the only member of that group to be terminated.
following his termination,delaney brought this employment discrimination action against boa,alleging claims of age discrimination in violation of the adea and breach of contract.with respect to the breach of contract claim,delaney alleges that boa breached an oral promise made to him that his compensation would not suffer from his transfer to the high yield group because he would be awarded sufficient accounts to generate production credits so that his compensation would remain at least level and,hopefully,increase.appellant br.boa moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted after determining that delaney failed to establish a prima facie age discrimination case.then assuming arguendo that delaney had established a prima facie case,the district court further ruled that delaney evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable to conclude that he would not have been terminated but for his age,and thus that he failed to establish that boa legitimate nondiscriminatory reason that delaney was terminated as part of a rif and selected based on his poor performance was a pretext for age discrimination.delaney bank of am,d.having dismissed delaney federal claim,the district court,pursuant to,exercised supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim and determined that none of the conversations and statements identified on the record constituted an enforceable contract.id.at.judgment was entered in favor of boa.delaney timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,delaney argues that in granting summary judgment in favor of boa,the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to him as the party.specifically,delaney contends that if the district court had properly applied this court decision in weiss jp moran chase,app x,cir summary order,to the proffered evidence,it would have concluded that boa legitimate nondiscriminatory reason lacked credence and was instead a pretext for age discrimination.delaney also challenges the district court decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his contract law claim and further contends that if the district court had properly considered the submitted evidence,it would have concluded that he had established a breach of contract claim against boa.
