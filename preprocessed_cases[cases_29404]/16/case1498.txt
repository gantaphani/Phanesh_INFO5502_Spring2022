this matter comes before us as a single case consolidated from appeals and.both appeals arise from the same underlying case and center on essentially the same concerns.accordingly,we address them together.in,wellons wellons appeals the district court determination that wellons failed to carry its burden of establishing admiral insurance company admiral duty to defend wellons under its commercial general liability policy policy.the district court declined to find a duty to defend,citing exclusion m of the policy.
in,admiral appeals the district court subsequent determination that admiral owed wellons a duty to indemnify under the policy.admiral contends that the district court erred in both finding coverage existed under the policy insuring clause and failing to apply any of a number of possible exclusions.
with respect to the duty to defend as appealed in,we find that the district court erred when it concluded that exclusion m eliminated admiral duty to defend.we conclude that admiral had a duty to defend in light of the language of the policy and the allegations of the underlying complaint.with respect to the duty to indemnify as set forth in,we agree with the district court analysis.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand in and affirm the judgment in.
factual and procedural background 
martco martco,a building product manufacturer,hired wellons,a manufacturer of boiler and energy systems,to design,fabricate and install certain improvements to its existing thermal oil heating system the wellons unit located in martco oriented strand board osb plant in le moyen,louisiana.the extent of this relationship was documented by a series of five contracts executed between martco and wellons.martco stated goal in hiring wellons was to increase the thermal oil output of its wellons unit.construction of the improvements commenced in late december with a planned shutdown of the osb plant.the work schedule developed by the parties called for the wellons unit to enter service and the osb plant to resume production on january.
numerous problems arose with the wellons unit following the january resumption of production.a new expansion tank installed by wellons imploded a circulation pump isolation valve failed fires developed in the dry bins a valve stem leaked more ash than anticipated was generated by the new wellons unit the computerized control system did not function properly and wires burnt off the thermocouples.martco later demonstrated at trial that it was unable to operate the wellons unit for certain periods of time after the january restart because of these failures.these shutdowns and periods of defective performance caused unplanned downtime for the entire osb plant.ultimately,martco inability to use the wellons unit resulted in lost production,profits,and business opportunities valued at.
martco subsequently filed suit against wellons.martco complaint stated six separate contractual claims against wellons.the merits of martco claims were tried and a jury returned a verdict for martco.we affirmed that judgment on march.see martco.wellons,cir.
before trial,wellons sought both defense and indemnity from admiral.in a letter,admiral refused defense and indemnity on the basis that the claims stated in martco complaint did not allege property damage caused by an occurrence within the applicable policy period.additionally,admiral cited numerous exclusions as foreclosing its duty to defend or indemnify wellons for any claims that may have been stated.the liability issues as between martco and wellons and the insurance issues as between wellons and admiral were bifurcated by court order before trial.
after trial on the underlying liability issues was completed,admiral filed a motion for summary judgment wherein it asserted that the policy did not provide indemnification for martco claims in the underlying suit.wellons,joined by martco,filed a arguing that the policy did provide indemnification for martco claims.the district court found that the policy required admiral to indemnify wellons for martco claims for lost productivity,earnings,and profits.admiral took the instant appeal on the question of indemnity under matter.
shortly thereafter,wellons and martco filed a joint motion for summary judgment on the issue of admiral duty to defend.admiral responded by claiming that there was no duty to defend under the policy because there was no property damage caused by an occurrence evident in the original martco complaint and because numerous exclusions applied.the district court found that there was property damage.without examining whether there was an occurrence,the court turned to exclusion m to determine whether the property damage alleged was excluded.it concluded that this exclusion applied such that admiral did not have a duty to defend wellons in the underlying suit.the duty to defend issue was timely appealed as matter.
ii.standard of review 
we apply louisiana substantive law when reviewing a district court ruling in a diversity action.foradori harris,cir citing erie tompkins.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.bolton city of dallas,cir.our inquiry is limited to the summary judgment record before the trial court.topalian ehrman,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d,and the movant has the burden of showing this court that summary judgment is appropriate,celotex catrett,d.summary judgment is appropriate where the competent summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.bolton,at see.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could enter a verdict for the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
iii.discussion 
an insurer duty to defend suits on behalf on an insured presents a separate and distinct inquiry from that of the insurer duty to indemnify a covered claim after judgment against the insured in the underlying liability case.elliott cont l cas,so d,citing am.home assurance czarniecki,so d,while factual inquiries beyond the complaint are prohibited with respect to the duty to defend,they are indispensable in assessing the duty to indemnify.assessing each duty requires analysis of different facts in the light of applicable controlling presumptions.accordingly,we will address each duty separately.
a.the duty to defend 
wellons appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment on the duty to defend raises two issues for review whether martco complaint alleged a potentially covered event triggering admiral duty to defend under the policy,and whether that alleged triggering event fell within an exclusion of the policy.the duty to defend analysis begins with an examination of whether any of the facts pleaded in the complaint possibly fall within matters covered under the insuring clause.the insured bears the burden on this point.see doerr mobil oil,so d,modified on other grounds,so d.if claims potentially covered under the insuring clause are pled,the insurer then has the burden of proving that the complaint states only facts that fall within an exclusion from coverage.doerr,so d at.maint,certain underwriters at lloyd,so d.to prevail,the insurer must show that the allegations in the complaint unambiguously fall within one of the exclusionary clauses.alert centre,alarm protection,cir.we conclude that wellons was entitled to a defense under the policy.read broadly,as louisiana law requires,the complaint alleged facts that fall within the policy insuring clause.exclusion m did not defeat the duty to defend because martco complaint did not allege damage to impaired property as defined by the policy.
louisiana duty to defend interpretive rules 
under louisiana eight corners rule,we must assess whether there is a duty to defend by applying the allegations of the complaint to the underlying policy without resort to extrinsic evidence.adams frost,so d,citing vaughn franklin,so d.the insurer has a duty to defend unless the allegations in the complaint as applied to the policy unambiguously preclude coverage.elliott,so d at.moreover,an insurer duty to defend arises whenever the pleadings against the insured disclose a possibility of liability under the policy.meloy conoco,so d.
the allegations of the complaint are liberally interpreted in determining whether they set forth grounds that bring the claim within the scope of the insurer duty to defend.yount maisano,so d,citing czarniecki,so d.at the same time,any ambiguity in an insurance policy is construed against the insurer.smith matthews,so d,breland schilling,so d,kendrick mason,so d.
whether martco allegations do not unambiguously preclude coverage 
before considering any exclusions,we must first address whether wellons satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the complaint alleges a set of facts that would fall within coverage.as mentioned above,the test of a liability insurer duty to defend is not whether the allegations unambiguously fall within coverage but,rather,whether the allegations do not unambiguously prevent a conclusion that coverage could exist.vaughn franklin,so d.we conclude that martco alleged property damage caused by an occurrence under the policy.
property damage 
in order to satisfy its burden,wellons must show that martco complaint alleges property damage within the meaning of the policy.under the policy,property damage is defined as p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.when construed liberally in favor of wellons,paragraph of martco complaint,as supported by paragraph iii of the complaint,made out a claim that falls within the policy definition.
martco complaint relied on a total of eleven paragraphs of factual allegations to make out six distinct claims.as admiral asserts,ten of these paragraphs were directed at martco dissatisfaction with wellons product.one paragraph,however,was not so clearly focused.paragraph of martco complaint stated that 
wellons efforts have produced negative results so far and the operation of the wellons unit has caused physical degrading of the infrastructure through excessive ash carryover.
martco compl.much of the debate on this issue has centered on what the infrastructure means.the meaning of this phrase,in fact,is determinative when we examine the exclusions.however,at this step in the analysis,we examine only whether property damage caused by an occurrence is arguably pled.we need only ask if paragraph and the demand for damages for repairs in paragraph iii can be construed as making a claim for an injury to tangible property caused by the insured.whether the damage that required repair was to the wellons unit or the larger osb plant is immaterial to this question.the claim that the infrastructure whatever that may degrad ed can reasonably be read in conjunction with the demand for repair damages to make out a claim for injury to some item of tangible property caused by the insured.as such,wellons met its burden with respect to this portion.
occurrence 
wellons must also show that the complaint alleges that the property damage at issue was caused by an occurrence.the policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.wellons contends that martco complaint satisfactorily pled an occurrence under the repeated exposure portion of the policy definition when it alleged damage from excessive ash carryover.in response,admiral contends that the events alleged could not be an occurrence because the allegations were too ambiguous to constitute a repeated exposure.admiral argument,however,is insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the insured.wellons has carried its burden of proving an occurrence.
admiral contends that nothing in the complaint could be construed as suggesting damage arising from continuous or repeated exposure.instead,admiral claims martco would have needed to plead how often the excessive ash carryover occurred for us to find coverage under the repeated exposure definition.in short,admiral complains that martco did not affirmatively plead sufficient facts to allow wellons to assert coverage using paragraph.
such a reading would require an inversion of louisiana standard for assessing the duty to defend issue.rather,we must ask whether the allegations do not unambiguously prevent a conclusion that coverage could exist.vaughn,so d at.here,paragraph is ambiguous.it does not define excessive ash carryover.it does not state how often excessive ash carryover occurred.all it states is that wellons efforts at repair which the preceding and following paragraphs suggest lasted months created additional harm and the resulting ash carryover led to degradation of some undefined infrastructure.again,liberally construing the allegations,injury by excessive ash carryover can reasonably be understood to involve repeated exposure over the long period in which wellons fruitlessly attempted to make repairs.while this may not be affirmatively clear on the pleadings,it is sufficient to conclude that the allegations do not unambiguously preclude a finding that there was an occurrence.consequently,we conclude that the allegations of the complaint state claims that may be covered by the insuring clause of the policy.
whether admiral carried its burden of proving that a policy exclusion applies to martco allegations 
we must next consider whether any policy exclusion applies.as noted above,the insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusionary clause within the policy.doerr mobil oil,so d,modified on other grounds,so d.a duty to defend will exist unless the allegations are such that every claim pleaded in the complaint and otherwise falling within the insuring clause unambiguously falls within an exclusion.alert centre,alarm protection,cir.finally,any ambiguity in an insurance policy is construed against the insurer.smith matthews,so d.admiral alleges three separate exclusions apply the work product exclusion exclusion m for impaired property and exclusion a for intended or expected injury.though the district court applied exclusion m,we find that no exclusion contained in the policy applies in this case.
a.the work product exclusion 
admiral,without specificity,alleges that any property damage found in the complaint falls under one of the work product exclusions of the policy.this argument could refer to any of four different exclusions exclusion j exclusion j,exclusion k and exclusion l regardless of which provision admiral intended to assert,the crux of the dispute over these four exclusions boils down to a simple inquiry what infrastructure was degraded by the excessive ash carryover as we have stated,any ambiguity is resolved in favor of the duty to defend.yount maisano,so d,smith,so d at.thus,wellons plausible reading of the complaint as addressing damage to the martco plant infrastructure rather than only the wellons unit infrastructure supports the conclusion that these exclusions do not apply.
exclusion m 
admiral next argues,and the district court found,that admiral duty to defend was precluded by exclusion m of the policy exclusion m operates to omit property damage to impaired property.the policy sets forth a definition for impaired property 
impaired property means tangible property,other than your product or your work,that can not be used or is less useful because 
a.it incorporates your product or your work that is known or thought to be defective,deficient,inadequate or dangerous.
if such property can be restored to use by 
a.the repair,replacement,adjustment or removal of your product or your work.
working off this definition,wellons asserts two arguments.
first,wellons contends that exclusion m can not apply to claims for physical injury to impaired property.for this proposition,wellons cites gaylord chem.propump,so d in gaylord,the louisiana court of appeals addressed an identical impaired property exclusion.the gaylord insured sought coverage for damages to a plant infrastructure caused by excessively vibrating pipes installed by the insured.id.at.the court,in addressing the impaired property exclusion with respect to the damaged plant,concluded that 
t he impaired property exclusion only excludes damage to property that has not been physically injured or for which the claimed damages are only for loss of use of that property.therefore,any damages based on actual physical injury to gaylord plant,equipment,or other property would not be excluded under this provision.
id.at.this interpretation of an identical impaired property provision is convincing and,arguably,under gaylord,the impaired property exclusion should not apply because the allegations of paragraph by way of paragraph iii appear to make a claim for repairs rather than loss of use.
wellons also argues that the restoration provision of the impaired property definition prevents exclusion m from applying,and we agree.specifically,for the exclusion to apply,the complaint must unambiguously state that impaired property is susceptible to full restoration by repairing,replacing,adjusting,or removing the insured work or the insured product.stated another way,admiral must show that the degradation alleged in paragraph would be entirely repaired by simply fixing or removing the wellons unit.nothing in the complaint unambiguously demonstrates such a simple solution would repair martco infrastructure on the contrary,the construction of paragraph iii as demanding repair damages for martco osb plant suggests the opposite conclusion.accordingly,we find that the property damage to the infrastructure as alleged in paragraph did not involve impaired property,and,as such,exclusion m does not apply.
exclusion a 
finally,admiral argues that we should apply exclusion a to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment if no other exclusion applies.but admiral did not raise exclusion a with respect to its duty to defend in the district court.we may only affirm an order granting summary judgment on a basis that was presented to the district court.see lemaire louisiana,cir.this rule is in keeping with our requirement that arguments not raised before the district court are waived and can not be raised for the first time on appeal.id.admiral only asserted exclusion a with respect to its duty to indemnify in the court below.exclusion a is never once mentioned anywhere in admiral argument below regarding duty to defend.additionally,the district court ruling in no way suggests that admiral otherwise submitted this argument for consideration with respect to its duty to defend.as such,this argument has been waived.
b.the duty to indemnify 
we next turn to the question of indemnity advanced in case.unlike our examination of the duty to defend,we are not limited by the eight corners rule in assessing the duty to indemnify.instead,we must apply the policy to the actual evidence adduced at the underlying liability trial together with any evidence introduced in the coverage case.admiral raises four issues for review in its appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment for wellons whether wellons carried its burden of establishing that the actual claims for which the judgment in the underlying case awarded damages fell within the policy insuring clause whether the policy operations hazards pcoh coverage applied whether the event fell within exclusion m of the policy based on the facts established at trial and whether any other policy exclusion offered by admiral applies we conclude that the district court correctly decided all four issues.
louisiana duty to indemnify interpretive rules 
the parties agree that louisiana insurance law governs the interpretation of the policy.as such,the question of indemnity before us should be assessed in light of the following louisiana interpretive rules.
the interpretation of an insurance contract presents a question of law,rather than of fact,and therefore is an appropriate matter for determination by summary judgment.bonin westport ins,so d.an insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed using the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the louisiana civil code.cadwallader allstate ins,so d.ins.guar.ass interstate fire cas,so d.words and phrases used in an insurance policy should be construed using their plain,ordinary and generally prevailing meaning,unless the words have acquired a technical meaning.cadwallader,so d at carbon allstate ins,so d.
an insurance policy must be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy,and as amplified,extended,or modified by any rider,endorsement,or application attached to or made a part of the policy.vanderbrook unitrin preferred ins,cir quoting.ann.ambiguity in an insurance contract must be resolved according to the general rules governing contract interpretation ambiguous policy provisions are to be construed against the confector,the insurer.ambiguity will also be resolved by ascertaining how a reasonable insurance policy purchaser would construe the clause at the time the insurance contract was entered.breland schilling,so d,citations omitted.
coverage under the insuring clause 
to carry its burden,wellons must show that the damages that it seeks to recover from admiral fall within the policy terms.see doerr mobil oil,so d,modified on other grounds,so d that is,wellons must demonstrate that the damages for which indemnity is sought constitute property damage caused by an occurrence,as those terms are defined in the policy.a review of the evidence adduced at trial,the resulting verdict and judgment,and the applicable louisiana law reveals that wellons clearly carried its burden of establishing coverage under the insuring clause.
property damage 
admiral makes two arguments with respect to the property damage prong of coverage analysis.first,admiral contends that any attempt to show property damage as part of martco contractual claims is precluded as a matter of law.second,admiral contends that wellons can not show any property damage under the policy definition for that term.the district court rejection of both of these arguments was sound and accurately reflects the current state of insurance law in louisiana.accordingly,we conclude that wellons has adequately proven property damage under the policy.
contract claims as property damage claims 
admiral first contends that,as a matter of law,a claim for breach of contract can not constitute a claim for property damage.admiral reasons that any recovery derived from such claims would involve purely economic damages and,as such,martco failed to prove the necessary injury.as the district court noted,however,this argument fails because the louisiana court of appeals has addressed this exact issue and rejected admiral position.
in stewart interior contractors,metalpro industries,so d,the court addressed whether claims for breach of contract and redhibition due to misrepresentation were claims solely for economic losses caused by breach of contract and not covered by the policy.id.at.the court concluded that such claims could be covered,and,moreover,cgl policies would simply not make sense if the court held otherwise.specifically,various cgl provisions and exclusions carefully address situations arising from contractual breaches producing property damage.id.in light of this analysis,the stewart court affirmatively that granting summary judgment merely because only contractual claims were involved constitutes error under louisiana law.id.as such,martco claims are,as a threshold matter,eligible for property damage coverage under the policy.
ii.loss of use as property damage in this case 
admiral alternatively contends that martco and wellons have not proven property damage as defined under the policy.as the district court noted,three exhibits clearly set forth the downtime at the osb plant caused by various failures in the wellons unit.more importantly,the jury agreed.the jury verdict form expressly awards for lost productivity,earnings,and profits due to wellons breach of contract,negligence,and sale of a product with a redhibitory defect.the district court correctly concluded that these findings show martco demonstrated loss of use.as such,wellons,by way of martco,adequately demonstrated property damage as that term is defined in the policy.
occurrence 
on appeal,admiral only makes one relevant argument regarding whether martco and wellons satisfactorily demonstrated property damage caused by an occurrence.admiral suggests that the district court erred when it concluded that louisiana law no longer categorically excludes construction defects as possible occurrences.yet louisiana case law fully supports the district court assessment of the occurrence requirement.as such,wellons easily satisfies its burden of demonstrating the proven property damage was caused by an occurrence.
below,admiral vigorously contended that no construction defect could ever constitute an occurrence under a cgl policy.the district court correctly found,however,that the louisiana court of appeals directly addressed and rejected that proposition.see rando top notch,so d,t he clear weight of authority in more recent cases considers defects in construction that result in damage subsequent to completion to be accidents and occurrences when they manifest themselves.on appeal,admiral attempts to argue,instead,that louisiana law excludes this type of construction defect case.admiral cites no authority that supports this point.massey parker,so d,does not so hold.as discussed above,the jury found that martco alleged and proved more than million in property damage in the form of loss of use.that loss of use flowed from repeated,sudden breakdowns.as such,this case alleges exactly the sort of construction defect resulting in damage that the court in massey accepted as falling within an ordinary cgl policy.
whether a policy exclusion applies to martco allegations 
admiral bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusionary clause within the policy.doerr,so d at.maint,certain underwriters at lloyd,so d.if admiral can not unambiguously show an exclusion applies,the policy must be construed in favor of coverage.doerr,so d at citing yount maisano,so d.admiral variously argues that the district court incorrectly considered pcoh coverage,incorrectly applied the exception to exclusion m,and incorrectly failed to apply the work product exclusions.we conclude that the district court correctly decided all of the above issues and,as such,wellons is entitled to indemnification under the policy.
applicability of pcoh coverage 
as the district court noted below,the applicability of the policy definition for a operations hazard pcoh has proven to be perhaps the most contested issue surrounding the question of indemnification.the parties even dispute why we must consider whether pcoh applies.admiral suggests pcoh analysis is necessary to fully consider exclusion j for certain harms relating to work product.wellons contends that pcoh analysis is necessary to address the applicability of the exception to exclusion m.as applied to either issue,the district court application of the policy definition for was correct.
pcoh and exclusion j 
admiral argues that the district court erred in its application of the policy definition of pcoh.specifically,admiral contends that the district court incorrectly determined that martco proved loss of use caused by wellons product.on the contrary,the district court interpretation of pcoh with respect to this exclusion appears to be correct.as such,martco claim can not fall within exclusion j of the policy due to the pcoh exception.
admiral primary reason for appealing the district court pcoh assessment was the district court interpretation of the policy definition for pcoh in the context of an exception to exclusion j.exclusion j excludes 
property damage to 
that particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.
paragraph of this exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the hazard.
the district court squarely addressed the applicability of the pcoh definition to martco claimed damages.the policy allows for indemnification where property damage to other property arose from wellons product.martco.wellons,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.admiral contends that the district court reasoning circularly asserts loss of use was caused by loss of use.we conclude that the district court correctly found that martco lost the use of the osb plant because it lost the use of the wellons unit through a series of mechanical failures.far from circular,this justification in the district court opinion shows the sort of direct causal link required by the pcoh definition.as such,the district court application of the pcoh definition with respect to martco loss of use of other property was correct and exclusion j does not apply due to the exception provision.
ii.pcoh and exclusion m 
wellons asserts that the district court undertook its analysis of pcoh coverage as part of its assessment of the applicability of exclusion m.specifically,wellons points out that the exception to exclusion m and the pcoh definition both require a showing that the insured product was put to its intended use.put to its intended use is not a defined term in the policy.the district court concluded that the jury awarded damages to martco which arose after the wellons unit was put to its intended use.
the primary point of contention regarding pcoh and exclusion m centers on whether wellons work was ever completed and put to use by martco.neither party disputes that the of the wellons unit occurred on january.neither party disputes that the ensuing work on the wellons unit was outside the original contracts and,instead,reflected remedial efforts.all of the available evidence demonstrates that martco loss of use damages did not begin to accrue until after the january when martco was supposed to be able to fully utilize the upgraded furnace.
words and phrases used in an insurance policy should be construed using their plain,ordinary,and generally prevailing meaning,unless the words have acquired a technical meaning.cadwallader,so d at carbon,so d at.here,put to its intended use does not have a technical meaning or a definition.applying the common meaning,then,the wellons unit was put to use as soon as martco began employing it as part of its factory.wellons was putatively done with its responsibilities,and martco had begun trying to make use of its new furnace.only as it began using the product did martco start incurring unexpected downtime.the district court conclusions that wellons completed its work on january,and that martco began putting the furnace to use on january,were correct.consequently,the pcoh definition applies to martco damages in the instant case.
exclusion m 
when we addressed exclusion m in the section on duty to defend,we noted that the parties focused on whether the impaired property prong of that exclusion applied.because the pleading alleged damage to infrastructure from excessive ash carryover,the second prong of exclusion m property that has not been physically injured was not at issue.however,following a trial in which the bulk of damages awarded were for loss of use,exclusion m arguably applies the district court found that the exception to the exclusion applied to negate the exclusion.
admiral claims that the district court improperly applied the exception.the district court analysis of these issues is both correct and consistent with louisiana and fifth circuit case law.as such,we affirm the district court application of the exception to exclusion m.
the exception to exclusion m reads in relevant part 
this exclusion does not apply to the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical injury to your product or your work after it has been put to its intended use.
admiral claims that the district court lacked any evidence to conclude the jury awarded damages for injury to other property the osb plant caused by sudden and accidental physical injury to the wellons unit.yet the district court had ample evidence to support these conclusions.the evidence at trial demonstrated that a thermal oil tank installed by wellons imploded a circulation pump isolation valve failed a valve stem leaked the computerized control system did not function properly and wires burnt off the thermocouples.martco offered evidence of
