this appeal arises from the final decision of the national labor relations board the nlrb interpreting a collective bargaining agreement provision.engelhard corporation engelhard or the company,relying on its interpretation of the provision,suspended employees for holding a demonstration at its annual shareholders meeting.for the reasons set out below,we agree with the nlrb that engelhard employees did not contravene that provision.thus,we deny the petition for review of the board decision that engelhard suspension of the employees violated subsections a and of the national labor relations act the nlra,and grant the nlrb application for enforcement of that decision.
factual and procedural background 
engelhard manufactures and distributes pigments and film products at various locations throughout the united states.local,international brotherhood of electrical workers,the union represents approximately employees in five of engelhard new york facilities,including the plant located in peekskill,new york.at all relevant times,engelhard peekskill employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement the cba binding both engelhard and the union.
article of the cba included a provision that stated 
the employer and the union declare it to be their intention to prevent any suspension of work due to labor disputes during the term of this agreement.to carry out this intention,the employer agrees that there shall be no lockout of any of its employees or discrimination against them because they have raised a dispute or grievance.the union agrees that it will not call,participate in,or sanction,during the term of this agreement,any strike,boycott,picketing,or whatsoever.the union further agrees that any employee engaging in an unauthorized strike,boycott,picketing,organized work slowdown or stoppage,or any other type of interference with the employer business,shall be subject to immediate discharge at the discretion of the employer with no recourse to the grievance procedure contained herein.
however,the employer agrees that it will not hold the union responsible for damages resulting from any such unauthorized action if the union takes immediate action to advise all employees that such unauthorized action is unauthorized and that employees participating will by subject to discipline,up to and including discharge.
the cba was due to expire on june.in anticipation of that expiration date,the union and engelhard held negotiations for a successor agreement on march,and.the discussions broke off,however,prior to formalizing any new agreement.the union aspired to return to the bargaining table.indeed,in order to put pressure on the company to resume negotiations,the union decided to picket engelhard may,shareholders meeting at the sheraton hotel in woodbridge,new jersey,a location some fifty miles from engelhard plant in peekskill.
on april,union business agent robert meyer left a message with engelhard senior vice president to provide notice of its plans to picket the shareholders meeting.engelhard director of human resources,joel gray,returned the call and informed meyer that,in the company view,the proposed picketing violated the provision of the cba.the union disagreed,stating that because article applied only to concerted activity resulting in a work stoppage or affecting production,it did not cover the union peaceful picketing of the shareholders meeting.the same day,engelhard sent a letter to the union,which engelhard posted at the peekskill plant,expressing its position that the planned picketing violated article of the cba.the letter further warned that any employee who engaged in picketing at the shareholders meeting would be subject to immediate discharge.
on may,approximately fifty company employees from its peekskill plant,accompanied by fifteen to twenty,participated in a demonstration outside the sheraton hotel in woodbridge.of the fifty employees who took part in the demonstration,only three were scheduled to work at the time of the demonstration,and each of them had received advance permission from the company to miss work on may.some of the carried picket signs indicating that the union had filed unfair labor practice charges against engelhard while other distributed handbills complaining that the company had broken off contract negotiations.none of the participants chanted,blew whistles or otherwise made any noise.rather,the demonstrators engaged in a silent protest,obeying all of the rules given by the police.the peekskill employees stood next to the picketers and handbill distributors for approximately one hour,the duration of the protest.
engelhard concedes it videotaped the demonstration.according to engelhard,it recorded the demonstration in the event the participators attempted to disrupt the meeting or it decided to seek an injunction.it is undisputed that no protester disrupted the shareholders meeting or prevented individuals or vehicles from either entering or exiting the hotel.
on may,engelhard sent the union a second letter which also was posted in the peekskill plant.among other things,this communication declared that engelhard intended to take formal disciplinary action against both the employees who participated in the demonstration and the union for violating article of the cba.
engelhard used the may videotape recording to identify those employees who participated in the demonstration,and then suspended each of them for three days.the union filed grievances over the suspensions,which engelhard refused to arbitrate.it maintained that the grievances were not arbitrable because the employees picketed in violation of the cba and thus had no recourse to its grievance procedures.
the union followed up by filing unfair labor practice charges with the nlrb.the nlrb general counsel issued a consolidated complaint alleging that engelhard had committed a variety of unfair labor practices in violation of subsections a and of the nlra,a.engelhard filed an answer to that complaint,denying all charges.at the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing,an administrative law judge alj issued a decision holding that it violated subsection a of the nlra by threatening employees with discharge if they engaged in union activity and surveilling employees engaged in union activity.the alj also ruled that engelhard violated subsection a of the nlra by suspending employees for participating in a union demonstration at the company annual shareholders meeting.timely exceptions were filed by engelhard to the nlrb,which issued an opinion,over one dissent,affirming the alj.this appeal followed

iii.merits 
section of the nlra grants employees the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.section states that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their section rights,a,or to discriminate with regard to hire or tenure or employment or any term or condition of employment to discourage membership in any labor organization.a.indeed,it is that section of the nlra protects the right of employees to observe lawful picket lines.int l of workers,local,nlrb,cir.
