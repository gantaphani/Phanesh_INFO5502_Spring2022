opinion of the court 
the willow inn received the final payment on its property damage claim over two years after the building was damaged by a tornado.having encountered sustained resistance to its insurance claim rather than cooperation in settling it,willow inn,sued its real and personal property insurance carrier,public service mutual insurance company psm,asserting,inter alia,a breach of contract claim and unspecified punitive damages,attorney fees,and costs pursuant to pennsylvania bad faith statute.following a bench trial,the district court awarded willow inn in compensatory damages on the contract claim and in punitive damages plus attorney fees and costs,later set at and,respectively,on the bad faith claim.
on may,this court upheld the compensatory award and the attorney fees and costs awards.we did not discuss,however,the district court findings that psm had breached the insurance contract and had acted in bad faith under.because the district court had not addressed its punitive damages award in terms of the united states supreme court guideposts enunciated in bmw of north america,gore,d,we vacated that award.we instructed the district court to determine the appropriate punitive damages award in accordance with the supreme court dictates in gore and reinforced in state farm mutual automobile insurance company campbell,d,which had been filed after the district court decision.the district court survey determined that its earlier award accorded with due process,and it reinstated the punitive damages award.we affirm.
on june,a tornado caused severe damage to the willow inn,a and residence in willow grove,pennsylvania.within days of the storm willow inn hired a public adjusting firm,assured adjustment,on a contingency fee to assist it in submitting its insurance claim to psm.psm retained mcshea associates to adjust the claim.on june,assured adjustment forwarded its initial claim estimate of to mcshea.on july,mcshea countered with its initial claim estimate.perhaps predictably,given their opposing incentives assured adjustment to maximize the claim to increase its fee and willow inn recovery,and mcshea to minimize the claim to attract future psm business,mcshea estimate of was less than of the one prepared by assured adjustment a month earlier.
at willow inn request,on september,psm advanced a payment to its insured.because of the variance between their estimates,assured adjustment and mcshea retained a contractor to evaluate willow inn loss and to facilitate negotiations.with the contractor evaluation and following negotiations,assured adjusters and mcshea agreed to a claim amount of,which mcshea recommended to psm on october.when psm inexplicably failed to respond to its adjuster correspondence for over a month,mcshea iterated the recommendation on november.
on november,willow inn submitted to psm a sworn proof of loss for,an amount that after the deductible was the same as that agreed upon by assured adjustment and mcshea.willow inn also claimed an additional for costs associated with preparing the proof of loss,the maximum allowed under a separate policy provision.on november,psm rejected the proof of loss,and did not respond to the preparations costs claim.by this time psm had hired another estimator,casson associates,to evaluate the claim.
casson estimated willow inn loss to be.on december,psm authorized mcshea to offer willow inn,the casson estimate less the advance to settle the claim.willow inn rejected this offer.on january,willow inn withdrew its adherence to the proposed settlement,and,per the policy,requested an appraisal within days.
on february,psm refused the appraisal request,stating that it did not have a sworn proof of loss statement from willow inn and that it could not go forward with an appraisal because it was no longer established that a dispute in fact existed.the district court found psm stated rationale for refusing to participate in the appraisal process to be disingenuous.willow inn had merely retreated from the settlement offer it had not withdrawn its proof of loss statement.despite repeated requests from willow inn,psm did not submit to an appraisal until october.during the appraisal process,psm relied on materially identical documents it originally averred were insufficient to document the existence of a dispute.on july,the appraisal umpire fixed willow inn property loss claim at,which,less the advance,psm paid on august.psm did not pay the preparations costs claim.willow inn filed this suit two months later.
the parties agreed to a bench trial.the district court january,rule a memorandum and order awarded willow inn on the breach of contract claim.the court considered the policy provision defraying up to of claimants proof of loss preparations costs to be unambiguous,and found that the undisputed evidence at trial established that assured adjustment had reasonably expended well in excess of the policy limit in preparing the proof of loss.
the district court noted that bad faith under must be proven by clear and convincing evidence and not merely insinuated,terletsky prudential prop.cas.ins,such that it enables a court to reach its decision with a clear conviction.polselli nationwide mut.fire ins,cir.
the district court then wrote,
mindful of this high standard,i find that psm conduct constituted bad faith as contemplated by section.specifically,unreasonable delays in the processing of the willow inn claims were extraordinarily unwarranted such that there can be no conclusion except that psm knowingly or recklessly disregarded the absence of a reasonable basis for its conduct.the record is replete with examples of psm failure to respond in a timely fashion to willow inn various reasonable requests,and even to the requests of those working on psm behalf.as one egregious example,psm unjustified delay in appointing an appraiser prevented the appraisal from commencing,despite the willow inn and its adjusters diligent efforts,until more than eight months after the willow inn initial appraisal request.similarly,psm failed to pay the willow inn for its costs incurred in preparing proof of the willow inn loss,or to even acknowledge the willow inn request for more than three months,despite ample evidence that the willow inn was entitled to this compensation.while each of these examples standing alone evinces bad faith,this conclusion becomes even stronger when one considers the abundance of evidence presented at trial pointing out the dramatic contrast between the willow inn conscientious efforts and psm reckless and obstructive actions.see also a insurer must provide notice of its decision to insured within fifteen working days after receipt of a proof loss.
though cognizant of dollar punitive damage awards in section cases,the district court concluded that is an appropriate,adequate,and reasonable award.the court also indicated that it would award appropriate fees and costs after considering plaintiff counsel forthcoming petition.after considering willow inn petition and the parties briefs,on april,the district court awarded willow inn in attorney fees and in costs.
psm appealed the district court breach of contract and bad faith findings,its exercise of discretion in awarding attorney fees and costs,and its punitive damages assessment,which psm argued was constitutionally excessive.we summarily affirmed the district court decision with respect to the first three issues,having granted argument limited to the punitive damages award.we vacated and remanded that award to the district court with instructions to apply the guideposts.willow inn,public serv.mut.ins.cir not precedential.
on remand,the district court declared its punitive damages award not to be constitutionally excessive.following the three guideposts,the district court first found psm behavior reprehensible due to willow inn financially vulnerable position,the repeated misconduct of psm,and because the unreasonable delay in psm payment of the claim was not mere accident.next,the district court found the appropriate ratio of the punitive damages penalty to the harm caused by psm conduct to be approximately,because the punitive damages award of is approximately equal to the value of the willow inn claim under the policy and the payment that it belatedly received.as to the guidepost of other sanctions that could be imposed for comparable misconduct,the district court reasoned that the significant attorney fees authorized under evince the pennsylvania legislature intent to hold insurers accountable for acting in bad faith,and that the significant attorney fees awarded in prior cases gave psm notice that its conduct would subject the company to punishment.
the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction under a this court has final order jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court decision upholding the constitutionality of the amount of its punitive damages award.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.more specifically,we must engage in an independent examination of the relevant criteria,id.at,to determine whether the punitive damage award is so grossly disproportional to the defendant conduct as to amount to a constitutional violation.id.at.quoting united states bajakajian,d.
due process demands that a defendant receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also of the penalty the state may impose.gore,at.thus,punitive damages awards must not be disproportionately excessive to the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct and the harm that conduct visited upon the plaintiff,and the award must not exceed the state legislature judgment of the appropriate sanctions for the conduct.campbell,at.addressing each of the three guideposts,and acknowledging the inherent imprecision of the substantive due process analysis,we consider the punitive damages to approach but not cross the constitutional line.see cooper,at.t he relevant constitutional line is inherently imprecise,rather than one marked by a simple mathematical formula.citations omitted.
degree of reprehensibility 
perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct.gore,at.just as criminal sanctions are calibrated to comport with the gravity of the offender conduct,so should the amount of the punitive damages imposed on a defendant reflect the accepted view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others.id.
given the procedural posture of this case,we find especially salient the supreme court observation that with respect to the reprehensibility inquiry,the district courts have a somewhat superior vantage over courts of appeal,and even then the advantage exists primarily with respect to issues turning on witness credibility and demeanor.cooper,at.the district judge presided over this case for well over a year and ruled on the defendant motion for summary judgment and countless motions.during a two day bench trial the district judge heard testimony from witnesses and observed their demeanor.the trial transcript reveals several instances in which the district judge questioned witnesses and cited specific pages of the record to which counsel had alluded before counsel themselves could locate the pages.the transcript reveals a district judge who was deeply engaged in the proceedings and who had a thorough grasp of the evidence.most importantly,the critical input to the reprehensibility calculus in this case is whether the delay in settling the claim was due to legitimate differences of opinion over its value or,rather,to psm dilatoriness and inertia.this evaluation was best made by the judge who heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of all of the significant,contractors,and claims in willow inn claim.
further,the importance of the district court superior vantage is magnified in bench trials.when the supreme court articulated de novo review of punitive damages awards,it was in the usual context of an appellate court passing on district courts determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards made by juries.id.at.the concerns undergirding de novo review may be tempered somewhat,however,when a federal district judge,rather than a local jury,is the factfinder setting the punitive damages award.in such a case,the potential for an or inflated reprehensibility determination is less.
while due process demands that states guide the discretion of juries contemplating punitive damages awards,cooper,at,concerns of judicial overreaching dictate that trial judges view jury determinations of appropriate punitive damages with a measure of deference.see dunn hovic,cir en banc determining that due process is satisfied where a district court accords a jury punitive damages award substantial deference while remit ting the portion of the verdict in excess of the maximum amount supportable by the evidence internal quotation marks omitted.if a jury punitive damages award is free of irrationality,passion,and prejudice,and falls within the broad discretion in authorizing and limiting permissible punitive damages awards lodged with state legislatures,cooper industries,at.see campbell,at,a trial judge should not substitute his or her view of the appropriate amount of punitive damages for the jury determination.similarly,the touchstone of appellate review of punitive damages awards is reasonableness,not exactitude.gore,at.see haslip,at.as long as the discretion is exercised within reasonable constraints,due process is satisfied.if a court determines that a jury punitive damages award is constitutionally excessive,dunn indicates that the court should decrease the award to an amount the evidence will bear,which amount must necessarily be as may well be the level the court would have deemed appropriate if working on a clean slate.at.the danger inherent in the typical,for punitive damages awards to creep toward the constitutional limit as the potential prejudice infecting a jury reprehensibility analysis and its punitive damages calculus can be tempered but not eliminated by allayed when a federal judge sets the amount of punitive damages as an initial matter.
in sum,while the reprehensibility of psm conduct is not a fact established at trial,see cooper industries,at,that the quantum of reprehensibility necessary to support the punitive damages award was determined to exist by a judge exercising diversity jurisdiction lessens our concern that the conclusion was the product of local bias,distaste for corporate defendants,or sympathy for the plaintiff.
the supreme court has parsed the reprehensibility analysis into five subfactors,three of financial vulnerability of the plaintiff,that the conduct involved repeated actions by the defendant,and that the harm was intentionally district court determined were applicable to this case.see gore,at.campbell,at.we agree with the district court that willow inn was financially vulnerable,and that its need for the insurance proceeds was particularly pressing.though no documents related to willow inn financial standing were introduced at trial,the trial testimony amply supports the district court finding.for example,the uncontroverted testimony of gerald dimarzio,a willow inn,was that in the hours following the tornado,he and neighborhood volunteers fastened tarps to cover holes in the roof and exterior of the building,and cleared debris from the building and its grounds to make the area less hazardous.his testimony established that the willow inn is unquestionably a modest business,and is not an enterprise with the resources to have had its premises repaired professionally without the benefit of insurance proceeds.
the district court noted that the delay in settling and paying willow inn claim was not the result of one specific event,but,rather,a series of instances in which psm failed or refused to act on plaintiff claim.the district court considered this conduct to evince reprehensibility because repeated conduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance.gore,at.the district court seems to have misinterpreted this subfactor,at least as it has been applied by the supreme court.the repeated conduct cited in gore involved not merely a pattern of contemptible conduct within one extended transaction,the sale of one automobile to gore,but rather specific instances of similar conduct by the defendant in relation to other parties.in gore,the behavior the plaintiff argued was recidivistic involved bmw selling repainted cars as new to people,all but fourteen of whom lived in other states.the claimed recidivistic behavior did not refer to the series of steps that amounted to the alleged fraud related to gore automobile.similarly,in campbell,the plaintiffs essentially attempted to put state farm policy for minimizing claims on trial.the repeated conduct alleged in campbell related to the insurer nationwide claims handling practices across thousands of claims,not to the series of unreasonable decisions various state farm employees made in handling the campbells specific claim.
here,the district court improperly considered the various stonewalling tactics employed by psm in processing willow inn claim to satisfy the repeated conduct reprehensibility subfactor of gore and campbell.notwithstanding this misinterpretation,however,we consider this subfactor to be relevant,but with less force,insofar as the series of actions and inaction by psm which delayed settlement of the claim until more than two years after the windstorm implied a concerted effort to lessen psm expected payment on the claim.psm pattern of delay suggests that its actions were designed to achieve a fiscally beneficial result for itself at odds with the pennsylvania supreme court dictate that an insurer must act with the utmost good faith toward its insured.fedas insurance of.
as noted by the district court,valid claimants who were less diligent than willow inn in pressing their claims,when confronted with similar behavior by psm,would have abandoned their claims in frustration.we have little doubt that had willow inn not vigorously pursued a final settlement,psm would not have made payment beyond the advance.indeed,the dilatory tactics of psm effectively produced an loan to psm from willow inn of the difference between the advance and the value of the claim for as long as psm was able to stretch out payment.in this regard,we think the gore campbell repeated conduct subfactor applies to this case in a way not captured in the intent subfactor,to which we now turn.
the district court concluded that the unreasonable delay here was due to psm intentional stonewalling and was not the result of mere accident.campbell,at.citing gore,at.we agree.the trial transcript indicates that psm repeatedly asked willow inn for documentation that the insured had already submitted or was otherwise unnecessary that psm unreasonably asserted that no dispute warranting an appraisal existed and told its appraiser to freeze the appraisal process and that psm withheld the difference between the lowest estimate and its advance payment on the unreasonable ground that the appraisal might be returned in an amount less than the lowest estimate.in short,psm conduct in settling and paying willow inn claim was a mix of purposefully indifferent inaction and intentionally dilatory action.
our reprehensibility review is not an exhaustive catalog of psm misconduct.as indicated by the district court,the trial transcript reflects the abundance of evidence presented at trial pointing out the dramatic contrast between the willow inn conscientious efforts and psm reckless and obstructive actions.for example,among the actions and inactions by psm indicative of bad faith,but not mentioned by the district court,was psm inappropriate vagueness in rejecting the settlement recommended by mcshea,psm persistent and unvarying attempts to lowball willow inn regarding construction materials,and psm neglect in failing to keep willow inn reasonably apprised of the status of its claim.acknowledging,too,that the reprehensibility analysis is rightly augmented by the demeanor evidence available only to the district judge,we can not conclude that the punitive damages award here is out of proportion to the reprehensibility of psm conduct.
ratio of punitive damages to harm 
the second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff.gore,at.the constitutionally acceptable range is not reducible to a simple mathematical formula,id.at,and the supreme court has been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio.campbell,at.rather,the ratio of punitive damages to the harm caused by the defendant is a tool to ensure that the two bear a reasonable relationship to each other.gore,at.campbell,at.while few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process,campbell,at,greater ratios may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.id.quoting gore,at.
the supreme court ratio discussions evidence a concern that the punishment should fit the crime,and imply the general observation that conduct that visits great economic harm onto a plaintiff is likely to be more culpable than where the stakes are lower.the supreme court has never suggested,for example,that a large compensatory award could sustain a significant punitive damages award,regardless of the resulting compensatory to punitive damages ratio,where the underlying conduct was not of punishable character.
accordingly,the question becomes what figure comprises the second term of the ratio to compare to the punitive damages award there is no shortage of candidates.the district court used the amount of willow inn claim under the policy and the payment that it belatedly received approximately a ratio of roughly one to one.to reach this ratio,the district court reasoned that because willow inn had to be uncommonly diligent in asserting its claim in the face of psm mix of obstructionism and passivity,the entire claim amount was the potential harm.the district court cited txo production,the seminal potential harm case,for the proposition that a plaintiff potential harm and not its actual harm is the relevant term to compare to the punitive damages award.see txo production,at.we do not agree that this is a potential harm case or that the claim amount is the proper figure of comparison.in txo production,the defendant attempted to defraud the plaintiff out of potentially lucrative royalties of which the plaintiff was unaware.the lesson of txo production is that punitive damages amounts need not be tethered to the small actual harm frauds visited upon their victims.rather,just as the criminal justice system punishes attempts to commit crime with roughly the same severity as it does substantive offenses,punitive damages awards can match the scale of the attempted swindle.here,psm was merely unreasonable in not settling and paying willow inn claim in a fair and timely manner.willow inn claim was limited to repairing wind damage,so txo production potential harm analysis is inapposite 
psm and its amicus argue that the award on willow inn contract claim is the compensatory award,and that campbell ratio guidance caps the punitive damages award at.though this solution has the virtue of clarity,the is a red herring,and we do not adopt it as a term of the ratio analysis.the award relates to only one aspect of psm bad faith unreasonable refusal to pay on the policy provision defraying willow inn costs of preparing the proof of is in no way indicative of the sum of psm culpability section allows punitive damages awards even in the absence of other successful claims brought by the plaintiff,see march paradise mut.ins,in which case,according to psm argument,it would be impossible to formulate a ratio.thus,as here,when an insurance claim has been settled and paid,pennsylvania bad faith statute provides insurance claimants a means of redressing unreasonable delays by their insurers.klinger state farm mut.auto.ins,cir upholding a punitive damages award on a delay claim where the insurance claim had been settled by an arbitrator before the bad faith claim was filed.therefore,we view the award on willow inn contract claim to be incidental to the punitive damages award.it would be an improper term to use in
