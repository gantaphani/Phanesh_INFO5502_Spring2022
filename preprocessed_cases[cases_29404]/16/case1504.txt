the basis for this interlocutory appeal pursuant to b is the district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration of a contractual dispute among three insurers.the district court concluded that because of the act the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards convention and federal legislation providing that the convention shall be enforced in united states courts,found in,are reverse preempted by.ann.we disagree.
louisiana safety association of insurers fund lsat is,as its name implies,a fund operating in louisiana.it provided workers compensation insurance for its members.certain underwriters at lloyd,london the underwriters provided excess insurance to lsat by reinsuring claims for occurrences that exceeded the amount of lsat retention.each reinsurance agreement contained an arbitration provision.
safety national casualty corporation safety national also provides excess workers compensation coverage and alleges that in a loss portfolio transfer agreement,lsat assigned its rights under the reinsurance agreements with the underwriters to safety national.the underwriters refused to recognize the assignment,contending that lsat obligations were strictly personal and therefore.
safety national sued the underwriters in federal district court.the underwriters filed an unopposed motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration.the district court initially granted that motion and stayed the lawsuit.
the underwriters initiated arbitration proceedings with safety national and lsat however,the parties could not agree upon how arbitrators were to be selected.the underwriters then filed a motion to lift the stay in order to join lsat as a party in the district court and to compel arbitration to resolve the dispute about how to compose the arbitration panel.in response,lsat moved to intervene,lift the stay,and quash arbitration.lsat asserted that the arbitration agreements were unenforceable under louisiana law.while those motions were pending,the underwriters filed a separate action against safety national and lsat seeking recovery of unpaid premiums under the policies.the district court consolidated the two actions.
the district court ultimately reconsidered its initial decision and granted lsat motion to quash arbitration.the district court concluded that although the convention would otherwise require arbitration,a louisiana that has been interpreted to prohibit arbitration agreements in insurance contracts was controlling.the district court reasoned that since that statute had the purpose of regulating the business of insurance within the meaning of the act,the louisiana statute reverse preempted the convention the district court subsequently certified that its order embodying these rulings involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate appeal pursuant to b may materially advance the termination of the litigation.we granted leave to appeal.
the louisiana statute at issue provides 
no insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state and covering subjects located,resident,or to be performed in this state shall contain any condition,stipulation,or agreement 
depriving the courts of this state of the jurisdiction of action against the insurer.
any such condition,stipulation,or agreement in violation of this section shall be void,but such voiding shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of the contract 
although it is not clear from this provision text that arbitration agreements are voided,louisiana courts have held that such agreements are unenforceable because of this statute 
the act provides that congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest,and that silence on the part of the congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several states.the act further provides,n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance 
the convention does not specifically relate to the business of insurance.nor do underwriters challenge the district court conclusion that.ann,when applied to disputes arising under reinsurance agreements between insurers,regulates the business of insurance within the meaning of the act accordingly,we will assume,without deciding,that the louisiana statute does regulate the business of insurance,although the matter is not entirely free from doubt.one of the criteria for determining whether a law regulates the business of insurance is whether it has the effect of spreading or transferring a policyholder risk the supreme court has emphasized that arbitration agreements are provisions and do not displace substantive rights afforded by a statute or other substantive law an argument could be made that at least in theory,resolving claims in an arbitration rather than in a court before a jury does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.however,this court has held in american bankers insurance of florida inman that the federal arbitration was reverse preempted by the act in the context of a dispute between an injured insured and his insurer regarding coverage governed by mississippi law therefore,this issue is foreclosed in this circuit and in any event is not before us.
the underwriters set forth three issues whether the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards is an act of congress within the meaning of the act the act applies to international commercial transactions,and the convention takes precedence over the act even if the latter applies to international transactions.for the reasons we consider below,we are persuaded that congress did not intend to include treaties within the scope of an act of congress when it used those words in the act,and we therefore do not reach other issues pressed by the underwriters.
lsat contends that treaties stand on equal footing with acts of congress,the convention was not and could only have effect in the courts of this country when congress passed enabling legislation,and therefore,the convention enabling legislation is the equivalent of an act of congress within the meaning of the act.lsat is correct that an act of congress is on full parity with a treaty w hen a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty,the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null.the underwriters maintain that the convention was ratified after the act was enacted and that in any event,the convention is,which means that it did not require an act of congress to have effect in united states courts.the underwriters assert that a treaty supercedes a federal statute if there is a conflict.the convention is not an act of congress,the underwriters alternatively contend,even if the convention was not,because a treaty is more than an act of congress.
it is unclear whether the convention is.the supreme court recent decision in medellin texas instructs that t he interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.in medellin,the court examined the vienna convention on consular and the optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes to the vienna to determine whether a judgment of the international court of justice icj was directly enforceable as domestic law in a state court in the united states.the united states had agreed to submit disputes arising out of the vienna convention to the icj,but the supreme court recognized that submitting to jurisdiction and agreeing to be bound are two different things.the court observed that the optional protocol says nothing about the effect of an icj decision and does not itself commit signatories to comply with an icj judgment.the court went on to consider any obligations imposed by article of the united nations charter,finding that it also does not provide that the united states shall or must comply with an icj decision,nor indicate that the senate that ratified the charter intended to vest icj decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts.by contrast,the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards expressly states that courts shall compel arbitration when requested by a party to an international arbitration agreement 
the court of a contracting state,when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article,shall,at the request of one of the parties,refer the parties to arbitration,unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,inoperative or incapable of being performed 
the convention additionally sets forth at least some procedures to be followed in obtaining enforcement of an arbitration award however,the supreme court indicated in dicta in medellin that at least the provisions of the convention pertaining to the enforcement of judgments of international arbitration tribunals are not this reference in medellin could be read to imply that the convention in its entirety is not,although such a conclusion can not be drawn with any certainty from the brief discussion in the court opinion.
but even if the convention required legislation to implement it in united states courts,that does not mean that congress intended an act of congress,as that phrase is used in the act,to include a treaty.implementing legislation does not replace or displace a treaty.a treaty remains something more than an act of congress.it is an international agreement or contract negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the senate not congress.the fact that a treaty stands on equal footing with legislation when implemented by congress does not mean that it ceases to be a treaty and becomes an act of congress.
the supreme court has indicated that the preemptive reach of the act was not intended to extend to the conduct of foreign affairs.the supreme court considered in american insurance ass garamendi whether a state law,aimed at aiding holocaust victims by requiring insurers to disclose information about insurance policies sold in europe before and during world war ii,interfered with the federal government conduct of foreign relations the president of the united states had entered into an executive agreement with germany chancellor in which the united states agreed that whenever a german company was sued in an american court regarding a claim,the united states government would submit a statement that it would be in the foreign policy interests of the united states for the foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for the resolution of all asserted claims against german companies arising from their involvement in the national socialist era and world war ii.this and other executive agreements regarding holocaust claims had not been ratified as treaties by the united states senate but were instead acts solely of the executive branch.the supreme court observed that g enerally,valid executive agreements are fit to preempt state law,just as treaties are,and if the agreements here had expressly preempted laws like california law,the issue would be straightforward.the court ultimately concluded that the state law conflicted with presidential foreign policy as expressed in executive agreements with foreign nations and was preempted in addressing california argument that in the act congress authorized state laws of the sort california had enacted,the court said,
as the text itself makes clear,the point of legislative choice of leaving insurance regulation generally to the states was to limit congressional preemption under the commerce power,whether dormant or exercised a federal statute directed to implied preemption by domestic commerce legislation can not sensibly be construed to address preemption by executive conduct in foreign affairs 
we think it unlikely that when congress crafted the act,it intended any future treaty implemented by an act of congress to be abrogated to the extent that treaty conflicted in some way with a state law regulating the business of insurance if congress implementing legislation did not expressly save the treaty from reverse preemption by state law.if this had been congress intent,it seems probable that congress would have included or any treaty requiring congressional implementation or similar language following act of congress and such act when it said,n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.there is no indication in the act that congress intended,through the preemption provision and the use of the term act of congress,to restrict the united states ability to negotiate and implement a treaty that might affect some aspect of international insurance agreements in the same way that other international agreements would be affected by the terms of the treaty.if that were congress intent,it would seem,as we have said,that congress would have more clearly articulated its design.
most importantly,there is no apparent reason why congress would have chosen to distinguish in the act between treaties that are and those that are not.it is undisputed that if the provisions in the convention directing courts to enforce international arbitration agreements were,then the act would have no preemptive effect because treaties are not an act of congress.no rationale has been offered by anyone as to why congress would have intended to include a treaty that requires implementation by congress within the reach of the act reverse preemption provisions but not treaties.
we are aware that the second circuit has held that the convention is not,and therefore,relies upon an act of congress for its implementation.as a consequence,the second circuit held congress implementing legislation did not preempt a kentucky statute that subordinated all choice of law or arbitration provisions in a contract to which an insolvent insurer in liquidation proceedings was a party the court reasoned that when the terms of a treaty import a either of the parties engages to perform a particular act,the treaty addresses itself to the political,not the judicial department and the legislature must execute the contract,before it can become a rule for the court.the court then quoted the n o act of congress provision in the act and said,a ccordingly,the implementing legislation does not preempt the kentucky liquidation act 
we agree,of course,that when provisions of a treaty are not,they can not be enforced in a court in this country unless and until those provisions are implemented by congress.but,we submit,this does not answer the question of what congress intended when it used the terms n o act of congress and such act in or why congress would have addressed only treaties that required implementation by congress.the text of the act does not support the inclusion by implication of a treaty implemented by an act of congress.because we give the phrases act of congress and such act their usual,commonly understood meaning,we conclude that treaties,or not,are not reverse preempted by the act.
the supreme court decision in missouri reflects that a treaty followed by implementing legislation,may accomplish more than either treaty or an act of congress,standing alone.the united states had consummated a treaty with great britain to protect migratory birds,and the treaty stated that the two powers would take or propose to their lawmaking bodies the necessary measures for carrying the treaty out.accordingly,the treaty was not.an act was passed giving effect to the convention,directing the secretary of agriculture to promulgate regulations and prohibiting the killing of migratory birds except as permitted by regulations compatible with the treaty the state of missouri sought to prohibit the enforcement of the migratory bird treaty act and the secretary regulations,arguing that the statute interfered with rights reser
