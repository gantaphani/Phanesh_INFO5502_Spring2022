factual background 
this suit arose from a dispute regarding a purchase option contained in a lease agreement the lease on a property located in dallas,texas the property.in december,petula leased a commercial building to dolco for a term.the lease was amended twice.the lease provided both a renewal and a purchase option for dolco.in paragraph of the lease,dolco was afforded the opportunity to purchase the property for the set price of,plus costs,during the first five years of the lease,or for the fair market value during the next five years of the lease.in november,however,the purchase option and rental payment provisions of the lease were altered due to dolco reorganization.while the period for purchasing the property at the set price was it now expired at on august,the fair market value option period was shortened from five years to five days after the first option expired.further,dolco rental payments were graduated,so that dolco would pay reduced rents in the first five years of the amended lease,with the reduction to be made up by increased rents thereafter.
according to both the original and the amended lease,the fair market value of the property was to be determined in accordance with the valuation procedure outlined in paragraph of the lease.pursuant to paragraph,the parties were first required to attempt to reach agreement on the fair market value of the property.if those negotiations failed,the parties were each required to select an appraiser to value the property the average of the appraisers estimates would constitute the fair market value of the property.if,however,the appraisers valuations differed by more than ten percent,the appraisers were to select a third appraiser to value the property.
in accordance with the lease purchase provision,dolco informed petula on august,of its intent to exercise its option to purchase the property for fair market value.the parties were,however,unsuccessful in their attempt to reach an agreement regarding the fair market value of the property.as a consequence,each party hired an appraiser to value the premises.dolco appraiser determined that the property should be valued without regard to the lease,and therefore valued the property at million.petula appraiser determined that the term fair market value should include the value of the lease,and therefore appraised the property at million.because of the divergence in the appraiser valuations,a third appraiser was selected.the third appraiser,however,recused himself before valuing the property.
after the third appraiser withdrew,petula refused to allow another appraiser to be appointed,and instead filed a declaratory judgment action in texas state court.dolco removed the case to federal district court,and requested summary judgment.the questions before the court were whether dolco caused the third appraiser to withdraw,and whether the lease should be considered in determining the fair market value of the property.the district court held that dolco actions with regard to the appraiser did not constitute a breach of the lease,and thus that dolco was entitled to specific performance of the lease in addition,the district court ordered that another appraiser be appointed,and that the factors in paragraph controlled whether the lease should be considered in determining the fair market value of the property.because the lease was not listed as a factor in paragraph,the court determined that the lease should not be included in the valuation.on june,a new appraiser determined that the property was worth million and thereafter dolco requested a closing date.
prior to the proposed closing date,dolco informed petula that the lease required petula to provide a warranty deed free of liens or encumbrances at closing.petula,however,argued that pursuant to paragraph d of the lease,it could tender the property subject to its first lien mortgage of million.thereupon dolco filed a summary judgment motion arguing that petula could not encumber the property,and that dolco should receive an equitable accounting and attorneys fees.petula filed a for summary judgment arguing that paragraph d allowed the property to be encumbered by the lien,and that because of the provision in the lease,dolco was not entitled to an equitable accounting or attorneys fees.
the district court held that petula interpretation of paragraph d was incorrect,and that petula could not transfer the property subject to the lien because petula did not have positive equity in the property.further,the district court granted dolco request for attorneys fees because the court found that paragraph of the lease contemplated the assessment of attorneys fees.the court also granted dolco request for an equitable accounting for the rents paid by dolco from july,forward.although dolco had requested an accounting from december,or one month after the original third appraiser resigned,the court determined that july,was the appropriate date,because that was date on which the closing should have occurred following the june,appraisal.
petula appeals three of the district court holdings first,that the lease should not be considered in determining the fair market value of the property second,that petula may not transfer the property to dolco subject to the existing first lien mortgage and third,that petula may be held liable to dolco for an equitable accounting and attorneys fees.dolco appeals the district court decision to start the equitable accounting period on july,rather than on december,as dolco had requested.
standard of review 
this suit involves the interpretation of terms included in the lease.because the suit was brought under diversity jurisdiction,the district court applied texas law regarding contract interpretation.under texas law,summary judgment may be granted if the terms of a contract are not ambiguous,such that they can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation.coker coker.in the present case,the district court concluded,and the parties did not dispute,that the provisions of the lease are unambiguous.the district court then granted summary judgment in favor of dolco regarding the interpretations of the phrase fair market value,the provisions governing how the purchase price for the property should be paid,and the provisions limiting petula personal liability under the lease.we review the district court conclusions de novo.see eeoc boeing services int l,cir.
discussion 
fair market value 
paragraph of the lease provides in relevant part 
in determining the prevailing fair market rate or fair market value for the purposes of a provision in the lease,such rate or value shall be the rate or value,as the case may be,which landlord and tenant shall mutually agree upon,considering like premises in the dallas,texas area,of the same quality and age of the building and also considering the length of the renewal term then under consideration as to fair market rate,and the quality,utility and location of the space involved.
texas courts have consistently defined fair market value broadly to mean the price a piece of property would receive on the open market if the seller and buyer were not compelled to enter into the transaction.see state w
