between november and february,verizon new england,inc.vne began requiring its field technicians to carry cell phones during work.vne supervisors need to stay in touch with field technicians,who are assigned to work on installation projects around massachusetts and rhode island,and vne found a previous company policy reliant on paging devices to be inefficient and cumbersome.the cell phones contain a global positioning system gps,which allows vne to determine the location of each field technician through a monitoring service known as field force manager.
plaintiffs are vne field technicians who are admittedly represented by a union,the international brotherhood of electrical workers,local the union,which has a collective bargaining agreement cba with vne.the plaintiffs assert that by requiring them to carry these phones,vne violated their privacy rights under article of the declaration of rights in the massachusetts constitution and.laws ch,and their rights as alleged beneficiaries of a contract between vne and verizon wireless,which they say required vne to receive consent from its employees when it instituted the phone policy.
this is the second lawsuit before this court involving employee discontent with vne new cell phone policy.in february,vne brought the first lawsuit against a pair of union locals,asserting that they had violated a cba clause in response to the cell phone policy and other vne actions.see verizon new england,int l of workers,local,wl cir.june.these violations,vne argued,warranted injunctive relief under boys markets,retail clerks union,local,as they deprived the company of the benefit of arbitration under the cba.we describe some of the facts relevant to this suit in that prior decision,which affirmed a denial of injunctive relief against one of the locals but vacated and remanded a denial of declaratory relief against it.see verizon new england,wl,at.
in june,a little more than four months after vne filed that suit,the plaintiffs filed this suit.before this filing,rather than grieve the new cell phone rule,the union had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board nlrb in january.the charge alleged that the rule constituted a change in working conditions over which vne was required to bargain.on june,the nlrb deferred the charge to arbitration because the issue arose from the cba.the plaintiff employee union members,represented by the same counsel who represent the union,filed suit in state court the next day asserting the two claims.
vne removed this case to the federal district court and moved for summary judgment.the plaintiffs then to remand the case for lack of jurisdiction.in its motion and opposition to the plaintiffs motion,vne argued that the plaintiffs claims are preempted by of the labor management relations act lmra,a,as well as,pursuant to san diego building trades council garmon,the national labor relations act nlra,and that at any rate the plaintiffs beneficiary claim fails as a matter of law.in their motion and opposition to vne motion,the plaintiffs argued that the claims are not preempted and that therefore the case should be remanded to the state court,and vne had not established sufficient undisputed facts to warrant a grant of summary judgment on their beneficiary claim.in so arguing,the plaintiffs asserted that they must be allowed discovery to establish that they were intended beneficiaries of the contract between vne and verizon.
the district court entered summary judgment for vne and denied plaintiffs motion to remand.haggins verizon new england,inc,d.the court held that the privacy claims were preempted under,but did not address whether the beneficiary claim was preempted.it then granted summary judgment for vne on the merits.we affirm the dismissal of the claims.
the plaintiffs do not dispute that,as union members,they are subject to the cba entered by vne and the union.in relevant part,the cba provides the following.under an article entitled management rights,the agreement states 
subject only to the limitations contained in this agreement the company retains the exclusive right to manage its business including but not limited to the right to determine the methods and means by which its operations are to be carried on,to assign and direct the work force and to conduct its operations in a safe and effective manner.
the cba also outlines a grievance process,defining grievance as a complaint involving the interpretation or application of any of the provisions of this agreement or a complaint that an employee or group of employees for whom the union is the bargaining agent has,in any manner,been unfairly treated.grievances may be subjected to arbitration consonant with requirements set out in the cba.
vne asserts that it adopted the cell phone policy at issue in this litigation pursuant to the management rights clause of the cba.the plaintiffs work as central office equipment installation technicians coei techs and install telephone equipment for vne.although coei techs have reporting headquarters,they often work on installation projects elsewhere in massachusetts and rhode island,which can take days,weeks,or even months.vne requires that coei techs stay in touch with their supervisors during these projects.before vne adopted the disputed policy,it provided coei techs with pagers when a supervisor contacted a coei tech by pager,the coei tech would need to find a phone and call the supervisor back.
in switching from pagers to cell phones,vne apparently sought to improve its communication with coei techs,streamline its administrative systems,and enhance its ability to locate coei techs working in the field.the cell phones vne selected not only enable supervisors to call coei techs directly they also contain a feature called field force manager ffm that possesses more advanced capabilities ffm makes it possible for employees to punch in and out of work remotely,submit standardized forms,and receive driving instructions,customer contact information,and mass text messages from their supervisors.it also has a feature that can determine an employee hours worked from the punch in and punch out system and link this information to vne payroll system.most important here,ffm has a gps function that allows vne to monitor the location of the phones.
vne describes the utility of this gps tracking function with reference to improving its ability to respond quickly to emergencies.in particular,vne emphasizes that when an emergency arises,this monitoring capability allows supervisors to quickly identify the coei techs in the area so they can assign them to the job.vne also emphasizes that the gps function is responsible for ffm ability to transmit driving instructions and process employee punch ins and punch outs,though it is not clear why this necessitates that vne monitor the location of the phones.at any rate,vne acknowledges that the gps feature allows it to determine whether an employee is not where he or she is supposed to be when phones are to ffm.in relevant part,vne work rules concerning the phones,adopted in october,state employees will not shut off,disable field force manager,or render useless the gps functionality of the phone during working hours.
vne began purchasing these phones from verizon wireless in october and issued them to employees between and early february.on january,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the nlrb,alleging that vne had begun requiring employees to use mobile telephones enabled with a gps tracking system without giving the union notice or an opportunity to bargain to the extent required by law.six months later,on june,the nlrb deferred the union labor charge on the grounds that the dispute here involved arises from the contract between the parties,and the contractual procedures are available for resolving the dispute.the nlrb deferral letter noted as well that vne had notified the board that it was willing to arbitrate the dispute underlying this charge.
on april,while the nlrb charge was still pending,the union outside counsel sent a letter on behalf of vne employees to verizon wireless.it is undisputed that the cell pho
