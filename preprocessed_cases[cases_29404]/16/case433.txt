background 
we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the summary judgment loser here,the plaintiff,consistent with record support,cir.
the defendant is a nevada corporation that maintains its principal place of business in california.it manufactures products,dietary supplements,and other personal care items.the company markets its wares through a network of independent distributors,who can earn money through three channels.first,distributors purchase products from the company at a sizable discount,mark them up,and resell them to consumers.second,distributors become sponsors by enlisting recruits who,in the idiom of the trade,are known as downline distributors and earn commissions on products that these downline distributors purchase from the company.finally,distributors benefit from the recruiting efforts of their downline distributors as the defendant pays royalties to sponsors based on purchases attributable to their recruits who,in the idiom of the trade,become part of the initial distributor lineage.the sustainability of this business model depends on ensuring that each downline distributor is assigned to a single sponsor.
the plaintiff,a foreign national who resided in massachusetts between and,became a herbalife distributor by executing a distributorship contract the contract on july.the parties agree that the contract incorporates by reference the terms of herbalife career book,which contains both a sales and marketing plan the plan lining the terms of compensation,and the rules of conduct and distributor policies the rules 
the rules are of particular interest here.pertinently,rule specifies that a n individual may have only one herbalife distributorship under one sponsor.that command is designed to prohibit dual distributorships,that is,the pairing of a single downline distributor with more than one sponsor.rule speaks to the parties rights in the event of a violation of rule 
if herbalife determines that an individual has signed an application for distributorship,or has worked or assisted in the development of another distributorship while obligated to a prior distributorship,herbalife has sole and absolute discretion to determine the disposition of both distributorships,as well as any penalties or sanctions it deems necessary and appropriate for the distributorship and the sponsoring organization s.
rule also states that the first sponsor to recruit a distributor and have him execute a contract with the defendant is considered the valid distributorship.
other generally applicable provisions of the rules cede broad discretion to the defendant with respect to violations of the rules.for example,rule stipulates that when an infraction has occurred,the defendant may in its sole discretion take whatever actions or measures it deems necessary and appropriate,including but not limited to suspension of earnings.similar language in enforcement procedure says that,should a violation occur,the defendant,i n its sole and absolute discretion may impose any remedy or sanction it determines best addresses the issue.
in,the plaintiff alerted the defendant that as many as of his downline distributors had been enticed by pirate sponsors to sign second distributorship agreements in violation of the prohibition on dual distributorships.he requested,inter alia,that the defendant restore to him the commissions and royalties attributable to these downline distributors.the defendant response was painfully slow for a period of approximately four years,it investigated the entangled lineages.the defendant eventually determined that certain of the identified downline distributors had belonged in the plaintiff lineage.by letter dated february,the defendant informed the plaintiff that it would restore these downline distributors to his lineage on a basis,but without monetary adjustments.put bluntly,the defendant refused to compensate the plaintiff for the commissions and royalties that had been misallocated during the currency of the dual distributorships.
ii.travel of the case 
on february,the plaintiff brought suit in a massachusetts state court alleging breach of contract.in an amended complaint,he added counts based on quantum meruit,promissory estoppel,and implied contract.
noting the diverse citizenship of the parties and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,the defendant removed the case to the federal district court.see a.following a period of pretrial discovery,the district court directed the parties to file for summary judgment.the parties complied 
the placed the parties at loggerheads.the plaintiff argued that summary judgment ought to be entered in his favor because the contract entitled him to the diverted payments.for its part,the defendant argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because its decision not to compensate the plaintiff for the bygone purchases made by the disputed downline distributors and their progeny was within the discretion conferred by the contract.in due course,the lower court granted the defendant motion and denied the plaintiff.the court concluded that under the plain terms of the contract,it was within the defendant discretion to refuse to reallocate the diverted payments and,therefore,no breach of contract had occurred.okmyansky,d at.this timely appeal ensued.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiff advances two sets of arguments in support of his claim of error.first,he asserts that the contract obligated the defendant to recompense him for the diverted payments.as a subset of this argument,he maintains that he had fully complied with the rules,so the defendant was not at liberty to exercise its contractual discretion to extinguish the payment obligation second,he asseverates that even if the contract does not protect him,he is entitled to recovery on an equitable basis.after delineating the standard of review,we address each of these arguments in turn.
standard of review.
a nisi prius court may grant summary judgment whenever the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.these components are familiar an issue is genuine if a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party,united states v.one parcel of real,cir,and a fact is material if it has the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law,amusements,town of dedham,cir.
