on april,smith signed a proof of statement verifying her husband death and submitted it to aflac.on may,aflac paid smith after determining that the accident was an other accident under the terms of the policy.aflac refused to classify the accident as a accident,because it stated that the helicopter had not been an airplane,train,bus,trolley,or boat that operated on a regularly scheduled basis between predetermined points or cities.
smith sued aflac,seeking in additional benefits,as well as attorneys fees and penalties under.ann.b on the ground that aflac had acted in bad faith by refusing to classify her husband accident as a accident.smith initiated the suit by amending the petition of a suit against rotorcraft and several other defendants that was already underway in louisiana state court.aflac removed the suit to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction and then successfully moved to sever all claims against rotorcraft and the other defendants 
aflac then moved for summary judgment to dismiss smith claims on the ground that the helicopter crash could not qualify as a accident under the terms of the policy,because a helicopter was not an airplane.aflac also moved for partial summary judgment to dismiss smith claims for penalties and attorneys fees on the ground that there was no evidence that aflac had acted in bad faith by denying her request for additional benefits.smith opposed both of aflac motions and filed a for summary judgment,arguing that the language of the policy was ambiguous and therefore had to be interpreted in favor of the policyholder under established principles of louisiana law.aflac filed a response to this motion in which it reasserted that a helicopter was not an airplane and added that,even if airplane were interpreted to include helicopters,smith helicopter could not have been a vehicle,because it had not been regularly scheduled between predetermined points or cities.aflac had not raised this regularly scheduled argument before,so smith requested a continuance to conduct additional discovery on the issue.the district court granted her request,but there is no indication that smith ever conducted any discovery on this issue.aflac claims that she did not,and smith does not deny this claim.
