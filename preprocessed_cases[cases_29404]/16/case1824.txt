cory cochran sought recovery on his personal injury negligence suit under an insurance policy issued to drillmark consulting,by group.cochran appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of the insurance company.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural history 
drillmark consulting,drillmark,nabors drilling usa,nabors,and defendant services.services all contracted with union pacific resources company upr to perform various functions on an oil drilling operation.group contracted with drillmark to provide insurance for some of drillmark obligations arising from the upr drilling operation.drillmark contracted with upr to supervise the upr site overall and to report back to upr regarding the work of other contractors.drillmark assigned roy springfield to be the overall supervisor on the upr site.in the vernacular of drilling operations,springfield was the company man.
on july,cory cochran,a derrick hand employed by nabors,was injured while removing a cement head owned by services from the head casing on top of the drilling rig.cochran filed a personal injury suit alleging negligence against,inter alia,services,nabors,upr,and drillmark.drillmark supervisor springfield was not present at the scene of cochran accident with the cement head.cochran alleged that springfield absence constituted a failure to supervise by drillmark that caused cochran injury.
cochran later added as a defendant,seeking recovery from the insurer pursuant to the insurance contract between and drillmark,which contract provided for defense and indemnification of drillmark by for any covered obligations denied drillmark coverage for obligations arising from cochran suit based on a provision within the policy that excludes coverage for any obligations arising due to drillmark furnishing professional services on the upr operation.on june,moved for summary judgment claiming no liability under the policy it issued to drillmark.on august,based on the district court finding that the professional services exclusion applied to drillmark alleged failure to supervise removal of the cement head,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of insurer.cochran,nabors,and drillmark collectively,the appellants timely appeal that summary judgment 
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.chaney new orleans pub.facility,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
iii.obligation to provide coverage to drillmark 
the district court applied louisiana law to hold that the professional services exclusion provision in the insurance contract released from any insurance liability arising from cochran suit as a matter of law in deciding cases governed by state law,we are bound by applicable decisions of the state highest court.see,gaia techs.recycled prods,cir citation omitted.the louisiana supreme court has yet to interpret the scope of the precise type of professional services exclusion provision implicated in this case in like circumstances.in the absence of a decision on point by the louisiana supreme court,we must ascertain how that court would rule if faced with the interpretation of the scope of the provision.see id.to accomplish that task,we may look for guidance from decisions by louisiana intermediate appellate courts,see,and decisions by federal courts applying louisiana law.see state farm mut.auto.ins.coviello,cir citation omitted meridian mut.ins.kellman,cir citation omitted.
the professional services exclusion provision within the insurance contract reads in relevant part 
architects or surveyors professional liability this insurance does not apply to bodily injury,property damage arising out of the rendering of or failure to render any professional services by drillmark or any engineer,architect or surveyor who is either employed by drillmark or performing work on drillmark behalf in such capacity.professional services include.the preparing,approving,or failure to prepare or approve maps,shop drawings,opinions,reports,surveys,field orders,change orders or drawings and specifications and.supervisory,inspection,architectural,or engineering activities.
emphasis added.as one louisiana appellate court recently reiterated,such exclusion provisions are common to commercial or comprehensive general liability insurance contracts known as cgl insurance such as the contract between and drillmark.see smith travelers prop.cir,so d.such provisions reflect the fact that insured professionals,such as engineers,on drilling operations for example,ordinarily carry special insurance separate from the cgl policy to cover obligations arising from the rendering of professional services.see id.citing mccarthy berman,so d.
as the appellants correctly point out,the district court erred by stating that courts applying louisiana law construe these exclusion provisions broadly.rather,it is louisiana law that all insurance contract exclusion provisions are construed strictly against the insurer,and any ambiguity is construed in favor of the insured.id.at quoting ledbetter concord,so d,internal citation omitted.however,the rule of strict construction does not authorize a perversion of language,or the exercise of inventive powers for the purpose of creating an ambiguity where none exists.id.at quoting ledbetter,so d at internal quotation and citation omitted.it is also louisiana law that the insurance provider has the burden of proving that an exclusion unambiguously applies.see,arnette npc.cir,so d,citing gaylord chem.propump.cir,so d.moreover,s ummary judgment declaring a lack of coverage under an insurance policy may not be rendered unless there is no reasonable interpretation of the policy,when applied to the undisputed material facts shown by the evidence supporting the motion,under which coverage could be afforded.smith,so d at citing reynolds select,so d.consequently,contrary to the district court portrayal,louisiana law places a heavy burden on when that insurer seeks to exclude insureds from coverage via the type of professional services provision at issue in this case,especially on motion for summary judgment.
this court has at least twice interpreted the scope of professional service exclusion provisions in insurance contracts,which provisions were materially indistinguishable from the provision,with contrasting results.see natural gas pipeline of am.odom offshore surveys,cir finding in favor of an insurance company under louisiana law that a professional services exclusion provision excluded coverage for obligations arising due to allegedly negligent anchor placement by a surveyor on a pipeline operation thermo terratech gdc,cir finding in favor of insureds under louisiana law that a professional services exclusion provision did not exclude coverage for obligations arising due to allegedly negligent removal of a part within a hazardous waste incinerator by the employee of an incinerator design contractor.the district court in this case relied upon our decision in odom to interpret the meaning of the term supervisory as it appears in the exclusion include the allegedly negligent action by drillmark that gave rise to cochran suit,specifically failure to supervise removal of the cement head.the district court thus concluded that the provision excluded coverage for any failure by drillmark to supervise cement head removal.close examination of odom,along with our more recent decision in thermo terratech,however,indicates that the district court interpretation of the scope of the instant exclusion provision is flawed.
in odom,an insured surveyor contractor was hired to survey a pipeline project and to guide a dive vessel during anchoring operations.at.after an anchor injured the pipeline,the surveyor contractor was sued for negligence.id.the surveyor cgl insurance policy included the following professional services exclusion provision,which provision is analogous to the provision 
this insurance does not apply if the insured is an architect,engineer or surveyor,to bodily injury or property damage arising out of professional services performed by such insured,including the preparation or approval of maps,drawings,opinions,reports,surveys,change orders,designs,or specifications,and supervisory,inspection,or engineering services.
id.at.we rejected an argument that the employees responsible for negligent anchor placement were merely navigating,but not surveying,at the time of the accident.see id.we instead credited testimony that the acts performed were generally recognized as surveying services.id.at.we also credited testimony relied upon by the district court in that case that the employees of the contractor required training as a surveyor to operate the necessary equipment and to perform the allegedly negligent anchor placement tasks.see id.
in odom,we further cited to a definition of professional services first set forth by a louisiana intermediate appellate court in aker sabatier,so d.see odom,at.that definition from aker states that p rofessional services,in its usual connotation,means services performed by one in the ordinary course of the practice of his profession,on behalf of another,pursuant to some agreement,express or implied,and for which it could reasonably be expected some compensation would be due.id.quoting aker,so d at.relying on that aker definition,we interpreted louisiana law in odom to require a court to look to the nature of the particular service allegedly negligently provided or not provided to determine whether that service was recognized as a professional service of the type included within the category of professional services that the contractor agreed to provide.see at.we also relied on a finding by the district court that the surveyor had contracted to provide both the survey of the ocean floor and the interpretation and translation of that information into correct anchor placements.id.we found,therefore,that the contractor failure in anchor placement easily fall s within the professional services category of services required under its contract.id.at.we thus concluded that the provision at issue excluded coverage for any suit arising from a failure to properly place the anchor.see id.
in contrast,in our more recent decision thermo terratech,we interpreted a professional services exclusion provision in a cgl policy,which provision likewise is materially indistinguishable from the provision,to find that the provision did not exclude coverage by the insurer.see at.in so doing,we distinguished odom in a manner that is instructive in this case.see id.in thermo terratech,an insurer issued a cgl insurance policy to a hazardous incineration job operator.id.at.the incineration job operator hired a contractor to design,develop,manufacture,and deliver a portable incinerator to an incineration plant.id.at.an employee of the design contractor,an engineer,was assigned to the plant as a lead operator,and his primary duty was to train the employees of the incineration job operator to operate the incinerator.id.at the request of the incineration job operator,the design contractor employee disrupted power to the control panel of the incinerator to facilitate removal of a speed control driver for repair.id.at.by doing so,the employee thereby disconnect ed some recirculat ion pumps.id.a fire in the incinerator ensued shortly after the power to the control panel was disconnected.id.
claims were filed against the design contractor to recover amounts paid in settlement due to the fire based on the allegedly negligent removal of the driver.id.at.the design contractor prevailed,and the suit for repayment of fire damages was dismissed the design contractor then filed suit against the incineration job operator to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in defending the claims.id.at.as a threshold matter,we determined that the cgl policy held by the incinerator operator in thermo terratech,which provided for indemnification and defense to the incinerator operator for obligations arising from the incineration operation,extended to cover obligations owed by the design contractor as well.see id.at 
the cgl insurer in thermo terratech claimed,however,that the professional services exclusion provision in the cgl policy in that case excluded coverage for obligations arising due to the removal of the incinerator driver.id.the exclusion provision in thermo terratech,which is materially indistinguishable from the provision,reads in relevant part 
it is agreed that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the rendering of or the failure to render any professional services by or for the name insured,including supervisory,inspection or engineering services.
in reversing summary judgment that was granted in favor of the insurer,we noted that under louisiana law,where an insurance exclusion is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,a court must adopt the interpretation that provides coverage to the insured.id.at citing talley blue cross blue shield of.cir,so d.we further cited to the same aker definition of professional services relied upon by the district court in this case.see id.at quoting aker,so d at internal quotation and citation omitted.we then reiterated the test we outlined in odom that was developed by louisiana appellate courts for interpretation of the scope of professional service exclusion provisions such as the provision 
to determine whether services are professional in nature,we look t o the character of the services performed,such as whether special knowledge and technical expertise are required,rather than the title or character of the party performing the services.acts which could have been done by an unskilled or untrained employee are not subject to a professional services exclusion.professional services involve discretion acquired by special training and the exercise of special judgment.
id.at internal quotation and citations omitted citing am.cas.hartford ins,so d,which decision in turn notes that the test was first set forth in sara mayo,so d.we interpreted this test,along with the aker definition,to require that for the professional liability exclusion to apply in thermo terratech,the fire and resulting property damage must have arisen from the negligent employee rendering,or his failure to render,an engineering service.id.
we then noted that it was undisputed in thermo terratech that some of the incineration job operator employees,none of whom were professional engineers,had been trained to assess the incinerator logs and control panel prior to disconnecting power to the system so that several employees had the training necessary to remove the damaged driver.id.at.we found,therefore,that although the actions taken by the allegedly negligent design contractor employee could not have been performed by an individual not trained to operate the incinerator,such actions could have been performed by individuals who had neither engineering training,nor the ability to exercise special judgment unique to the field of engineering.id.at.we thus concluded in thermo terratech that the actions taken by the design contractor employee were not engineering services and,therefore,fall outside the scope of the professional liability exclusion contained in the cgl policy.id.citation omitted.
in so concluding in thermo terratech,we distinguished odom on its facts,noting that there was a substantial amount of evidence in odom to show that the services being performed,specifically anchor placement,were of the type generally recognized as surveying,thus constituting professional services for the purpose of the exclusion.id.at quoting odom,at.we then contrasted the circumstance of thermo terratech,reasoning that the facts show that the actions taken in thermo terratech were not required to satisfy the engineering portion of the contract as,at the time the actions were taken,the employee was not in the process of designing,developing,or otherwise acting within the course of the practice of his engineering profession on behalf of the allegedly negligent contractor.id.we therefore found that the exclusion did not apply and found in favor of the insured.id.
