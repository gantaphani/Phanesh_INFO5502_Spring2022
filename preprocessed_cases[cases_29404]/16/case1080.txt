opinion of the court 
john facenda,a philadelphia broadcasting legend,provided his voice to many productions of nfl films,before his death in.these productions recounted tales of the national football league with filmed highlights,background music,and facenda commanding narration.more than two decades after facenda death,nfl films used small portions of his work in a production about the football video game madden nfl.that production,entitled the making of madden nfl,sparked this controversy.
facenda estate the estate sued nfl films,the national football league,and nfl properties which we refer to collectively,where appropriate,as the nfl in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the estate claims that the program use of facenda voice falsely suggested that facenda endorsed the video game,violating the federal lanham act,which deals with trademarks and related theories of intellectual property.the estate also claims that the program was an unauthorized use of facenda name or likeness in violation of pennsylvania right of publicity statute.in its defense the nfl argued,among other things,that its copyrights in the original nfl films productions that facenda narrated gave it the exclusive right to use portions of those productions soundtracks as it saw fit,including in the television piece at issue.
we must resolve this clash between parties claiming different types of intellectual property.although we agree with much of the court trademark analysis,for the reasons that follow we vacate the court grant of summary judgment for the estate and remand for trial on the lanham act claim.we affirm,however,the district court grant of summary judgment to the estate on the pennsylvania claim.
facenda won national acclaim for his nfl films work.his estate credits that fame to the special qualities of his voice.in various depositions,several representatives for nfl films described facenda deep baritone voice as distinctive,recognizable,legendary,and as known by many football fans as the voice of god.as recently as,nfl films released works branded as featuring the legendary voice of john facenda.
for decades,facenda worked on a basis under an oral agreement,receiving a fee.but shortly before he died from cancer in,facenda signed a standard release contract stating that nfl films enjoys the unequivocal rights to use the audio and visual film sequences recorded of me,or any part of them in perpetuity and by whatever media or manner nfl films sees fit,provided,however,such use does not constitute an endorsement of any product or service.
in,nfl films produced the making of madden nfl about the released annual update of the video game that simulates nfl games.this production is minutes long and was shown on the nfl network eight times in a span leading up to the release of the video game to retail stores.it featured interviews with nfl players,the game producers,and others.it also included several sequences comparing the video game virtual environment with the actual nfl environment,extolling the realism of everything from the stadiums to the game play.the end of the program featured a countdown to the video game release.
the district court found that not a single critical observation was made in this video regarding madden nfl all the commentary was positive.other media,outside of the nfl network,also covered the release of the game and addressed similar topics albeit with the inclusion of the occasional criticism or recitation of the game perceived faults.
the program used sound recordings,taken from earlier nfl films productions,of three sentences read by facenda pro football,the game for the ear and the eye,this sport is more than spectacle,it is a game for all seasons,and x and o on the blackboard are translated into aggression on the field.these excerpts from his nfl films work total seconds of the program.in its opening brief to our court,the nfl admits that these excerpts were chosen to underscore the degree to which the video game authentically recreates the nfl experience.
the producers of the program used the excerpts in a slightly altered form.the sound waves in the original recording of facenda voice were digitally filtered to sound more like the synthesized speech one might hear from a computer.nfl films president steve sabol described the results of this aesthetic choice by the show producers as awful.
the nfl has an agreement with ea sports,the makers of madden nfl,which provides the nfl with royalty revenue in return for the use of the nfl intellectual property.various messages in the record suggest that nfl films sought to create the television program as a promotion for madden nfl,describing it as the madden promo or as the advertisements in actors release forms.but in their depositions,many nfl films executives testified that the program was a documentary and denied that it was a commercial or that it was motivated by promotional considerations.
ii.procedural history 
facenda estate initially sued the nfl for false endorsement under a of the lanham act,a,and for unauthorized use of name or likeness known as the right of publicity under.ann.the district court split the case into a liability phase and a damages phase.after discovery in the liability phase,the parties for summary judgment and agreed at a hearing that the district court could resolve the liability issues on the evidence already before it.the district court granted the estate motion for summary judgment on both the claim and the claim.facenda nfl films,d.
iii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction under because of the estate lanham act claims.it exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the claims under.
because our court has not yet issued an opinion interpreting the lanham act in the context of a claim,and because the district court perceived a conflict between our caselaw on the general interpretation of a a of the lanham act and a single case from the eastern district of pennsylvania which dealt with the specific issue of false endorsement,the district court certified the issue for interlocutory appeal.facenda nfl films,wl,at.may.it also certified whether copyright law preempts the estate claim because the caselaw across all federal courts of appeals does not reflect a consistent line of reasoning.id.at.we granted the petition for interlocutory appeal and have jurisdiction under b.
iv.standard of review 
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,reading all facts in the light most favorable to the party that did not move for summary estate.lucent info,lucent,cir.the estate argues that we review the district court factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard.but,to support this proposition,the estate cites a case reviewing a preliminary injunction.sandoz pharms,cir.we recently explained the important distinction between the standards of review for a preliminary injunction and summary judgment.doeblers.hybrids,doebler,cir.
failure to strictly observe the principles governing summary judgment becomes particularly significant in a trademark or tradename action,where summary judgments are the exception.country floors,composed of gepner ford,cir.on a summary judgment motion,the district court must not find facts.see doeblers,at a district court should not weigh the evidence and determine the truth itself,but should instead determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.rather,it should identify undisputed facts and resolve the remaining disputed facts in favor of the.for example,c redibility determinations that underlie findings of fact are appropriate to a bench verdict,but t hey are inappropriate to the legal conclusions necessary to a ruling on summary judgment.country floors,at.when considering the district court grant of summary judgment to the estate on a particular claim,the sole question before our court is whether plaintiff met its burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.doeblers,at.
false endorsement under the lanham act 
the estate alleges that the use of sound samples of facenda voice in the making of madden nfl falsely implied that the estate had agreed to endorse the video game that is the production subject.this false endorsement,they argue,violates a a of the lanham act.this provision reads as follows 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person 
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
a to prove a violation of a a in a false endorsement case,a plaintiff must show that its mark is legally protectable it owns the mark and the defendant use of the mark to identify its goods or services is likely to create confusion concerning the plaintiff sponsorship or approval of those goods or services.see commerce ins,commerce ins.agency,cir listing the three prongs of a a claim.
the nfl does not deny that courts broadly interpret the terms name,symbol,or device in a to include other indicia of identity,such as a person voice.see waits,cir holding that a claims based on voice are cognizable.nor does the nfl deny that facenda voice is distinctive and generally protectable as an unregistered mark.thus,the estate has satisfied the first prong of a a claim.the nfl also declines to contest the second the mark is owned by the estate.
our case thus focuses on the third prong whether the nfl use of facenda voice was likely to cause confusion among consumers by suggesting that facenda estate has an affiliation,connection,or association with ea sports video game implying that the estate sponsor s or approve s of that product.a a.
a.the legal standard for likelihood of confusion in false endorsement claims brought under a of the lanham act 
the nfl contends that the district court applied the wrong legal standard under a to the estate claim.it also argues that our constitution first amendment right to free speech prohibited application of the lanham act to its television production in this case.because the nfl first amendment defense presents a threshold issue that would affect how we apply trademark law in this case,we address that argument first.ultimately rejecting the first amendment defense,we outline the test courts use to evaluate the likelihood of consumer confusion when faced with a claim under a a.finally,we respond to the nfl various disagreements with the district court analysis.the nfl primary argument is that the legal standards under a a and a b do not differ from each other,which implies that the estate was required to bring evidence of actual confusion to prove a likelihood of confusion.we reject that argument and thus adopt a trademark analysis similar to the district court.
first amendment limits on the lanham act 
the nfl argues that its production constitutes informational expression,artistic expression,or both,and is thus protected by the first amendment.it asks our court to adopt the balancing test of the second circuit court of appeals decision in rogers grimaldi,which weighs the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion against the public interest in free expression,cir.in that case,the dancer and actress ginger rogers sued the producers and distributors of ginger and fred,a film about a pair of italian dancers nicknamed for rogers and fred astaire.the court rejected rogers claim.under the rogers test,the proper balance between trademark law and free expression will normally not support application of the lanham act unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,or the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.id.because the film title had an ironic and ambiguous meaning related to its subject,id.at,and did not directly state that it depicted rogers,concerns outweighed survey evidence that some members of the public would draw the incorrect inference that rogers had some involvement with the film,id.
the analysis of rogers has been adopted by three other courts of appeals.see parks laface records,cir applying rogers to a song title mattel,mca records,cir same sugar busters llc brennan,cir adopting rogers in a case concerning a book title.soon after announcing the rogers test,the second circuit stated that the test is generally applicable to lanham act claims against works of artistic expression,a category that includes parody.cliffs notes,bantam doubleday dell publ g group,cir applying rogers to a parody book cover.but we have identified only one federal appellate case other than cliffs notes that applies the rogers test to something other than the title of a creative work.see etw jireh publ g,cir applying rogers to a commemorative sports painting of tiger woods victory at the masters golf tournament in.but see id.at clay,dissenting declining to endorse the application of rogers in that case and arguing that the majority had applied rogers in a faulty fashion.
the nfl asks us also to adopt rogers and apply it to the use of the making of madden nfl.before considering whether either prong of the rogers test applies,however,we must decide whether the television production is a work of artistic expression,cliffs notes,at,as understood in the context of construing the lanham act narrowly to avoid a conflict with the first amendment,see rogers,at.although the district court did not address the nfl first amendment defense in its opinion the categorization of speech is a question of law that we must resolve through independent review of the program.see connick myers,d w e are compelled to examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they are made to see whether they are of a character which the principles of the first amendment protect.quotation marks omitted.
the nfl posits that its program,taken as a whole,is a work of artistic expression,and that the producers use of the particular sound clips at issue in this case represented an artistic choice.in the nfl view,the strong association between facenda voice and the nfl means that the use of his voice conveyed the message that madden nfl provides an accurate rendering of nfl game play.by applying digital sound effects to make the voice sound computerized and adding a metallic echo,the program producers aimed to connect the nfl history symbolized by facenda voice,which narrated much of that history to a modern video game symbolized by digital filtering of the voice.the nfl contends that it had the right to choose how to convey those messages,even if it meant using portions of recordings of facenda voice.
the nfl argues additionally that its program can not be mere commercial is defined as speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction,united states united foods,d,and is not as protected as artistic expression,it contains information that also appeared in news accounts of the release of madden nfl.this informational material includes descriptions of the video game realism,explanations of the game features,and reports of gamers and nfl players enthusiasm for the new version.in this sense,the nfl argues,its program functions as a documentary explaining how the video game was made and depicting the phenomenon of the game popularity.
the nfl also argues that,even if the program has promotional aspects a point which it concedes only for the sake of argument,they are inextricably intertwined with the artistic and informational elements,meaning that we must treat the program as fully protected speech.riley fed of the blind of,d applying exacting first amendment scrutiny to a state regulation of charitable solicitation materials see in re orthopedic bone screw prods.liab,cir stating that riley applies where speech consists of complex mixtures of commercial and noncommercial elements quoting bolger youngs drug prods,d stevens,concurring.
the estate contends that the program is commercial speech,and we agree.our court has three factors to consider in deciding whether speech is commercial is the speech an advertisement does the speech refer to a specific product or service and does the speaker have an economic motivation for the speech.healthcare,blue cross of greater,cir citing bolger,at.an affirmative answer to all three questions provides strong support for the conclusion that the speech is commercial.id.quoting bolger,at.this inquiry involves making a commonsense distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction and other varieties of speech.orthopedic bone screw,at quoting bolger,at.quoting ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d.
the first factor presents a novel issue,because the program is not a traditional or television advertisement.but ultimately the question is not close.the estate comparison of the program to a,infomercial is apt.like an infomercial,the program focuses on one product,explaining both how it works and the source of its innovations,all in a positive tone while it does not advertise the game price,the program did feature a clock at its ending that displayed the number of days until the video game release for sale.furthermore,the program was only broadcast eight times in a span immediately before the release of the video game to retail like an advertisement for an upcoming film.the second factor is easily satisfied because the program sole subject is madden nfl.the show does not refer to other video previous years versions of madden,which the program portrays as antiquated.the third factor is satisfied by nfl licensing agreement with ea sports,which gives the nfl a direct financial interest in sales of the video game moreover,the video game general promotion of football provides an additional indirect financial motivation.in this context,we deem the making of madden nfl to be commercial speech.
although we err on the side of fully protecting speech when confronted with works near the line dividing commercial and noncommercial speech,we do not view the making of madden nfl as close to that boundary.unlike the film title in rogers,the books in cliffs notes,or the painting in etw,the work accused of trademark infringement in our case aims to promote another creative work,the video game.even if rogers should apply beyond titles an extension undertaken,to our knowledge,in only the two cases mentioned above,we decline to apply it here in a context with that additional degree of separation.moreover,the artistic and informational messages that the nfl contends the program conveys amount to mere praise for the product,attesting to its realism and popularity.as the district court noted,no one in the making of madden had a negative thing to say about the game,d at,unlike news accounts that mentioned various criticisms.this belies any argument that the program has a documentary purpose.
because we hold that the making of madden nfl is commercial speech rather than artistic expression,we need not reach the issue whether our court will adopt the rogers test.we acknowledge that commercial speech does receive some first amendment protection.see,united foods,at.central hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,d.yet the lanham act customarily avoids violating the first amendment,in part by enforcing a trademark only when consumers are likely to be misled or confused by the alleged infringer use.see id.at.t here can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity.see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at ed.supp describing the low level of first amendment protection for misleading speech alex kozinski,trademarks unplugged,so long as trademark law limits itself to its traditional role of avoiding confusion in the marketplace,there little likelihood that free expression will be hindered.thus,we reject the nfl first amendment defense and proceed to analyze the estate claim under trademark law without overlaying the balancing test of rogers.
tailoring the lapp factors to false endorsement claims 
the estate claims that the nfl violated a a of the lanham act by falsely implying that facenda or,as here,his successor in interest had endorsed madden nfl.this claim is considered a trademark claim because facenda voice is a distinctive mark,the estate owns the mark,and the making of madden nfl allegedly creates a likelihood of confusion that facenda estate has an affiliation,connection,or association with the madden nfl video game implying that the estate sponsor s or approve s of that game.a a.
section a a covers more than just false endorsement claims.in fact,false endorsement claims are rare enough that our court has not previously announced the legal standard that applies to them.a more typical claim under a a involves one company accusing another company of using the first company unregistered mark.we therefore must determine whether the district court analyzed the estate lanham act claim under a standard suitably tailored to the false endorsement context.
our court evaluates a a claims under the test outlined in interpace lapp,cir quoting scott paper scott liquid gold,cir,abrogated on other grounds by swint,d.we subsequently adapted lapp slightly to accommodate cases involving either directly competing or goods.applying lapp,we consider the following ten factors 
the degree of similarity between the owner mark and the alleged infringing mark 
the strength of the owner mark 
the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase 
the length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising 
the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark 
the evidence of actual confusion 
whether the goods,competing or not competing,are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media 
the extent to which the targets of the parties sales efforts are the same 
the relationship of the goods in the minds of consumers,whether because of the of the products,the similarity of function,or other factors and 
other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture both products,or expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant market,or expect that the prior owner is likely to expand into the defendant market.
a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir.
the lapp factors allow courts to compare the marks of two competing or goods.but this makes lapp an uncomfortable fit in a case like this one.this case presents the question whether the nfl used the estate mark,facenda voice in a way that falsely implied that the estate endorsed a video game.rather than protecting its mark with respect to a particular product,the estate seeks to reserve the exclusive right to grant or deny permission to those who wish to use facenda voice to promote unspecified products in the future.
to address this disconnect between lapp and claims,the district court concluded that under a a the traditional lapp factors apply in a modified form specifically crafted for cases by the ninth circuit court of appeals 
the level of recognition that the plaintiff has among the segment of the society for whom the defendant product is intended 
the relatedness of the fame or success of the plaintiff to the defendant product 
the similarity of the likeness used by the defendant to the actual plaintiff 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
likely degree of purchaser care 
defendant intent in selecting the plaintiff and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines.
although these are all factors that are appropriate for consideration in determining the likelihood of confusion,they are not necessarily of equal importance,nor do they necessarily apply to every case.
downing abercrombie fitch,cir.
the district court reasoned that each of the downing factors corresponds to one or more of the lapp factors.facenda,d at.the court linked downing factor to lapp factors and,downing factor to lapp factor,downing factor to lapp factor,downing factor to lapp factor a nearly exact correspondence,downing factor to lapp factor also an especially close correspondence,and downing factor to lapp factor.id.the only lapp factor left unmatched is the fourth,which we address below.
we substantially agree with the district court approach to tailoring the lapp factors in the manner of downing.we augment the list set out above by noting that downing factor is analogous to lapp factor,and that downing factor relates to lapp factor.also,we modify the fourth factor of downing by adding the words and the length of time the defendant employed the allegedly infringing work before any evidence of actual confusion arose.this accounts for the fourth lapp factor,which has no corresponding factor in downing.otherwise,we hold that the downing factors retain the substance of lapp while appropriately tailoring the language to false endorsement claims.century real estate lendingtree,cir tailoring the lapp factors for nominative use cases,in which the alleged infringer refers to a competitor product in discussing its own product a h sportswear,at although all of the factors can be useful,the lanham act does not require that the lapp factors be followed precisely so long as the relevant comparisons suggested by the test are made.
in adopting our slightly modified version of downing,affirming the district court approach in large part,we emphasize that this formulation of the lapp factors applies only to false endorsement claims.this only to uphold the substance of lapp as the set of factors for courts to consider when evaluating likelihood of not critique any of our court prior precedent in the area of trademark infringement.
distinguishing between subsections of section a 
under the slightly modified downing test,evidence of actual confusion among consumers about whether facenda estate had agreed to endorse madden nfl is one factor to consider among eight.a common way of providing such evidence of actual confusion is to conduct a survey,but the estate did not conduct one.the district court held that the lack of survey evidence or even anecdotal evidence of actual confusion was not fatal.facenda,d at.even though the factor can be important,survey evidence is expensive and difficult to obtain,leading some courts not to penalize plaintiffs for failing to obtain it.id.at.moreover,evidence of actual confusion was especially difficult to obtain in this case because the program aired on nfl network a cable network,we note,to which many households do not have access only eight times.see id.at.weighing all the downing factors,the district court held that a likelihood of confusion did exist about whether facenda estate agreed to endorse madden nfl.id.
the nfl strenuously objects to the district court choice of legal standard under a a as well as its legal conclusion about whether evidence of actual confusion was required.it argues that subsections a a and a b have the same standard,which distinguishes impliedly false endorsements from expressly false endorsements.it also contends that claims of impliedly false endorsement like the estate as opposed to,for example,an expressly false endorsement consisting of sound clips of facenda voice digitally stitched together to say i think you should buy madden nfl must be proven with evidence that the program actually confused consumers.at the very least,the nfl argues,the district court should have required evidence that consumers actually received the implied message.the nfl distinguishes receipt of a false message from belief in that falsehood.
we reject the nfl arguments about the proper legal standard.the lapp factors apply,modified for false endorsement cases as described above,and no single factor is dispositive.our court has made the difference in the standards under a a and a b explicit 
some actions brought under the lanham act require proof of actual confusion and others do not.in an action brought under sections and a of the lanham act for trademark infringement,and a a,plaintiff need not provide proof of actual confusion he need only show likelihood of confusion.in an action brought under another part of section a of the lanham act for false advertising,a b,plaintiff need not prove the challenged advertising misled the public if he can show it was literally false.however,if his claim is not that the advertising was false but that it was misleading,he must prove the public was actually misled or confused by it.
fisons horticulture,vigoro,cir citations omitted.for claims brought under subsection a a,only a likelihood of confusion is required.the distinction between impliedly false and expressly false statements that the nfl urges us to apply comes from the jurisprudence under subsection a b.we decline the nfl invitation to muddle the two separate bodies of law that have developed under the separate subsections of a.
the statutory text of the two subsections differs only subsection a a includes the phrase likely to cause confusion.a a see facenda,d at.the case law also differs our court has long applied the lapp factors in a a cases but not in a b cases.see facenda,d at.the leading treatise on trademark law explains that plaintiffs could bring false endorsement claims under either a a or a b.mccarthy on trademarks,at both prongs of the version of a would seem to be implicated in false endorsement cases.but that does not mean that plaintiffs must bring claims under both subsections.nor does it mean that the elements of a a claims and a b claims are the same,as the nfl alleges.in fact,a a requires only a likelihood of confusion whereas claims of impliedly false statements under a b require showing actual confusion or misleading statements.
the nfl cites a number of cases for the proposition that we must require evidence of actual confusion by or,at a minimum,actual receipt of the message.all but one of these cases were decided under subsection a b,the false advertising prong of a.see novartis consumer health,johnson consumer pharms,cir quoting a b and describing the legal standard for false advertising claims breathasure,cir same johnson consumer pharms.rorer,cir same sandoz,at quoting only a,not specifying which subsection,but describing the a claim as one for false advertising healthcare,at quoting a and both subsections predecessors but citing and discussing cases.
only a single opinion from a district court both cites subsection a a and requires evidence of actual confusion.seale gramercy pictures.that case analyzed a false endorsement claim under subsection a b,the false advertising prong of a.yet,when quoting the statutory language at the outset of its analysis,the court quoted the language of subsection a a but stated immediately thereafter the standard for a claim for false advertising under the lanham act.id.at emphasis added.as we read that case,the district court in seale erred likely inadvertently by quoting the language of subsection a a rather than a b as it apparently intended.but that small passage in seale forced the district court here to resolve the apparent conflict between seale and our court precedent,including fisons.it reviewed several cases in both the a a line and the a b line before deciding,correctly,that fisons was the correct statement of the law.facenda,d at.the oversight in seale also led the nfl to spend much of its opening brief to our court attempting to blur the distinction between a a and a b.
we thus reject the nfl challenge to the legal standard applied by the district court.we adhere to the language in fisons summarizing the difference between the subsections and view the contrary language in seale which regardless is not binding on our court,as an oversight in a case that otherwise dealt with false advertising.
application to the estate claim 
with the legal standard under a a settled,we turn to the application of that standard to the facts of the estate claim.first,we briefly explain the limited significance of the standard release contract between facenda and nfl films,signed shortly before his death.second,we evaluate whether summary judgment for the estate on its claim was appropriate.
the standard release contract 
a threshold inquiry is whether the standard release contract that facenda signed serves as a complete defense to the estate claims,as the nfl argued in the district court.the contract states that the nfl can use its recordings featuring facenda voice as it sees fit,provided,however,such use does not constitute an endorsement of any product or service.the district court rejected the nfl defense.it concluded that the making of madden nfl is commercial in nature,that it constitutes an endorsement of the video does not fall within the terms of the contract.id.at 
in interpreting the language of the contract,we would not focus on whether the program as a whole constitutes an endorsement.instead,we would ask whether the use of facenda voice within the program constitutes an endorsement.viewed in this light,the district court rationale does not support rejecting the defense.yet we agree with the court conclusion that the contract does not bar the estate claim.
in the contract,facenda waived his rights with regard to any uses that were not endorsements.but if the estate succeeds in proving the elements of its claim,such a finding by the district court will demonstrate that the nfl use of facenda voice was an endorsement,falling outside the contract waiver clause.on the other hand,if the estate claim were to fail,meaning that the use was not an endorsement,the contract waiver would apply to that claim.thus,what falls inside the lanham act prohibitions defines what is outside the contract waiver.this renders further analysis of the contract as an independent defense moot.the significance of the contract is that facenda did not waive the right to bring a claim under the lanham act for false endorsement.
genuine issues of material fact remain 
applying the eight downing factors,the district court concluded that six factors favored the estate,while only one factor,evidence of actual confusion,favored the nfl.d at.it held that the sixth factor,likely degree of purchaser care,did not apply.id.at.on balance,the court concluded that the making of madden nfl was likely to confuse consumers as to whether the estate sponsored or approved of the video game.id.although the nfl barely addressed the issue in its briefing to our court,under our de novo standard of review on a grant of summary judgment,we must examine whether the district court properly awarded summary judgment to the estate.
the parties told the district court that no more evidence was necessary to decide their for summary judgment.id.at b oth parties agreed that they had no need of further discovery,and that the court could resolve all the liability issues on the evidence already before it.but the mere fact that both parties seek summary judgment does not constitute a waiver of a full trial or the right to have the case presented to a jury.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed,at citing rains cascade,cir.although it might seem to serve principles of judicial economy,parties may not stipulate to forgoing a trial when genuine issues of material fact remain that prevent either side from succeeding on a motion for summary judgment.
genuine disputes over material facts do exist in our case.for example,the nfl denies that it had the intent to profit unjustly from its use of facenda voice in the program.nfl films executives testified in depositions,for instance,that they thought they had the right to use the sound clips they long as the program was not a commercial.see facenda,d at.the nfl films producers did not see the production as a violation of the standard release contract because of how they perceived its aspects.although we concluded in section above that the program is commercial speech for first amendment purposes,that legal conclusion does not dictate the result of a factual inquiry into the nfl intent.
the district court appears to have disbelieved the nfl films executives testimony regarding intent.a dim view of deposition testimony that contradicts internal that testimony including statements like the whole show is a making of show,so all it does it promotes m adden,id.at may have ample justification.but the nfl has a plausible point that the district court was rejecting contrary evidence and making a credibility judgment,which is disallowed when ruling on a summary judgment motion.see country floors,at wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure suggesting that summary judgment is often inappropriate when a state of mind,such as intent or knowledge,is an element of a claim.
another issue of disputed fact is whether any consumers actually received the message that facenda endorsed madden nfl.this falls under the fourth factor of downing,evidence of actual confusion.the estate introduced no consumer survey evidence and no anecdotal evidence.facenda,d at.but the estate did produce an expert witness on the issue of consumer albert levy,who testified that viewers would probably believe,mistakenly,that there was an affiliation between facenda and the madden game.id.levy expertise centers on providing celebrities and music to appear in advertisements and pricing those appearances.although he admitted having no experience with consumer surveys,he also testified that he must judge whether an appearance requires permission to determine the price owed to the celebrity or musical artist,whether that price should be greater than zero.the district court stated that this downing factor overwhelmingly favored the nfl.id.at.but that conclusion was the result of weighing competing evidence,which the summary judgment standard forbids.
the larger question here is whether the overall weighing of the downing factors is a question of law or one of fact.the lanham act likelihood of confusion standard is predominantly factual in nature.thus,summary judgment is inappropriate when a jury could reasonably conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion.downing,at internal citation omitted.the presence of genuine disputes over some of the downing factors suggests that this inquiry should have been handled at trial.
we follow downing in holding that likelihood of confusion is a question of fact.see,a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir assocs.sklar,cir.thus,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment for the estate and remand this issue for trial.on remand,the district court should apply downing adding the fourth lapp factor to its consideration of the fourth downing factor as described above,see section supra to determine whether the nfl program was likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the estate sponsorship or approval of madden nfl 
vi.unauthorized use of name or likeness under pennsylvania law 
pennsylvania law grants individuals the exclusive right to their name and likeness,which includes voice.ann.any natural person whose name or likeness has commercial value and is used for any commercial or advertising purpose without consent may sue for an injunction and damages.id.a.a deceased person estate may bring such an action,id.b,although the right only lasts until thirty years after the person death,id.c.
the district court held that the nfl violated this statute with its use of facenda voice because a his voice commercial value was not disputed,b the nfl used his voice for a commercial purpose,and c the standard release facenda signed did not consent to the use of his voice in endorsements.facenda,d at.the nfl argued that its use of facenda voice was merely incidental.see thomas mccarthy,the rights of publicity and privacy,at ed.supp.the district court rejected this defense because the nfl stated a specific purpose for using the three sound clips of facenda voice enhanc ing the parallel between madden nfl and nfl football.facenda,d at.the nfl does not pursue its defense on appeal and we thus deem that argument to be waived.
we agree that the nfl has violated on its face for precisely the reasons provided by the district court,and we see no disputed issues of material fact on that question.on appeal,the nfl instead focuses on another argument it raised in the district copyright law preempts the estate claim 
a.the nfl copyright in the sound clips 
a threshold issue for the nfl preemption defense is whether the nfl has a valid copyright in the sound recordings of facenda voice.the nfl notes that it excerpted the sound clips at issue from copyrighted productions of nfl films.moreover,the sound clips represent facenda readings of copyrighted nfl scripts,making the clips derivative works of the scripts in which a distinct copyright exists.see granting copyright holders the exclusive right to prepare derivative works id.a allowing copyrights in sound recordings,which are separate and distinct from the copyrights in musical compositions of a.either way,the nfl had the copyright in the sound clips.
by using the sound clips of facenda voice in the making of madden nfl,the nfl was exercising its exclusive right to make derivative works of those sound clips under.in effect,it was sampling itself,making a collage,taking a small piece of an old work and using it in a new when a group samples the drum part from james brown funky drummer.it is that copyrights extend to samples,even brief samples.see,grand upright music warner.records.for instance,no third party to this case may use those recordings unless a limitation on or exception to the nfl rights applies,such as the fair use doctrine of.see campbell music,d holding a parody of roy orbison oh,pretty woman may be a fair use.thus,the nfl is correct that copyright law,taken in isolation,gives it the exclusive right absent a limitation or exception to use the sound recordings of facenda voice in the way that it did.
the question for us is how the nfl federal copyright relates to facenda right of publicity.does the right of publicity exist irrespective of the federal copyright put another way,does federal copyright law preempt the right of publicity claim under pennsylvania law 
express preemption 
the copyright code has an express preemption provision,which provides that 
all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and are governed exclusively by this title.
a.in other words,for a claim to be preempted by copyright law,it must protect an exclusive right in a work within copyright subject matter.the same section of the copyright code goes on to explain that this provision is not meant to annul or limit any rights in works outside the subject matter of copyright under state law.id.b.nor does it limit any intellectual property rights from other federal statutes,which is why there is no question of preemption regarding the estate lanham act claim.see id.d.
equivalent to an exclusive right 
the estate claim seeks to block the nfl from exercising its exclusive rights under to reproduce,distribute,perform,and make derivative works from sound recordings in which it owns the copyrights.in that sense,it could be thought equivalent to a copyright holder exclusive rights.a,b harper row,publishers,nation,cir,rev on other grounds,d if there is a qualitative difference between the asserted right a claim for tortious interference with contract and the exclusive right under the act of preparing derivative works based on the copyrighted work,we are unable to discern it.in both cases,it is the act of unauthorized publication which causes the violation.
under the first prong of express copyright preemption analysis,some courts have looked to the elements of a cause of action.the presence of an additional element required to state a cause of action under state law,beyond what a claim would require,renders the cause of action not equivalent to a copyright.see dielsi falk.
pennsylvania statute requires a showing of commercial value,defined as a v aluable interest in a natural person name or likeness that is developed through the investment of time,effort and money.ann.e.the requirement under the statute that facenda voice have commercial value,id.a,provides an additional element beyond what a claim requires,see nimmer on copyright b c,at to invasion of privacy may sometimes occur by acts of reproduction,distribution,performance,or display,but inasmuch as the essence of the tort does not lie in such acts,should not apply.the same may be said of the right of publicity.accord mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy,at.because the estate claim relied on an element not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights granted to federal copyright holders,we hold that the first prong of a is not satisfied here.
copyrightable subject matter 
looking to the second prong of a,does facenda voice fall under the subject matter of copyright the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has stated,in the context of vocal imitations,that a voice is not copyrightable.the sounds are not fixed.what is put forward as protectible sic here is more personal than any work of authorship.midler ford motor,cir.one can fix facenda voice in a tangible medium by recording it,but one can not divorce his distinctive voice itself from the facenda identity or persona.see nimmer on copyright b c,at the work that is the subject of the right of publicity is the persona,the name and likeness of a celebrity or other individual.a persona can hardly be said to constitute a writing of an author within the meaning of the copyright clause of the constitution.mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy,at the sound in plaintiff recording is merely an indicium by which the listening public can identify plaintiff persona and identity.we hold that facenda voice is outside the subject matter of copyright thus,the second prong of a is not satisfied.
we conclude thus that copyright express preemption provision,a,does not bar the estate claim.thus,we affirm the holding of the district court to this effect.
conflict preemption 
our analysis,however,does not stop there.we also consider whether federal copyright law impliedly preempts the estate claim.
the analysis works as follows.copyright law does not expressly preempt the right of publicity because an individual identity or persona is outside the subject matter of copyright.see,waits,at midler,at.yet in some situations,including this case,the right of publicity clashes with the exploitation of a defendant copyright.unlike the plaintiffs in cases involving vocal imitations,see,midler,at,facenda collaborated with the nfl to create the copyrighted sound recordings at issue.in our view,this gives the nfl a stronger preemption defense than the defendants,for example.where a defendant in a claim obtained a copyright in a work featuring the plaintiff,courts must separate legitimate exploitations of what congress intended to be a copyright holder exclusive rights from particular uses that infringe the right of publicity.otherwise,few copyright holders would be safe from suits by performers who agreed to appear in the holders works.see mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy,at w hen another reproduces a recorded performance in an expressive,medium,this should not be the concern of right of publicity law.
conflict preemption is a particular species of implied preemption that renders state law without effect when,without express congressional command,state law conflicts with federal law.employees benefit trust fund zeneca,cir citing cipollone liggett group,d.as one copyright treatise puts it 
therefore,even apart from section,the general proposition pertains in copyright law,as elsewhere,that a state law is invalid that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress.such conflict equally pertains when compliance with both federal and state mandates is a physical impossibility.
nimmer on copyright b a,at.the estate claim,if successful,will constrain the nfl ability to exercise its full array of exclusive rights under the copyright code.yet federal copyrights are not absolute.
courts have found conflict preemption where state laws interfere with federal copyright law goal of leaving some works,or uses of works,in the public domain.see id.b c,at citing brown ames,cir.for example,these concerns might arise with respect to state laws offering protection for sound recordings,which copyright does not protect.see id.b b i,at to discussing midler,at see also vault quaid software,cir holding that a louisiana state law permitting a software producer to prohibit disassembly of its computer program conflicted with rights congress left to software purchasers under what is now a of the federal copyright code and was therefore unenforceable.
our case presents a different kind of potential conflict.here we are concerned with the conflict between copyright law and the right of publicity.when does the right of individuals to avoid commercial exploitation of their identities interfere with the rights of copyright owners to exploit their works in addition,we must confront the role of the standard release contract.does a contract acknowledging a for defendant copyright in a work containing a plaintiff identity mean that the defendant may use that work in any way it sees fit 
david nimmer has proposed a framework for handling cases at the intersection of copyright,the right of publicity,and contract first,we look to how the copyrighted work featuring the plaintiff identity is used.surveying the case law,nimmer finds that when defendants use the work for the purposes of trade,such as in an advertisement,plaintiffs claims have not been held to be preempted.see nimmer on copyright b b iv i,at on the other hand,when defendants uses constitute expressive works,claims have been preempted.see id.b b iv i,at the rationale is that state law has a role in regulating practices of trade,including advertising.but limiting the way that material can be used in expressive works extends beyond the purview of state law and into the domain of copyright law.
seale gramercy pictures was nimmer inspiration for this framework,and illustrates the distinction he draws.seale claim for use of his likeness to make a docudrama about the black panthers failed as a matter of law.id.at.nimmer contends that this claim should have been preempted because it targeted an expressive work.see nimmer on copyright b b iv i,at.on the other hand,seale claim based on the use of his image to sell compact discs on which he did not perform went to trial,seale.at although the defendants ultimately prevailed,seale.at.nimmer suggests that this claim should not have been preempted even though it proved unsuccessful.see nimmer on copyright b b iv i,at to.
the nfl used the sound recordings of facenda voice in a television production promoting the video game madden nfl.this kind of use,in what amounts to a promotional piece akin to advertising,does not count as an expressive work.following the case law,this suggests that conflict preemption is inappropriate in our case.
the second part of nimmer framework addresses the way that contracts affect the preemption analysis.nimmer proposes that courts should examine the purpose of the use to which the plaintiff initially consented when signing over the copyright in a contract.he argues that the proper question in cases involving advertising and a contract between the plaintiff and the as our whether the plaintiff collaborated in the creation of a copyrighted advertising product.nimmer on copyright b b iv ii,at.if the plaintiff did collaborate in that fashion,then the party holding the copyright is in a very strong position to contend that allowing the plaintiff to assert a right of publicity against use of its likeness in advertising would interfere with the rights it acquired.if,on the other hand,the plaintiff did not collaborate specifically in the creation of advertising content,then the plaintiff is in a strong position to assert continuing control over the use of his image.
three cases,along with the district court opinion in our case,provide the most important background case law for the second part of nimmer analysis.fleet cbs,involved a claim by actors seeking to prevent a company from distributing a film in which they appeared.th,d.the actors had contracted away their rights in the film,but had not received compensation.they apparently hoped to obtain leverage in seeking payment by enjoining distribution of the film.the california court of appeal held that the actors claim was preempted,stating that a party who does not hold the copyright in a performance captured on film can not prevent the one who does from exploiting it by resort to state law.id.at.
the ninth circuit court of appeals in laws sony music entertainment,evaluated singer debra laws claims that sony had violated her right of publicity by using a sample of one of her recordings in a song by jennifer lopez and ll cool at.a third party,elektra asylum records,owned the copyright in the original sound recording that featured laws.elektra granted sony a license to use the sample in the cool j song.laws recording contract with elektra gave elektra the right to grant licenses,subject to contractual conditions.in that context,whether laws authorized the sample license was a contract issue between laws and elektra.but laws sued sony,the end user of the sample.see id.at to the extent that laws has enforceable,contractual rights regarding the use of elektra copyright,her remedy may lie in a breach of contract claim against elektra for licensing her song very special without her authorization.even though laws might have been able to state a contract claim against elektra,her claim against sony was preempted by a.
in toney,the plaintiff,a model,sued for the unauthorized use of her image on product packaging.at.the plaintiff had a contract with corporate predecessor to use her image in that way,but it had expired.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that the plaintiff claim was not preempted.id.at.there is no work of authorship at issue in toney right of publicity claim.a person not authored and it is not fixed.the fact that an image of the person might be fixed in a copyrightable photograph does not change this.id.at.thus,the second requirement of a that the state law at issue purports to protect something that falls within the subject matter of copyright was not met,and accordingly toney claim was not preempted.
to illustrate this second part of his framework,nimmer puts the fact situations in fleet,laws,and toney on one side,and the fact situation of our case which he uses as his main,based on the district court opinion on the other 
fleet acted in a movie for that reason,he could not complain when that very movie was later exploited,by being broadcast on television.laws sang for a recording for that reason,she could not complain when that very recording was later exploited,by being used as background for jennifer lopez.toney posed for the packaging of ultra sheen supreme.parallel reasoning indicates that she should not be able to complain about subsequent exploitation of that very work.the defendants in that case,in short,did not appropriate the commercial value of a toney identity by using it without consent.far from simply did exactly what she agreed to.in that regard,they stand poles apart from the nfl,when it took anchorman facenda sports commentary and transmuted it into part of a pitch for a computer game.
nimmer on copyright b b iv ii,at.thus,with regard to toney claim,nimmer answers the question did she collaborate in the production of a copyrighted advertising product in the affirmative.he argues that her case should have been an exception to the usual rule that claims for uses in advertisements would not be preempted and thus the seventh circuit erred.but in our case,nimmer suggests that preemption is not appropriate.facenda consented to participation in films documenting nfl games,not an advertisement for a football video game.the release form facenda signed did not implicitly waive his right to publicity,the core of which is the right not to have one identity used in advertisements.see,mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy,at.in fact,the release specifically preserved that right by carving out endorsements.
the nfl argues that facenda only remedy should lie in contract.while we agree that facenda could state a claim for breach of contract,we believe that he also retained his remedy
