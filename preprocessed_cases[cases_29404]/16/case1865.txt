in this appeal,we decide whether the plaintiff lawsuit,alleging only state law causes of action,relates to an international arbitration agreement with the defendants,such that the district court had removal jurisdiction under that section permits defendants to remove a plaintiff lawsuit to federal court when the subject matter of the suit relates to an arbitration agreement that fall s under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards hereinafter the convention 
fred beiser,a consultant in the oil and gas industry,served as a director and the only employee of horizon energy limited horizon.horizon is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of jersey,in the channel islands.horizon contracted to consult with roy huffington,on the acquisition of development rights to an oil and gas field in hungary.horizon also entered into a line of credit agreement with hungarian horizon energy limited hungarian horizon.the line of credit agreement provided financing for the development of the oil interest.both agreements contained clauses providing for the arbitration of any dispute in london.beiser signed both agreements on behalf of horizon.
beiser now contends that the defendants hereinafter collectively huffington wrongfully deprived him of his financial interest in the hungary field.the group of defendants includes several individuals and limited liability entities,including roy huffington,horizon,hungarian horizon,and roy huffington,who together funded and developed the oil and gas field.beiser avers that the defendants fraudulently induced him to assist with the hungary project by falsely promising him a financial stake in the field production.he filed suit in texas court,alleging a number of state law tort claims.huffington removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas,contending that beiser case related to the arbitration clauses in the two agreements.huffington also moved to compel arbitration.
beiser moved to remand to state court.he did not contest that the arbitration agreements fall under the convention within the meaning of.instead,he insisted that he was not a party to those agreements.beiser pointed out that corporate officers or directors sign contracts as agents of the corporation only.when an officer signs as a corporate fiduciary,he does not thereby bind himself personally to the agreement,newby von oppen,blackburn,i ndividuals who constitute the corporation can not be made liable personally on its contracts beiser argued that horizon,the company,agreed to arbitrate its disputes with huffington.beiser,the individual,made no such agreement 
the district court denied beiser motion to remand without opinion.beiser did not file a response to huffington motion to compel arbitration.the district court granted that motion,and beiser now appeals.on appeal,as in the district court,beiser insists that he challenges only the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts under,not the merits of the motion to compel arbitration 
although beiser clearly articulates his position that he signed the agreements only as an agent of horizon,he does not explain precisely why this fact means that the agreements do not relate to the subject matter of his suit.we suppose that he means to say that,if he is not bound personally to the agreements,that the agreements are simply unconnected to his claims.that is,corporations and limited liability companies are separate legal persons the agreements here relate to horizon transactions with hungarian horizon and roy huffington,not beiser personal relationship with those entities and the people that control them.according to beiser,he is legally distinct from horizon agreements to arbitrate entered into by horizon have simply nothing to do with him.
beiser position finds some support in our vacated and therefore no longer binding decision in marathon oil ruhrgas,cir,reh g en banc granted and opinion vacated,cir,aff on other grounds,cir,rev on other grounds,d.in that case,marathon petroleum norway mpn entered into an agreement with the german gas company ruhrgas that provided for the binding arbitration of disputes related to a north sea gas field.marathon oil company,an affiliate of mpn,sued ruhrgas,claiming that ruhrgas falsely promised mpn premium prices for the gas from the field,thereby fraudulently inducing marathon to invest million in mpn.ruhrgas removed the case on the basis of.
the panel held that did not provide a basis for jurisdiction.in large part,the panel relied on the fact that marathon oil had not signed the agreements.according to the panel,the issue is whether any relevant arbitration agreement exists between the parties to this litigation simply stated,there is no such agreement.id.at.although signatory mpn was bound to the agreements,and compelled to arbitrate,its affiliate company was free to bring suit in state court.
the en banc court reached the same conclusion as the panel on another issue in the case,but did not affirm the panel with respect to.it remanded to the district court for of whether that section conferred subject matter jurisdiction.marathon oil ruhrgas,cir,rev,ruhrgas marathon oil,d.the dissent went further.it commented on behalf of eight judges that the defendant invocation of was certainly not frivolous and noted the mountain of amicus briefs criticizing the panel interpretation of.id.at higginbotham,dissenting.
we reject beiser and marathon oil interpretation of relates to in.we interpret statutes according to their plain meaning,and the plain meaning of the phrase relates to sweeps broadly enough to encompass the relationship between the arbitration clauses in the agreements and beiser suit.united states ron pair enterprises,d holding that statutes should be interpreted according to their plain meaning.the supreme court has described the normal sense of the phrase relates to as having a connection with or reference to.shaw delta air lines,d.the phrase relates to generally conveys a sense of breadth.see id.at.giving broad scope to erisa preemption of any state law that relates to an employee benefit plan.here,the two agreements are the only written contracts governing beiser work in hungary.beiser was horizon only employee the contracts were entered into specifically to secure his personal expertise and advice in developing the oil interest.developing beiser case will necessarily involve explaining the scope and operation of the two contracts.even if beiser is right on the merits that he can not ultimately be forced into arbitration,his suit at least has a connection with the contracts governing the transaction out of which his claims arise.
the definition that we have given the phrase relates to in another area of law where that phrase defines our jurisdiction helps to specify more fully the phrase plain meaning.in bankruptcy,district courts have jurisdiction over any state proceeding that relates to a bankruptcy case.we read the phrase relates to in expansively,permitting jurisdiction whenever the outcome of a proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.in re wood,cir.this definition of relates to as conceivably having an effect on the outcome of seems to capture at least one sense in which we commonly use the phrase.for example,we might say that the creditors suit to recover on its security interest relates to the debtor attempt to reorganize or that the witness testimony that the pedestrian was drunk relates to the issue of contributory negligence.whatever else the phrase relates to conveys,it means at least as much as having a possible effect on the outcome of an issue or decision.
similarly,whenever an arbitration agreement falling under the convention could conceivably affect the outcome of the plaintiff case,the agreement relates to to the plaintiff suit.thus,the district court will have jurisdiction under over just about any suit in which a defendant contends that an arbitration clause falling under the convention provides a defense.as long as the defendant assertion is not completely absurd or impossible,it is at least conceivable that the arbitration clause will impact the disposition of the case.that is all that is required to meet the low bar of relates to.
so,in this case,huffington contends that the agreements require beiser to submit his claims to an arbitrator.huffington contention is not frivolous.the doctrine of corporate personhood is not an absolute shield to liability for officers,directors,employees and shareholders.that doctrine contains exceptions and limitations,and can not be applied automatically any time a litigant seeks to hold an individual liable for something the individual did in the corporation name.although beiser did not formally commit to any of the agreements,it is at least conceivable that a court might pierce the corporate veil and hold him personally responsible for the contracts designed to secure his personal involvement on the hungary development.the fiction of corporate personhood is a convenient way to capture the essence of the principle of limited liability but the fact that we often call a corporation a separate legal person does not mean that beiser is simply a stranger to the two agreements.because the arbitration agreements could conceivably affect the disposition of beiser claims,those agreements relate to his claims,and the district court had removal jurisdiction under.
besides conflicting with the plainly broad meaning of relates to,beiser suggested approach to determining a court jurisdiction under has the disadvantage of frontloading a merits inquiry into the district court examination of its jurisdiction.if we were to accept beiser view that the agreements relate to his claims only if he turns out on the merits to be personally bound to the agreements,the district court would have had to make a final conclusion about whether to pierce horizon corporate veil as part of its jurisdictional determination.it would have to decide if horizon was the alter ego of beiser and if corporate formalities were observed.it would have to take evidence.it would have to examine any other legal theory by which beiser could be held bound to the arbitration clauses.beiser would therefore have the court performing inquiries during the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings.
for most forms of federal question jurisdiction,whether the court has jurisdiction can be determined from the face of the pleadings.section confers a form of federal question jurisdiction it permits the federal courts to decide cases that arise under treaties made by the united states.const.art.iii.but,on beiser view of the federal question jurisdiction conferred by,a court could not tell by the pleadings alone whether the case arose under federal law.it would have to engage in a significantly more detailed inquiry.and once the district court made its determination of jurisdiction,there would be nothing left to do on the merits.if it decided that beiser was indeed personally bound to the contracts,it would by that fact have decided not only that it had jurisdiction under but also that it should compel beiser to arbitrate.beiser view therefore conflates the jurisdictional and merits inquiries into a single step.
conceptually,whether a federal court has jurisdiction to decide an issue is a distinct question from how to decide that issue correctly.to use justice holmes phrase,jurisdiction is the power to decide the case either way.the fair kohler die specialty.when a plaintiff brings a civil rights suit under,or a discrimination action under title vii,or a habeas petition under,the district court has jurisdiction to decide the case,even if the claims ultimately prove unavailing.whether the district court has jurisdiction can be determined from the face of the plaintiff complaint from the pleading itself,without the requirement of evidence or a merits inquiry.see louisville mottley.establishing the complaint rule by which jurisdiction under the general federal question jurisdiction statute,is determined by reference to the plaintiff complaint alone.beiser view would require the unusual step of going beyond the pleadings to determine whether the district court had federal question jurisdiction.it would combine the jurisdictional and merits inquiry into a single stage.
the language of strongly suggests that congress intended that district courts continue to be able to assess their jurisdiction from the pleadings alone.section provides in part the procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply,except that the ground for removal provided in this section need not appear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition for removal.emphasis added.this language does create one difference between the federal question jurisdiction conferred by and most other forms of federal question jurisdiction it permits removal on the basis of a federal defense.the language that the ground for removal need not appear on the face of the complaint explicitly abrogates the complaint rule that normally keeps such defenses from serving as the basis for federal question jurisdiction.but at the same time the statute permits a defense based on an arbitration clause to serve as a grounds for removal,it also directs us to treat such defenses the same way that we treat offensive claims.that is,just as we determine whether a plaintiff claim arises under federal law from the complaint alone,the statute directs us to determine whether a defendant defense arises under federal law from the petition for removal alone.
the definition of relates to we have adopted allows the district court to determine its jurisdiction from the petition for removal itself,and keeps the jurisdictional and merits inquiries separate earlier in this opinion,we explained that an arbitration clause under the convention relates to the plaintiff suit in the plain meaning of the phrase relates to whenever the clause could conceivably have an affect on the outcome of the case.as a result,absent the rare frivolous petition for removal,as long as the defendant claims in its petition that an arbitration clause provides a defense,the district court will have jurisdiction to decide the merits of that claim.this approach honors the statute command that we treat defenses based on arbitration clauses under the convention in the same way that we treat removal generally.it allows the district court to determine its jurisdiction from the petition for removal,without taking evidence and without a inquiry.
the problems with conflating jurisdiction and the merits into a single step go beyond conceptual infelicity conflating jurisdiction and the merits also could have consequences that are both irrational and inconsistent with our precedents.most importantly,conflating jurisdiction and the merits would deprive defendants of an opportunity to appeal in a significant class of cases in which the district court concludes that the arbitration clause under the convention does not in fact provide a defense.
a district court decision to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction can not be reviewed by an appellate court.d.suppose beiser were right,and that,if he is not bound in his personal capacity to the agreements,the district court would lack jurisdiction.if that were the case,a district court decision favorable to beiser would not be subject to appeal.such a decision would be a determination that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under.because decisions to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not appealable,the district court conclusion not to enforce an arbitration clause under the convention would be a final,irrevocable federal pronouncement.
we have twice commented on the importance of a defendant right to appeal the refusal to enforce an arbitration clause under the convention.sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican national oil,cir mcdermott international,lloyds underwriters of london,cir.in sedco,we held that the convention abrogated a rule of admiralty law that otherwise would have barred appeal of the district court refusal to enforce an arbitration clause.we noted in particular that the convention contains a reciprocity clause.sedco,at see also convention,art.xiv.
