in this appeal,we must decide between the conflicting conclusions reached by two district judges in the same court regarding the interpretation of the same collective bargaining contract.one has held that the contract arbitration clause is narrow,while the other has held that it is broad.although only one of the cases is on appeal before us,we write to resolve the conflict because the interpretation of that clause is central to our disposition.
