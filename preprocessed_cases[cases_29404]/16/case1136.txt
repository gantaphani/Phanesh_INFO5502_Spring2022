the first issue we will consider is whether recent legislative changes to the carmack amendment permit a carrier to limit its liability for damaged goods without offering the shipper two or more rates with corresponding levels of liability.to address this issue,we delve into release value agreements under the common law,legislative changes made to the carmack amendment,and courts interpretations of the carmack amendment.
release value agreements under the common law 
at common law,a carrier liability for goods damaged in transit was virtually unlimited nor was a carrier permitted to exculpate itself from liability for its negligent acts.see first.bank,airlines,cir.it could,however,limit its liability for damaged or lost goods pursuant to a release value agreement.see id.under a release value agreement,a carrier and shipper agreed to a reduced value of the goods in exchange for a reduced shipping rate.see union pac.burke.courts would enforce these release value agreements as long as the carrier gave the shipper the alternative of paying a higher rate in exchange for greater carrier liability.see id.if a carrier failed to provide the shipper with a reasonable opportunity to pay a higher shipping rate in exchange for greater carrier liability,then the carrier would be liable for the actual true value of the damaged or lost property.see first.bank,at.
in,congress passed the interstate commerce act to regulate transportation.congress established the interstate commerce commission icc,an independent regulatory agency,to administer the act,at.the icc initially regulated the railroad industry by requiring rates to be reasonable and just and prohibited certain railroad practices,such as rate discrimination,price fixing,and rebating.id.congress gradually expanded the authority of the icc by allowing it to regulate other modes of transportation,including the truck and bus industries.id.at.
initially,the interstate commerce act did not contain a provision concerning the liability of carriers for loss or damage to goods.it was also silent on whether carriers could exempt themselves from liability or limit their liability pursuant to an agreement in the bill of lading or elsewhere.saul sorkin,goods in transit,at.
in,congress addressed carrier liability in the carmack amendment,which provided in pertinent part 
that any common carrier,railroad,or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss,damage,or injury to such property caused by it and no contract,receipt,rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier,railroad,or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed.
act of june,ch,stat.
in adams express croninger,the united states supreme court considered whether the carmack amendment prohibited a carrier from limiting its liability by providing a choice of freight rates and corresponding levels of liability in its bill of lading.in croninger,a diamond ring was lost during shipment.the limitation of liability provision in the bill of lading provided that the carrier would not be held liable for more than fifty dollars unless a greater value was declared.the court interpreted the carmack amendment as a codification of the common law and held that a carrier and shipper were still permitted to enter release value agreements.see id.at see also peyton ry.express agency.noting that the supreme court upheld the power of a carrier to enter into release value agreements following the carmack amendment.
overview of legislative changes to the carmack amendment 
after the supreme court decision in croninger,congress passed the first cummins amendment,stat,which prohibited all released rate arrangements except when the goods were concealed by packaging and the character of the goods was unknown to the carrier.see shippers freight claim council.finding the first cummins amendment too restrictive,congress passed the second cummins amendment,stat,which substantially restored the common law rule expressed in croninger.see peyton,at.pursuant to the second cummins amendment,a carrier could be authorized by order of the interstate commerce commission to establish and maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property.howe allied van lines,cir quoting previous version of the carmack amendment,the icc would authorize such rates listed in the carrier tariff if it found the rates to be just and reasonable.see sorkin,at.
in,congress passed the revised interstate commerce act,stat,which recodified the carmack amendment.the expressed legislative intent was to restore without substantive change the applicable laws enacted prior to may.see id.the provisions concerning released rates originally found in were codified at.see shippers freight claim council,at.similar to,provided 
the interstate commerce commission may require or authorize a carrier providing transportation or service subject to its jurisdiction to establish rates for transportation of property under which the liability of the carrier for that property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper,or by a written agreement,when that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
this provision applied to all interstate common carriers of property,other than water carriers.see shippers freight claim council,at.
congress then amended with the motor carrier act of,stat.july.section of the motor carrier act divided into two subsections.subsection a consisted of the prior but was made inapplicable to motor carriers of nonhousehold property.the new subsection b allowed a motor carrier of nonhousehold property to establish released rates without prior approval of the icc,but permitted the icc to require the carrier to have in effect full liability rates as well see id.
in enacting subsection b,congress sought to deregulate transportation services and allow released value rates to foster more competition in prices,at,as reprinted in,at.
congress then passed the trucking industry regulatory reform act of,tirra,stat,which eliminated the requirement that nonhousehold good carriers file a tariff containing rates with the icc.next,congress passed the icc termination act of iccta which replaced with.under the iccta,motor carriers and freight forwarders can establish rates for the transportation of property,other than household goods,under which the liability of the carrier is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement.as to motor carriers,the rate must be reasonable.the surface transportation board,which replaced the icc,is authorized to determine reasonableness.sorkin,at.
federal courts interpretation of the carmack amendment 
in carmana designs north american van lines,cir,this court noted that a carrier ability to limit its liability is a carefully defined exception to the carmack amendment general objective of imposing full liability for the loss of shipped goods courts,thus,carefully scrutinize agreements purporting to limit such liability.id.at.prior to the enactment of the tirra and the iccta,a carrier had to satisfy four requirements before it could limit its liability under the carmack amendment 
maintain a tariff within the prescribed guidelines of the interstate commerce commission obtain the shipper agreement as to the shipper choice of liability give the shipper a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability and issue a receipt or bill of lading prior to moving the shipment.

in the present case,estes contends that the third requirement that a carrier offer a shipper two or more levels of liability is no longer mandated pursuant to the iccta.prior to the iccta,the liability limiting provisions under of the carmack amendment provided in pertinent part 
b a motor common carrier may establish rates for the transportation of property under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
before a carrier may establish a rate for any service under paragraph of this subsection,the commission may require such carrier to have in effect and keep in effect a rate for such service which does not limit the liability of the carrier 
subsequent to the iccta,the liability limiting provisions of the carmack amendment now state 
c special rules.
motor carriers.
a shipper to the provisions of subparagraph b,a carrier providing transportation or service may,subject to the provisions of this chapter including with respect to a motor carrier,the requirements of section a,establish rates for the transportation of property other than household goods described in section a under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
a carrier the motor carrier is not required to file its tariff with the board,it shall provide under section a to the shipper,on request of the shipper,a written or electronic copy of the rate,classification,rules,and practices upon which any rate applicable to a shipment,or agreed to between the shipper and the carrier,is based.the copy provided by the carrier shall clearly state the dates of applicability of the rate,classification,rules,or practices.
estes contends that b codified the release value doctrine,and the iccta deletion of b indicates congress intent to no longer require carriers to offer two or more levels of liability.we disagree with estes argument.congress is presumed to know the federal courts interpretation of a statute that it intends to amend.see ankenbrandt richards,d.c ourts presume that congress will use clear language if it intends to alter an established understanding about what a law means if congress fails to do so,courts presume that the new statute has the same effect as the previous version.firstar bank,faul,cir citing cottage savs.ass commissioner.as noted above,carriers have consistently been permitted to limit their liability subsequent to the second cummins amendment through a written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement between the shipper and carrier.in addition to the statutory requirement of a written agreement between the carrier and shipper,federal courts have required a carrier to offer a shipper two or more rates with corresponding levels of liability in order for a limitation of liability provision to be enforceable.consistent with prior versions of the carmack amendment,the iccta permits a carrier to limit its liability through a shipper written declaration or a written agreement.the iccta does not contain clear language altering the courts additional requirement that a carrier offer two or more rate
