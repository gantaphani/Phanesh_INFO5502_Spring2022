online commerce has ballooned in importance over recent years,and it is no surprise that automobile dealers are among those who are interested in exploiting its possibilities.this case,brought under the diversity jurisdiction,involves an effort by two companies to develop programs that would deliver,brand specific,internet sales leads to auto dealers.publications international publications ran a website that collected the raw sales leads,and smart marketing group smart promised to develop programs that would market that information to auto dealers.unfortunately,things did not go as planned.publications terminated the agreement,and smart sued for breach of contract.a jury saw things smart way and awarded it million in damages.given the deference we owe to the jury,we refrain from disturbing its verdict on liability.its damages award,however,finds such slim support in the evidence that we conclude that there must be a new trial limited to damages.
in an effort to get a good buy on a new car,millions of americans now turn to the web in search of free price quotes from local dealers.publications for some time has run a popular website,called,that furnishes these quotes.its website is based on a automotive guide.provision of these quotes has been profitable for publications,because the quotes generate sales leads that can be sold to wholesalers,who in turn sell them to auto dealers.in,publications decided that it could earn more from its leads if it cut out the middlemen and sold directly to the dealers.in order to carry out this plan,it hired smart to market its leads.smart two principals,michael welch and william magarity,had extensive experience selling conventional leads and other promotions to car dealers,but neither had much familiarity with internet leads.
initially,publications and smart developed two separate programs that publications planned to sell to auto dealers nationwide.the first was called the approved program it involved selling dealers the right to be designated as a consumer guide approved dealership.this designation was supposed to entitle the dealer to use the consumer guide logo,to advertise in consumer guide print publications and on its website,to display a plaque in the showroom,and to obtain reports per month.the other program was called leads listings in principle,it was supposed to exploit the internet more effectively.the parties planned that each member dealership would receive an average of,internet leads per month from.a standard leads listings contract was supposed to last for months,although in practice it turned out that some dealers preferred shorter terms,and it appears that their wishes were respected.
the parties executed two temporary agreements in march and july,under which smart began actively selling both programs to dealers.to hear publications tell the story,the approved program was a dud.smart began selling the program to dealers on a commission basis after the march agreement was executed,but the dealers did not like it.publications says that it took too long for a dealership ad to appear in the consumer guide magazine,the dealers received paper certificates rather than wooden plaques,and worst,the dealers were not getting any leads.many dealers demanded refunds,which they received,and smart sales of approved contracts fell off sharply,down to five in july,eight in august,two in september,and none in october and november.
still according to publications,this put pressure on the parties to launch the leads listings program quickly.in the july agreement,the parties decided to begin marketing the leads listings program,which was set to become operational sometime in the fall.smart was also to be paid on a commission basis under this program.between late july and november,smart sold leads listings contracts the contracts had varying terms and durations ranging from monthly to annual.
smart account of this early stage of the business reflects a different tone.the march agreement engaged smart to sell the approved program plus two others that were never launched.publications was entitled to cancel the agreement for cause if smart failed to enroll dealers by march.smart asserts that it had great success selling the approved program.it had nearly dealers enrolled by the end of april,and it added another in may.by the end of june it had signed up dealers and was on track to meet the contractual goal.smart concedes that the dealers were grumbling about the program in smart view,however,this was because publications was not delivering what it had promised dealers enrolled between march and may did not receive their welcome kit from publications until early june instead of plaques they got paper certificates and their ads did not appear in the consumer guide magazine until october.
smart recounts that the parties had delayed the leads listings program while publications worked on software designed to distribute the leads.by july,however,they decided to put the approved program on hold and to focus their efforts on launching leads listings.smart was to contact approved dealers first and offer them a discount if they agreed to participate in the leads listings program.as of july,smart was authorized to begin selling leads listings contracts to dealers.a performance clause in the agreement required it to enroll an average of dealers per month,for minimum monthly fees of to depending on the dealer size.smart enrolled over dealers in the program by august.it continued to enroll dealers,while at the same time the parties attempted to negotiate a more permanent contract.
by the end of september,publications had still not finalized the necessary software that was to deliver the promised leads.it asked smart to limit new contracts to per month smart complied with that request.it signed new dealers in october and another by.all was not well,however.smart was having trouble getting paid for its efforts,and the parties could not agree on the compensation due for contracts that were converted from the approved program to leads listings.on october,publications admitted that it owed smart roughly.on october the parties signed a contract in which publications agreed to have smart sell both programs to dealers.that contract declared all prior agreements null and void and superseded and replaced in full by the october agreement.the october agreement included a commission schedule and provisions on termination.it allowed publications to terminate the arrangement for cause if smart misrepresented the consumer guide or its programs,if smart engaged in business practices that consumer guide in its sole judgment may negatively impact the consumer guide brand sic,or the attrition rate in any program exceeded per month prior to the third month bill.
very soon after that agreement was signed,publications decided to pull the plug on the entire relationship with smart.publications had not figured out how to deliver the promised leads,and the gap between its promises and its ability to fulfill them had become too wide.its president,richard maddrell,had his lawyer write a letter to smart on november telling smart that publications was terminating the october agreement.the letter relied on each of the three reasons noted in the october agreement it said that smart had misrepresented consumer guide programs that smart had engaged in practices that had a negative effect on the guide and that the attrition rate was in excess of per month.the letter offered no explanation for these conclusions.publications finally succeeded in bringing its software up to snuff in.it contracted in with a different sales force to sell a similar program to auto dealers.publications continued servicing auto dealers with leads until late,when it sold the consumer guide automotive business.
displeased with its termination,smart filed this suit in the district court on january.smart is incorporated in california and has its principal place of business in that state defendants michael welch,william magarity,and paul west,who are all affiliated with smart,are also citizens of california.publications is part of a chain of companies that begins with consumer guide llc,a limited liability company.the sole member of consumer guide is pil new medial llc the latter sole member is pil llc and sole member is publications international,which is a corporation incorporated and with its principal place of business in illinois.the amount in controversy exceeds,and so the district court had jurisdiction over the case under.
smart amended complaint accused publications and consumer guide,which we do not need to address separately of breaching its contract with smart in three different ways it also included one count of fraud and duress,and two counts.publications filed counterclaims and,but those have dropped out of the case by this time.the district court ruled on september,that the october agreement was valid and enforceable,and that this rendered the earlier agreements of no moment.it therefore dismissed smart claims alleging breach of the march and july agreements it retained smart claims alleging a right to commissions on a basis for work done before the october agreement.the court rejected publications argument that it was entitled to cancel the october agreement,ruling instead that the contractual right to terminate had to be exercised in good faith,and whether publications had done so was a jury issue.
on that basis,the case proceeded to trial.the central question,given the earlier rulings,had to do with smart damages.smart was asking for lost profits of approximately million.it relied on an accounting expert,martin birnbaum,to support that number.birnbaum reviewed each of the dealer contracts that smart had sold and summarized their terms in a spreadsheet.using that information,birnbaum then projected the profits that smart would have earned over the remainder of the term of the october agreement.he assumed that smart would have enrolled approved and leads listings dealers each month,less attrition of and respectively.he also assumed that there would be a annual increase in the number of leads available.
publications contested birnbaum qualifications as an expert.the court agreed that birnbaum had no firsthand knowledge of the automotive industry,and so he knew nothing special about attrition and renewal rates for contracts like the ones smart was selling.birnbaum conceded that he had relied for that information on smart founders,welch and magarity,and that he did not know whether their estimates were typical in the industry.the court ruled that he was not qualified to render an expert opinion on the final damages figure,but it permitted him to explain his spreadsheet so that the jury would understand how smart arrived at its lost profits figure.
publications called two experts at trial.the first,dillon macdonald,was presented as an expert in the business of marketing to car dealers.his past experience was thin,but the court allowed him to testify that birnbaum assumptions were unreasonable and that it was not possible for the consumer guide website to produce enough leads to provide a dealer with an average of targeted leads per month.smart criticized macdonald for badly underestimating the number of visitors to consumer guide website and for failing to take into account the possibility that publications might purchase additional leads on the wholesale market.publications second expert was jeffrey katz,an accountant.katz adjusted birnbaum calculations to reflect what he regarded as more realistic assumptions no sales of the approved program,sales per month of leads listings,and attrition of enrolled dealers per month.katz also assumed that dealers would enroll in only one of the two programs.
the jury found that publications breached the october agreement when it terminated smart in november,and that smart was entitled to recover lost profits of.after the verdict was entered,smart moved for prejudgment interest under the illinois interest act,ilcs.the district court,citing first national bank of lagrange lowrey,denied the motion on the ground that the amount owed was not a fixed or easily calculated amount due.publications then moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,or in the alternative for a new trial or remittitur of damages under rule,arguing that the evidence did not support the verdict of liability or the damages awarded for lost profits.the court denied those motions.publications has appealed on both points,and smart has from the denial of its motion for prejudgment interest.
logically,the first question is whether there is any reason to upset the jury finding that publications breached the october agreement when it informed smart on november,that it was canceling the deal.we do not need to concern ourselves with that,however,because publications has limited its arguments on appeal to the damages issue.on the latter point,publications offers two general arguments first,that smart case was so deficient that the district court erred by denying its motion under rule b second,that the damages award rested on such shaky ground that a new trial on damages is necessary.we address these points in turn.
under illinois law,which applies to this case,smart had the burden of presenting to the jury sufficient evidence on which to determine the amount of its lost profits to a reasonable degree of certainty.chicago pizza,chicago pizza franchise.usa.while courts do not ask for mathematical precision,they demand more than conjecture or speculation to support the jury award.in re estate of talty.normally,an established business is able to satisfy its evidentiary burden by providing data about its past profits,burke,bosselman weaver.new businesses have more trouble coming up with hard evidence,though they are entitled to try.as the supreme court of illinois has observed,generally speaking,courts consider evidence of lost profits in a new business too speculative to sustain the burden of proof.id.even with these favorable legal rules,however,publications faces a difficult task.only if we are convinced,after looking at all of the evidence in the record,that there was not enough to support the jury verdict may we find that publications was entitled as a matter of law to a ruling that damages were not established.tate exec.mgmt,cir.
one preliminary question is whether the venture between publications and smart falls within the category of new businesses at all.publications had been supplying internet leads to car dealers through middlemen,and smart principals had experience with conventional,promotions for car dealers.neither side had ever engaged in an enterprise that wedded these two elements.the record leaves no doubt that the element of the program was critical.publications points out that the leads listings program depended on the ability of the consumer guide website to generate enough leads to satisfy the average dealer entitlement to leads per month.the hard part was to develop a software program that would eliminate false leads,such as those with incorrect contact information,and then sort the remaining leads by geography and.publications initially looked into purchasing software from a middleman it had been using,dealix,but it ultimately chose to develop its own product and in the course of doing so failed to meet several deadlines.we are satisfied that the evidence readily supports the application of the rules to this arrangement.
much of the evidence tended to show how difficult it is to predict how successful the parties venture would have been.publications problems with the software affected not only the leads listings program,but also the approved program.some evidence indicates that the dealers did not want the approved program without internet leads.apparently there were no dealers in the end who chose to participate only in the approved program,once leads listings was available.there must have been some independent value to the approved program,however,because dealers remained in it after they signed up for leads listings.
the efforts that smart had made before the october agreement was signed are inconclusive,because all of this work was done before the software was ready in december.smart had to prove what its profits would have been from the date of th
