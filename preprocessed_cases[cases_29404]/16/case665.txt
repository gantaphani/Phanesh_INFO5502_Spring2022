plaintiffs appellants the building industry electrical contractors association bieca and united electrical contractors association ueca appeal the dismissal of their complaint challenging a number of agreements entered into by the city of new york with respect to labor conditions on certain city construction projects.appellants argue that the agreements regulate the labor market and are therefore preempted by the national labor relations act.we find the project labor agreements in this case materially indistinguishable from agreements the supreme court found permissible under the market participant exception to preemption in building and construction trades council of metropolitan district associated builders and contractors of island,boston harbor.because the city acted as a market participant and not a regulator in entering the agreements,its actions fall outside the scope of nlra preemption.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the contracts at issue in this case are project labor agreements plas,contracts common in the construction industry.plas typically select a union to represent workers on a project and are often signed before construction begins.although agreements normally violate the national labor relations act requirement that a collective bargaining representative be selected by a majority vote of workers,see a,congress created an exception for the construction industry because of the unique conditions of that industry.construction is characterized by seasonal work,jobs of brief duration,and employees who typically work for many employers and for none of them continuously.building and construction trades department,afl cio br.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.these conditions convinced congress,as part of the landrum griffin act,to enact special provisions governing the construction industry,which codified and expressly legalized contemporary practice in that industry.see woelke romero framing,nlrb,see also boston harbor,at.
although public employers such as the city are excluded from the nlra coverage,see,two key provisions of the landrum griffin act provide important background on the use of prehire agreements in the construction industry.first,the act added to the nlra section f,codified at f,which permits unions and employers in the construction industry to enter into collective bargaining agreements before the union establishes majority status by vote.second,the act amended nlra section e,codified at e,to except the construction industry from the usual prohibition on agreements between an employer and union to refrain from doing business with a third party.the amended section e allows unions and employers to agree that only contractors who sign particular contracts,such as a project pla,will be permitted to work on a site.together,sections e and f allow the manager of a construction project to enter into a comprehensive agreement that sets common employment terms to govern the many different trades involved in a construction project.the two provisions help solve the problems otherwise created by the specific conditions in the construction industry,including the nature of employment which makes posthire collective bargaining difficult,the contractor need for predictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor,and a longstanding custom of prehire bargaining in the industry.boston harbor,at.
though large in scope and dollar amount,the plas in this case city plas contain terms typical of plas.initially announced in november,they have been estimated to cover about half of the city construction projects over the five years between and,and provide that the covered projects will be serviced by contractors recognizing the building and construction trades council of greater new york and vicinity bctc and its affiliates as the sole bargaining representatives for all construction workers on projects.the bctc is affiliated with local union,international brotherhood of electrical workers,afl cio local,and the plas incorporate favorable terms for members of local,which will provide the lion share of the electrical labor on projects covered by the city plas.in addition to the requirement that contractors on projects recognize bctc affiliates as the collective bargaining representatives for project employees,relevant common terms of the city plas include union security clauses,which require employees on the plas to pay dues,or their equivalent,whether or not they join the relevant union a requirement for any signatory contractor to secure at least of its labor through bctc affiliates hiring halls prohibitions on unions discriminating in referrals based on union affiliation requirements that contractors contribute to affiliated union fringe benefit funds standard work rules and hours and clauses and dispute resolution systems.it is undisputed that these terms are not materially different from those in other private and public plas.a contractor wishing to obtain work under one of the city plas must sign a letter of assent which binds the contractor to the pla terms and specifies that where the pla conflicts with the contractor collective bargaining agreement cba,the pla will govern.
bieca has a collective bargaining agreement with a different,union local,united service workers union under which local has the right to provide labor on bieca contracts.this and other terms in bieca collective bargaining agreement will make it difficult for bieca to seek work under the city plas.as discussed more fully below,bieca argues that the plas effectively punish bieca for its bargaining agreement with local.similarly,ueca has been engaged in an ongoing labor dispute with local,but the plas will set the terms under which ueca members can employ local members on pla projects.this,ueca argues,improperly interferes with ueca right to freely negotiate its collective bargaining agreements 
plaintiffs bieca and ueca brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert patterson.they argued principally that the plas are preempted by the nlra,and also asserted related causes of action under federal and state law.defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and.after holding that the plas are not preempted,the district court found that the remaining federal claims lacked merit and dismissed them it then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.building industry contractors ass city of new york,civ,wl.this appeal followed.

although the complaint asserted five causes of action and the district court dismissed them all,bieca concedes that the threshold and potentially dispositive question before this court is whether the district court correctly held that the plas are not preempted,since all of the district court rulings rest on that conclusion.
bieca argues that the plas are invalid because they are preempted by the elaborate regulatory scheme set out in the national labor relations act.states may not regulate activity that the nlra protects,prohibits,or arguably protects or prohibits,healthcare ass of state,pataki,cir internal quotation marks omitted,nor may they interfere with the open space created by the nlra for the free play of economic forces,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
but doctrines apply only to state regulation.boston harbor,at.congress did not intend states decisions about how to spend their own money as participants in the labor market to be subject to the same scrutiny as state regulation of the private labor market.when a state owns and manages property,when it is a proprietor,it must interact with private participants in the marketplace.id.such marketplace interactions are not regulation and so are not normally subject to preemption analysis at all.see healthcare ass n,at a major limitation on the labor law preemption doctrines is the principle that state conduct will not be preempted if the state actions are proprietary,rather than regulatory.
the clearest illustration of the market participant exception is a case with facts nearly identical to this one the supreme court boston harbor decision.in boston harbor,contractors who did not use union labor challenged a project labor agreement covering public works and environmental projects to clean up boston harbor worth billion over ten years.at.the pla designated the building and construction trades council as the bargaining agent for all employees,designated hiring halls as the primary source of labor,required all employees to join a union within seven days of employment or pay union agency fees,and required contractors to be bound by the pla.id.at.
the nonunion contractor plaintiffs argued that the pla was preempted by,among other statutes,the nlra.however,the amendments to the nlra,sections e and f,indisputably permitted private parties to enter into prehire agreements with the same restrictions and effects on nonunion contractors.id.at.the court noted that the amendments authorizing plas were enacted to accommodate the specific needs of the construction industry.id.at.the court found no reason to expect the defining features of the construction industry to depend upon the public or private nature of the entity purchasing contracting services.id.therefore,the court concluded that congress could not have intended to forbid public entities from entering precisely the same agreements that a private developer could.id.at.because the state agency was acting precisely as a private developer would to efficiently obtain services for its construction projects,the court held that preemption was simply inapplicable the state was purchasing,not regulating.see id.at there is no question but that the state agency was attempting to ensure an efficient project that would be completed as quickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.
boston harbor appears to decide this case.bieca makes two principal efforts to distinguish it.first,it argues that because its union contractor members are bound by cbas,the city plas in this case have such dramatic extracontractual effect that they are tantamount to regulation and thus preempted.second,it argues that these agreements fall outside the market participant exception because the city was motivated to enter them not by efficiency,but by political cronyism.neither argument is persuasive.
extracontractual effect on union contractors 
first,bieca argues that as an association of union contractors,as opposed to the nonunion contractor plaintiffs in boston harbor,the city plas interfere with its right to collectively bargain with union workers.when a pla requires a nonunion contractor to adopt employment terms contrary to its normal practices,it may simply adopt those terms by contrast,a union contractor is bound by a collective bargaining agreement that can not be changed unilaterally or at a moment notice.the pla therefore has an extracontractual effect on the union contractor it must alter the cba that governs all of its projects in order to do work under the plas.
in support of this argument,bieca correctly notes that the market participant exception does not immunize from scrutiny any choice a state makes about expending state funds on state projects.a state can not use its spending power to regulate labor.for example,in wisconsin department of industry,labor and human relations gould,the supreme court held that the nlra preempted a state law forbidding the state from doing business with repeat nlra violators,because the uncontroverted purpose of the law was to deter nlra violations the unique province of the federal government.similarly,in chamber of commerce of united states brown,the court struck down a state law prohibiting recipients of state funds from using that money to to assist,promote,or deter union organizing.the law did not fall within the market participant exception because it was neither specifically tailored to one particular job nor a legitimate response to state procurement constraints or to local economic needs,id.at,quoting boston harbor,at,and its legislative purpose was not the efficient procurement of goods and services,but the furtherance of a labor policy,id.
bieca may also be correct that a state law or contract with profound effects outside of the state market interest in the transaction would be preempted.see healthcare ass n,at a state can not leverage its money to affect the contractor protected activity beyond the contractor dealings with the state.cardinal towing auto repair,city of bedford,cir holding that a state action is more likely to be proprietary than regulatory when the narrow scope of the challenged action defeat s an inference that its primary goal was to encourage a general policy rather than address a specific proprietary problem but the supposed extracontractual effect of the city plas that appellants point to in this case the requirement that they renegotiate their cbas is entirely.bieca is free to renegotiate its cba with local and its other signatory unions.bieca is equally free to decline work on city pla projects and continue to work under its existing cbas on other private projects,or on city projects not covered by the plas.
bieca resists this conclusion by analogizing its cba to the status of contractors in gould.it argues that just as the gould law affected extracontractual nlra violations,these plas affect extracontractual union affiliation decisions.but this argument misses the point of gould,which centered on regulatory purpose rather than effect.the gould law did not essentially reflect the entity own interest in its efficient procurement of needed goods and services.cardinal towing,at.instead,the law represented a policy of discouraging nlra violations.see gould,at the state concedes,as we think it must,that the point of the statute is to deter labor law violations and to reward fidelity to the law.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court reasonably found that congress intended such policy decisions to be an exclusively federal matter.id.at.
moreover,bieca extracontractual effect argument is plainly foreclosed by boston harbor,decided several years after gould and factually indistinguishable from this case.the boston harbor pla surely put pressure on the plaintiff contractors extracontractual decision to employ nonunion workers.but preemption is a matter of congress intent,and the court found it implausible that congress intended to foreclose that type of extracontractual effect in public sector construction,given that it had expressly ratified identical effects in the private sector by enacting sections e and f.boston harbor,at.
in sum,we see no reason to distinguish boston harbor simply because it dealt with nonunion contractors.we recognize that,as compared to nonunion contractors,it may be more difficult for bieca members to comply with the plas terms where those terms differ from their usual practice.but this difference does not alter the market participant analysis.the effects that bieca complains of are entirely ordinary consequences of plas,in private as well as public contracts.project labor agreements create winners and losers among contractors and labor unions.congress foresaw and weighed these consequences when it expressly legalized construction industry plas.see generally woelke romero framing,at discussing legislative history of e exception for the construction industry.or,as explained by judge breyer of the first circuit,dissenting from the en banc ruling that the supreme court reversed in boston harbor,
