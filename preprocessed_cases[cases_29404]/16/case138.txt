this diversity case involves an dispute,governed the parties agree by massachusetts substantive law.on one side is sgi walpole,llc and.on the other is strathmore insurance company.a federal magistrate judge presiding by the parties consent,see c granted strathmore summary judgment,and sgi walpole and ask us to take a second look.exercising de novo review,we affirm,though our reasoning differs somewhat from the magistrate judge.see,rtr,helming,cir discussing some of the ins and outs of review.we will explain our thinking shortly.but first we summarize the relevant facts in the light most friendly to sgi walpole and the losers.see,soto padró pub.bldgs,cir.
a hard rain falls 
the story begins in walpole,massachusetts,in march,after a blew through the area,dumping about seven inches of rain in three days.to give the reader a sense of just how bad the storm was,the bay state governor ended up declaring a state of emergency.anyway,sgi walpole owns land in walpole with warehouses on it.manages the property,which,importantly,butts up against a retaining wall at the base of a steep slope.and,rounding out our brief description of the parties,strathmore insured the two companies interest in the property.unfortunately,by the storm end,a pile of soil had slid down the hill and into and over the retaining wall,damaging one of the buildings to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars.
the policy 
stripped to essentials,the policy between the parties called,in insurance lingo,an all risks policy covers all physical loss to the property unless caused by or resulting from an excluded peril among the many exclusions is one found in the exclusions section first numbered paragraph barring coverage for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by earth movement,which includes a landslide.such earth movement loss or damage is noncompensable regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.known in the insurance world as an anticoncurrent cause clause,what this provision does is deny coverage whenever covered and excluded perils combine to cause the loss.see,boazova safety ins.
for clarity sake,a word or two more about clauses might be helpful.understanding how policies work is fairly easy,at least at a certain level.if a peril is excluded,there is no coverage.see stephen cozen,insuring real property,at.if a peril is not excluded,there is coverage.see id.it gets a bit more complicated when excluded and covered perils combine to cause the loss,when there is concurrent causation.courts have adopted a few different approaches for dealing with this very situation.see id.we need not delve into them any further than to say that massachusetts courts follow the efficient proximate cause approach skipping over nuances not relevant here,coverage exists if the predominant cause of the loss is a covered peril,boazova,at,or if a covered cause sets in motion a train of events leading to the loss,jussim.bay ins,looking to contract around the doctrine,the insurance industry has come up with clauses,which,as we just said,bar coverage for damage caused by an excluded cause,regardless of whether a covered act also contributed to the damage.see boazova,at see also lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance,at.
now back to our policy.another key exclusion found in numbered paragraph of the exclusions section excludes coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from a collapse,except as set forth in the policy additional coverage for collapse section and another exclusion found in the exclusions section numbered paragraph precludes coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from weather conditions if weather conditions contribute d in any way with a cause or event excluded in numbered paragraph,landslide to produce the loss or damage.a few pages later the additional proviso appears a proviso that says that strathmore will pay for direct physical loss or damage to the property caused by collapse of a building or any part of a building insured under the policy.but there is a catch.the collapse must have been caused by a listed peril one of which is something called specified causes of loss,which most pertinently for our purposes means water damage,which in turn means accidental discharge or leakage of water as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a plumbing or other system on the property 
the denied claim lead up and fallout 
sgi walpole and filed a claim with strathmore,and strathmore sent aegis engineering,and gza geoenvironmental,to determine what had caused the damage.aegis concluded that rain from the had soaked into the soil,causing a landslide that caused the loss.acting on an idea floated by a representative of sgi walpole and,aegis checked whether water leaking from a drain pipe had caused or contributed to the landslide.aegis did detect some water leakage.but after running some tests,aegis flatly said that that leakage was not a cause or contributing factor.the amount was negligible compared to the rain amount,aegis noted,and besides,the majority of the leakage flowed away from the slope and retaining wall failure area 
similarly,gza investigation led it to blame the slope and retaining wall failure on a combination of heavy rain infiltrating into the slope and the inadequate subsurface drainage behind the retaining wall.gza also spotted some water leaking from the pipe.but,like aegis,gza rejected the idea championed by others that the failure was caused by leakage of stormwater from the subsurface drainage system that theory,gza emphasized,is not supported by our analyses,which indicate s that such leakage represented merely percent of the water that infiltrated the failed area.
armed with reports from both firms,strathmore denied coverage,citing most relevantly here the landslide,collapse,and weather exclusions.unwilling to take this lying down,sgi walpole and sued strathmore in federal court,alleging breach of the insurance contract and violation of the massachusetts act.laws ch.not missing a beat,strathmore counterclaimed,seeking a declaration that the policy did not cover the claimed loss.both sides moved for summary judgment,and ultimately,the magistrate judge denied sgi walpole and motion and granted strathmore.
the policy excludes damages from landslides,the magistrate judge noted.and,she said,the aegis and gza reports characterize the slope movement here as a landslide.plus sgi walpole and presented no evidence that the accident was not a landslide,she added.then she took on their elaborate coverage theory,which went something like this the exclusions section,they said,has an clause in numbered paragraph,but,they insisted,the section does not.and so,in their view,the section provides coverage even if an excluded peril think landslide contributed to the loss.quoting a snippet of the gza report saying percent of the water which infiltrated the failed area came from a leaky pipe,they contended that that leakage constituted a specified cause of loss per the section,which combined with the rain water to trigger the landslide that caused the collapse.in the end,because the pipe leakage is a covered concurrent cause and because there is no clause in the section,strathmore is obligated to pay up despite the landslide exclusion or so their argument concluded.the magistrate judge was unpersuaded.causes of loss in the section like water damage,she stressed,are still subject to the exclusions in the exclusion s section one of which is landslides.also,a commonsense reading of the policy,she believed,shows that the clause in numbered paragraph of the exclusions section excluding all loss caused directly or indirectly by a landslide,regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss bars coverage for any damage caused in whole or in part by losses covered in the section.and,she ruled,because the loss here was caused at least in part by the excluded landslide peril,strathmore denial of coverage was proper as a matter of law,which,she added,doomed sgi walpole and chapter claim.
so the magistrate judge entered final judgment against sgi walpole and.unhappy with this outcome,sgi walpole and appeal.
our take on the case 
a few legal principles some of which we mentioned earlier guide our decision.they fall into two groups.the first deals with some of the inner workings of the standard.the second deals with some of the basics of massachusetts insurance law.
as always,we give fresh review to the grant of summary judgment,affirming only if the record read as required here,in the light most agreeable to sgi walpole and shows both the lack of any genuine issue of material fact and the moving party entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.see,candelario del moral ubs fin.servs.of,cir rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir see also.a.and of course we are not straitjacketed by the magistrate judge reasoning quite the contrary,we are free to uphold her order on any basis present in the record.see,loubriel fondo del seguro del estado,cir.
moving on to massachusetts decisions,we see that the insureds here,sgi walpole and have the initial burden of showing that the case involves a generally covered risk under the policy.see,boazova,at.should the insureds accomplish that task,the burden shifts to the insurer here,strathmore to show an exclusion applies.id.and if the insurer satisfies that burden,the burden shifts back to the insureds to show an exception to the exclusion holds sway.id.making life a little easier for us,the parties just argue about whether sgi walpole and shouldered this last burden.finally,when it comes to causation,remember the applicable standard here is efficient proximate cause,using the or tests highlighted above.see id.at jussim,at.
sgi walpole and argument to us a variation on the one they made below involves bear with us seven steps.step one landslides and collapses are excluded causes of loss,and they concede their losses here would be excluded by these provisions but for one thing the section.step two that section provides coverage for a collapse caused by water damage,defined as including water that leaked from a cracked plumbing or similar system.step three gza found that water had saturated soil on the slope,helping to cause the landslide that caused the collapse.step four percent of that water came from a leaky pipe,according to gza.step five the presence of any water from a cracked pipe no matter the percentage,they write means water damage helped cause the collapse.step six the magistrate judge got it wrong in construing the policy,because the section can not be trumped by the landslide,collapse,or exclusions,given that it has no language.step seven so the ruling can not stand.though we give sgi walpole and points for creativity,their theory does not hold together.
the simplest way to decide a case is often the best,a distinguished judge once wrote.chambers bowersox,cir arnold.thankfully,there is a simple way here.let us put aside sgi walpole and complaints about the magistrate judge policy interpretation step six of their argument,for those keeping track.we need not and therefore do not decide those tricky issues and the issue,for example,is nothing if not tricky,because to get anywhere sgi walpole and must convince us that the evidence shows that water from the cracked pipe caused the collapse,to paraphrase and quote the key parts of the section.recall that it is sgi walpole and burden to make that showing.see,boazova,at.and this they have not come close to doing.we explain.
properly understood,sgi walpole and reversal theory turns on concurrent causation just like they agreed,at least implicitly,at oral argument,that a covered peril water damage,to be precise combined with one or more excluded perils weather conditions,perhaps,in the form of rain,or a landslide to cause the collapse.but even on their own view of things,strathmore can be on the hook for their losses only if the water leak was the efficient proximate cause of the collapse in other words,only if the leak was the predominant cause of the collapse or set in motion the cause or causes of the collapse see,boazova,at jussim,at.sgi walpole and argue that a sentence from the gza report makes that required showing.not so.
yes,gza found that percent of all the water that had infiltrated the failed area had come from the leaky pipe.but pulling no punches,gza thoroughly rejected the theory pushed by someone on sgi walpole and behalf that that leakage had caused the failure such a theory is not supported by our analyses,gza declared.elsewhere gza stressed that the heavy rain and the inadequate subsurface drainage had combined to cause the slope and failures.note that gza did not say that water from the rain and the cracked pipe had combined with the poor drainage system to cause the failures.and gza was not alone in rejecting the leakage theory.aegis did not buy it either.the leakage,aegis wrote,was negligible,in comparison with the amount of rain water that had soaked into the soil,which is a pithy way of saying that the leakage was so small or insignificant as not to be worth considering.see oxford english dictionary online,quick search negligible last visited may.the leakage,then,was not a cause or contributing factor,aegis bluntly stated.for what it is worth,sgi walpole and submitted no expert reports supporting their hypothesis or contradicting gza and aegis conclusions.
the upshot of this is that sgi walpole and can not prevail.after all,it would take a view of causation to say that a leak not listed as one of the combined causes of the collapse gza report and dismissed as too insignificant to matter aegis report really was the predominant cause of the collapse or put in motion events that caused the collapse.see,boazova,at jussim,at.and because strathmore acted well within its rights in denying coverage,the magistrate judge properly denied sgi walpole and motion and properly granted summary judgment for strathmore on all claims.see,timpson transamerica ins.
final words 
our story over,we affirm the judgment below in all respects.each side shall bear their own costs on appeal.
as a,whenever we quote the policy in the text,we omit any needless capitalization of words.but to give the reader a better sense of policy setup,we reproduce the relevant parts like this one in some footnotes that follow,presenting them pretty much as they appear in that document coveragewe will pay for direct physical loss of or damage to covered property at the premises described in the declarations caused by or resulting from any covered cause of policy defines covered causes of loss a little later as risks of direct physical loss unless the loss is e xcluded in section,exclusions 
that piece of the policy is set out this way.we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.earth movement landslide,including any earth sinking,rising or shifting related to such event 
the jussim court held that the doctrine is flexible enough to make an event at the beginning of a chain the responsible cause of an event that happens later.at holding that if the proximate cause is an insured risk,there will be coverage even though the final form of the property damage,produced by a series of related events,appears to take the loss outside of the terms of the policy.
this part of the policy is laid out like so.we will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following collapse,except as provided below in the additional coverage for collapse.
that paragraph reads in pertinent part.we will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following weather conditions.but this exclusion only applies if weather conditions contribute in any way with a cause or event excluded in paragraph.above to produce the loss or damage.
here is how that section shows up in the policy.additional coverage collapsethe term covered cause of loss includes the additional coverage collapse as described and limited in.through.below.we will pay for direct physical loss or damage to covered property,caused by collapse of a building or any part of a buildin
