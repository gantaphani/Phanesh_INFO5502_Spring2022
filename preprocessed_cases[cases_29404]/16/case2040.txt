bsh home appliances corporation appeals from the district court judgment that it pay to detroit radiant products company for breach of contract.the dispute centers around whether the contract between the two companies,which involved stove burners,contemplated a minimum fixed number of units binding upon the purchaser or merely a estimate.because we conclude that a minimum fixed number was indeed contemplated,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
detroit radiant is a manufacturer of infrared heaters used for commercial and industrial applications.bsh is a maker of home appliances under the bosch,siemens,thermador,and gaggenau brands.bsh had planned the manufacture of a new product,the pro stainless steel range,a,range intended for home use.to this end,bsh supplied detroit radiant with detailed specifications for the pro burner,and requested a price quote based on an estimated annual usage of units.
on july,detroit radiant quoted a price of between and per unit,depending on the quantity bsh ultimately ordered.bsh rejected this proposal and specifically requested a price quote for a volume of units.detroit radiant responded by email with a quote of per unit based on units,indicating that for this volume it would be willing to absorb all tooling and research and development costs.the price was later increased to per unit to include the cost of a test burn that bsh had separately requested.on august,bsh sent to detroit radiant a signed purchase order for burner units at per unit.detroit radiant began to manufacture and ship burners under this purchase order,pursuant to release schedules provided by bsh on january,bsh sent to detroit radiant another signed purchase order,this time for units at the same price per unit.
between september and april,detroit radiant shipped burners to bsh.bsh accepted and paid for these burners and took no issue with their quality.as of april,bsh had also scheduled the release of approximately additional burners for dates in the future,up to and including february.on april,however,a revised release schedule showed future releases dwindling to zero.in other words,it appeared from this schedule that bsh no longer intended to order pro burner units from detroit radiant.as it turns out,by the spring of,bsh had selected a company called solaronics to be its new supplier of pro burners and had stopped ordering them from detroit radiant entirely,allegedly as a measure 
detroit radiant maintained that bsh was contractually bound by its two purchase orders to order a total of burners,and that this number was consistent with its prior negotiations and price quote based on a volume of at least units.thus,on june,detroit radiant filed a complaint against bsh in michigan state court,alleging breach of contract and claiming entitlement to damages for the units that bsh never purchased.detroit radiant claimed in lost profits,as well as in unused inventory because the pro burners had been specially manufactured.bsh successfully moved to have the case removed to federal court pursuant to and a bench trial was held in federal district court,at which bsh argued that the purchase order superseded the purchase order,obligating it to purchase at most units,not units.bsh also stressed that the purchase orders represented only estimates of quantity,not obligations to purchase exact amounts.as such,bsh argued,the purchase orders were a form of requirements contract,through which bsh committed itself to buying only as many burners as needed.the primary evidence adduced by bsh for its claims was that the purchase order was specifically labeled a blanket order,an industry custom indicating that it was an estimate of quantity rather than a fixed obligation and the existence of a drafted but unsigned supplier agreement containing a clause suggesting that scheduled orders would be forecasts rather than fixed amounts.
on march,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.applying michigan substantive law and michigan version of article of the uniform commercial code,the district court found that the august,and january,purchase orders required bsh to purchase units of the burner at per unit.this was consistent with the court finding of a prior contract between the two parties namely,that detroit radiant had agreed to manufacture the burners at the reduced price and to absorb all tooling and research and development costs in exchange for bsh agreement to purchase at least burner units.the district court rejected bsh argument that the purchase orders represented an estimate of burner units only instead,the court found the two purchase orders to be unambiguous as to quantity and lacking any language that intimates that the quantity terms are forecasts or estimates.the court also rejected bsh claims relying on the unsigned supplier agreement,finding that this was not an enforceable contract and therefore did not govern the terms of the agreement between the parties.finally,the district court concluded that bsh had failed to meet its burden in proving that the second purchase order simply replaced the first purchase order.
as to damages,the court ruled that detroit radiant was entitled to its lost profits for the specially manufactured burners as well as its unused inventory.adding interest and adjusting to present value,the district court awarded to detroit radiant a total of.bsh now appeals,raising four issues for review.
in reviewing a contract action,we will not set aside findings of fact by the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.lancaster glass philips ecg,cir see also.a findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.however,the district court interpretation and construction of a contract is a matter of law,and such matters this court reviews de novo.id.the parties agree that both michigan law and michigan version of the uniform commercial code apply to this dispute.
burden of proof 
bsh first takes issue with the district court conclusion of law that bsh did not meet its burden in proving that the second purchase order simply replaced the first purchase order.op.at.bsh claims that with this one statement,the district court impermissibly shifted the burden of establishing the terms of the contract and the fact of the breach from detroit radiant to bsh.in other words,bsh argues,because michigan law requires that a plaintiff bear the burden of proving a breach of contract claim,it was detroit radiant burden to prove that the second purchase order was an addition to,rather than a replacement of,the first order,not bsh burden to prove the opposite.had the district court concluded that the purchase order for units replaced rather than supplemented the purchase order for units,as bsh argues it should have,then a breach by bsh would have resulted in significantly reduced damages.
in support of its argument,bsh contends that it had presented strong evidence that a schedule agreement had replaced the purchase order,and that this schedule agreement was embodied by the purchase order.on december,bsh sent a letter to detroit radiant informing it that bsh was implementing a new computer system and that as a result detroit radiant will be receiving a scheduling agreement,which will replace the current purchase order.joint app x at.under the new system,what were formerly called purchase orders would now be called schedule agreements.bsh claims that it ultimately sent out this replacement schedule agreement in january,over one year after it sent out the letter.yet this replacement is none other than what detroit radiant calls the purchase order.the argument proffered by bsh simply defies credulity,especially because detroit radiant sent four shipments of burners to bsh totaling units between the time it received the letter and the time it received the january,schedule agreement.if bsh had been serious about replacing its purchase order with a schedule agreement,it presumably would have done so immediately after issuing the december,letter,bsh than one year later.and given this significant time lapse it is especially odd,at least under bsh theory,that the order says on its face or in accompanying its being a replacement order.a plain reading of the order,then,regardless of what the parties may have called it,is that it was independent of the order.nor does bsh present any evidence at all as to why a mere format change dictated by a new computer is,from calling what used to be a purchase order under the old system a schedule agreement under the new lead to a change in the number of units ordered,from to.
bsh also claims that detroit radiant vice president of operations,joe wortman,actually admitted in a june,email to the words i understand that your po b is no longer active that the purchase order had been supplanted by the schedule agreement.joint app x at.what bsh neglects to point out,however,is the very next sentence in wortman email.in full context,the email reads i understand that your po b is no longer active.i was just stating that it was never fulfilled.id.emphasis added.in other words,whether or not the purchase order was formally considered active had no bearing on the fact that bsh had promised to order burner units and had yet to fulfill this promise.
bsh arguments seem to miss a broader point.the district court found that a contract existed between detroit radiant and bsh for the sale of at least pro burner units,a contract which was subsequently clarified by the two purchase orders 
bsh initially requested a price quote for the burners from detroit radiant on july.
detroit radiant provided its first pricing quote,based on a range of quantities,july.
price negotiating followed for a month,and detroit radiant continued to lower the price based on the understanding that bsh would buy at least units.
detroit radiant agreed to absorb the tooling cost based on the understanding that bsh would buy at least units.
detroit radiant would not have agreed to the deal at only total units and would not have absorbed the cost of tooling and research and development at volumes lower than.
while the parties adjusted the annual volume amount,the basic premise of the business deal was always based on the total purchase of at least units.
the august,purchase order,the first purchase order,committed bsh to purchase units.
the january,purchase order,the second purchase order,committed bsh to purchase units.
the total number of units identified by the two purchase orders is consistent with and supports the finding that bsh would buy at least units.
op.at.in finding that the two purchase orders were independent of each other,and consistent with a prior agreement,the district court implicitly rejected bsh theory that the purchase order modified the purchase order.it was perhaps confusing for the district court to have engaged in a discussion of burdens of proof in its subsequent section,but such discussion does not alter the end result.the district court critical finding was the existence of a binding contract between detroit radiant and bsh a reduced price per burner unit and an agreement to absorb tooling and research and development costs,in exchange for a purchase of at least units.there was nothing clearly erroneous about this finding,especially because the district court was in the best position to gauge the credibility of the actors whose words and actions gave rise to the contract.and given this finding,bsh argument holds little is,given the district court finding that the parties had entered into a binding contract at the outset,it may be implied that detroit radiant had already met its burden to show that the purchase order did not replace the order,since the two purchase orders,only when added together,were consistent with the figure.
bsh replacement theory might stand on firmer footing had the total number of pro burner units shipped,combined with the number of units scheduled for release approximately,been less than.but given the fact that this total well over it would be counterintuitive to view the january purchase order as a replacement,because such an interpretation would leave several thousand units unaccounted for.to account for this inconsistency,bsh must argue that neither of its purchase orders contemplated fixed quantities of burner,they contemplated estimates only.this argument is addressed in the ensuing two sections.
b.the unsigned supplier agreement 
both parties admit that in august of they engaged in negotiations to draft a supplier agreement.this agreement was intended to supplant the parties prior agreement for at least burner units by including numerous additional terms such as warranties,arbitration,assignability,limitations on liability,and so on.while the supplier agreement had been drafted by bsh,the record indicates that detroit radiant was particularly interested in having something in writing that limited its tort liability in the event of a consumer being injured while using the pro stove.the parties sent drafts and revisions of the agreement back and forth,but ultimately it was never signed.the final communication regarding the draft agreement was an august,email from joe wortman to curt sevig,a representative for bsh.wortman email stated we had the opportunity to review your supplier agreement and have revised it in some areas that we felt necessary.the file will show deletions in red,additions in blue and notations in yellow.we are prepared to sign the contract if you are in agreement with our changes.joint app x at.neither sevig nor bsh responded to wortman proposed changes.the following day,however,bsh sent a purchase order to detroit radiant for burner units,and detroit radiant commenced production.
the significance of the supplier agreement,according to bsh,lies in a section entitled purchase,which contains the following language 
on a regular basis as agreed upon,buyer shall issue lines against such purchase agreements,specifying the quantities to be delivered and delivery dates.the purchase agreements and releases scheduling lines submitted by buyer are constituted as acceptance,unless otherwise specified by supplier with a written response.the first month are committed orders,and the remaining months listed on the purchase agreement are forecast.
joint app x at,emphasis added.bsh claims that this forecast language clearly indicates that its purchase orders were estimates only,and that the district court conclusion that it was bound to purchase burners was erroneous.
the district court found that t he draft,unsigned supplier agreement does not cover the terms of the agreement between the parties.op.at.the district court then held that t he draft,unsigned supplier agreement is not an enforceable contract and therefore does not govern resolution of the dispute.id.at.bsh argues that the parties signatures were not required to render the supplier agreement enforceable.see a contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement,including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.bsh claims that because the court treated the lack of signature as dispositive of unenforceability,and nowhere did the district court expressly state that it had considered conduct of the parties with respect to the supplier agreement,therefore at minimum a remand is in order to determine the parties intentions.
bsh is correct that a lack of signature on the supplier agreement is not dispositive on the issue of its enforceability,but this is beside the point.rather,the key inquiry is whether the draft supplier agreement was understood by the parties to memorialize the terms of their contract.yet bsh presents no evidence that such a meeting of the minds took place.in light of the fact that wortman made detroit radiant acceptance of the supplier agreement conditional on bsh agreeing to several suggested changes,the email from wortman should properly be viewed as an offer or counteroffer that was never accepted by bsh,thus creating no enforceable contract.the mere fact that bsh issued a purchase order the following day and the parties subsequently began to make,sell,and buy the pro burners does not constitute ac
