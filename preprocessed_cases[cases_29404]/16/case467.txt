this appeal,presenting issues of contract law and appellate jurisdiction,arises out of the sale of a business.the principal plaintiffs in the district court,david laird and scott baker,previously owned and operated eight health and fitness centers in new england doing business under several names,planet fitness fit tech.on april,laird and baker executed an asset purchase agreement effective as of march,by which defendant major owner of such fitness plaintiffs centers 
the purchase agreement fixed the purchase price at million payable at closing but provided that the total amount could be increased by a maximum of million depending on earnings of the eight centers in the two years following the closing.the formula for computing the extra payment depended primarily on earnings of the centers before corporate overhead,interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization this figure is defined in the purchase agreement and called ebitda.the purchase agreement sets out both procedures for calculating the amount and a time table.
specifically,bally was required to provide laird and baker quarterly reports setting forth bally calculation of the ebitda.an initial percent payment by bally,based on the advance schedule,was to be determined within days after the first anniversary of the closing date,by.the final calculation of the full supplemental amount,designated the schedule,was due on the second anniversary of the closing.section of the purchase agreement then set out a process for dealing with disputes as to the schedules 
e protest notice.within sixty days after delivery to the sellers of the advance schedule or the schedule,as applicable,the sellers may deliver written notice each,a protest notice to the buyer of any objections,and the basis therefor,which the sellers may have to the advance schedule or the schedule,as applicable.any such protest notice shall specify the basis for the objection,as well as the amount in dispute.the failure of the sellers to deliver a protest notice within the prescribed time period will constitute the sellers acceptance of the advance schedule and the schedule set forth therein,as applicable.
f resolution of the sellers protest.if the buyer and the sellers are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to the advance schedule or the schedule within twenty days following the buyer receipt of any protest notice,then the items in dispute will be referred to the accountants for final determination within days,which determination shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto.the accountants shall be engaged by the sellers and the buyer regarding the advance schedule or the schedule,as applicable,based upon the written submissions of the sellers and the buyer,and the accountants may,but shall not be required to,audit the advance schedule or the schedule or any portion thereof.the advance schedule and the schedule as ultimately prepared and finalized in accordance with this section f shall thereafter be deemed to be and constitute the advance schedule and the schedule respectively,for all purposes.
elsewhere in the agreement,pricewaterhousecoopers price waterhouse was designated as the accountants.a choice of law provision specified that the purchase agreement was to be governed by illinois law.
the purchase agreement also provided that laird and baker would each sign an employment agreement,making them area directors to manage and operate bally new england fitness centers.the employment agreement,unlike the purchase agreement,contained a standard arbitration clause providing that a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this employment agreement,or the breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association or a similar organization selected by bally.
laird and baker began to serve pursuant to the employment agreements,but disagreements soon developed between them and bally.in february,laird and baker brought this diversity action against bally in the federal district court in massachusetts,charging bally primarily with breach of contract and of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.claims were also made under the massachusetts statute governing unfair and deceptive trade practices.laws ch,and a counterpart illinois statute.comp.stat.
the complaint included extensive factual allegations of improper conduct by bally.the district court essentially grouped these alleged wrongful acts in two categories.the first,comprising what we will call accounting violations,alleged that bally in its initial ebitda calculations had improperly calculated earnings contrary to applicable accounting principles so as to reduce the extra purchase price that would be due.for example,bally was alleged to have spread revenues from new memberships over the projected expected life while accruing the entire commission expense of the agent in the month that the membership was sold.
the second category consisted of numerous alleged actions taken by bally that laird and baker said were wrongfully designed to reduce the extra earnings that would boost the purchase price.for instance,the complaint charged that bally had used its computer system to direct phone inquiries away from the former centers and toward bally new england facilities and that bally had provided the centers products unfit for sale.these and acts like them we will call operating violations.
on march,bally moved to dismiss the complaint,relying inter alia on the purchase agreement requirement that claims be submitted to binding alternative dispute resolution by the accountant under the purchase agreement.bally did not mention the employment agreement arbitration clause.on august,the district court concluded that certain of the factual allegations raised matters within the purview of the accountants under section f but that the bally allegedly improper operation of the not and that those latter claims were properly reserved for disposition by the district court.
bally then filed a motion to reconsider or clarify,asking the court to identify more clearly which claims were to be submitted to the accountant and also arguing that new events warranted reconsideration of the district court decision to retain any of the claims for its own consideration.the new events concerned a traditional arbitration proceeding that bally had begun against laird in chicago on june,under the arbitration clause in laird employment agreement.
in the chicago proceeding,bally sought a ruling that it was entitled to terminate laird employment for cause later it asked for a declaration that both laird and baker were subject to restrictive covenants in their respective employment agreements.laird and baker then counterclaimed in the arbitration to seek monetary compensation for bally own alleged breaches of the employment agreement,including four alleged episodes that had also been listed in laird and baker federal complaint.
bally argued that these overlapping claims should be dismissed because laird and baker have elected to submit these claims to arbitration in chicago.more broadly,bally contended that all of the issues retained by the district court for its own resolution were properly subject to arbitration under the employment agreement.by order entered on november,the district court clarified its apportionment of issues as between the court and the accountant,but it declined to refer any of the claims overlapping or not to the chicago arbitration.
bally has now filed an interlocutory appeal.it argues that the district court should not have retained any of the plaintiffs claims bally says that all must be submitted to price waterhouse or,in the alternative,subject to the chicago arbitration.at the very least says bally,the district court should not proceed to address the overlapping claims that are being presented both in the federal complaint and in laird and baker answer and counterclaim in the chicago arbitration.
jurisdiction.at the outset laird and baker say that we lack jurisdiction over bally appeal.the challenge to our jurisdiction arises because the district court refusal either to dismiss the case or to leave all of the issues to price waterhouse or the chicago arbitration is not a final order disposing of all claims against all parties.thus,it is not appealable as a final judgment under,and our jurisdiction must be based on one of the several statutory or case law exceptions to the final judgment requirement.
section of the federal arbitration act,a b,explicitly permits an immediate appeal from a district court order denying a petition under section of this title to order arbitration to proceed.see also col√≥n grace,cir.we think that the district court orders are appealable under this section insofar as the district court refused to send all of the issues to the chicago arbitration proceedings is the trickier jurisdictional to the court refusal to send them all to price waterhouse.
we start with bally request to refer the issues to the chicago arbitration.this request was made only in the motion for reconsideration following the district court original august,order but the delay is not a bar the district court did not decline to address the request as forfeited by failure to make it earlier but instead decided on the merits that a reference to the chicago arbitrator was not required.bally explicit request for a reference to the chicago arbitrator was effectively a request for an order to arbitrate under section,which is immediately appealable under section,a b.
for two separate reasons,the refusal to send all the claims to price waterhouse is more difficult to equate with a refusal to order arbitration.one reason is that,as plaintiffs point out,bally request was not for a stay pending submission to price waterhouse or an order to arbitrate but for dismissal of the case because of the price waterhouse remedy.so far as pertinent,section allows an interlocutory appeal only from an order denying a petition to compel arbitration or from the denial of a stay pending such an arbitration.
the courts are divided as to whether a request to dismiss a case based on an arbitration clause should be treated as a request for an order compelling arbitration circumstances vary and one rule may not suit all cases.but here bally clearly argued to the district court that under the purchase agreement the accountant had sole authority to resolve all issues.if that was right and bally wanted the accountant to decide the issues,then the proper remedy would have been to stay the court proceeding and order that the accounting remedy is arbitration.
if bally had wanted a dismissal but no decision by the arbitrator,then we would refuse to entertain an appeal by bally to provide a reference that bally had not sought and did not want.but in this case bally clearly is invoking the accountant dispute resolution remedy,even if a stay rather than dismissal ensues.since no one has been prejudicially misled by bally request for an remedy of dismissal,its request for dismissal in favor of the accountant remedy can be treated as encompassing the lesser alternative remedy of a stay and reference.
this brings us to bally second hurdle,namely,to the question whether the accountant remedy is arbitration at all.if it is not arbitration,then remedies under the federal arbitration act,including an interlocutory appeal,would be unavailable.the act itself does not define arbitration,see harrison nissan motor in,cir.whether the accountant remedy is arbitration under the federal statute is a characterization issue,which in our view is governed by federal law.
that a uniform federal definition is required is obvious to us.true,the substance of the purchase promised to do governed by state law here,the parties agree,by illinois law,but whether what has been agreed to amounts to arbitration under the federal arbitration act depends on what congress meant by the term in the federal statute.assuredly congress intended a national definition for a national policy.analogous cases are numerous 
curiously,there is a ninth circuit case to the contrary,wasyl,first boston,cir,followed by hartford lloyd ins.teachworth,cir,but wasyl assumed without real analysis that state law governed,and the wasyl decision itself was rightly criticized by a more recent ninth circuit panel when forced to follow the earlier case.see portland united states bank trust nat.ass as tr.for trust,cir tashima,concurring id.at mckeown,specially concurring.
whether the accounting remedy is arbitration under the federal statute is the more interesting question.the answer does not depend on the nomenclature used in the agreement,see amf brunswick,rather,the question is how closely the specified procedure resembles classic arbitration and whether treating the procedure as arbitration serves the intuited purposes of congress.for example,other circuits defensibly,in our view have declined to treat an agreement for arbitration as arbitration within the meaning of the act.see dluhos strasberg,cir harrison,at.but see wolsey,foodmaker,cir.
by contrast,in our case,the purchase agreement makes the price waterhouse remedy final whether any more final than ordinary arbitration is doubtful but need not be decided now,and other common incidents of arbitration of a contractual dispute are present an independent adjudicator,substantive standards the contractual terms of the,and an opportunity for each side to present its case.see general motors pamela equities,cir harrison,at amf.at.to us,this is arbitration in everything but name 
in one respect,the accounting remedy departs from a common feature of many arbitrations.the district court found that the purchase agreement refers to price waterhouse for its resolution only the accounting issues and not the operational disputes that affect the.so,unlike many arbitrations,this limited reference can not resolve the whole,or even the greater part,of the controversy between the parties.in consequence,a reference does not fully spare the court resources,and it creates a proceeding even as to claims of breach of contract.
yet arbitrations sometimes do cover only a part of the overall dispute between the parties,coady ashcraft gerel,cir mcdonnell douglas fin.power light,cir.if this adds to the procedural complexity,it may still provide a swifter and depending on the arbitrator a more expert answer to the questions that are arbitrated.references to agencies under the somewhat analogous primary jurisdiction doctrine sometimes comprise only a single narrow issue referred to the agency before the federal law suit goes forward.see,pub.interest research group atl.salmon of,llc,cir blackstone valley,cir 
arbitrability of the issues.having confirmed our jurisdiction over the appeal,we turn next to the question whether the district court correctly construed the purchase agreement when it referred to price waterhouse only the accounting issues and retained the remaining misconduct charges for itself.the district court bifurcation might at first surprise a reader given to literalism but it rests on a realistic parsing of the purchase agreement and is ultimately correct.
the pertinent language of the purchase agreement,quoted more fully above,says that any disagreement with respect to the advance schedule or the schedule will,if unresolved after the protest notice,be referred to the accountants for a final determination.the operational misconduct could,just like ordinary accounting errors,alter the figures in the two schedules and reduce the.so,bally seemingly argues,whether operational misconduct occurred is for the accountants to decide.
absent admissible extrinsic evidence bearing upon intent,a court in interpreting disputed contract language asks what reasonable persons in the position of the parties would ordinarily have intended by using the words in question in the circumstances.farnsworth on contracts,ed,a view followed in illinois horbach kaczmarek,tatar maxon constr.by this test,referring the operational issues to the accountants makes no sense.
the phrase any disagreement refers to earning schedules whose components are defined in detail in the purchase agreement in accounting terms specifically,the ebitda formula for earnings of the eight centers before certain other costs,interest,taxes,depreciation are taken into account.and,the unresolved disagreements are to be referred to accountants.in context,it therefore makes most sense to read any disagreements as referring to disagreements about accounting issues arising in the calculations that underpin the schedules.
conversely,it makes no sense to assume that accountants would be entrusted with evaluating disputes about the operation of the business in question.yes,operational misconduct may well affect the level of earnings and therefore the schedules,but the misconduct itself would not be a breach of proper accounting standards.nor would one expect accountants to have special competence in deciding whether business misconduct unrelated to accounting conventions was a breach of contract or any implied duty of fair dealing.
thus,the accounting treatment of new membership sales was correctly regarded by the district court as an issue properly reserved for price waterhouse but whether bally had manipulated the phone system to divert calls from the eight centers to other bally centers involves not an accounting question but contract interpretation and judgments about reasonable business practices.whether specific issues fall on one side or the other of the dividing line could be disputed but on this appeal bally has attacked only the district court general bifurcation approach and not its classification of particular misconduct claims.
the district court reading is supported by at least four different cases in which clauses directing certain disputes to accountants were read as implicitly limited to accounting issues in two of the cases,the precise phrasing of the clauses made this conclusion even easier to reach than it is in the present case,see blutt integrated health,civ,wl,at july,united steelworkers of am.roll,wl,at.may,but the other two decisions are not very far from our own.in all events,if a red sox sports announcer says that the batter hit the ball out of the park,everyone knows that a baseball is implied.
bally relies principally upon mayfair constr.waveland assocs.phase i,d.there the court read contract language as requiring the submission to an architect essentially for arbitration of disputes about schedule extensions and cost increases in the construction of a building.id.at.the case gives bally a bit of support but not too much.
the need for extensions of time for construction and resulting cost effects of delay are arguably matters within the normal competence of an architect.further,the clause in mayfair explicitly directed that the architect will be the interpreter of the requirements of the contract documents and the initial judge of the performance thereunder by both the owner and contractor in his capacity as interpreter and judge,he will endeavor to secure faithful performance by both the owner and contractor.id.at.mayfair is thus quite distinguishable.
this brings us to bally alternative claim,in its petition for reconsideration to the district court,that the chicago arbitration alters the situation and calls for deferral of the claims in favor of the chicago proceeding.bally has two versions of this argument.in the strong version,bally argues that the general arbitration clause in the employment agreement covers the claims made by laird and baker in the court case.the short answer is that it does not.
the arbitration clause says that a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this employment agreement,or the breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration as specified in the agreement.the arising out of language is plainly inapplicable the complaint itself makes clear that all of the claims in the district court case arise out of supposed breaches of the purchase agreement,its implied covenant of fair dealing and associated statutory duties.
the relating to language is more vague,and therefore potentially broader,but if no proceedings had been begun in chicago,no one would claim that the district court case involved a claim relating to the employment agreement.it would be a far more normal use of words to say that such a claim was related to the purchase agreement whose alleged breach is the umbrella cause of action in the district court.that the same misconduct could also play a role in the chicago arbitration is a different matter to which we return below.
bally says that the distinction between the two agreements is artificial.it points out that the employment agreements were referenced in,and required by,the purchase agreement that the opportunities provided by the latter were related to the plaintiffs continued employment and that the integration clause in the purchase agreement refers to the purchase agreement and documents referred to in it as comprising the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties.
these are real but the juxtaposition of the two documents hurts bally more than it helps it.the two agreements do comprise understandings related to the same business sale and,in interpreting the documents,one provides context for the other.but the two documents deal with different aspects of the sale asset purchase and subsequent employment.no one can seriously argue that clauses can be plucked at random from one agreement and inserted into the other.
the general arbitration clause appears only in the employment agreements and refers to disputes arising under or related to that agreement.further,not only is such a clause omitted from the purchase agreement although it would have been child play to insert it there but the purchase agreement has instead a different,and narrower,dispute resolution process relying on the accountants that process would be,the same matter were covered by the general arbitration clause in the employment agreement.
the rosenblum decision is more or less on point,rosenblum,cir.there a business sale and employment agreement were paired and,when the seller sued under the sale agreement for failure to pay,the buyer invoked the arbitration clause of the employment agreement.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected the attempt.in language no less applicable here,the court said 
generally,one instrument may incorporate another instrument by reference.turner constr.midwest curtainwalls,d.the contract must show an intent to incorporate the other document and make it part of the contract itself.id.when determining under illinois law whether something is incorporated into a contract,we limit our inquiry to the four corners of the contract.atl.mut.ins.metron eng g constr,cir none of the provisions relied upon by the district court incorporates the employment agreement by reference.there is no doubt that the acquisition agreement refers to the employment agreement,but there is no intention to incorporate the document and make it a part of the contract on the face of the acquisition agreement itself a merger clause does not incorporate other contracts by reference,rather,a merger clause negates the impact of earlier negotiations and contract drafts,and states that the written contract is the complete expression of the parties agreement.
a pair of fifth circuit cases invoked by bally did transpose arbitration clauses among contemporaneously executed related contracts,but the cases are distinguishable,especially because in our case each agreement has its own dispute resolution process.personal sec.safety.motorola,cir neal hardee food systems,cir.further,both the seventh and fifth circuits said they were applying state law in construing the scope of their respective contracts,rosenblum,at neal,at,and as between illinois and texas law,the former is the governing law in our own case so far as the substance of the agreement is concerned.
alternatively this is the weak version of bally argument,bally says that,even if its incorporation argument fails,laird and baker have affirmatively elected arbitration as to those misconduct issues that they have themselves raised in the chicago proceeding by answer and counterclaim.these include some but not all of the issues retained by the district court.the district court said briefly in its order on reconsideration that the plaintiffs answer and counterclaim in the chicago arbitration proceeding was n
