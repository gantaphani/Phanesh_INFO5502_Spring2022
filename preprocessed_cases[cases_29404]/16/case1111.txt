opinion of the court 
at issue in this appeal is whether an arbitrator or a court should decide whether coverage disputes under essentially identical insurance contracts should be arbitrated separately on a basis or collectively in a consolidated arbitration.the district court held that the issue of consolidation should be decided by an arbitrator.we believe that decision comports with the direction provided by two supreme court decisions and will affirm.
the underlying dispute in this matter regards the payment of asbestos claims under reinsurance coverage that westchester fire insurance company westchester fire purchased from certain lloyd of london reinsurers the underwriters.the parties disagree as to how to characterize the coverage at issue.westchester fire argues that we are dealing with two reinsurance programs one being the comprehensive catastrophe treaty,which was made up of six essentially identical contracts covering different time periods in effect from inclusive,and the other,the special contingency treaty,made up of two essentially identical contracts in effect from inclusive.
by way of brief introduction to the industry terminology,t here are two types of reinsurance contract treaty and facultative.north river ins.cigna reinsurance,cir.unlike facultative reinsurance,which entails the ceding of a particular risk or policy,a reinsurance treaty involves an agreement by a reinsurer to accept an entire block of business from the reinsured because a treaty reinsurer accepts an entire block of business,it does not assess the individual risks being reinsured rather,it evaluates the overall risk pool.id.
on may,westchester fire sent two arbitration demand letters to the underwriters,each based upon one of the two treaties.westchester fire captioned one demand as referencing the comprehensive catastrophe excess of layers treaty,effective inclusive,app.at,and the other as referencing the special casualty contingency excess of loss treaty,effective.app.at.each letter stated that westchester fire hereby demands and initiates arbitration under the above captioned treaty underwriters are requested and required in accordance with pertinent treaty provisions to name their arbitrator.app.at.
in response to each demand,the underwriters filed a verified petition to compel arbitration and stay arbitration in the district of new jersey.their petition in response to the comprehensive catastrophe arbitration demand argued that the comprehensive catastrophe treaty consists of at least six separate contracts,each with its own arbitration clause,and that n one of the agreements provide for the consolidation of arbitration proceedings,let alone consolidation with proceedings under other contracts.app.at.they asked that the demand be stayed.likewise,the petition in response to the special casualty contingency arbitration demand argued that the demand should be stayed,as it was an effort to consolidate a dispute arising under at least two separate reinsurance contracts,each having its own arbitration clause.
the underwriters petitions also requested that the court order eight arbitrations in conjunction with the eight contracts the underwriters had,six separate arbitrations in response to westchester fire demand under the comprehensive catastrophe program and two separate arbitrations under the special contingency program.the underwriters asked as well that westchester fire produce all reinsurance agreements within the scope of its arbitration demand,as there may exist other agreements not presently known to petitioners,app.at,and sought a declaration that westchester may not consolidate proceedings without the consent of all parties to the agreements.id.
as the basis for its request for arbitration,westchester fire argues that the underwriters have imposed onerous documentation and claim procedures before payment of asbestos claims that they had reinsured,and that these requirements differ from the parties prior course of dealing.it complains that the underwriters have subjected it to repetitive audits and requests for information,and have not paid the billings that westchester fire submitted.it seeks an award enforcing the payment requirement and confirming that it is under no obligation to meet the documentation or claim procedures that the underwriters have asserted.
in response to each underwriters petition,westchester fire to compel arbitration.in regard to the special contingency petition,westchester fire argued that,a lthough the contract wording for the reinsurance program varied in certain respects over the years,the contract wording for the reinsurance program provides that the contract between the parties is continuous,even though it changes in certain respects over time.disputes under the reinsurance program are to be resolved by arbitration in morristown,new jersey.app.at.westchester fire responded similarly to the underwriters comprehensive catastrophe petition,arguing that,while t he reinsurance program consisted of several layers over the years,the agreement between the parties was continuous and,similarly,called for arbitration in morristown,new jersey.app.at.
following consolidation of the two actions,the district court observed that it was not presented with the question of whether a valid arbitration agreement exists,but,rather,the question of whether the parties had contractually agreed to separate arbitrations under the various contractual layers to the reinsurance program or to a single consolidated arbitration with respect to each petition.app.at.this,the district court concluded,was an issue for the arbitrators not the courts to decide.id.it issued an order denying the underwriters petitions and granting westchester fire to compel arbitration.the order directed the underwriters to appoint a single arbitrator in response to each of westchester fire arbitration demands,and proceed promptly with westchester fire insurance company to identify a single umpire in response to each arbitration demand.app.at.the order also instructed that the relief granted herein shall not,in any matter,preclude the underwriters from applying to the arbitration panel for the same or similar relief sought in this proceeding nor in any way limit the panel authority to grant such relief.app.at.
the district court had jurisdiction under because,as the parties agree,these actions between domestic westchester fire and foreign underwriters fall within the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,chemrite,cir see also china minmetals materials imp.exp,chi mei,cir explaining,in regard to the federal arbitration act faa,et,that the domestic faa chapter of the faa is applicable to actions brought under the convention chapter of the faa to the extent they are not in conflict pursuant to.
we have jurisdiction over the underwriters appeal under and section of the faa.sandvik ab advent int l,cir.this court exercises plenary review over the legal questions concerning the applicability and scope of an arbitration agreement.medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir.
the underwriters the reinsurers argue that the district court had no authority to order the parties to submit to an arbitral determination of the question of whether future arbitrations on the underlying merits issue would occur in consolidated or fashion.the underwriters argue that the arbitration clause in each agreement calls for an arbitration of all issues pertaining to that specific reinsurance contract,which they believe requires an arbitration.appellants br.at.therefore,they continue,forcing all parties into a unified threshold proceeding in connection with each demand is beyond the scope of what the parties agreed to arbitrate.the issue of consolidated arbitration,they insist,should be presented to individual arbitration panels convened in accordance with each contract.
in contrast to the underwriters,westchester fire argues that the question of whether the contracts should be arbitrated collectively or individually is itself a determination that must be made by an arbitrator.in the alternative,westchester fire argues that,were we to decide that it is the district court that must make the consolidation decision,new jersey law authorizes consolidation of multiple arbitrations under multiple contracts.appellee br.at.in light of our determination,we need not reach this issue.
a rbitration is a creature of contract,and an arbitration panel has the authority to decide only the issues that have been submitted for arbitration by the parties.metromedia energy,enserch energy,cir medtronic,at noting that arbitrators have the authority to resolve disputes only if the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration and that there must be sufficient evidence that the parties consented to arbitration in an express agreement.
in two recent cases,the supreme court has provided guidance on the sometimes vexing issue of the respective roles of the court and the arbitrators.in howsam dean witter reynolds,d,an investor howsam,complaining that her broker dean witter had made misrepresentations in its investment advice,sought arbitration before the national association of securities dealers nasd.id.at.dean witter filed suit in federal court seeking a declaration that howsam suit was untimely.id.the district court dismissed the action,holding that the nasd arbitrator should decide the issue.id.
the court of appeals for the tenth circuit reversed on the ground that the question of whether howsam claim was under a nasd arbitration rule presented a question of arbitrability for the court to decide.id.the supreme court reversed.it noted that although it had long recognized the liberal federal policy in favor of arbitration,the question of whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration,the question of arbitrability,is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.id.at.emphasis in original internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the court stated that whereas one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a question of arbitrability,the phrase question of arbitrability has a far more limited scope.id.such questions of arbitrability are raised only in narrow circumstance s where courts must determine gateway matter s,such as a dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause or whether a disagreement about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.in contrast,the court explained,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.id.at.emphasis in original internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in howsam,the court observed the inherent logic and efficiency of such a presumption.f or the law to assume an expectation that aligns decisionmaker with comparative expertise will help better to secure a fair and expeditious resolution of the underlying goal of arbitration systems and judicial systems alike.id.at.thus,only when there is a question regarding whether the parties should be arbitrating at all is a question of arbitrability raised for the court to resolve.dockser schwartzberg,cir.in other circumstances,resolution by the arbitrator remains the presumptive rule.id.
the court plurality decision in green tree financial bazzle,d,provides further guidance as to the distinction between questions of arbitrability for the court and questions of arbitral procedure for the arbitrator.two sets of south carolina customers who had contracted with green tree financial for loans for either home improvement or home purchase filed separate actions claiming that green tree failed to provide them with the form legally required under south carolina law advising that they had a right to name their own lawyers and insurance agents.id.at.their contracts with green tree provided for mandatory arbitration,and they filed separate actions in south carolina state courts.id.at.one set of plaintiffs,the bazzles,asked the court to certify a class action,which the court did and compelled arbitration.id.the arbitrator,proceeding with the arbitration as a class arbitration,awarded in statutory damages plus attorney fees.id.in the other proceeding,the arbitrator certified a class in arbitration and ultimately awarded in statutory damages in addition to attorney fees.id.
green tree appealed to the south carolina court of appeals claiming that class arbitration was legally impermissible.id.the south carolina supreme court assumed jurisdiction and held that,if an arbitration provision is silent on the question,then arbitration is permissible.id.at.the united states supreme court granted certiorari to consider whether the south carolina supreme court holding was consistent with the faa.id.in its decision,the court held that the resolution of the threshold question of contract interpretation are the contracts in fact silent,or do they forbid class arbitration as petitioner green tree financial contends should be resolved in arbitration.id.at.
drawing on howsam,the plurality reasoned that unless one finds clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary in an arbitration clause,only in certain gateway matters will a court assume that the parties intended courts,not arbitrators,to decide a particular matter.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.matters that concern neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties will not fall within this narrow exception.see also pacificare health,book,d rejecting argument that preliminary question of whether the contractual remedial limitations at issue here prohibit an award of rico treble damages raised question of arbitrability for court to resolve,and concluding it presented question of contract interpretation to be resolved in arbitration buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d under the faa,whether a contract is void for illegality is generally an issue for arbitrator,not court,to decide ehleiter grapetree shores,cir concluding that green tree reaffirms the general division of labor between arbitrator and judge as articulated in howsam.the green tree plurality therefore vacated the decision of the south carolina supreme court and remanded the case so that the arbitrator may decide the question of contract enforcing the parties arbitration agreements according to their terms.at.
thus,howsam and green tree together explain why no question of arbitrability,as the supreme court has that phrase,has been raised here.under section of the faa,federal courts,upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,are authorized to make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.see also a court having jurisdiction under this chapter may direct that arbitration be held in accordance with the agreement.this,the district court has done.
as in green tree,the question here is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter,but rather what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.at.emphasis in original.in this case,the parties agree that they agreed to arbitrate the question is merely whether they agreed to individualized or consolidated proceedings as a matter of procedure.therefore,any doubt here about the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
the underwriters protest that there is no contractual authority for a threshold proceeding before an arbitrator on consolidation under each program.yet,westchester fire demands for arbitration under the comprehensive catastrophe and special contingency treaties are based on express contractual language between the parties that calls for arbitration.whether requiring the underwriters to select an arbitrator for each program is consistent with the contractual language will be appropriately resolved by the arbitrators once the panels are convened.such disputes on arbitral procedure are i ncluded within the scope of the default rule in favor of arbitral resol
