background 
tite curet was a prolific puerto rican composer who passed away on august,leaving three heirs.lamco is a publisher that owns music through contracts with composers and acemla is a performance rights society.tite curet musical catalog with acemla and lamco includes approximately to compositions.
at issue in this case are four of tite curet songs,pueblo latino,distinto y diferente,periódico de ayer,and planté bandera.on august,tite curet signed contracts with lamco and acemla assigning and conveying the licensing rights to certain songs,including the four songs at issue here.according to these contracts,lamco and acemla were obligated to provide tite curet with royalty reports on february and august of each year.tite curet also signed the june,rider the rider,which extended the previously mentioned contracts indefinitely in exchange for.however,as the curet heirs expert testified,acemla and lamco never paid tite curet the.
acemla and lamco failed to comply with the requirement to provide royalty reports.they failed to issue separate royalty reports between and but instead compiled the royalties data for those years in the and royalty reports.further,although acemla and lamco are separate entities and should have provided separate reports,they submitted combined data in the and royalty reports.they failed to provide any royalty reports for and did not provide the and royalty reports until january.to make matters worse,the district court found that the reports contained inconsistencies and accounting discrepancies.see curet velázquez acemla de,adc,slip op.at.acemla and lamco also issued several checks to tite curet as royalty reimbursements or as bonuses,but accounted for them as royalty advances.acemla and lamco also failed to report royalties and to issue payments with respect to the same.see id.at.
procedural history 
the curet heirs filed a complaint against acemla and lamco in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico seeking injunctive and monetary relief pursuant to the copyright act of,as amended,et.the district court had jurisdiction over this claim pursuant to and.the complaint also included puerto rico law claims for breach of contract,nullity of contract,rescission of contract,unfair competition,tort,unjust enrichment and moral rights.the district court had jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to and.
on april,the curet heirs filed a motion for summary judgment and a statement of facts in support thereof.this initial motion for summary judgment stated that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to acemla and lamco infringement of the pueblo latino copyright.the district court set september,as the deadline for acemla and lamco response to the curet heirs motion for summary judgment.acemla and lamco filed their opposition to the motion for summary judgment on the deadline date,and the curet heirs filed a on october.
on february,the curet heirs filed a second motion for summary judgment and a second statement of material facts alleging that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to acemla and lamco infringement of pueblo latino,distinto y diferente,periódico de ayer,and planté bandera.acemla and lamco filed their opposition to the second motion for summary judgment on april.
on june,the district court issued an order referring the motions for summary judgment to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation pursuant to b.on november,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation granting in part and denying in part the motions for summary judgment.curet velázquez acemla de puerto rico,adc,wl,at.the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment regarding the copyright infringement claim regarding the licensing of the performance of pueblo latino at a concert at hostos community college and the copyright infringement claims regarding the licenses issued as to planté bandera and periódico de ayer id.at.on january,acemla and lamco filed their objections to the report and recommendation,but despite the objections,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full in an order issued on august.id.at.
the district court then held a bench trial to address two issues the amount of damages and the curet heirs claims of breach of contract and rescission.during the trial,the court heard testimony from félix norman román negrón román,the curet heirs expert witness,regarding the royalty reports and his calculation of the damages to the plaintiffs.his valuation of the curet heirs damages was based on two value theories the opportunity cost theory and the conclusion of value theory cvt.acemla and lamco moved to strike román testimony,arguing that he was not qualified as an expert in copyright infringement and challenging the value theories he used to assess the curet heirs damages.on march,the court issued its opinion and order,and entered judgment.curet velázquez,adc,slip op.at.
the district court concluded that román was qualified as an expert witness,but rejected the use of the opportunity cost theory,concluding that the theory did not pass muster under federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.curet velázquez,adc,slip op.at.
with respect to the copyright infringement claim,the court concluded that acemla and lamco copyright infringements were not willful under the copyright act because at the time of the infringements acemla and lamco were appealing the district court ruling regarding the ownership of pueblo latino.id.at.the court then proceeded to impose the maximum statutory damages allowed under c,which was for each of the four infringements for a total of in statutory damages.id.at.the court reasoned that it was impossible for it to determine the amount of damages due to acemla and lamco incomplete records.id.at.
the court also concluded that the statute of limitations for actions arising under the commonwealth commerce code or under article of the commerce code,laws ann.tit,did not bar the curet heirs claims.id.at.the court noted that even if this statute of limitations were to apply,it would not bar the curet heirs claims because of the nature of acemla and lamco actions.id.at.further,the court determined that the applicable statute of limitations was the fifteen year statute of limitations for breach of contract pursuant to article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit,and that the claims fell within the required limitation.id.at.
acemla and lamco filed a notice of appeal on april.this court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
copyright act preemption and statute of limitations 
appellants contend that the copyright act of preempts the curet heirs cause of action under puerto rico law for rescission of contract,laws ann.tit,and that the statute of limitations for actions of rescission,id,bars the curet heirs action seeking such rescission.appellants failed to properly raise these arguments at the district court level and,absent compelling circumstances,these arguments are waived.
we do not find any evidence in the record below that acemla and lamco argued that the copyright act preempts the cause of action for rescission of contract under puerto rico law.it is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court can not be surfaced for the first time on appeal.mccoy.inst.of,cir,cited with approval in horne flores,see,boston celtics.shaw,cir clauson smith,cir.there is nothing sufficiently compelling about this case to warrant relaxation of such a fundamental rule.see teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union,local superline transp,cir.
with respect to the statute of limitations argument,acemla and lamco argue that they specifically raised the argument in their answer to the curet heirs complaint where they stated,claimant allegations are time barred by the statute of limitation,without specifying which statute of limitations was applicable.during the closing arguments at the bench trial,appellants argued that the applicable statute of limitations was article of the puerto rico commerce code,laws ann.tit,et.see curet velázquez,adc,slip op.at.as the district court noted,both during trial and in their brief,acemla and lamco cited to a provision of the commerce code that applies to actions that prescribe in one year,none of which apply to the claims at issue in this case id.at.the appellants brief failed to provide adequate legal argumentation explaining why the commerce code should apply.see id.on appeal,appellants now seek to buttress their statute of limitations argument by citing to a different statute of limitations,laws ann.tit.yet,they fail to explain why they cited to a different statute in the district court.
we can not say that this argument was clearly raised before the district court,and o verburdened trial judges can not be expected to be mind readers.mccoy,at.we conclude that appellants have failed to make some effort at developed argumentation it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.harriman hancock,cir quoting united states zannino,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
various objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation 
acemla and lamco contend that the magistrate judge report and recommendation with respect to the curet heirs motion for summary judgment was based on erroneous findings of fact and law.specifically,they argue that the magistrate judge committed errors of fact and law regarding the validity of the assignment establishing ownership,and the finding that the harry fox agency authorization of licenses constituted infringements.we have examined acemla and lamco objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation and we conclude that they failed to object to the magistrate judge manner of addressing these issues in the report and recommendation.therefore,we conclude that these arguments are waived.see borden sec y of health human,cir agreeing with the district court that the appellant had waived an issue by failing to raise it before the magistrate judge.i t is a virtually ironclad rule that a party may not advance for the first time on appeal a new argument cochran quest software,cir.
implied license defense 
acemla and lamco also argue that the district court erred in deeming their implied license defense waived.see curet velázquez,wl,at.they argue that e ven if the arguments were more developed in the objections,the factual bases are contained in the record,the complaint,and exhibits to the motions and were undoubtedly raised and argued by defendants.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court conclusion that a party has waived an issue by failing to adequately assert it before the magistrate judge.see guillemard ginorio contreras gómez,cir.arguments alluded to but not properly developed before a magistrate judge are deemed waived.see id.at.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in not addressing an argument not explicitly raised before the magistrate judge.the appellants had their chance to exhaust their nonexclusive implied license argument in front of the magistrate judge,but made the affirmative decision not to do so.curet velázquez,wl,at.their contention that the factual basis for the implied license argument was in the record before the magistrate judge is unavailing.a passing mention that fails to present analysis or any legal theory of support is insufficient to constitute an argument.mccoy,at.a party has a duty to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly rather than being allowed to defeat the system by seeding the record with mysterious references hoping to set the stage for an ambush should the ensuing ruling fail to suit.id.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting paterson leitch.mun.wholesale,cir.if claims are merely insinuated rather than actually articulated in the trial court,we will ordinarily refuse to deem them preserved for appellate review.id.here,the appellants mentioned in passing facts that might have been used to support the argument they now seek to develop on appeal.the magistrate judge should not have been expected to make the argument for them.the argument is waived.
discovery and expert testimony 
acemla and lamco contend that the district court abused its discretion when it reopened discovery and ordered simultaneous disclosure of expert reports and that those actions prejudiced them.they further assert that the district court abused its discretion because it permitted the curet heirs expert to testify to matters beyond his report without requiring him to amend his report.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to reopen discovery and to allow the expert witness to testify to matters beyond his report.
reopening discovery 
district courts have broad discretion in pretrial management matters.wells real estate inv.trust ii,chardón hato rey,cir.we review discovery orders for abuse of discretion.remexcel managerial consultants,arlequín,cir.w e may reverse a district court only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,that is,where the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting in re subpoena to witzel,cir.
at a settlement conference held on october,the court set new deadlines for,among other things,discovery,designation of experts,expert reports,and the deposition of experts.acemla and lamco argue that the court decision to reopen discovery prejudiced them,in part because the court required that the parties submit their expert reports simultaneously.specifically,acemla and lamco argue that the court should have set the deadline for the submission of their expert report for sixty days after the deadline for the curet heirs to submit their expert report.they assert that the court failure to do so prejudiced them because they did not know whether the curet heirs would use an expert or what the expert testimony would cover.
the record reveals that the appellants paint a picture that is convenient for them,but unsupported in fact.because the parties explicitly agreed to designate experts and exchange reports by a certain date,the appellants can not claim that they were unprepared for the possibility that the curet heirs would use an expert.the district court october,settlement conference report and order,which was entered with respect to the october,settlement conference,states that october was agreed upon to exchange the designation of experts november,expert reports are due emphasis added.
it appears that what appellants are really complaining about is the court refusal to grant the requested extensions and not the court decision to extend discovery.in fact,they themselves requested that the court extend the time further.although the appellants were aware of the deadline to produce their expert report,they failed to file it on time and,on december,after the november,deadline,they filed a motion titled omnibus motion regarding expert report,nunc pro tunc,requesting an extension until december,to produce the expert report.on december,they filed a motion titled motion requesting enlargement of time opposition to preclude expert witness nunc pro tunc,in which they requested an extension until december,to produce their expert report.on january,acemla and lamco filed a motion seeking to extend the time to conclude discovery until february.on january,the court denied all motions requesting an extension of time.given the appellants requests,we find it difficult to understand exactly how the appellants were prejudiced by the court decision to reopen discovery.the district court did not abuse its discretion in reopening discovery.
expert witness 
acemla and lamco also claim that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the curet heirs expert witness to testify to matters that were not covered in his expert report,in particular,documents that he received on the day of his deposition and a week before trial.they also objected to román qualifications and methodology.the appellants filed a motion to limit the curet heirs expert testimony to the content of his filed report.the district court nevertheless allowed román to testify,including about the newly received evidence.the appellants now object to the district court failure to exclude román testimony as a sanction for failing to amend his expert report to reflect new evidence,as federal rule of civil procedure e requires.they also appeal the district court conclusion that román was a qualified expert witness.
expert report discussion 
we review a district court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony due to a violation of federal rule of civil procedure e for abuse of discretion.boston gas,keyspan energy delivery century indem,cir reviewing the district court decision to preclude an expert witness from supplementing his expert report for abuse of discretion.further,the court abuse of discretion must have resulted in prejudice to the complaining party.licciardi tig ins,cir.
federal rule of civil procedure e requires a party to supplement information included in the expert report and information given during the expert deposition.one of the purposes of this rule is to avoid trial by ambush.macaulay anas,cir.we have looked to a variety of factors in assessing a claim of error under rule.licciardi,at.these include the conduct of the trial,the importance of the evidence to its proponent,and the ability of the opposing party to formulate a response.id.alteration in original quoting johnson webster,cir internal quotation marks omitted.surprise and prejudice are important integers in determining whether the district court abused its discretion.macaulay,at.
here,appellants complain that román testified to things he did after his report was rendered without amending his expert report.we have examined the record and note that during the voir dire,plaintiffs counsel did ask questions about documents that were not included in the report.however,the documents at issue are documents that acemla and lamco produced on the day of román deposition and about a week before trial.the court noted that román did not prepare an amended report,but verified that he did not reach any new conclusions or change his opinion based on the new information.román testified that the new documentation did not change the conclusion in his original report and in fact corroborated the inconsistencies and lack of proper record keeping that he originally identified.
in these circumstances,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that no amendment to the expert report was required and allowing the testimony.here,there was no prejudice to the appellants because román testimony briefly referenced new documents that the appellants themselves drafted and had delayed in disclosing.in this case,the expert testimony did not evidence a different conclusion or opinion from that expressed in his report.macaulay,at affirming the district court decision to preclude appellant expert witness where her expert witness attempted to opine on a new theory of liability and the court concluded that this change would cause unfair surprise licciardi,at,vacating and remanding for a new trial where the trial testimony of appellee expert directly contradicted and went beyond his expert report regarding a material issue in the case.further,appellants can not claim that the reference to these new documents was an unfair surprise because they themselves prepared and disclosed the documents.see brennan dickie brennan,cir affirming district court denial of a motion to exclude plaintiff expert supplemental report where the district court reasonably believed that the defense expert had access to the supporting work papers and calculations and where the defense expert was already familiar with the underlying data.
expert qualifications 
appellants also object to the district court failure to strike román testimony because his qualifications and methodology were unreliable.we review a district court federal rule of evidence rulings for abuse of discretion.milward acuity specialty prods,cir.
appellants specifically objected to the reliability of román opportunity cost theory.although the district court allowed román to present the theory and did not strike it from the record,it rejected the opportunity cost theory in its opinion and order.curet velázquez,adc,slip op.at.therefore,there was no prejudice to acemla and lamco due to the testimony regarding the opportunity cost theory.we can easily dismiss appellants argument because the district court ultimately rejected and disregarded the portion of román testimony based on his opportunity cost theory,a method that he created and that had not gained acceptance in the music industry.id.after reviewing the record we find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination that román was a qualified expert.we therefore affirm the district court decision to qualify román as an expert and to allow his testimony regarding appellants accounting,royalty reports and statements.
statutory damages 
appellants acemla and lamco argue that the district court erred in awarding,pursuant to c,maximum statutory damages for each of the four infringements that acemla and lamco were found to have committed.specifically,acemla and lamco argue that the curet heirs did not properly exercise the option to receive statutory damages because their complaint elected to receive an award of either actual damages or statutory damages.they also aver that the district court imposition of the statutory maximum for each infringement was grossly excessive and was an abuse of discretion because the damages were not proven and the court improperly relied on román determination of damages.we reject the appellants claims and affirm the district court imposition of the maximum damages allowed under c.
first,we reject the contention that the curet heirs failed to properly exercise their option to receive statutory damages.in these circumstances,where the curet heirs requested either actual damages or statutory damages,appellants can not complain that they had no notice that the court might grant statutory damages.in fact,federal rule of civil procedure explicitly allows a plaintiff to demand relief in the alternative.a a demand for the relief sought may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief.see also william patry,patry on copyright noting that a plaintiff may submit both actual damages and statutory damages to the trier of fact as alternatives and wait until the verdict is rendered to select which one it prefers.further,the statute clearly states that the copyright owner may elect,a
