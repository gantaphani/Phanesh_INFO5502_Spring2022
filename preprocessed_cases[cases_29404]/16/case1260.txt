at least three times during the past two decades,federal courts in our circuit have called upon west virginia highest court to answer certified questions regarding the west virginia unfair trade practices act wvutpa.each time,the supreme court of appeals of west virginia determined that actions pursuant to the wvutpa sound in tort and not in contract.taylor nationwide mut.ins,wilt state auto.mut.ins.co,poling motorists mut.ins,this court,too,has decided a case under that same framework,albeit in an unpublished opinion.yost travelers ins,cir unpublished table decision.in view of the want of published authority from this court and the frequency with which the wvutpa is litigated in federal court,we take this opportunity to clarify the law for district courts,unless and until the supreme court of appeals of west virginia rules to the contrary.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that actions brought pursuant to the wvutpa sound in tort and not in contract.we further hold that west virginia law governs the underlying lawsuit and that the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings.
audrey kenney husband,ronald kenney,passed away on september,leaving kenney as the sole beneficiary of a policy the policy issued by the independent order of foresters iof,a canadian corporation.at the time of kenney passing in,the kenneys were residents of west virginia and had resided there since.at the time that iof issued the policy to kenney in,however,the kenneys resided in virginia.the policy contains a provision that states as follows the rights or obligations of the member or anyone rightfully claiming under this certificate will be governed by the laws of the state in which this certificate is delivered.
on september,kenney filed a claim with iof to collect the policy benefits,which she believed to be iof,however,responded that the policy was worth only.in fact,although the policy was worth only when kenney took out the policy in,kenney subsequently applied for and received a increase in coverage in.
when iof refused to pay to kenney,she filed a complaint with the west virginia office of the insurance commissioner the commissioner on november.iof responded to kenney complaint on or around december,and maintained that the policy was worth only.on june,the commissioner scheduled an administrative hearing to be held on august,regarding kenney claim.then,on july,nearly ten months after kenney first contacted iof and just twelve days before the administrative hearing was scheduled to take place iof reversed course and agreed to pay to kenney.without further explanation,iof provided the following reasoning for the sudden departure from its prior position on kenney claim there are some inconsistencies within the file that lead us to the conclusion that kenney would have assumed the face amount of the insurance certificate at the increased coverage amount of.based on this information,we will honour the death claim for that amount.in its brief on appeal,iof now reveals that kenney allegedly failed to sign and return the offer form before its expiration date,and thus the offer for the increase in coverage had lapsed.this explanation,however,was never provided to kenney during the nearly period that she was denied the benefit of the increased coverage.
kenney sued iof in west virginia state court on september,pursuant to the wvutpa.specifically,kenney acknowledged in her complaint that she substantially prevailed in obtaining the coverage to which she was always lawfully entitled she alleged,however,that iof conduct in connection with its handling of her claim constituted an unlawful settlement practice prohibited by the wvutpa.see,f unlawful to n ot attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.iof removed the case to the district court below and thereafter moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted iof motion to dismiss and kenney appealed this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
this appeal presents three issues that we must address in series.first,whether kenney lawsuit pursuant to the wvutpa sounds in tort or in contract.in re bankers trust,cir the initial step in any choice of law analysis involves the characterization of the subject matter of or the issues in the case,tort or contract and of the nature of each issue and whether it raises a problem of procedural or substantive law.citing scoles hay,conflict of laws.second,whether west virginia law or virginia law governs the outcome of the suit pursuant to west virginia rules.see acme circus operating kuperstock,cir.and finally,whether the complaint factual allegations sufficiently state a claim upon which relief can be granted.this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.ballard bank of,cir.
when hearing a case on appeal for which federal subject matter jurisdiction was proper in the district court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction,this court applies the rules of the state of the district court below,volvo constr.equip,clm equip,cir in this case,west virginia.the proper analysis in west virginia varies depending on how a claim is characterized,as a tort claim or as a contract claim.choice of law in contracts cases is governed by the rule of lex loci contractus,see johnson neal,and choice of law in torts cases is generally governed by the rule of lex loci delicti,see vest albans psychiatric,se d.
the district court did not take a position on whether kenney wvutpa claim sounds in tort or in contract because it concluded that virginia law applied in either case.similarly,iof contends that characterization of the wvutpa claim as either a tort claim or a contract claim is wholly irrelevant because the result is the same under both analyses.because we are firm in our conviction that kenney wvutpa claim sounds in tort,as explained in detail below,it is unnecessary to conduct a contracts analysis.that being said,we are reluctant to agree with iof that the applicable law would be the same under both analyses based on the provision contained within the policy.
iof cites to several nonbinding federal cases that are split as to whether wvutpa claims are properly characterized as contract or tort claims.see,yost,stating that duties arising under the wvutpa are,extracontractual,but applying analysis for a tort claim pen coal william mcgee,characterizing and wvutpa claims as and,but applying analysis for a contract claim.kenney,on the other hand,cites to west virginia state cases for the proposition that wvutpa claims sound in tort.see,wilt,at characterizing a violation of the wvutpa as tortious conduct quoting poling,at internal quotation marks omitted.although kenney wvutpa claim would not exist the policy,her claim is not predicated on the terms of the policy itself rather,kenney complaint makes clear that her cause of action stems from iof allegedly handling of her claim for proceeds on the policy.this distinction is important.
the supreme court of appeals of west virginia explained the distinction noted above in wilt.there,injured plaintiffs sued the in federal court pursuant to the wvutpa for unfair settlement practices after they were involved in an automobile accident.id.at.the district court then asked the supreme court of appeals of west virginia to determine the proper statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiffs claim one year for torts or ten years for written contracts.id.in concluding that the plaintiffs wvutpa claim sounded in tort,the wilt court contrasted the facts before it with the facts of plumley may,
in plumley,this court held that a claim by an insured to recover underinsurance benefits from insurance carrier is governed by the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions.that action,as opposed to the plaintiffs pending claim,involved the direct attempt by an insured to recover policy benefits from the carrier with whom entered into a contract for underinsurance.in contrast to the instant case that was brought to recover damages for unfair settlement practices,plumley was a direct suit against the insurer to obtain insurance benefits.given this critical distinction,plumley is clearly inapposite authority for plaintiffs contention that unfair settlement claims are contractual in origin.
wilt,at emphasis added footnote omitted citation omitted.
the supreme court of appeals of west virginia employed the same reasoning used in wilt in the analogous case of hall nichols.in hall,the appellants sued their attorney for legal malpractice,and the trial court dismissed the action as based on the statute of limitations applicable to torts,as opposed to contracts.id.at.despite recognizing that claims sound in both tort and contract,the appeals court affirmed the lower court and also characterized the action as one in tort.specifically,the court noted that,n otwithstanding the inclusion of the term contractual in the amended complaint,the essence of the appellants cause of action is various breaches of duties implied by law and not by contract.id.at.the hall court employed and quoted in its entirety the reasoning from pancake house,redmond,which states 
where the act complained of is a breach of specific terms of the contract without any reference to the legal duties imposed by law upon the relationship created thereby,the action is contractual.where the essential claim of the action is a breach of a duty imposed by law upon the relationship of and not of the contract itself,the action is in tort.
id.at emphasis added see hall,at only when the breach pertains specifically to the terms of the contract without any reference to the legal duties imposed by law upon the attorney client relationship is the cause of action contractual in nature.alterations in original quoting redmond,at.
here,it is uncontested that kenney claim does not directly involve the policy terms or benefits as noted above,kenney conceded in her complaint that she substantially prevailed in obtaining the coverage to which she was always lawfully entitled.rather,like in wilt and hall,kenney lawsuit is based on iof allegedly unlawful conduct in connection with its handling of her claim.in other words,notwithstanding the repeated references to the policy a contract in the complaint,the essential claim underlying kenney lawsuit is iof allegedly tortious conduct.see hall,at quoting redmond,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we can further reason that kenney action is one in tort as opposed to on the type of damages available under the wvutpa and the type of relief prayed for in the complaint.the wilt court noted that a successful plaintiff suing pursuant to the wvutpa may recover attorney fees and punitive damages and,because punitive damages,as a rule,are not available in contract cases,the damages awarded in connection with a violation of the wvutpa are clearly not typical of damages awarded in contract cases.at citation omitted.here,kenney seeks,among other relief,punitive damages and attorneys fees and costs.notably,however,she does not seek damages based on the terms of the policy itself,but instead references the policy only when describing the damages that she incurred as a result of iof improper refusal to honor her claim.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that kenney wvutpa claim sounds in tort and not in contract.we now proceed to determine which state laws apply to the substantive tort claim.
the district court,when it assumed arguendo that kenney claim sounds in tort,employed the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement approach and concluded that virginia law applies.the parties dispute this result kenney argues that the district court erred by not using the lex loci delicti approach and that west virginia courts usually apply iof,on the other hand,contends that the district court was correct in both its methodology and conclusion.both parties are justified in their positions as noted above,west virginia traditionally applies the lex loci delicti approach to torts,see vest,se d at,but has in certain circumstances shown a willingness to apply the restatement approach to resolve particularly thorny conflicts problems,oakes oxygen therapy.
regardless,as the proper approach is an issue of state law and,as we explain below,the outcome is the same under either approach,this court need not determine which approach west virginia courts would apply here.see chawla transam.occidental life ins,cir c ourts should avoid deciding more than is necessary to resolve a specific case.rather,we prefer to leave it up to west virginia courts to develop west virginia law in this area.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that west virginia law applies pursuant to the lex loci delicti approach and the restatement approach.
under the lex loci delicti approach,courts apply the law of the place of the wrong.although conduct that causes harm can occur in one state and the resulting injury to a plaintiff can occur in another state,the substantive rights between the parties are determined by the law of the place of injury.west virginia ex rel.chemtall madden.
here,iof asserts that the effects of its allegedly unlawful conduct and thus kenney injury would have been felt by kenney in virginia,as the state where the policy was issued and where kenney applied for the increase in coverage.this argument rings hollow.the kenneys moved from virginia to west virginia in and lived there continuously until kenney passed away in.kenney filed her claim on the policy with iof from west virginia and remains a west virginia resident.accordingly,insofar as kenney cause of action stems from iof handling of her claim on the policy and she was a west virginia resident at all times during resolution of her claim on september,when she filed the claim with iof on november,when she filed a complaint with the commissioner and on july,when iof agreed to pay to kenney the full the injury to kenney undoubtedly occurred in west virginia,not virginia.see yost,concluding that the worry,annoyance,and economic hardship of the delay in receiving compensation,the injury in an claim is suffered in the state where the plaintiff resides.
accordingly,we hold that west virginia law applies to kenney claim pursuant to the lex loci delicti approach.we turn now to the restatement approach that the district court employed.
section of the restatement provides as follows the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to that issue,has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in which we explain below.section then lists four contacts to consider when determining the most significant relationship a the place where the injury occurred b the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred c the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties and d the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.restatement second of conflict of laws.
as determined above in our analysis of the lex loci delicti approach,contact a points to west virginia as the state where the injury to kenney occurred.as to contact b,despite iof contention that the alleged misrepresentations took place in virginia,the letter denying the full benefit of the policy to kenney was sent presumably from iof toronto,canada office as to contact c,kenney is currently a west virginia resident and iof is headquartered in canada.as to contact d,even though the relationship between kenney and iof began in virginia when he first took the policy out in and later applied for the increase in coverage in,the relationship between kenney who is the party to the lawsuit and iof is centered in west virginia,where kenney sought to collect,and was denied,policy benefits.in sum,none of the contacts point to virginia,and three of the four contacts point to west virginia,with the fourth contact being split between canada and west virginia an outcome that we would expect in a diversity suit.
