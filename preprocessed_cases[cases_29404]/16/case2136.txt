plaintiff gage products company,a chemical supplier to daimlerchrysler corporation jefferson north assembly plant,appeals the september,order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of defendant henkel corporation and the september,order denying gage motion for reconsideration.on may,henkel became the sole tier i supplier of chemical products to the plant pursuant to chrysler total chemical management program tcm program.as a consequence,gage,which previously had been one of several tier i suppliers to the plant,became a tier ii supplier and began selling its chemical products directly to henkel instead of chrysler.henkel insisted on paying gage the prices gage had been charging chrysler for chemical products prior to may,the current prices.gage insisted that it would sell its products to henkel only if henkel paid the prices gage had proposed to chrysler in november,but that chrysler had not yet approved the higher prices.despite the parties apparent disagreement over price,henkel ordered,and gage shipped,chemical products in response to those orders.the district court held that gage did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether henkel breached a contract to pay gage the higher prices for its chemical products,which chrysler eventually approved in august.the district court also held that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether henkel promise to honor gage higher prices upon chrysler approval amounted to fraud.for the reasons that follow,we affirm,in part,and reverse,in part,the judgment of the district court.
substantive facts 
in early,pursuant to its tcm program,daimlerchrysler chrysler issued a request for quotation rfq for the position of chemical manager at its jefferson north assembly plant the plant or jnap in detroit,michigan.under this new tcm program,chrysler would contract directly with the chemical manager as opposed to contracting directly with numerous tier i chemical suppliers.the tcm program would make the chemical manager the sole tier i supplier and put the burden on the chemical manager to minimize waste and reduce costs through its direct dealings with the chemical suppliers.the rfq required bidders to identify all of its proposed suppliers on whom the quotation price would be based and to divide the total cost of all of the chemicals supplied to the plant by the total number of vehicles units produced at the plant,yielding a cost per unit,or cpu,figure.each bidder would then submit its respective cost per unit figure,which chrysler would use to determine the low bidder.each bidder would be required to propose cost per unit pricing for each of the three years of the contract,with the cost per unit price declining from year to year.
both gage products company gage and henkel corporation henkel,direct competitors and chemical suppliers to the plant,bid for the chemical manager contract.to prepare its bid,henkel solicited prices from gage for various chemical products to be used for paint spraybooth maintenance,purge solvent,equipment cleaning,windshield solvent,floor cleaning,paint spraybooth coatings,and other specialty chemical products.on march,gage submitted a quotation of per unit,and attached a list of its products reflecting the price per gallon of each product 
gage claims that its march,quote was based on the prices that gage had quoted and that chrysler had been reviewing since november four months earlier,on november,gage had informed chrysler by letter that it would be raising its prices effective november,due to market conditions.as of march,chrysler had yet to respond to gage plan to raise its prices in the meantime,gage continued to invoice chrysler at its current prices.unbeknownst to gage,henkel disregarded the higher prices quoted on march,and instead submitted its chemical manager bid to chrysler with what it believed to be gage current prices that it had obtained from chrysler computer system.
on april,chrysler named henkel the chemical manager.on april,henkel complained about gage prices and requested gage to provide its current pricing for chrysler gage refused to quote henkel its current prices,instead offering to supply its products at the prices based on the november,letter to chrysler.gage believed that these higher prices,which were to have taken effect the preceding november,represented its current pricing for chrysler,even though chrysler had not yet approved the new prices.
on may,representatives from gage and henkel met and again discussed gage pricing.at that meeting,charles schilling,henkel sales director,asked jay hohauser,gage business manager for chrysler accounts,to quote gage current chrysler pricing.hohauser responded that gage was expecting chrysler to authorize its higher prices.schilling responded that if chrysler awarded gage the increased pricing,henkel will pay that.
on may,joe farren,henkel chemical manager at the plant,sent an to hohauser stating,jay,perhaps i was emphatic enough at our meeting the other day you were to have the current pricing used at the plant to chuck schilling and myself yesterday.if purchasing ok a price increase we will certainly honor it.until then please provide the current pricing in effect for the plant.a few days later,hohauser told farren by,chrysler purchasing has confirmed a path forward for our price adjustments which will be in effect next tuesday,may.therefore,the original pricing we submitted in march,which reflects our price adjustments plus our manpower at the plant,is our pricing.id 
on may,schilling sent an to chrysler,requesting verification of hohauser claim about an authorized price increase effective may.chrysler responded that gage increases had not been authorized and that any changes that may occur with gage in the future would not affect the launch of the tcm program on may.
when the tcm program launched on may,henkel needed to order chemical products from gage to avoid shutting down the plant.henkel argues that,as of the launch date,gage still had refused to divulge the prices it was charging chrysler at the time and that it was forced to obtain the prices through its access to chrysler computers.def.br.at,and.as noted,however,henkel already knew gage chrysler pricing because it had accessed that information in march in order to prepare its bid for the chemical manager contract.again,it appears that henkel was not seeking pricing information from gage,but a price quotation a blanket purchase order from which henkel could order gage products.this view is supported by the fact that,beginning on may,henkel issued individual purchase orders to gage using the prices henkel had accessed from chrysler computer system.
henkel sent its first purchase order to gage on may.this purchase order,as well as all subsequent orders,stated at the top 
confirm receipt of po by fax,verifying price and advising firm ship date.henkel will only pay charges listed on this po.
upon receipt,yelena paykina,who processed gage orders,spoke with vicki erdem at henkel,who confirmed that the parties did not have a signed blanket purchase order contract.when paykina stated that gage could not ship any products to henkel without a contract,erdem said that gage ca do that and that gage needed to continue shipping until the issue was settled to avoid shutting down the plant.daniel logan,gage director of north american automotive operations,was concerned about keeping the plant running and maintaining gage cash flow.logan also was under the impression that chrysler soon would approve gage requested price increases and that henkel would honor those increases.he therefore instructed paykina to put in the old pricing in order to get cash coming in,with the understanding that henkel had told gage that when gage received the increases,henkel would honor them.
between may and june,gage shipped products to henkel in response to henkel purchase orders and invoiced henkel approximately times according to gage pricing with chrysler.on occasions,henkel issued purchase orders to gage listing prices for various products that were not,in fact,gage current chrysler prices some prices on henkel purchase orders were too high,and some were too low.on each of those occasions,gage acknowledged henkel purchase order by faxing a copy of the original purchase order back to henkel with the correct chrysler pricing handwritten on the purchase order.upon receipt of the price acknowledgments from gage,henkel sent gage a cancellation of the original purchase order,followed by a new purchase order confirming the correct price.gage then shipped the products to the plant and issued invoices to henkel that referenced the correct current price.gage did not alter those henkel purchase orders that listed the correct current prices.
in the meantime,on may,henkel again sought a price quote from gage on its products.on the same day,gage representatives,including logan and jeffrey patsy,met with henkel representatives,including schilling and farren,to discuss the pricing issue.gage insisted on its pricing schedule submitted in march.schilling,and possibly farren as well,responded that henkel wanted to pay gage its current prices but that henkel would honor the higher prices upon chrysler approval.
on june,logan wrote a letter to schilling attaching a price quote for gage products and stating,per your request the prices are lower than what was previously quoted to you on march.these prices reflect our price adjustments submitted to chrysler on november,effective november.
on june,thomas randazzo,gage vice president and general counsel,wrote a letter to john sloan,henkel purchasing agent,stating that the unit prices listed on all of henkel purchase orders since may,were incorrect and that gage expected to be paid for all products shipped at the unit prices gage had quoted to henkel on march.randazzo advised that gage would be issuing new invoices to henkel to reflect the unit prices for all products shipped between may,and the date of his letter and would be issuing all future invoices for products shipped at the march,unit price.gage followed through and,beginning on june,issued invoices for newly delivered products at the higher prices and issued revised invoices for previously shipped products,demanding payment for the difference between what henkel already had paid and the higher prices.
on june,sloan responded to randazzo,stating 
the prices listed on each purchase order represent the most current price daimlerchrysler was paying prior to henkel chemical management being awarded the chemical management contract.these prices shall not be adjusted without approval.
sloan further advised that henkel rejects any price for any product or material that is inconsistent with daimlerchrysler acquisition price prior to the implementation of the chemical management program.henkel has never agreed to any other price sloan noted that gage insistence on the pricing set forth in its march,letter was curious considering that gage products has been invoicing henkel at different the pricing that was in effect prior to henkel assuming chemical management responsibilities.gage appropriately interpreted henkel letter as a rejection of gage march,pricing,but gage nevertheless decided to continue shipping products in response to henkel purchase orders.
on august and,chrysler approved gage price increase retroactively to april,prior to the launch of the tcm program.gage then expected henkel to pay the invoices according to the prices submitted to chrysler in november.henkel refused nevertheless,on january,schilling of henkel purportedly met with three chrysler representatives and stated the following w e understand you gave gage a price increase and we like to discuss with you receiving a price increase and what we will do is we will pass all that money straight through to gage for the increase.schilling testified that chrysler refused to give henkel a price increase supposedly because the dispute between henkel and gage had nothing to do with jefferson north assembly plan t and the total chemical management program and henkel.
procedural history 
on march,gage sued henkel in the oakland county circuit court,which henkel timely removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan based on diversity of citizenship.gage complaint alleged five claims breach of contract account stated promissory estoppel unjust enrichment and quantum meruit and fraud,misrepresentation,and fraud in the inducement.gage did not request a trial by jury,meaning that the court would be the factfinder.after the close of discovery,henkel moved for summary judgment.at oral argument on may,gage consented to the dismissal of counts two,three,and four of the complaint.
on september,the district court granted henkel summary judgment on gage remaining claims for breach of contract and for misrepresentation,fraud,and fraud in the inducement.the court dismissed gage breach of contract claim on the ground that henkel purchase orders indicating gage current prices were offers that gage accepted for transactions prior to june,by issuing invoices incorporating those prices and for transactions after june,by shipping the products in response to henkel purchase orders.the district court dismissed gage claim for misrepresentation,fraud,and fraud in the inducement on the ground that gage could not prove that it had relied on henkel promise to honor chrysler consent to gage increasing its prices.the court cited the testimony of gage sales director who purportedly testified that gage still would have supplied the plant with chemical supplies even if henkel had not promised to honor the anticipated price increases.the court dismissed the fraud claim on the alternative ground that a promise to do something in the future can not give rise to a fraud claim.although noting the existence of a bad faith exception to this general rule where a promise is made without the intention to perform,gage allegedly failed to cite evidence showing that henkel never intended to fulfill its promise to pay gage its higher prices once approved by chrysler.
gage filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied on september.gage timely appealed the order granting henkel motion for summary judgment and the order denying gage motion for reconsideration.

breach of contract claim 
in its breach of contract claim,gage alleges that,on may,henkel agreed to pay prices for gage products equal to the higher prices gage had quoted to chrysler on november,if chrysler subsequently approved those prices.gage further alleges that henkel sent gage purchase orders for chemical products on or after may,but at no time did henkel advise gage that it would not honor gage higher prices once approved by chrysler.gage argues that henkel purchase orders from june,onward constituted henkel acceptance of gage june,offer via the letter from logan to schilling to sell the chemical products at the higher prices that chrysler subsequently approved.according to gage,henkel purchase orders manifested a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance of gage june,price quote containing different prices pursuant to michigan version of uniform commercial code.comp.laws.see id.a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon,unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
the district court disagreed.relying on herm hughes sons quintek,utah,the district court held that did not deem henkel purchase orders to be acceptances of the prices that gage proposed on june,but instead deemed the orders to be that gage accepted when it shipped its products to henkel and sent henkel invoices at prices that matched the prices in henkel purchase orders.we agree.
in herm hughes,a contractor,hughes,solicited bids from a subcontractor,quintek,to provide roof trusses on a building project.id.at.quintek submitted a written bid that specified that the offer had to be accepted within ten days,but hughes did not respond in a timely manner.id.thereafter,quintek solicited hughes for a contract,and hughes delivered a supplier agreement.id.quintek refused to sign hughes agreement because of material changes in the payment terms compared to quintek original bid proposal.id.hughes argued that,under,a contract was formed when it delivered its supplier agreement to quintek,despite its additional terms.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that did not apply without the existence of an underlying agreement pursuant to herm hughes,at.the court then found that hughes delivery of the supplier agreement did not constitute a valid acceptance of quintek offer to provide roof trusses because the supplier agreement not only added additional terms,but directly contradicted quintek offer,specifically in its treatment of payment terms.id.at.given the materiality of the payment terms to this contract,quintek bid proposal and hughes supplier agreement fail to evidence a meeting of the minds sufficient to establish a contract.id.
so too in this case,the direct contradiction between the prices set forth in gage june,letter and henkel subsequent purchase orders demonstrated that the parties did not have a meeting of the minds sufficient to form a blanket contract covering all the transactions at issue.the price was the single factor preventing the parties from entering into a blanket purchase order agreement.accordingly,we agree with the district court conclusion that the parties did not have a contract by virtue of henkel purported acceptance of gage june,price list.
even though the parties initial writings did not establish a contract,the facts might support a finding that the parties thereafter formed a contract or a series of contracts.to address this issue,we,like the district court below,have broken the parties transactions into two time periods orders and shipments that june,and orders and shipments on or after june.
on march,gage offered to sell its chemical products to henkel for prices that were higher than it was charging chrysler at the time.over the next two months,henkel insisted that gage offer henkel its current chrysler pricing,but gage refused to budge from its higher prices.by the time the tcm program launched on may,gage and henkel still had not come to an agreement on price.on that date,henkel effectively forced the issue by sending gage a purchase order reflecting it thought was gage chrysler pricing.the purchase order prominently stated,henkel will only pay charges listed on this po.upon receipt,gage initially balked and told henkel that it could not ship any products because it had not agreed as to price by signing a blanket purchase order contract.however,to avoid a plant shutdown,maintain cash flow,and preserve good relations with chrysler,gage opted to sell the goods to henkel anyway.henkel subsequently sent gage numerous purchase orders at what it believed to be gage chrysler pricing.gage received those purchase orders and,where applicable,corrected the prices to conform with its current chrysler prices some of those changes involved price reductions.upon return of their corrected purchase orders,henkel canceled them out and issued new purchase orders reflecting the corrected pricing provided by gage.as before,the purchase orders prominently stated,henkel will only pay charges listed on this po.upon receipt of the new purchase orders,gage shipped the products to henkel,followed by invoices mirroring the prices in the revised purchase orders.
based on these facts,it is undisputed that henkel expressly conditioned gage acceptance of its purchase orders on gage agreement to charge the prices listed in those orders.it also is undisputed that the parties writings agreed on price prior to june.although there is evidence that henkel promised on various dates between may and may,to pay gage the higher prices if and when chrysler so agreed,there is no evidence that henkel agreed to pay those prices before chrysler provided its approval which did not occur until the following august that henkel would honor those new prices retroactively upon chrysler approval.rather,the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that gage made a business decision to relinquish its right to enforce henkel promise to pay the higher prices when it affirmatively assented,in writing and without qualification,to henkel purchase orders at the lower prices.at no time prior to june,while it processed approximately orders from henkel,did gage communicate the fact that it hoped or expected to be paid the prices subsequently approved by chrysler instead,it enclosed invoices confirming the prices set forth in henkel purchase orders.mantaline ppg,wl,at cir.june,holding that,because the seller shipped the goods without any contemporaneous disclaimer in response to buyer purchase order,the purchase order ripened into a contract when the seller accepted it by the prompt shipment of conforming goods packers,shoney,cir holding that purchaser could not manifest acceptance to seller new offer,thus inducing performance,and then revoke acceptance and demand compliance with terms of prior,withdrawn offer shoney secretly harbored intent to later deduct the difference between the old and new price could not bind.therefore,we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether henkel breached its contract or contracts with gage prior to june.
the decision in quaker state mushroom dominick finer foods,which gage cites,does not imply a contrary result.quaker state involved a buyer four separate orders for mushrooms from the seller.the buyer placed two of the orders before november,the date when the seller notified the buyer of a price increase however,all of the orders were shipped after november,and contained invoices at the higher prices.id.at.the court found that the seller shipment of the mushrooms did not necessarily amount to an acceptance of the buyer purchase orders at the lower price because the seller november notice clearly rejected the lower price listed in the buyer purchase orders.id 
assuming,as gage argues,that gage march and june,letters to henkel were offers to sell products to henkel at a particular price,it is clear that henkel,like the buyer in quaker state,placed orders at a fundamentally different price.in other words,henkel rejected gage offers by making repeated at a lower price.moreover,quaker state suggests that gage accepted henkel on each of the approximately fifty transactions prior to june.in quaker state,the seller clearly rejected the lower price set forth in the purchase orders by sending the buyer a new price list and then shipping the products with invoices reflecting these prices.by contrast,until june,gage had sent no such notice to henkel and shipped the products to henkel with prices that matched the prices in henkel purchase orders.these circumstances show that gage accepted the price set forth in henkel,purchase orders.id.at observing that the seller shipment in response to the buyer purchase order did not constitute acceptance of the buyer price because the seller had notified the buyer that it was rejecting the buyer price before shipping.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to henkel with regard to the parties,transactions.
conduct on or after june,
on june,gage informed henkel that gage expected to be paid for all products shipped at the unit prices that gage had quoted to henkel on march,which were based on the price increases gage had proposed to chrysler on november,but which chrysler had not yet authorized.beginning on june,gage issued invoices for newly delivered products at the higher prices.on june,henkel wrote back stating that it would pay only gage current chrysler pricing and that t hese prices shall not be adjusted without approval.thereafter,gage continued to ship products in response to henkel purchase orders,which,consistent with henkel past purchase orders,stated,henkel will only pay charges listed on this po.gage nevertheless followed up its shipments with invoices at the higher prices that chrysler would not approve until august and.
gage argues that its course of dealing with henkel,with the conflicting purchase orders and invoices,involved a classic battle of the forms,which.comp.laws,governs.according to gage,the parties conflicting price terms were to be disregarded under in favor of a reasonable price per providing that the parties can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled and specifies how a reasonable price is to be set.the district court held,however,that did not apply to the,transactions on the following grounds comment to indicates that the purpose of the section is directed to the situation where the essential terms of the contract have already been agreed upon,but the letter expressed and intended as the acceptance or the closing of an agreement adds further minor suggestions or proposals and henkel expressly made its purchase orders conditional on gage old prices.emphasis added by district court quoting.comp.laws cmt.we disagree.
first,the district court erred in relying on comment to to hold that the battle of the forms provisions do not come into play on the ground that a price change is not a minor suggestion or proposal.comment addresses only the situation of proposed additions to a contract that are contained in a responsive form,but says nothing about proposed different terms.see.comp.laws cmt.noting that one situation with which the section is intended to deal is offer and acceptance,in which a wire or letter expressed and intended as an acceptance or the closing of an agreement adds further minor suggestions or proposals such as ship by tuesday,rush,ship draft against bill of lading inspection allowed,or the like emphasis added.comment is more relevant to the facts in this case because it indicates that w hether or not additional or different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the provisions of.comp.laws cmt.emphasis added.comment further explains that i f the different terms are such as materially to alter the original bargain,they will not be included unless expressly agreed to by the other party.see also id.b providing that additional terms do not become part of the contract if they materially alter it.although gage materially different price terms could not have become part of the parties purported contract s,instructs that the terms of those contracts consist ed of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree d,together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of the ucc.id.
second,the fact that henkel made its purchase orders conditional on gage acceptance of its current prices also did not render inapplicable.instructs that,as with a proposed term that materially alters the contract under b,an offeree refusal to accept a conditional offer under does not preclude contract formation where the parties conduct otherwise evidences an agreement.comp.laws conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.see also id.a contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement,including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.
here,henkel submitted numerous purchase orders to gage,gage shipped products in response to those orders,and henkel received and paid gage for those shipped products albeit not at the prices that gage expected.this pattern of conduct creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties had one or more contracts for shipments on or after june.see id.cmt.in many cases,as where goods are shipped,accepted and paid for before any dispute arises,there is no question whether a contract has been made the only question is what terms are included in the contract,and subsection of furnishes the governing rule.mcjunkin mechanicals,cir holding that the parties course of conduct established a contract where seller sent numerous shipments after receiving purchase orders from buyer and buyer paid for shipments quaker state mushroom.at it is clear that the parties intended to have a contract,acted as if they had a contract,but had not agreed upon a price for the goods sellers usually do not ship and buyers to not receive goods unless they think they have struck a deal.benedict aeroquip,wl,at.july,unpublished holding that the parties behavior substantiates the existence of a contract because plaintiff manufactured the parts and supplied them to defendant on demand at a negotiated price when it received the purchase orders and releases southeastern adhesives funder,holding,pursuant to,that parties had contracted for the shipment and delivery of urea resins each time the defendant would place a telephonic order and the plaintiff would ship the resin audio visual,sharp,cir holding that no contract was formed pursuant to or the complaint does not allege that sharp performed pursuant to the purchase did not ship the goods to audio audio visual alleges no other conduct by either party to evidence a contract.
the district court held,as a matter of law,that the parties had contracts for shipments after june,but further held that gage mere shipment of goods in response to henkel purchase orders constituted an acceptance of the price terms in henkel offers.although b provides that an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods,that provision does not apply where the language or circumstances unambiguously indicate otherwise.comp.laws.gage made it clear via its letter of june,and with each subsequent invoice that it would not consent to the price terms in henkel purchase orders.thus,contrary to the district court,we hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether gage shipment of goods after june,manifested its assent to a contract containing the prices from henkel purchase orders.
an alternative view of the same facts suggests that the parties did not have a contract or a series of contracts after june.arguably,gage invoices,which contained materially different price terms from henkel purchase orders,did not manifest definite and seasonable expression s of acceptance to those orders,pursuant to.id.under this view of the evidence,gage decision to ship products after june,followed by invoices reflecting different price terms,indicated an unambiguous rejection of the conditional offers in henkel purchase orders,thereby precluding contract formation.see,united foods,wl,at.may,unpublished finding no seasonable expression of acceptance where buyer sent numerous purchase orders for cotton and seller shipped cotton with a higher invoice price,because no contract is formed when the acceptance diverges significantly as to a material term quoting howard constr.quarries,mantaline,wl,at holding that seller shipment of goods without any contemporaneous disclaimer in response to buyer purchase order caused purchase order to ripen into a contract.
buttresses the view that the parties never formed a contract on the ground that they never intended to be bound without an agreement on price.see.comp.la
