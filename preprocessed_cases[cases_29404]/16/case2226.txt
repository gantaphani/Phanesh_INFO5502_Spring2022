international union,united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america,uaw local union,filed grievances against karl schmidt unisia,company,on its own behalf and on behalf of sam jenkins and john tony smith.after initially participating in the grievance process,the company reversed course and filed suit against the union,smith,and jenkins in federal district court,seeking a declaratory judgment that the union grievances are not arbitrable.the union filed a counterclaim to compel arbitration and subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court found the grievances arbitrable under the terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement cba,and it therefore granted the union motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
background 
in,the parties negotiated the cba that was in place at all relevant times of this dispute.section of the cba includes a thirty and out provision,which provides eligibility for supplemental retirement benefits to an employee once he has reached the age and seniority requirements in the provision.section also provides that the pension plan,which sets forth other features of the company retirement policy,shall continue in effect for the term of the cba.after the cba had gone into effect,the company unilaterally added language to of the pension plan.based on this amendment to,to be eligible to receive the supplemental retirement benefit,an employee must have reached the age and seniority requirements of the thirty and out provision as of his date of termination of employment.section of the cba provides the rules for loss of employee seniority.section of the cba outlines a procedure for grievances the fourth step is arbitration.
in april,the company notified the union of impending layoffs at its fort wayne facility.earlier in,the union had learned the company planned to deny supplemental retirement benefits to employees who were on layoff when they met the requirements of.fearing the company would deny the benefits of the thirty and out provision to otherwise eligible employees,the union initiated the grievance procedure provided by the cba.after completing the first three steps,and with the dispute still unresolved,the union appealed the grievance to arbitration.at this stage,the union also filed grievances on behalf of smith and jenkins,who had reached the age and seniority requirements of,but to whom the company was denying the thirty and out benefit.pursuant to the process outlined in the cba,the company and union each rejected one panel of arbitrators.
when the third panel was appointed,the company refused to arbitrate.instead,it filed suit in federal district court against the union,jenkins,and smith,seeking a judgment declaring the parties dispute not arbitrable.the company asserted that the issue was governed by the terms of the pension plan and not by the terms of the cba.the union filed a counterclaim seeking an order to compel arbitration of the grievances and then moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the union motion for summary judgment and ordered arbitration.the company now appeals.
ii.analysis 
when a district court has ordered arbitration,we review that decision de novo.united steel workers int l union trimas corp,cir.the court can not compel a party to arbitrate a dispute unless that party has contractually agreed to do so.at t,commc ns workers of.we keep in mind,however,the federal policy favoring arbitrability.see united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav,explaining that a broad arbitration clause promotes industrial stability,because the clause represents the union consideration for its agreement not to strike while the cba is in effect.if the parties contract includes a broad arbitration clause,there is a presumption in favor of arbitrability.trimas,at.finally,we must take care not to address the merits of the underlying claim.at t,at.
the language of the cba arbitration clause forms the basis of our analysis.trimas,at.section a of the cba provides,in relevant part,the union may grieve any violation of this agreement each grievance arising under this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the procedure described in this article of the agreement.the procedure shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy for any grievance.a grievance,as defined in of the cba,is a claim by the union,an employee,or group of employees that the company has violated an express provision of this agreement by some conduct,act or omission occurring during the term of the agreement.the union claims the company violated the thirty and out provision of.on its face,this claim is a grievance under the cba.
because the cba contains a generally applicable arbitration clause,the union claim is presumed arbitrable.see at t,at.to overcome the presumption of arbitrability,a party must show either an express provision excluding the grievance from arbitration or the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration.warrior gulf,at.
express exclusion from arbitration 
the company argues the cba arbitration clause and the cba definition of grievance expressly exclude the union claim from arbitration.we disagree.according to the company,because the cba does not specifically address whether an employee may be laid off when he reaches the requirements,the union has not alleged that the company violated an express provision of the cba.and because a grievance must claim a violation of an express term of the cba,the union claim is not a grievance.the arbitration clause applies to grievances,the argument goes,so we should apply the interpretive rule of inclusio unius est exclusio alterious the inclusion of one is the exclusion of another to show the arbitration clause expressly excludes the union claim.
but to articulate this argument is to recognize its absurdity mere failure to address a type of dispute is not necessarily an express exclusion of that type.a rule of construction that implies exclusion is irrelevant to the question of express exclusion.moreover,if we were to accept this argument,the arbiter interpretive domain would be a null to disputes for which a plain reading of the cba clearly determines the outcome.finally,to accept this argument would be to conclude that and of the cba do not require the company to provide the supplemental thirty and out benefit to employees who are laid off when they meet the relevant age and seniority requirements.this conclusion would be a ruling on the merits of the union claim,and we have no business making such a ruling.at t,at.
the company express exclusion argument also fails for a more fundamental reason the argument distorts the union claims.the union alleges the company violated express terms of the cba,namely thirty and out and seniority,by denying the thirty and out benefit to employees who had met the requirements while on layoff and who had not lost seniority under the company tries to characterize the grievance as a dispute about the meaning of termination in the pension plan.it claims there is no dispute about any express term in the cba because the company agrees with the union that employees satisfy all conditions of thirty and out provision and retain seniority under.but the union does not claim that the company has misinterpreted the cba rather,it claims that the company has violated the terms of the cba and that the cba provides for arbitration of precisely such claims.
most forceful evidence of parties intent not to arbitrate 
the company presents several arguments purporting to show most forceful evidence that the parties intended to exclude the union grievance from arbitration.none of these arguments,either alone or in combination,rebuts the presumption of arbitrability.
issues underlying the dispute 
the company argues that the best determinant of whether the parties intended to arbitrate the dispute is whether the answer to the underlying issue resides within the terms of the cba or some other document.the company claims the underlying issue here is the meaning of termination as used in of the pension plan,so the parties did not intend to arbitrate this dispute.
we need not decide whether the
