appellants lynne and james mackenzie mackenzies filed an amended complaint alleging eleven counts of state law violations related to the decisions of flagstar bank,fsb flagstar to deny them a loan modification under the home affordable modification program hamp and to foreclose on their home the district court dismissed the complaint.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
the mackenzies own property located at williams street in north dighton,massachusetts property.on may,they gave a promissory note note in the amount of at the interest rate of to bankstreet mortgage,llc bankstreet secured by a mortgage on the property mortgage.the mackenzies executed the mortgage with mortgage electronic registration systems,mers as the nominee for the lender.the mortgage granted the right of assignment and allowed for the severability of the mortgage and the note.
bankstreet assigned the note to flagstar.flagstar signed a servicer participation agreement spa with fannie mae acting as the agent of the united states department of treasury,agreeing to participate in hamp.spas require loan servicers to offer loan modifications and foreclosure prevention services pursuant to hamp guidelines.
on july,the mackenzies and flagstar executed a loan modification agreement agreement reducing the interest rate to,extending the maturity date,and capitalizing unpaid interest to arrive at a principal balance of.the agreement identifies the mortgage as the contract that it amends and supplements.on october,the mackenzies submitted an application to flagstar for a new modification.flagstar denied that application on april.on april,the mackenzies filed another application with flagstar,this time for a loan modification pursuant to hamp.
on may,mers assigned to flagstar the mortgage as modified by the agreement.the mackenzies allege on the basis of a loan investigation that the mortgage had been securitized into a lehman brothers trust prior to the assignment.on may,harmon filed a notice with the commonwealth of massachusetts land court on behalf of flagstar claiming authority to foreclose on the property.
thereafter,flagstar inexplicably began pursuing two contradictory courses of action.despite the may notice,on august,flagstar evaluated the mackenzies for a loan modification under the hamp guidelines and determined that they were eligible.nevertheless,harmon sent the mackenzies a notice of foreclosure sale on october,stating that flagstar would conduct the sale on or after november.on october,the mackenzies filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court seeking injunctive relief to prevent the foreclosure.on november,flagstar sent the mackenzies a hamp modification offer,but still scheduled a foreclosure sale for november.on november,flagstar closed the hamp modification offer it then removed the pending state court case to federal court on november,on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.to date,as far as the record before us shows,a foreclosure sale has not taken place.
on february,the mackenzies served flagstar with a notice to rescind the agreement.flagstar did not accept the notice as a valid recission.the mackenzies filed an amended complaint on february,raising eleven state law claims.flagstar filed a motion to dismiss and a request for declaratory judgment,and the mackenzies filed a motion for partial summary judgment.the district court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the request for declaratory judgment and the motion for partial summary judgment.the mackenzies appeal the dismissal.
ii.analysis 
the mackenzies state on appeal that they do not press counts i,ii,iii,vi,viii,and xi.the remaining counts are breach of contract,based on violations of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing count iv violation of the massachusetts consumer credit cost disclosure act mcccda.laws ch,count v rescission count vii negligence count ix and promissory estoppel count x.
implied covenant of good faith count iv 
in count iv,the mackenzies allege that flagstar breached the implied obligation of good faith under the agreements,and breached the implied covenant that neither party shall do anything which will destroy or injure the other party right to receive the fruits of the contract.it is not clear on the face of the complaint whether the mackenzies intended to raise these allegations pursuant to their mortgage with flagstar or as beneficiaries of the spa between flagstar and the federal government.the mackenzies do not entirely clarify their position on appeal.on one hand,they state that they were beneficiaries of the spa agreement between the government and the servicer,flagstar.they rely almost exclusively on in re cruz,however,in which the court denied injunctive relief as to a beneficiary claim but granted it with respect to a claim for breach of good faith,on the basis of the duty mortgagees owe to mortgagors.
the district court rejected both possibilities.it held that the mackenzies are not beneficiaries of the agreements between flagstar and the government.with respect to the mortgage,it found that plaintiffs fail to allege any specific duty or right that was violated by flagstar in the agreement between the mackenzies and flagstar.it observed further that under massachusetts case law,absent an explicit provision in the mortgage contract,there is no duty to negotiate for loan modification once a mortgagor defaults internal quotation marks omitted.instead,a mortgagee duty of good faith when acting under a power of sale generally only extends to reasonable efforts to sell the property for the highest value possible internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,it concluded that the mackenzies had not stated a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
third party beneficiary claim 
the district court was correct in deciding that the mackenzies are not beneficiaries of the spa between flagstar and the government.it is a principle that g overnment contracts often benefit the public,but individual members of the public are treated as incidental beneficiaries who may not enforce a contract unless a different intention is manifested.restatement second of contracts cmt.a see also interface kanner,llc jpmorgan chase bank,cir klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir parties that benefit from a government contract are generally assumed to be incidental beneficiaries,and may not enforce the contract absent a clear intent to the contrary.price pierce,cir.
district courts in this circuit,relying on klamath,have applied this general principle in the specific context of disputes over hamp modifications and have concluded that borrowers are not beneficiaries of agreements between mortgage lenders and the government.see dill am.home mortg.servicing,d,teixeira fed.mortg.ass n,cv,wl,at.july,although hamp was generally designed to benefit homeowners,it does not follow necessarily that homeowners like the plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of the contracts between servicers and the government.markle hsbc mortg.usa,d,blackwood wells fargo bank,cv,wl,at,massachusetts courts have consistently rejected the argument that there is a private right of action under hamp by intended third party beneficiaries.speleos bac home loans servicing,d.
the reasoning of these district courts is persuasive.in teixeira,the court observed that the spa in that case does not give any indication that the parties to it intended to grant qualified borrowers the right to enforce the contract.wl,at.instead,the spa appears to limit who can enforce the contract terms the agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties to the agreement and their permitted.id.the spa in this case contains identical language.while it is true that intended beneficiaries need not be specifically named in the contract,they must fall within a class clearly intended by the parties to benefit from the contract.markle,d at internal quotation marks omitted.the decision of the contracting parties here specifically to identify themselves and their successors as the contract beneficiaries evinces their intention to exclude beneficiaries.moreover,as the court in markle noted 
if plaintiffs were beneficiaries,every in the united states who has defaulted on mortgage payments or is at risk of default could become a potential plaintiff.finding such a broad and indefinite class of beneficiaries would be inconsistent with the clear intent standard for government contracts set by the restatement.
id.at.thus,the broadly accepted principle set forth in the restatement,from which we see no reason to deviate,applies squarely to the circumstances of this case and forecloses the mackenzies argument that they are beneficiaries of the spa 
flagstar duty of good faith as mortgagee 
despite their explicit claim to be beneficiaries of the spa,the mackenzies rely almost entirely on cruz,in which the court found that borrowers are not beneficiaries of spas,but nevertheless found a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff would prevail on his claim for breach of good faith.at.oddly,the court in that case relied on speleos,which rejected the good faith claim but allowed a negligence claim to proceed.d at.the court in cruz held that the plaintiff allegation that wells fargo breached its duty of good faith and reasonable diligence is comparable to the negligence claim in speleos.at.the court did not explain,however,how the two claims were comparable.
a more clearly reasoned case that reaches the same conclusion as cruz is blackwood.wl,at.in that case,the court pointed out that i t is familiar law that a mortgagee in exercising a power of sale in a mortgage must act in good faith and must use reasonable diligence to protect the interests of the mortgagor.id.quoting roxbury.bank bowser,internal quotation marks omitted.it decided not to dismiss the breach of good faith claim,because if the defendants foreclosed when they lacked the legal authority to do so,they acted in violation of their obligation to protect the mortgagor.id.
the problem with the decision in blackwood is that t he concept of good faith is shaped by the nature of the contractual relationship from which the implied covenant derives,and the scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract that governs the particular relationship.young wells fargo bank,cir quoting ayash dana farber cancer.here,the mortgage as modified by the agreement is the only contract between the mackenzies and flagstar.and as the district court correctly pointed out,nothing in the mortgage imposes a duty on flagstar to consider a loan modification prior to foreclosure in the event of a default.see peterson gmac,llc,cv,wl,at,under massachusetts case law,absent an explicit provision in the mortgage contract,there is no duty to negotiate for loan modification once a mortgagor defaults.citing carney shawmut bank,p,wl,at.
it is true that mortgagees have an independent duty at common law to protect the interests of the mortgagor in exercising a power of sale in a mortgage.teixeira,wl,at.typically,this entails mak ing reasonable efforts to sell the property for the highest value possible.armand homecomings fin.network,cv,wl,at.june,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.thus,in the event of a foreclosure,the existence of a duty of good faith is tied directly to the mortgagee contractual right to exercise a power of sale.but the implied covenant of good faith can not create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship.young,at quoting ayash,at.it would therefore be an error to extend the implied covenant to encompass a duty to modify or consider modifying the loan prior to foreclosure,where no such obligation exists in the mortgage 
because the mackenzies are not beneficiaries of the spa,and because flagstar had no duty to modify the mackenzies loan prior to foreclosure,the district court correctly dismissed count iv.
mcccda count v and rescission count vii 
the mcccda provides borrowers in certain consumer credit transactions,including the refinancing of a mortgage,with a right of rescission and requires lenders to make certain mandatory disclosures related to the terms of the loan.laws ch.section f of the statute extends the borrower right of rescission to a period of four years in the event that the lender fails to make the required disclosures.id.the mackenzies allege that the agreement is a refinancing subject to the terms of the mcccda and that flagstar failed to make the required disclosures.accordingly,they seek to exercise their right of rescission within the period under section f.
the district court held that the a greement does not fall within the provisions of the mcccda.it pointed to section of title of the code of massachusetts regulations,which provides that 
a refinancing occurs when an existing obligation that was subject to cmr is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same consumer.a refinancing is a new transaction requiring new disclosures to the consumer.the new finance charge shall include any unearned portion of the old finance charge that is not credited to the existing obligation.the following shall not be treated as a refinancing 
b a reduction in the annual percentage rate with a corresponding change in the payment schedule.
d a change in the payment schedule or a change in collateral requirements as a result of the consumer default or delinquency 
regs.see also in re washington,applying this section of the regulations to the mcccda.the district court found that the agreement was not a refinancing because it did no more than lower the interest rate and change the payment schedule.
in their initial brief,the mackenzies sidestep section.they argue instead that the agreement is not exempt from disclosure requirements under section e b of chapter of the massachusetts general laws,which excludes refinancings from the purview of the mcccda under certain circumstances.that argument is beside the point.as the district court held,the modification was not a refinancing and,thus,section e b does not apply.in their reply brief,however,the mackenzies contend that the agreement was a refinancing because in addition to lowering the interest rate and extending the payment schedule,it involved a new lender and a new amount of principal.but these points do not undermine the district court decision.
first,flagstar is not a new lender it is the assignee of bankstreet,the original lender.it is axiomatic that an assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor.hosp.trust bank ohio cas.ins,cir quoting jaeger,williston on contracts,at ed.through the assignment,flagstar obtained bankstreet rights and obligations under the existing mortgage,including the right to reach an agreement with the mackenzies to modify the terms of the loan.see bank of,wrt realty,d,holding that the assignee of a note and mortgage enjoys all rights the assignor possessed.the fact that flagstar exercised that right does not mean that the existing obligation was satisfied and replaced by a new obligation.regs.
second,the change in the amount of principal was the result of the capitalization of unpaid interest.in other words,the entire principal balance under the agreement was debt owed under the original mortgage it was not a new obligation replacing the original obligation.see sheppard gmac mortg,holding that the capitalization of unpaid debt does not constitute a refinancing under the truth in lending act,on which the mcccda is modeled,because the new obligation did not completely replace the old one.
thus,under the terms of section,the agreement is not a refinancing.it is not subject to the disclosure requirements of the mcccda,and the mackenzies have no right to rescind it under the statute.therefore the district court properly dismissed counts v and vii.
negligence count ix 
in count ix,the mackenzies claim that flagstar owed them a duty as beneficiaries of the spa between a loan servicer and the federal government,and that flagstar breached their obligations under the hamp and other related government programs which the spa incorporates.to state a claim for negligence under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must allege a legal duty owed by defendant to plaintiff a breach of that duty proximate or legal cause and actual damage or injury.p
