background 
walker initiated this suit in may.jurisdiction is based on diversity and the claims are brought under massachusetts law.four counts were pending when defendants filed their motion for summary judgment count i breach of contract against harvard based on the board finding that walker had sufficiently submitted the note for it to be covered by the handbook count ii breach of contract against harvard based on alleged failures of the board to comply with provisions in the handbook count iv defamation based on the inclusion of the plagiarism findings in walker hls transcript and count vi asserting an entitlement to injunctive relief walker has appealed only the district court grant of summary judgment as to counts i and iv.we,therefore,set out the facts we deem relevant to those counts in the light most favorable to her and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.see martinez petrenko,cir.
preparation of the note 
as a first year student at hls,walker joined the staff of jolt.walker first worked as a,checking citations against their original source material.during her last year of law school,walker applied to write a comment for jolt on a recently decided patent case.her application was accepted and she commenced work on the comment,which was to be published in the spring of her third year.
upon acceptance of her application,jolt informed walker that an initial complete draft of the note would be due on february.the deadline for the final draft of the note was february.walker understood that the piece she turned in on or after the february,deadline would be subjected to the rigorous editing and process she had helped with as a.as that process normally unfolded,an author was not permitted to make changes to an article during the editing and process.at the conclusion of that process,authors were permitted to make limited changes prior to publication.
walker delivered a first draft of the note to jolt on february.she turned in a second draft on february,and a third draft on february.around the time the third draft was due,walker began experiencing problems with her laptop.on the day she sent the third draft to jolt,her laptop was infected with a computer virus.while working on her computer with it support,walker saw anna volfstun volfstun,jolt submissions editor.she told volfstun about the virus and explained that due to the virus,the note would require significant additional work to be made ready for publication.the next day,on february,walker attended a jolt student writing committee meeting where she discussed the virus causing her to lose data from her computer.
on february,doug kochelek kochelek,the jolt editor in charge of student articles,sent an email to remind walker and other students their final draft articles were due on february.kochelek said the articles would be subcited the following weekend before being returned after spring break for authors last round of review with opportunity for changes.walker responded,via email,on february,i doubt that i can send the note before tonight.footnotes and proofreading are taking all weekend.when kochelek asked walker when she would be sending the note,she replied it would be that night.she also wrote i over the length limit again and cutting more.
concerns regarding the note 
on february,two days after walker said she would send the note to jolt,she sent an email to kochelek and other jolt senior staff,which read here the latest draft of the piece.sorry about the delay.let me know if you have difficulty finding any sources.the piece was still over the word limit.walker subsequently met with andrew ungberg ungberg,the line editor responsible for part of the process.during that meeting walker gave ungberg two electronic files that contained versions of her sources obtained from westlaw.she told ungberg about the virus on her computer,indicating her draft had problems,including issues with citations and quotations,and she would need to go back to the sources and compare the arguments and quotations.walker also sent an email to jolt staff on february,stating that she continued to work on the note after having provided the final draft on february.
in early march,when jolt staff began editing the note,concerns arose that much of walker argument was derivative of the dissent in the case about which she was writing.the article editor for the note prepared a summary of the draft for comparison with other publications and ungberg compared the note with the dissent from the case.on march,volfstun,the jolt staffer who had spoken with walker at the it help area on february,sent an email offering to help walker fix issues with the note.around the same time,hamburger used google to run searches on full sentences from the note.he created an annotated version of the note showing which sentences were copied from other sources.he stopped after documenting instances.in,hamburger and kitzinger discussed their attribution concerns with walker and then with cosgrove,the dean of students.
hls review and disciplinary process 
cosgrove referred the note to the board,which reviewed the matter and considered whether to move forward with a charge of plagiarism.the plagiarism policy of hls reads in part as follows 
all work submitted by a student for any academic or nonacademic exercise is expected to be the student own work.in the preparation of their work,students should always take great care to distinguish their own ideas and knowledge from information derived from sources students who submit work that is not their own without clear attribution of all sources,even if inadvertently,will be subject to disciplinary action.
after the board voted to move forward with the plagiarism charge,walker was notified.the board consulted with walker attorneys and scheduled a hearing for may.although walker sought to resolve the situation without a hearing,she was told the plagiarism charge was too serious to be resolved informally.following the hearing,the board issued walker a formal reprimand which ultimately appeared on her transcript and caused the loss of an employment offer
