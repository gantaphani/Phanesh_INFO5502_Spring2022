this lawsuit concerns a dispute between a borrower along with its guarantor and a lender over various expenses associated with a foreclosure on a parcel of real estate following a loan default.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the lender.for the following reasons,we reverse in part.
facts background 
defendant cadlerocks centennial drive,llc cadlerocks is a massachusetts limited liability company whose single asset is a commercial and industrial property located at one centennial drive,peabody,massachusetts property.a warehouse located on the property,built in,was occupied during the time period relevant to this lawsuit by a daycare center and other tenants.defendant daniel cadle cadle is president of the cadle company,which is the sole manager of cadlerocks.
a.the original loan and cadlerocks default 
in december,cadlerocks entered into a loan with lender salomon brothers realty corporation original lender in the principal amount of loan.a promissory note note with an effective date of december,memorialized the loan.the note was secured by a mortgage,assignment of rents,and security agreement mortgage on the property,along with a separate assignment of leases and rents,exceptions to non recourse guaranty guaranty and an environmental indemnity agreement indemnity agreement or agreement.cadle executed the guaranty in his personal capacity,and both cadlerocks and cadle executed the indemnity agreement.
the original lender conducted a phase i environmental site assessment phase i prior to the closing of the loan,which revealed the possible presence of tetrachloroethylene,also known as perchloroethylene pce,on the property.pce is a known carcinogen that is listed as a hazardous substance in the massachusetts contingency plan,regs.the likely source was new england carbide,a tenant prior to cadle acquisition of the property,who used a degreasing agent containing pce.instead of following the phase i test with a more comprehensive phase ii test,cadlerocks decided to obtain an environmental insurance policy naming the original lender as the insured.at trial,cadle was unable to produce an executed,authenticated copy of that policy.
on august,the original lender assigned the mortgage and all related loan documents and agreements to wells fargo bank as trustee for the registered holders trust.orix capital markets,llc orix was the special servicer of the trust and acted pursuant to a limited power of attorney orix began servicing the loan in december.
the balloon balance due on the note at its maturity date of january,was.cadlerocks failed to make that payment,defaulting on the note,although it continued making payments on the interest and principal until august.during that period,the parties discussed the possibility of a loan modification.after these discussions proved unsuccessful,the trust decided to commence foreclosure proceedings.
environmental testing on the property 
cadle offered a,meaning a transfer of title without recourse,in settlement of the trust claims prior to foreclosure.as part of orix routine due diligence during these negotiations,orix engaged ebi consulting ebi to conduct a new phase i test phase i,which,like the phase i,revealed the possible presence of pce on the property because of the results of the test,orix rejected the offer of the,postponed the foreclosure sale,and sought the appointment of a receiver.cadlerocks did not oppose the appointment motion,and on december,the district court appointed francis morrissey receiver to serve as receiver for the property.
meanwhile,orix ordered ebi to conduct a phase ii test of the property,consisting of an integrity test of an underground storage tank on the property and a soil vapor investigation of the exterior of the warehouse.the tank passed the integrity test,but the soil vapor investigation identified the presence of pce in the soil outside of the building.as a result,ebi recommended a test of the indoor air quality of the warehouse.
on march,mark germano,the licensed site professional lsp overseeing ebi testing,conducted a grab that detected pce in concentrations of micrograms per cubic meter μg m in the portion of the building occupied by the daycare center.on march,orix notified the receiver of these results.the receiver immediately authorized ebi to perform a second air quality test and retained its own independent environmental professionals,lsp james young and attorneys mcgregor associates.young advised the receiver that the result of the march grab test,even if accurate,did not represent an imminent health or safety risk.
thereafter,on march,ebi conducted a second air quality test,which revealed pce in concentrations of μg m.the following day,the receiver provided the daycare center with young assessment of these results,which explained that the concentration s measured are two to five orders of magnitude below available guidelines and do not represent an acute risk.to evaluate the risk of chronic risk,a more thorough investigation is required.
in april,young walked through the building in an effort to better assess the possible origin of the pce vapors.he also conducted air tests to determine whether the levels of pce were hazardous over an extended period of time.he collected samples on june,and samples on july,but none of the tests showed concentrations of pce at hazardous levels.
the receiver sought reimbursement from cadlerocks for the expenses he incurred related to the environmental tests.cadlerocks did not respond,and the receiver therefore requested payment from orix.orix agreed that the receiver could draw down on income and sales proceeds generated from the property that otherwise would have been applied to pay down cadlerocks debt.
there was no further testing until the fall of,when a prospective buyer insisted on more recent data than the previous test results provided.at the receiver request,orix paid ebi to conduct a new round of tests.these tests included groundwater testing,soil borings,and indoor air testing.no testimony indicates that these tests revealed a hazardous level of pce.
litigation 
on november,orix filed this lawsuit against cadlerocks and cadle,alleging breaches of the various agreements related to the loan.the district court partially granted orix motion for summary judgment on october,holding that cadle was personally liable for in misappropriated rent.the court held a bench trial on the remaining claims on december.at the conclusion of the trial,the court entered an order awarding orix in damages related to the condition of the property and for expenses related to the environmental testing on the property under the indemnity agreement.in a separate order,the court awarded orix in attorney fees and in costs.appellants appeal the award of expenses related to the environmental testing,and ask this court to remand the award of attorney fees and costs for reconsideration.
ii.analysis 
the indemnity agreement provides in relevant part that cadle and cadlerocks would indemnify the original lender and its assignees and successors indemnitees from and against all costs,demands,expenses and other liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever sought from or asserted against indemnitees in connection with,in whole or in part,directly or indirectly,the presence,suspected presence,release,suspected release,or threat of release of any hazardous material on or around the property it further specifies that s uch liabilities shall include seven particular categories of liability,only one of which is arguably applicable here the cost required to take necessary precautions to protect against the release of any hazardous materials in,on,or under the property,the air,any ground water,waterway or body of water,any public domain or any surrounding areas to the property.
the district court held that orix was entitled to recover the majority of the costs associated with the environmental testing under the indemnity agreement.orix capital,llc cadlerocks centennial drive,llc,d.the court did not award orix the costs of the phase i,which orix conducted as part of its routine due diligence.because orix would have conducted a phase i regardless of any previous knowledge of the presence of pce at the property,that testing was not conducted in response to suspected environmental hazards and thus is not covered by the indemnity agreement.id.but it held appellants liable for the remainder of the environmental testing because the testing conducted after the phase i was reasonable and necessary,particularly given the receiver need to ensure that conditions were safe for the occupants of the day care facility on the premises.id.
appellants argue that all of the costs for environmental testing fall outside of the scope of the plain terms of the indemnity agreement,while appellee urges this court to affirm the district court broad reading of the agreement.neither party argues that the agreement is ambiguous,or attempts to introduce extrinsic evidence regarding its interpretation.thus,the issue before us is whether the district court correctly determined the scope of the indemnity agreement.contract interpretation,when based on contractual language without resort to extrinsic evidence,is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.officemax,levesque,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under massachusetts law,we interpret contracts in a manner which will effectuate the intent of the parties.bukuras mueller,llc,cir quoting kingstown black cat cranberry.t he parties intent must be gathered from a fair construction of the contract as a whole and not by a special emphasis on any one part.id.internal quotation marks omitted.words that are plain and free from ambiguity must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense,and the agreement should be read in a reasonable and practical way,consistent with its language,background,and purpose.id.quoting cady marcella.
in its findings of fact,the district court held that cadlerocks agreed to indemnify the lender for all costs and damages related to any suspected or actual presence of hazardous materials at the property.orix.at.the court decision to deny orix relief for the phase i,but award it the costs for all subsequent testing,shows that the district court interpreted the indemnity agreement as covering all reasonable and necessary expenses conducted in response to suspected environmental hazards.id.at.we believe this interpretation of the agreement is too broad.
the district court interpretation of the indemnity agreement is erroneous in two respects.first,it overlooks the term of the agreement limiting coverage to those liabilities sought from or asserted against the indemnitees.second,it ignores the sentence that limits coverage to certain specified categories of liability.
coverage limited to claims by third parties 
by its plain terms,the agreement only covers liabilities sought from or asserted against the indemnitees.grammatically,this phrase requires the existence of a third party imposing some type of liability on the indemnitees orix can not seek costs from or assert claims against itself.therefore,any costs that orix incurred on its own behalf,for its own purposes,do not fall within the scope of the indemnity agreement.
orix argues that the receiver plainly made demand upon orix for all the costs and expenses related to the environmental testing.this statement is only partially true.the receiver did not begin to seek any costs from orix or incur his own expenses related to environmental testing until after he received the results of ebi tests on march.prior to that date,orix ordered the tests from ebi and paid for them itself.these were costs that orix incurred on its own there was no third party seeking or asserting any liabilities against it.thus,they do not fall within the scope of the indemnity agreement.the district court therefore erred in awarding orix the costs associated with the phase ii test and the subsequent grab test conducted by mark germano on march.
coverage limited to specified liabilities 
the next question is whether the second sentence of paragraph four beginning such liabilities shall include functions as a limitation on the much broader preceding sentence,or rather provides examples of certain types of liabilities covered.the district court approach to this question is unclear.on one hand,it specifically found that the receiver tests were reasonable and necessary.the first sentence of paragraph four does not require that the covered expenses be necessary or reasonable.the word necessary only appears in subclause iv of the second sentence,which extends coverage to the cost required to take necessary precautions to protect against the release of any hazardous materials in or around the property.thus,the district court appears to interpret the second sentence as limiting the first,at least to some extent.
but while the district court appears to have read the second sentence as requiring the tests to be necessary,it did not address whether the tests were necessary for the purpose specified in subclause iv as a precaution against the release of hazardous materials.on appeal,orix argues that the second sentence does not limit the scope of indemnification,but rather expands liability by defining certain specific instances wherein rights to indemnification attach.further,orix argues that even if the second sentence does apply as a limitation,the tests conducted in this case were necessary because of the undisputed presence of pce on the property.appellants argue that the tests were not necessary,because there was never a recognized immediate threat to public health at the property.they also ask us to define the word necessary as it is used in the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.
neither party arguments are persuasive.the parties contract makes no mention of cercla as the defining touchstone for the agreement,and nothing in the agreement provides that the testing must be in response to an immediate public threat.but the agreement is not as broad as orix attempts to define it.
we begin by holding that the second sentence limits the terms of the first.it is a principle that a subsequent specification impliedly limits the meaning of a preceding generalization.schjeldahl,packaging mach.div.local lodge of dist.lodge of int l ass of machinists,cir see also mcdowell von thaden.div.specific and exact contractual terms are accorded greater weight than general language.williston on contracts ed.even absent a true conflict between the general and specific provisions of a contract,specific words will limit the meaning of general words when the specific words are consistent with the purpose of the agreement as a whole.this principle is applicable here.
unless the second sentence operates as a limit,the first sentence would expose appellants to liability even for environmental testing that was completely unreasonable or unnecessary.the receiver in this case acted responsibly,but had he ordered tests arbitrarily,without any reasonable basis,appellants would still be liable for those costs under orix reading of the agreement,as long as the tests were at least indirectly related to the suspected presence of a hazardous material.nothing in the first sentence prevents such a result.but we do not think that cadlerocks and the original lender intended this result when they negotiated the agreement.common sense is as much a part of contract interpretation as is the dictionary or the arsenal of cannons sic.bukuras,at internal quotation marks omitted.it makes more sense to read the second sentence as imposing reasonable limitations on the first.
we also note that the second sentence does not include the typical language parties often use to introduce a list of examples,such as shall include but not be limited to,or without limiting the foregoing,the term shall include.see,in re complaint of martin,d,signet,taylor,no.civ.p c,wl,at,unpublished.although such language is of course not obligatory,its absence does weigh against reading the second sentence as a list of examples.
we must determine,therefore,whether the receiver expenses fall within the enumerated categories of liability listed in the second sentence.as we pointed out above,the only one that is arguably applicable is subclause iv.a
