the district court granted summary judgment to sales support services,sales support and its employee health care plan,a employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa the plan,holding that an expectant mother did not sufficiently assign her benefits claim on behalf of her prematurely born twins to the admitting hospital,harris methodist fort worth harris.harris,a preferred provider organization ppo for the plan,was thus denied recovery for the twins lengthy hospital stay.concluding that the assignment of benefits was sufficient that the plan authorized assignments to ppos such as harris and that harris timely filed benefit claims,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
brenda crosson crosson was an employee of sales support services,in fort worth,texas,and a participant in the plan.the plan was part of the proamerica ppo managed care network,which allowed its participants to receive discounted care from designated ppo providers sales support,as the plan sponsor,administrator,and named fiduciary,reserved the right to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the plan terms.berkley risk managers berkley served as sales support plan administrator.
after only weeks of pregnancy,crosson was admitted to harris and gave birth on december.upon admission,she signed a general conditions of treatment form assigning to harris the right to receive and enforce payment under the plan for all medical services provided.the extremely premature twins,lacie and kaycee crosson,weighed less than a pound each and were treated at harris from december,through april.their hospitalization cost.although the plan paid the charges incurred by crosson at the hospital,and it concedes the twins were covered through crosson plan participation,it paid nothing for harris services to the twins harris delivered the crosson file to its counsel for collection on july.
harris filed suit under erisa against sales support and the plan on june,for appellees failure to reimburse it for services provided to the twins.sales support filed claims against both berkley and its excess loss insurers standard security life insurance company of new york sslic and transamerica collectively,insurers,and the insurers filed counterclaims against sales support.numerous for summary judgment were filed.the district court resolved the competing claims by granting summary judgment against harris on grounds that because of a defective assignment,harris lacked standing to sue under erisa and the plan contractual statute of limitations provision barred harris claims.the court accordingly dismissed as moot the claims between sales support and the insurers.harris now appeals the court dismissal of its claims sales support and the insurers appeal the dismissal of their competing claims.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo using the same standard as the district court.royal ins.of america hartford underwriters ins,cir.we review questions of law de novo.in re cpdc,cir.
harris contests both aspects of the district court ruling against it.it is well established that a healthcare provider,though not a statutorily designated erisa beneficiary,may obtain standing to sue derivatively to enforce an erisa plan beneficiary claim.see tango transport healthcare fin.servs.llc,cir.the first inquiry here is thus whether harris became an assignee of crosson erisa benefits claim for the crosson twins.if harris prevails on this issue,the next question is whether the claim was under the terms of the plan.
whether harris obtained a valid assignment 
the district court held that harris never obtained a valid assignment for the twins services based on its narrow interpretation of both the hospital general conditions of treatment form executed by crosson and the language of the company summary plan description spd.like the district court,we interpret the assignment form in accordance with texas contract law principles and the spd under erisa principles.
an assignment is a manifestation to another person by the owner of a right indicating his intention to transfer,without further action or manifestation of intention,his right to such other person or third person.wolters village mgmt.merchants planters bank of sherman,cir internal citations and marks omitted accord restatement second of contracts it is essential to an assignment of a right that the obligee manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person without further action or manifestation of intention by the obligee.the manifestation may be made to the other or to a third person on his behalf and,except as provided by statute or by contract,may be made either orally or by writing.once a valid assignment is made,the assignor right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.restatement second of contracts see also fdic mcfarland,cir i t is generally true that an assignee takes all of the rights of the assignor,no greater and no less.quoting in re new haven projects.liability city of new haven,cir.
to decide whether harris became an assignee,we must examine and consider the entire writing and give effect to all provisions such that none are rendered meaningless.gonzalez denning,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.contractual terms receive their ordinary and plain meaning unless the contract indicates the parties intended to give the terms a technical meaning.id.where a contract is written so that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning,it is not ambiguous.id.however,where a contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations,it is ambiguous and extrinsic evidence may be considered.id.
in addition,erisa requires that the spd be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.see also hansen continental ins,cir t he very purpose of having a summary plan description of the policy is to enable the average participant in the plan to understand readily the general features of the policy,precisely so that the average participant need not become expert in each and every one of the requirements,provisos,conditions,and qualifications of the policy and its legal terminology.emphasis in original.hansen also requires that any ambiguities in the spd must be resolved in the employee favor,and the spd must be read as a whole.at.
two documents are pertinent to the assignment at issue.the first is the general conditions of treatment document that crosson signed upon entering the hospital,several portions of which are relevant.paragraph provides 
financial agreement and assignment of benefits in consideration for the services to be rendered to me,i hereby promise to pay for those services in accordance with the rates and terms now in effect at the hospital,to the extent i am legally responsible for such payment.i hereby assign to the hospital and any practitioner providing care and treatment to me,any and all benefits and all interest and rights including causes of action and the right to enforce payment for services rendered under any insurance policies or any reimbursement or prepaid health care plan 
emphasis added.at the bottom of the page,the capitalized statement,this is a legal consent and assignment of benefits form,is just above where crosson signed.immediately below her signature,she wrote self on the line identifying her relationship to patient or legal representative.
paragraph of the form,labeled consent to treatment,states inter alia if i am to receive obstetrical care,this consent is given for any child ren born to me during this hospitalization juxtaposing this paragraph reference to children with the language of paragraph and crosson identification of herself as the patient,the district court concluded that the hospital document effected an assignment to harris of only the benefits due for treatment of crosson herself,not those due for the twins care.
