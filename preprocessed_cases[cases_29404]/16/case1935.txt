omari mazera was fired from his job as a car porter at varsity ford services,llc.after filing a lawsuit against his former employer on the basis of race and disability discrimination,he moved the district court to declare that his prior written agreement to arbitrate this type of dispute was not enforceable.the district court denied the motion,holding that the arbitration agreement was binding on mazera.but the court severed a provision in the agreement that required mazera to pay up to of the arbitration costs,holding that the provision would likely deter employees such as mazera from enforcing their rights.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it held that mazera entered a binding agreement to arbitrate,but reverse the judgment regarding the severance of the provision and remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
mazera is a naturalized united states citizen who was born in kenya.he began working as a porter for varsity ford in ann arbor,michigan in april.in august,mazera was fired.he filed suit in the district court months later,alleging that varsity ford had violated both federal and state law by terminating his employment due to his race and disability.varsity ford set forth various affirmative defenses to the complaint,including an assertion that the lawsuit was barred by a prior agreement to submit all such disputes to binding arbitration.mazera later moved for a declaratory judgment that would free him from the arbitration agreement.varsity ford opposed the motion and submitted documents evidencing a binding agreement to arbitrate.
upon being hired,mazera received an employee handbook.the opening page of the handbook stated 
nothing contained in this handbook is intended to create nor shall be construed as creating a contract of employment express or implied or guarantee employment for any term or for any specific procedures.there is no contract of employment between varsity ford and any one or all of its employees.employment security can not be guaranteed for or by any employee.
in the foreword to the handbook,varsity ford reserve d full discretion to add to,modify,or delete provisions of the handbook at any time without advance notice.the original handbook did not contain an arbitration clause.
in april,the handbook was revised to contain a mandatory complaint procedure that required employee complaints,including complaints of discrimination,to be resolved via a process that culminated in arbitration proceedings.that october,varsity ford revised the handbook once again,setting forth additional details about costs,selection of an arbitrator,powers of the arbitrator,and enforcement of an arbitration award.these revisions included the following provisions regarding cost splitting 
w ithin this time period ten days from the date of an unfavorable decision by the president of the dealership you the employee must deposit with the general manager or five days pay,whichever is less.if you request a waiver of the deposit fee,you must state the reasons for your request and submit the request to the general manager.this request must be submitted within the ten business day limit.if the request is denied,you will have ten additional days after notice of denial to pay the deposit fee in order to perfect your appeal.the dealership retains the right to waive or reduce the deposit fee at its sole discretion.the deposit fee shall be refunded to you if you prevail in full before the arbitrator.
the arbitrator fee and expenses shall be borne fully by the dealership if the award is fully in your favor with the deposit for arbitration to be refunded to you.the arbitrator fee and expenses shall be shared equally by both parties if all or part of the arbitration decision is in favor of the dealership,but your costs for the arbitration fee shall not exceed or five days pay,whichever is less,with the remainder of the expenses to be paid by the dealership.
in addition,the opening page of the handbook was revised to read 
nothing contained in this handbook is intended to create nor shall be construed as creating a contract of employment express or implied or guarantee employment for any term or for any specific procedures the only exception is the mandatory complaint procedure which is a binding obligation for both employees and the dealership.
emphasis added.on october,mazera signed a document that stated i acknowledge receipt of the mandatory complaint procedure and understand that compliance with this procedure is a term and condition of employment.
the district court denied mazera motion to declare the arbitration agreement unenforceable.according to the court,mazera lawsuit was precluded by a valid and enforceable agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration.the provision that mandates the deposit by mazera of up to,however,was declared to be prohibitively expensive and unreasonable.according to the court,a substantial number of similarly situated persons would be deterred by the deposit from seeking to vindicate their federal statutory rights,causing the court to sever the provision from the agreement.the court then ordered arbitration and dismissed the case.
mazera appealed,arguing that the district court should have let a jury decide whether a valid agreement to arbitrate had been formed.varsity ford filed a regarding the severance of the provision.the district court stayed the arbitration proceedings pending this appeal.

mazera argues that of the act entitles him to a jury trial regarding the validity of the varsity ford arbitration agreement.see if the making of the arbitration agreement is in issue,the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.but i n order to show that the validity of the agreement is in issue under,the party opposing arbitration must show a genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.great earth simons,cir.if a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that no valid agreement to arbitrate exists,the issue is subject to resolution by a jury.id.
the third circuit has opined that a n unequivocal denial that the agreement had been made,accompanied by supporting affidavits,in most cases should be sufficient to require a jury determination on whether there had in fact been a meeting of the minds about arbitration.mills,stockbridge fabrics,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in reliance on that language,mazera submitted an affidavit accompanying his motion for a declaratory judgment.he did not deny having entered into an arbitration agreement,but instead claimed that he had received no consideration as to any arbitration agreement,had little to no bargaining power concerning its terms,had no attorney,and did not understand english as well as other employees.mazera affidavit further contended that he was not told he was waiving his right to a jury trial,is not a sophisticated business person,and that he did not understand the difference between a jury trial and arbitration.finally,mazera insisted that a rbitration was not a condition of his employment,but instead was slipped in as a unilateral decision by varsity ford.he relies on mills in arguing that these statements created a genuine issue of material fact that requires submission to a jury.see id.
