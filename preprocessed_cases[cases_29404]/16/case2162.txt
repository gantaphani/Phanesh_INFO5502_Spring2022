this dispute arises from a massive fraud in which frank gruttadauria,a cleveland stockbroker,misappropriated at least million of his clients money.the plaintiffs,all clients of gruttadauria,brought this action against the brokerage houses for which he worked over the course of his career.the defendants moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration pursuant to arbitration clauses in the account agreements.the district court,relying largely on the gross nature of the fraud,ruled that the arbitration clauses in the agreements did not apply to the dispute and set the case for trial.the defendants appeal this decision.thus,the only question of law in this interlocutory appeal is whether similarly worded arbitration clauses in the plaintiffs brokerage account agreements mandate arbitration of their claims.
frank gruttadauria was a stockbroker for the defendant brokerage houses or firms that were purchased by them.as early as,gruttadauria began to send falsified statements to his clients that significantly overstated the value of their accounts.gruttadauria had incurred significant losses in some of these accounts,and he falsified statements to cover this up.
to make good when clients requested withdrawals from their inflated accounts,gruttaduaria either used new deposits by other clients or withdrew funds from other clients accounts to make payments.in a separate criminal proceeding against him,gruttaduaria entered into a plea agreement in which he admitted taking million in unauthorized withdrawals between and alone.he also admitted that he gained at least million personally from the fraud.
gruttaduaria scheme eventually collapsed.according to the plea agreement,by gruttadauria clients accounts had a paper value of million,while their actual value was only million.gruttadauria fled after leaving a letter of confession.in the letter,he claimed that he was the only person involved in the scheme but implied that the brokerage houses were grossly negligent for not monitoring his activities.he later surrendered to authorities and pleaded guilty to a federal indictment.
plaintiffs brought this action against defendants alleging numerous securities law violations including outright theft from their accounts.most plaintiffs also allege churning,unauthorized trading,and excessive risk taking as well as a number of other common law and statutory claims.in denying the defendants motions to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration,the district court did not provide a separate analysis for each arbitration agreement.however,the parties agree that each contains roughly the same language.the typical arbitration clause in the account agreements reads,any controversy arising out of or relating to any of my accounts,to transactions with you for me,or to this or any other agreement or the construction,performance or breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration.
the district court held that the arbitration clauses were not binding because,given the nature of the fraud,the agreements were void ab intitio and there were effectively no accounts.in the alternative,the district court held that the fraud alleged here was not covered by the arbitration clauses.we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to consider the particular claims of the parties regarding the validity of the arbitration clauses standing apart from the account agreements as a whole.
