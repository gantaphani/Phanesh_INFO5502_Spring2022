opinion of the court 
at issue in this world war ii reparations case is whether the joint statement of the berlin accords constitutes a privately enforceable contract between some of the participants to the joint statement.appellants contend that the defendant german companies owe interest on their payments to a reparations fund created by the berlin accords.in a prior appeal to our court,we held that the claim presented a justiciable issue not foreclosed by the political question doctrine.having again considered the allegations of the complaints,we hold that the disputed interest provision of the joint statement does not constitute or confer a privately enforceable cause of action on the appellants,who assert standing as beneficiaries.in so holding,we note the thoroughness of the district court analysis and reasoning.because we agree with judge debevoise rationale,we adopt it as ours,with some minor points as described herein.
background 
because the history and facts of this case are set forth in ample detail in our previous opinion,gross german foundation industrial initiative,cir gross ii,and the two district court opinions,gross german foundation industrial initiative,d gross iii,and in re nazi era cases against german defendants litigation,d gross i,we do not repeat them here rather,we briefly summarize the history and facts,insofar as they aid the present discussion.
the claims here involve reparations for slave labor,forced labor,appropriation of personal property,and dishonored insurance policies.as early as,the united states and german governments,aware of the significance of the claims and the seriousness of the risk posed to the german economy,encouraged negotiations between the plaintiffs and the defendant german corporations.the negotiations involved senior diplomatic executives from both the and german governments,specifically and respectively former deputy secretary of the treasury stuart eizenstat and count otto lambsdorff,chief negotiator for former german chancellor gerhard schroeder.several german companies came together as the german foundation industrial initiative the initiative,which acted as the negotiating arm of the german industry.representing the claimants were plaintiffs attorneys who had filed the civil actions.
after many months of intense negotiations and significant lucubration,on july,a diplomatic agreement,commonly referred to as the berlin accords or the berlin agreements,was reached as a means of resolving these claims.under the agreement,the german foundation remembrance,responsibility and the future the foundation was established as the intended,exclusive forum for receiving,processing,and paying reparation claims at issue here.germany and the german companies each agreed to contribute dm billion to fund the foundation.the plaintiffs lawyers agreed to dismiss with prejudice the numerous pending litigations,so that the victims would receive payment through the foundation rather than civil actions and that the german companies would achieve and enduring legal peace.
the berlin accords consist of the joint statement,the executive agreement between the united states and germany,and the foundation law.the joint titled the joint statement on occasion of the final plenary meeting concluding international talks on the preparation of the foundation remembrance,responsibility and the future sets forth a goal of the foundation,which is to provide dignified payments to hundreds of thousands of survivors and to others who suffered from wrongs during the national socialist era and world war ii.joint statement,pmbl.the joint statement commits the german government and german industry to provide dm billion in capitalization.as structured,the initiative would collect dm billion from individual german companies and then transfer the money to the foundation.particularly significant for this case,the last sentence of paragraph d of the joint statement states 
german company funds will continue to be collected on a schedule and in a manner that will ensure that the interest earned thereon before and after their delivery to the foundation will reach at least million dm.
the second document,the executive agreement,outlines the and german governments commitments to the foundation and obligates the united states executive,in all cases for which it is notified of a claim against a german company arising out of the wwii era,to file a statement of its foreign policy interests with the court in which the claim is pending,stating that united states foreign policy interests favor resolution through the foundation.the third document,the foundation law,is codified under german law and establishes the foundation as the legal entity for processing claims and distributing the dm billion fund.
on may,the german legislature declared legal peace,triggering the obligations of the german government and the german companies to each pay dm billion to the foundation.the german government made timely payment,but the initiative did not complete payment until december,at which point it had transferred dm billion,which included dm million as the interest designated in paragraph d of the joint statement.
due to the delay in the initiative payment and the differing assertions of what the interest provision mandated,several claimants filed suit,attempting to enforce the interest provision of the joint statement.in june,elly gross and others filed their complaint as beneficiaries seeking recovery for breach of contract against the initiative and against its founding companies.they alleged that the german corporations owed interest in excess of the dm million already paid,based on the initiative financial obligation from and after july,the date the joint statement was signed.in july,bernard and barbara schwartz lee brought a similar breach of contract action against deutsch bank ag and dresdner bank ag.they allege that the two banks agreed to pay interest earned on their payment from december.
these complaints were assigned to judge bassler.the initiative and the defendant corporations moved to dismiss the complaints pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and argued,in the alternative,that the claims were nonjusticiable.in a single opinion,the district court held that the claims were not justiciable.gross i,d at.on appeal,we reversed,holding that,while the claims implicated foreign policy issues within the realm of the executive branch,the case was nevertheless justiciable.gross ii,at.we also noted that a court would face at least two questions on the merits of this dispute is the joint statement,or part of the joint statement,enforceable as a private contract,and if so,what interest obligation,if any,did the parties intend for the german foundation industrial initiative id.at.
on remand,the cases were reassigned to judge debevoise.among other motions,defendants in the gross case moved to dismiss under rule b on the basis that the claims were not privately enforceable.defendants in the schwartz lee case moved to dismiss on the basis of a lack an enforceable december contract.in a single opinion,judge debevoise dismissed both complaints,holding that the joint statement is not a contract but a political document and thus does not confer a private cause of action on the plaintiffs.gross iii,d at.plaintiffs in both cases timely appealed on september.

iii.application of the law of international agreements 
in setting forth our analysis,we reiterate that we do so only to the extent necessary to supplement the analysis of the district court.below,we first confirm the district court turn to the law of international agreements as providing the legal framework for examining the joint statement.next,applying those principles,we expand on some additional points which warrant further discussion here.
at the outset,appellants contend that judge debevoise erred by applying treaty law as opposed to federal common law.but we do not see merit in this argument.the events leading to the berlin accords evince an unprecedented diplomatic effort to create an international agreement establishing a forum for the resolution of certain reparation claims and also to dispose of the pending legal actions.
as judge debevoise noted,july,was the occasion of one of the most remarkable diplomatic achievements since the end of world war ii.gross iii,d at.it was on that day that eight sovereign nations,a consortium representing numerous german companies,an international organization devoted to claims,and plaintiffs attorneys together signed the joint statement of the berlin accords.appellants can not reasonably dispute the significant political nature of the talks leading to the accords.granted,one objective was to settle litigation between the plaintiffs and the defendant german companies,but we weigh that private aspect of the resolution against the berlin accords political,diplomatic,and historical significance.the creation of the berlin accords was more than a mere settlement it was a profound expiation by the federal republic of germany and german companies.indeed,from the start of the negotiations,deputy secretary eizenstat,the lead negotiator,was determined that the responsible foreign government,germany,not just private companies,would have to be directly involved and directly engaged through a senior official who would be eizenstat counterpart.stuart eizenstat,imperfect justice looted assets,slave labor,and the unfinished business of world war ii.
we recognize that the joint statement is not a formal treaty nevertheless,it constitutes part of the understanding reached among sovereign nations and private parties.negotiations occurred during plenary sessions comprising executives of foreign nations.the signatories of the joint statement itself includes the representatives of eight different nations.further,the joint statement has meaning only in the context of the entire berlin accords.indeed,the joint statement by itself is incomplete,as it talks of the foundation,but understanding what the foundation is requires resort to the foundation law.in sum,the joint statement appears to be a unique document,the objectives of which are to memorialize the efforts of the diplomatic talks resolving both political and legal issues.thus,for at least these reasons,we agree with the district court that the law of international agreements provides the appropriate jurisprudential guidance in the analysis of whether the joint statement creates a private cause of action.
to ascertain whether an international agreement creates a private cause of action,we first look to the text of the agreement.see united states,d in construing a treaty,as in construing a statute,we first look to its terms to determine its meaning.at the same time,however,a court has greater leeway to look beyond the words of an international agreement.see,air france saks,d t reaties are construed more liberally than private agreements,and to ascertain their meaning we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.quoting choctaw nation of indians united states.moreover,the public acts and proclamations of foreign governments,and those of their publicly recognized agents,in carrying into effect th e treaties,though not made its in th e cause,are historical and notorious facts,of which the court can take regular judicial notice.united states reynes,how.see also el al israel airlines,tseng,d.
in general,a court role is limited to giving effect to the intent of the t reaty parties.sumitomo shoji,avagliano,d.thus,clear language controls unless it effects a result inconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.id.at quoting maximov united states,d.in line with this precedent,and regardless of whether we apply any presumption for or against private enforceability,our duty is to ascertain whether the signatories of the joint statement intended to permit a private cause of action against the german companies.
our examination of the text of the joint statement and the entire berlin accords supports the district court rationale and conclusion.we discern a strong intent on the part of the participants to enter into an agreement that is not enforceable through a private cause of action.first,the joint statement,along with the berlin accords as a whole,aspires to something other than simply the creation of a private,exchange.one specific objective was to send a conclusive,humanitarian signal,out of a sense of moral responsibility,solidarity and.joint statement,pmbl.another clear purpose was for the german companies to receive and enduring legal peace.see executive agreement,pmbl,and,joint statement,pmbl,and b foundation law,pmbl.even without any presumptive approach,this language strongly connotes an intent not to create a right of private action for only some of the joint statement participants.
second,as the district court noted,the joint statement uses language that is generally consistent with a political document.the signatories of the joint statement refer to themselves as participants,not as parties.joint statement.the participants declare rather than agree or undertake.id.the title of the document itself suggests a arrangement.see staff of comm.on foreign relations,print,treaties and other international agreements the role of the united states senate comm.print joint statements of intent are not binding agreements unless they meet the requirements of legally binding agreements,that is,that the parties intend to be legally bound.each of these textual clues points towards a document without privately enforceable rights.
it is true,as appellants point out,that some language of the joint statement can be read as suggesting binding obligations.for instance,paragraph d does use the terms will and shall when describing the steps that the german companies intend to take.appellants argue that such language should be read as imposing legally enforceable obligations on the german companies.but these few examples can not overcome the contrary language indicating a nature.the joint statement contains insufficient language to confer on appellants a private cause of action.
appellants also rely too much on textual hairsplitting between shall and will,as used in the joint statement.specifically,gross argues that shall is used with judicially enforceable acts and will with unenforceable acts.thus,their argument goes,things that will be done are not privately enforceable,but things that shall be done are enforceable.we disagree with the alleged subtlety.for example,paragraph d uses both shall and will in referring to the intended actions of the german companies the dm billion contribution of the german companies shall be due t he german companies will make available reasonable advanced funding german company funds will continue to be collected.joint statement d emphases added.the joint statement also uses shall and will interchangeably with the german government and the german companies.id.a,d.even if a clear difference in meaning exists between shall and will and we are not convinced there always is,see hewitt helms,d characterizing shall,will,and must as language of an unmistakably mandatory character the distinction is not borne out in the joint statement text 
appellants also propose that the district court erred by not severing the last sentence of paragraph d from the rest of the joint statement.according to their argument,severability permits that sentence to be the grant of private enforceability.without doubt,treaties and international agreements can include sections that are privately enforceable amidst sections not privately enforceable.see lidas,united states,cir holding that the united income tax treaty exchange of information provisions are severable from the double taxation provisions united states postal,cir a treaty need not be wholly or wholly executory.see also restatement third foreign relations law of the united states cmt.h some provisions of an international agreement may be and others.and we do not ignore these precedents.the test here is not,however,an overly formalistic application of any particular doctrinal rule.rather,our charge is to remain true to what the participants envisioned as their intended outcome,as shown through interpretative methods discussed above.in this case,the joint statement language does not lend itself to the dichotomous approach urged by appellants.excision of a single sentence from the body of the joint statement,and from the entire berlin accords,invites departure from the participants intentions.
at oral argument,appellants counsel repeated their contention that it would have been an act of temporary insanity for experienced counsel to have agreed to dismiss sixty cases with prejudice prior to payment,without the existence of a judicially enforceable means of insuring compliance.but we think this assertion is tenuous and overstates the situation.as the district court recognized,appellants counsel were not dismissing the actions with only the slim hope or gamble that the german companies might proceed with their payments.counsel dismissed the complaints,in part,because the joint statement had the support and backing of the governments of both the united states and the federal republic of germany.indeed,but for the actions of president clinton and chancellor schroeder,it is questionable whether the negotiations would have been fruitful.see imperfect justice describing the critical involvement of president clinton and chancellor schroeder during the negotiations in december.had the german companies opted to not complete their payments to the initiative,serious political consequences and executive discomfiture would have resulted.
moreover,despite gross argument to the contrary,the district court did not find that appellants only recourse rests exclusively with the german ministry of finance.the assertion runs counter to the undisputed fact that appellants always retained the option to reopen litigation through federal rule of civil procedure b.indeed,appellants could have utilized that procedure,but,to avoid jeopardizing the entire,politically sensitive resolution and the payment of the dm billion to the victims,claimants declined to move to reopen litigation under rule b.see in re nazi era cases against german defendants,d.instead,they asked the court to define and enforce the defendants interest obligation.on july,the district court declined to do so,holding that jurisdiction to enforce the joint statement was absent.id.at.appellants chose not to appeal that decision.what the district court in the present case concluded was that,given the foundation procedure and the option under rule b,the participants to the joint statement exhibited,through the text and structure of the berlin accords,an intent not to legally bind other participants by a contractual right enforceable through litigation.in our view,the district court correctly construed the terms of the joint statement and the arduous negotiations leading to the joint statement as manifestations of all participants intentions to implement a procedure for resolving further disputes.
appellants urge us to consider the litigious context in which the joint statement was drafted.in this context of settling class action lawsuits,gross argues,the joint statement must be viewed as a fashioned after a settlement agreement pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.we are cognizant of the drafting environment,but we remain convinced that the manifested intentions of the participants were to create a document that set forth the objectives of the negotiations without granting privately enforceable contractual rights,other than any provided by the foundation law.if the contextual evidence does anything,it strengthens our belief that the participants to the joint statement did not contemplate an agreement which would require further legal wrangling in courts.
to the extent that the district court considered the history of the berlin accords,we agree with the court reliance on the general approach set forth in frolova union of soviet socialist republics,cir.although frolova concerns a formal treaty,the factors listed are just as applicable here in analyzing whether the historical context surrounding the joint statement evinces an intent to confer privately enforceable rights.
we also briefly address gross position that the supreme court has implicitly rejected the district court approach in assessing the private enforceability of the joint statement.gross relies upon medellín texas,d,and its analysis of whether the vienna convention optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes,the united nations charter,and the international court of justice statute were treaties.in appellants view,medellín does away with any presumption against of treaties.
an overly strict reliance on the concept of versus treaties may be misleading in this case.a treaty is one which do es not require domestic legislation to give it the full force of law.renkel united states,cir citing trans world airlines,franklin mint,d.by itself,the status of does not answer the question of whether a document creates a private right of enforcement.see restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states cmt.h whether a treaty is is a question distinct from whether the treaty creates private rights or remedies.see also united states li,cir en banc t he character of a treaty does not by itself establish that the treaty creates private rights.thus,even if we were faced with a treaty,medellín discussion does not complete the picture.
as we see it,medellín does not undermine the district court analysis.the supreme court recognized that,e ven when treaties are in the sense that they create federal law,the background presumption is that i nternational agreements,even those directly benefiting private persons,generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.medellín.at quoting restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states,cmt.a.we have agreed with this approach,see mannington mills,congoleum,cir,as have several of our sister courts.see,united states emuegbunam,cir garza lappin,cir a s a general rule,international agreements,even those benefiting private parties,do not create private rights enforceable in domestic courts.united states,cir united states li,cir en banc goldstar panama united states,cir canadian transport united states.thus,when determining the intent of the joint statement participants,we keep in mind the accepted approach that,w hen no privately enforceable right is explicitly stated,courts look to the treaty as a whole to determine whether it evidences an intent to provide a private right of action.libyan arab republic,bork,concurring.
again,we emphasize that we do not apply a strict presumption in this case.rather,we draw from the state of international agreement law to understand better what the text of the joint statement teaches about the intentions of t
