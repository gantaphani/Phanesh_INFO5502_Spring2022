advocare international,formulated and sold products for improving nutrition and weight loss.it contracted with horizon laboratories,to manufacture some of its products,including products with ephedra,an ingredient that proved to be controversial.advocare also contracted with and its owner,richard scheckenbach,to formulate some of advocare products.various damages suits were filed against advocare,and scheckenbach for personal injuries caused to users of products containing ephedra.lexington insurance company,horizon insurer,refused to defend and indemnify horizon or advocare for the ephedra claims.
advocare sued horizon,alleging that it conspired with and scheckenbach to defraud advocare and was guilty of breach of contract and fraud.advocare also asserted claims against scheckenbach and for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud.scheckenbach,and horizon counterclaimed,and horizon named lexington as a defendant.advocare and lexington prevailed on most of their claims.horizon,and scheckenbach appealed.
horizon manufactured products for advocare under a and a contract.both contracts required horizon to maintain products liability insurance with advocare as an additional named insured under the policy.under the contract advocare agreed to make minimum monthly purchases of horizon products,and horizon agreed to take the steps necessary to obtain dietary supplement verification program dsvp certification within days.horizon failed to obtain this certification,and advocare by letter gave horizon notice of the breach and terminated the contract.but horizon continued to ship products to advocare accompanied by invoices that contained a provision billing interest for amounts due.advocare did not pay,maintaining that horizon had not reimbursed it for the expenses of the ephedra lawsuits.horizon insurer,lexington,had refused coverage,relying on a coverage exemption for ephedra in the policy.
in the meantime,scheckenbach worked as a consultant to advocare he formulated advocare products and ordered ingredients for them.scheckenbach agreed in his consulting contract to decline commissions,gratuities,or fees from suppliers.nonetheless,he profited from arrangements with suppliers,including companies that scheckenbach had founded himself.advocare sued scheckenbach,and horizon in a state district court in texas horizon removed the case to federal district court.advocare claimed that scheckenbach and conspired with horizon to raise artificially the price of the raw materials used in advocare products advocare stipulated that it owed horizon approximately million reflected in unpaid invoices but claimed an offset of expenses incurred in defending ephedra lawsuits,and a breach of horizon commitment to provide adequate insurance coverage.advocare also maintained that horizon had breached the contract by failing to obtain dsvp certification.horizon counterclaimed,arguing that advocare wrongfully terminated the contract and failed to satisfy the minimum monthly purchase commitment.horizon also requested that the court enter a declaratory judgment requiring lexington to indemnify horizon for the ephedra claims 
the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of advocare,holding that horizon had breached the contract by failing to obtain dsvp certification within days and breached the and contracts with advocare by failing to provide insurance coverage for the ephedra claims.the court also granted summary judgment for lexington and dismissed with prejudice horizon claims for declaratory judgment regarding lexington duty to indemnify.the question of damages arising from horizon breach of contract with advocare,and the amount owed by advocare to horizon under the unpaid invoices,went to a jury.the jury awarded advocare in damages to date and in future damages.in turn,the jury awarded horizon approximately for the unpaid invoices.applying texas law,the district court applied an interest rate of to the invoiced amount due horizon moved for judgment as a matter of law and to alter and amend judgment under rules and objecting to the interest rate,arguing for a rate of under california law.
in scheckenbach and portion of the case,and scheckenbach counterclaimed against advocare claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duties,arguing that advocare had wrongfully terminated the consulting agreement and committed fraud by promising to indemnify them in products liability suits and failing to do so they sought declaratory judgment regarding advocare duty to indemnify.the court granted partial summary judgment,finding that and scheckenbach had not breached their contract with advocare and sending the remainder of the claims to the jury.the jury found no conspiracy among scheckenbach,and horizon.it found that advocare had a duty to indemnify scheckenbach and,awarding and scheckenbach on that claim.it also found that advocare was not liable for breach of the consulting agreement.rather,the jury found that scheckenbach had breached his fiduciary duty to advocare and committed fraud.the jury awarded actual and punitive damages.the court deducted scheckenbach and indemnity award from advocare damages,resulting in a total award of approximately million to advocare for its claims against scheckenbach and horizon,scheckenbach,and appealed.we address horizon arguments,followed by scheckenbach and.
horizon argues that the district court erred in finding that the insurance policy unambiguously excluded coverage for ephedra lawsuits and granting summary judgment for lexington.applying california substantive law,we review de novo the court grant of summary judgment we also review de novo the interpretation of a contract,including the question of whether the contract is ambiguous.
approximately eleven lawsuits for personal injuries and wrongful death caused by weight loss products containing ephedra or ephedrine were filed against advocare and others.horizon takes issue with the six alleging injuries suffered between and,claiming coverage for these lawsuits under an insurance policy that lexington issued to horizon,with advocare as an additional insured,for october,to october,this was an occurrence policy,defining occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the policy excluded coverage for ephedra lawsuits under the weight management pharmaceutical exclusion in endorsement,stating,
this insurance does not apply to bodily injury,property damage,personal injury,or advertising injury,arising out of any pharmaceutical used for the treatment of obesity,weight control,weight management,including but not limited to dexfenfluramine,phentermine and ephedra.
in california,
a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity the insurer does not need to defend if the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage 
the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.furthermore,with respect to ambiguous language,
a ny ambiguity or uncertainty in an insurance policy is to be resolved against the insurer.if semantically permissible,the contract will be given such construction as will fairly achieve its manifest object of securing indemnity to the insured for the losses to which the insurance relates 
a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable,and exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.
horizon argues that the policy did not unambiguously exclude coverage for ephedra that it only applies to pharmaceuticals,and horizon herbal products are dietary supplements or food,not pharmaceuticals.horizon cites to california legal definition of pharmaceutical as a prescription or human or veterinary drug,including,but not limited to,a drug as defined in section or the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act and that a drug is,among other things,defined as any article other than food.
lexington argues that,following the ordinary,common sense interpretation of the policy language,as required in interpreting contracts under california law the exclusion essentially says we do cover diet pills containing ephedra.the district court found similarly,stating,the endorsement language does not imply that it encompasses ephedra only if it is a pharmaceutical.
w ords in an insurance policy must be read in their ordinary sense,and any ambiguity can not be based on a strained interpretation of the policy language.a finding that the policy was ambiguous in excluding coverage for ephedra lawsuits under a heading including the word pharmaceuticals would be a strained interpretation.the district court did not err in finding the policy unambiguous in its exclusion of defense costs for ephedra lawsuits and granting summary judgment for lexington.
in their and contracts,horizon committed to provide insurance for advocare approximately of the products that horizon manufactured for advocare contained ephedra,yet horizon insurance policy and subsequent policies with lexington excluded policy coverage for ephedra.for advocare breach of contract claim against horizon,the district court granted summary judgment for advocare but it was unable from the summary judgment materials submitted by advocare to determine whether any of advocare alleged damages of approximately million were attributable to breach of the agreement,leaving the damages question to the jury.the jury awarded more than to advocare.
horizon urges that a ny objections that advocare had to the insurance coverage provided by horizon were waived by its failure to raise the question of coverage with horizon.as the district court explained,horizon cites no authority for the concept that an aggrieved party has the burden to police compliance with a contract before claiming breach,and the court can conceive of none.
horizon also argues impossibility of performance,stating that advocare was aware of the difficulty and expense of obtaining insurance coverage for ephedra,and that i t is unreasonable for advocare to maintain that the and contracts required horizon to obtain insurance covering ephedra claims which advocare could not obtain.horizon provides no evidence to show that it was impossible or even prohibitively expensive to obtain insurance for ephedra products.it only claims that advocare dropped its product liability insurance because of high premiums concerning ephedra claims.
finally,horizon argues that both the and agreements are as to the type and extent of insurance coverage required,arguing that n othing in either contract says that horizon would be liable for all claims it merely says insurance.furthermore,horizon alleges,although the contract specifies that neither party is the drafter,advocare was the drafter of the contract and any ambiguities should be resolved against the drafter it follows,urges horizon,that the district court should have denied advocare motion for summary judgment for breach of contract.both horizon and advocare rely on texas law for their disputes over the and contracts.
we are persuaded that the language is not ambiguous under texas law.the agreements both require insurance coverage for product liability.as advocare points out,the term adequate in the contract only refers to the amount of insurance required,providing,manufacturer shall maintain in place at all times insurance coverage for product liability in adequate amounts.horizon argument that adequate insurance might have meant an insurance policy that covered most of the products that horizon manufactured for advocare,with the exception of ephedra,is unconvincing.both agreements require,without ambiguity,that horizon maintain product liability insurance,and they do not provide an exception for products containing ephedra.the district court did not err in holding that horizon failed to maintain insurance coverage for ephedra in breach of its contractual obligation.
in addition to requiring insurance coverage,advocare and horizon agreement required that horizon obtain special certification for manufacture of dietary supplements,stating,
usp compliance.manufacturer agrees to participate in and fully comply with the dietary supplement verification program dsvp established by pharmacopeia usp.manufacturer further agrees to undertake such actions as necessary to obtain the dsvp certification mark for the products within the days from the effective date of this agreement.
advocare argued before the district court that horizon breached the contract by failing to obtain dsvp certification within days of the contract,by april.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment.we find no error.
horizon argues that the term undertake is ambiguous because to undertake means to commit to take and not to complete.under texas law,ambiguity exists if after reading a contract in light of the surrounding circumstances a contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations.the argument is that there are two reasonable interpretations the contract language may require that horizon complete all of the steps necessary to obtain certification within days,or that horizon begin all of the steps necessary for certification within this time period.perhaps consideration of parol evidence to address this ambiguity may be reasonable,despite the existence of an integration clause 
we need not pause there,however,because the parol evidence does not show that horizon even began all of the steps necessary for certification within the window,nor does horizon claim that it did so horizon did not meet with advocare until more than one month after the deadline for certification passed,and at this meeting it told advocare that certification would be expensive.under the most generous interpretation of the language and the parol evidence,horizon failed to take even the initial steps required by the contract and thus breached the contract.
horizon,in addition to arguing ambiguity,urges that performance of dsvp certification was impossible and that the party alleging performance.it urges that the contract required it to obtain dsvp certification for all of advocare products within days,and that advocare did not take the steps necessary to make certification possible.specifically,it argues that advocare had not completed what was required from it to proceed under the certification process,pointing to a advocare that stated,neither advocare nor horizon labs has documented its business procedures.but horizon fails to specify what steps advocare should have completed and failed to complete.because horizon itself took no steps toward certification,the argument that advocare failed to perform and stifled horizon ability to perform under the contract has little weight.
horizon argument of impossibility of performance is also unpersuasive.horizon states that its president found that certification for just one product would take one to two years and over.under texas law,impossibility defenses generally fail when the probability of the unanticipated occurrence was known to the party seeking relief before contracting.advocare presented evidence that horizon president knew,prior to the signing of the contract,of the requirements for dsvp certification 
finally,horizon argues that advocare waived any arguments for breach because advocare president,todd cash,stated in a meeting that dsvp certification was not worthwhile to pursue.this meeting did not occur until after horizon had failed to meet the certification deadline in the contract.furthermore,although advocare continued to order products from horizon after horizon breach,it sent two letters clearly indicating that it was no longer operating under the agreement because horizon had breached and advocare had terminated the agreement.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment.
the agreement between advocare and horizon contained a texas choice of law provision but failed to specify an interest rate for past due amounts.after advocare terminated the agreement,horizon continued manufacturing products for advocare and sent advocare invoices.the invoices provided that past due amounts would accrue interest of per annum.advocare accepted the products but did not pay for them.the district court applied a rate in awarding horizon amounts for unpaid invoices.in dp solutions,rollins,we held that t he prejudgment interest award is a question of law and is reviewed de novo.
horizon objects to the court use of the prejudgment interest rate under texas law,arguing that a rate of under california law should apply.horizon objection came in motions to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to rule e and for entry of judgment as a matter of law under rule b.the district court rejected both.
advocare urges that horizon waived its prejudgment interest arguments by failing to make these objections in earlier motions,arguing that advocare submitted its proposed judgment with the prejudgment interest award that horizon now challenges on march,and the court did not enter the final judgment until april,that during this time,advocare should have objected to the interest rate.horizon replies that t his issue was preserved and identified in the and left for the court to determine,and that t he account stated count stated a request for eighteen percent interest,as did the prayer.
we need not address waiver with respect to rule b because the prejudgment interest issue turns on a choice of law a legal question for the court,not the jury.it is not the subject of a rule b motion.
we review denial of the rule e motion to amend the judgment to reflect an interest rate under california law only for abuse of discretion.a rule e motion must clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence and can not raise issues that could,and should,have been made before the judgment issued.although horizon did not object to the interest rate between the court issuance of the proposed and final judgments,its pretrial objections preserved the issue.in simon,where we held that the government waived a legal argument by failing to raise it at some point before the entry of judgment,we emphasized that the issue was not in the pretrial order here,it was.the order included as a contested issue of law w hether california or texas law applied to horizon interest claim.the pretrial order is the pleading on which the case goes to trial.unlike the situation in simon,the pretrial pleadings gave notice to the plaintiff and to the court that horizon would argue for an interest rate under california law,and we will review denial of this motion.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the rule e motion.because we find no provision governing the interest issue the most significant relationship test applies this test provides that the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the particular substantive issue will be applied to resolve that issue.to determine the contacts with the state,the texas supreme court in duncan looked to where the products were manufactured,where the manufacturer was incorporated,where the product was placed in the stream of commerce,and where the party injured by the product lived,and held that,t he beginning point for evaluating these contacts is the identification of the policies or governmental interests,if any,of each state in the application of its rule.
both california and texas would reasonably have a policy interest in limiting the interest rate that can be charged for amounts overdue,although texas has a strong interest,as the payments were made in texas horizon is based in california,while advocare is a texas company horizon manufactured the products in california and sent them from california to texas,where advocare then sent the products to distributors in texas.advocare ordered the product from texas and sent payments to horizon from texas.given the significant commercial activities that occurred in texas,the district court did not err in applying a interest rate under texas law.
horizon also argues on appeal that the court applied the interest rate to an amount of principal less than the amount owed under the account stated,urging,the worksheet used by advocare was attached with its proposed judgment and shows the interest rate calculated on,but the judgment was for,as stated in the judgment.advocare proposed final judgment listed,in error,the account stated amount as in calculating prejudgment interest and the court relied on this number in its calculations advocare argues that horizon waived any error by failing to object prior to the court entry of judgment.we disagree.courts,sitting in equity,have traditionally applied nunc pro tunc to correct limited types of errors,namely clerical or other record keeping errors.the court abused its discretion in not allowing correction of a clerical error in denying that portion of the rule e motion.we make that correction here,ordering the district court to calculate the prejudgment interest based on an account stated amount of.
we now turn to the issues involving scheckenbach and.after concluding in its ruling on summary judgment that scheckenbach had not breached his consulting contract with advocare,the district court instructed the jury that scheckenbach was an agent of advocare,that advocare bore the burden of proof to establish the scope of scheckenbach agency,and that scheckenbach owed a formal fiduciary duty to advocare.the jury had to determine whether scheckenbach actions in obtaining raw materials for advocare fell within the scope of his duties to advocare and whether scheckenbach breached his fiduciary duties to advocare.
the jury found that scheckenbach was liable to advocare for a breach of fiduciary duty.it awarded advocare approximately million in damages and million in lost profits for the breach the jury also found that scheckenbach committed fraud against advocare,awarding million to advocare for direct damages as a result of the fraud and million in exemplary damages,and it rejected scheckenbach limitations defense.scheckenbach argued in a motion for judgment as a matter of law that there was no evidence to support the jury rejection of the statute of limitations defense for the fraud and fiduciary duty claims,its finding of a breach of fiduciary duty,damages,or a breach of informal fiduciary duty.both parties rely on texas law in their appeal.
the standard of review for denial of a jmol motion is de novo but we reverse a jury determination only if the facts and inferences point so strongly and so overwhelmingly in favor of one party that reasonable men could not arrive at any verdict to the contrary.under this standard,reversal is not merited.
statute of limitations 
for the limitations defense,the court instructed the jury,
f or scheckenbach to meet his burden of proof for the defense of limitations,he must show by a preponderance of the evidence that before august,advocare knew,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the alleged injury.
the jury rejected scheckenbach limitations defense,and the district court denied scheckenbach jmol motion on the limitations issue.scheckenbach argues on appeal that advocare claims were barred by texas four year statute of limitations for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims,relying on the legal injury rule that starts the limitation clock running when the injury occurs.advocare argues that texas discovery rule should apply,where the limitations period starts to run when the injury is discovered.
while we review the record as a whole,we must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.thus,we are required to give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses 
advocare filed suit on august.advocare alleged in its complaint that scheckenbach engaged in secret sales of raw materials to horizon,thus inflating advocare prices and failing to disclose these sales or the fact that he had formed supplier companies that sold to horizon.it also argued that scheckenbach misrepresented facts when advocare asked if he was working for other companies.although,as scheckenbach argues,advocare was suspicious of scheckenbach activities and the first injury occurred before august,we are persuaded that in this case,the discovery rule and that there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that discovery did not occur more than four years prior to advocare filing suit.in murphy campbell,the texas supreme court held that the discovery rule applies in cases of fraud and fraudulent concealment,and in computer associates international,altai,it held similarly with respect to fiduciary claims scheckenbach argues that the evidence showed that discovery occurred no later than august,because on august.indeed,advocare counsel told scheckenbach in a letter on august,we have a very strong sense that there is a supplier or manufacturer,or more than one,in which you have an interest or from which you earn a fee.but advocare counsel testified that when scheckenbach responded to her august letter and stated,let me be very clear.i have no interest in either of these two companies horizon or or the others named herein or their possible holding companies or subsidiaries,no intended or anticipated interest in them,no do i earn a fee of any sort from any of them,she believed that she was getting the assurances from scheckenbach that she was seeking for some time.advocare presented evidence that,although it was suspicious of scheckenbach,his misrepresentations at least temporarily assuaged its fears.suspicions followed by misrepresentations calming those suspicions do not indicate that advocare actually knew or with reasonable diligence should have known of scheckenbach fraud and breaches of fiduciary duties before august.advocare also presented evidence that it asked scheckenbach if he was involved in supply companies and received assurances that he was not it did not confirm scheckenbach ownership of supply companies until,when it hired a law firm that identified those companies and confronted scheckenbach with the companies names,asking if he knew of them and was involved in them.there was no error in the jury denial of the limitations defense.
breach of fiduciary duty 
the breach of fiduciary duty charges against scheckenbach rested on alternate theories of breach,including a breach of a formal duty arising from scheckenbach agency relationship or a breach of an informal duty arising from scheckenbach confidential relationship with advocare.the court instructed the jury,
advocare claims that richard scheckenbach breached his fiduciary duty to advocare.specifically,advocare claims that scheckenbach or his companies wrongfully priced and sold raw materials to advocare and to horizon for use in advocare products,in violation of his fiduciary duty.for you to find scheckenbach to be liable to advocare for this claim,you must find 
that scheckenbach owed advocare a fiduciary duty with respect to the transaction s at issue and 
that scheckenbach breached that duty and 
that scheckenbach does not have a valid defense to advocare claim.
the instructions then listed two different types of fiduciary relationships,a formal and an informal fiduciary relationship,and gave instructions as to both.under formal fiduciary relationship,the court stated,
a fiduciary duty may arise from a formal relationship between the parties,or,alternatively,it may arise from an informal relationship.in this case,you are instructed that a formal fiduciary relationship existed between advocare and richard scheckenbach.richard scheckenbach was advocare agent.as such,he owed advocare a fiduciary duty with respect to all matters within the scope of his agency.
an agent in this case scheckenbach has a duty to act solely for the benefit of his principal in this case,advocare in all matters connected with his agency.an agent is free,however,to carry on activities outside the scope of his agency,even if those actions injuriously affect the principal business.
the scope of scheckenbach is,the range and type of matters for which scheckenbach acted as advocare a question of fact to be determined by you,jury advocare bears the burden of proof 
under informal fiduciary relationship,the court then instructed the jury,
in addition,and alternatively,you are instructed that a fiduciary duty may arise informally from a relationship of trust and confidence.a relationship of trust and confidence existed in this case if advocare justifiably placed trust and confidence in scheckenbach to act in advocare best interest.
advocare subjective trust and feelings alone do not justify transforming arm length dealings into a relationship of trust and confidence.in a business transaction,the relationship of trust and confidence must be proved to have existed before and apart from the agreement in existence between the parties.advocare bears the burden of proof to establish this relationship.
scheckenbach moved for jmol,arguing that there was insufficient evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty.scheckenbach argues on appeal that there was no dispute as to the scope of his formal fiduciary duty and that breach was a legal question that should not have been determined by the jury.further,he argues,there was no evidence that his sales of raw materials fell within the limited scope of these duties,urging that we should reverse the jury finding of a breach of fiduciary duty.to the contrary,the extent to which scheckenbach activities with supplier companies fell within his duties to advocare was disputed by the parties the court did not err in leaving that portion of the breach question to the jury.furthermore,there was sufficient evidence for a jury finding that scheckenbach breached his formal fiduciary duties arising under the agency relationship,even if there was no proof of a breach of the informal duty 
scheckenbach conceded that he was an agent of advocare but argued that he had a limited agency than that argued by that the agreement defined and limited those duties.the agreement provided,
this contract is conditioned upon advocare being the exclusive recipient of scheckenbach services in the direct nutritional products industry or scheckenbach not accepting or receiving any gratuities,commissions,or fees from direct suppliers to advocare or manufacturers except for those monies received by scheckenbach from and and advocare confidential treatment of each others sic proprietary and privileged information 
in contesting the sufficiency of the evidence of breach,scheckenbach primarily argues that his agreement with advocare limited his agency relationship and drew the bounds of his fiduciary duties.he points to the fourth paragraph of the agreement,which makes advocare the exclusive recipient of scheckenbach services,and argues that each of these clauses creates and limits a particular fiduciary duty.he also argues that the negotiations leading up to the contract,wherein advocare,at scheckenbach insistence,reduced the limitations on his dealings with suppliers,limited his fiduciary duties.
indeed,under some circumstances,fiduciary duties are limited by contract but the contract or contract negotiations did not so limit scheckenbach duties as to compel the jury to conclude that there was no breach although in the consulting agreement scheckenbach had only promised not to receive fees,commissions,or gratuities from direct suppliers to advocare,there was evidence that scheckenbach supervised the formulation and production of advocare products and thus had control over the raw ingredients comprising those products that scheckenbach formed direct supply companies,some consisting only of a mailbox and scheckenbach home.there was also evidence that he used these companies to sell raw materials to advocare manufacturer,horizon,at prices higher than the prices he paid for the materials and at advocare expense,and he failed to disclose these activities to advocare 
in addition to finding that scheckenbach breached his fiduciary duty to advocare,the jury found that scheckenbach committed fraud against advocare.in his motion for judgment as a matter of law,and here,scheckenbach challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a finding of fraud.we find the evidence sufficient.
at trial,advocare presented evidence of misrepresentations by scheckenbach that it justifiably relied upon,and evidence that scheckenbach formed several supply companies that sold raw materials to horizon.one of advocare former attorneys testified that she sent a letter on august,indicating that advocare was concerned that scheckenbach might be consulting for companies other than advocare and that scheckenbach responded,the assumptions put forth in that letter are both provocative and incorrect.first and foremost,for the last seven years,all of my consulting work has been for advocare.when asked,now,did you know in august of that scheckenbach had for a period of four years another company by the name of transglobal resources,advocare attorney responded,absolutely not and that makes that sentence a lie.when asked,and did you know that he devoted at least some time to transglobal resources ordering materials to sell to advocare for products she responded,i would never in the world have dreamed or imagined it.
advocare also provided evidence that scheckenbach wrote to advocare that,as to owning an interest or earning a fee from a manufacturer or supplier,i can only surmise that you are referring to horizon or since these other manufacturing facilities are basically minimal.let me be very clear.i have no interest in either of these two companies or the others named herein or their possible holding companies or subsidiaries.yet evidence produced at trial showed that scheckenbach worked with horizon and sold substantial quantities of raw materials to horizon.advocare former attorney at trial,when asked whether she believe d that she was getting the assurances from scheckenbach that she was seeking,responded that she did believe them,and believed that they were very clearly stated.
another of advocare attorneys testified,
i had received a report from the washington law firm showing that scheckenbach owned herbasia and fife and taylor,the two suppliers that we were looking into in a july,meeting i first asked scheckenbach i asked him do you own any companies that are selling raw materials,and he said no.and i followed up that question with do you know a company called herbasia.yes.do you own that company yes.is that the only other company you do business through.that all.do you know of a company called fife and taylor yes.he denied it when we asked him,but when we asked him specifically about the name of the company,he would admit it we learned that he owned companies when he had always told us he was doing that we did not know how much he had sold to horizon or what prices he had been marking them up.
as if by way of confession and avoidance,scheckenbach urges that his misrepresentations were obvious and that advocare should have known better than to rely on them.when advocare wrote to scheckenbach indicating its suspicions that he owned interests in some of advocare manufacturers and suppliers,scheckenbach responded that he had no interest in any advocare manufacturers and that beyond that,any shares that i own in any other company,whether it be dupont,intel is my personal financial business.scheckenbach now argues that his reply was exactly the type of red flag that prevents justifiable reliance.we are not persuaded.mere suspicions,followed by denials of those suspicions and a refusal to disclose personal information unrelated to advocare,are not evidence that compelled the jury to conclude that advocare unjustifiably relied on scheckenbach misrepresentations.
the jury returned two punitive damages awards against scheckenbach,each for million one for acting with malice in breaching his fiduciary duty and one for acting with malice in committing fraud.scheckenbach argues that we should reverse the award of punitive damages for fraud because of texas one satisfaction rule urging,
here,advocare could only recover damages under the single theory that would give the greatest relief.this is his breach of fiduciary claim,and the jury awarded only million in punitive damages for that claim.it was error to add another million based on the fraud claim.
although in ratner sioux natural gas we held that the rationale of the one satisfaction rule is usually inapposite to punitive damages,the rule does not stand for the proposition that one theory of liability can support several punitive damages awards.the theory of the case was that scheckenbach had interposed his own businesses into advocare chain of production and lied to advocare about it,simultaneously a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.that by the verdict form,advocare had two bites at the liability apple,fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,does not entitle advocare to two awards of punitive damages for the same course of misdeeds.we affirm only one of the two awards.
scheckenbach argues that advocare presented its damages testimony as a single lump sum figure covering the period.but the first alleged fraudulent misrepresentation was not made until july of.he concludes that the jury could not allocate some of this lump sum figure to the period after that date.he cites to annis county of westchester,a second circuit case,which held,
when i t is not possible to ascertain what portions of the compensatory and punitive damages awards were attributable to claims that were,the damages awards must be vacated 
scheckenbach urges,while this issue can not be fully resolved until the court decides which if any of scheckenbach six statements are,in fact,fraudulent,it is possible that in the end,some of advocare fraud damages may be barred by limitations and some may not.
the jury,in assessing damages for fraud,awarded million in response to question,which stated,what sum of money,if paid now in cash,would fairly and reasonably compensate advocare for the direct damages,if any,that resulted from richard scheckenbach fraud it awarded million in exemplary damages for the conduct involved in defrauding advocare.the jury was also aware of the limitations period.the court instructed the jury that 
under texas law,a party claiming breach of fiduciary duty or fraud must file its lawsuit within four years of the time the party discovers,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,that it has been the victim of breach of fiduciary duty or fraud.this lawsuit was filed on august.accordingly,for scheckenbach to meet his burden of proof for the defense of limitations,he must show by a preponderance of the evidence that before august,advocare knew,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the alleged injury.
one of advocare exhibits showed totals from scheckenbach companies and scheckenbach tax returns from,such as gross receipts and wages and distributions.although the instructions would have been clearer had they indicated that the jury could not base is damages award on conduct before the start of the limitations period,the instructions were not legally flawed,particularly because scheckenbach attorney did not object during the charge conference nor request an instruction making the matter more clear.
accordingly,the judgment is affirmed,except that one of the awards of punitive damages to advocare for scheckenbach fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty is reversed a punitive damage award is rendered in the single amount of.the award of prejudgment interest to horizon is vacated and remanded for recalculation.
this contract had a texas provision.
horizon also filed claims against herbasia corporation,one of scheckenbach companies,but those claims are not at issue here.
advocare also claimed that scheckenbach breached his fiduciary duties to advocare and committed fraud.
the court granted summary judgment for advocare on horizon claim that advocare was guilty of fraud in failing to make the minimum monthly purchase guarantees.horizon did not appeal that ruling.
