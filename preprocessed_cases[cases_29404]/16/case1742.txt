osfi,a louisiana corporation,employed joselito madriaga lim,a philippine resident and citizen,to work aboard the osfi,a vessel whose home port is port vila,vanuatu.the philippine government requires foreign employers or their agents to employ filipino workers through the philippine overseas employment administration poea,a department of the ministry of labor and employment.the employment contracts for seamen incorporate the philippine government standard terms and conditions governing the employment of filipino seafarers on board vessels standard terms.
lim employment contract was executed through the poea and subject to the standard terms.those terms include dispute resolution procedures,which require,inter alia,resolving employment claims through arbitration in the philippines.section of the standard terms states 
in cases of claims and disputes arising from this employment,the parties covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall submit the claim or dispute to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrator or panel of arbitrators.if the parties are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement,the parties may at their option submit the claim or dispute to either the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the national labor relations commission nlrc,pursuant to republic act ra otherwise known as the migrant workers and overseas filipinos act of or to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrators or panel of arbitrators

in its answer,and based on the standard terms arbitration clause,osfi claimed,inter alia,lack of subject matter jurisdiction rule b and improper venue rule b.osfi moved to dismiss,claiming the standard terms require arbitration in the philippines and the convention,as implemented at et as chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,requires district court enforcement of the arbitration clause.both the philippines and the united states are signatories to the convention.
plaintiffs responded that,although our court had held the convention applies to seamen contracts,see francisco stolt achievement mt,cir,cert.denied,d,the decision was in error and the convention should not apply.in the alternative,plaintiffs asserted that the arbitration clause is unenforceable for three reasons.first,arbitration has never been required in seamen wage litigation.second,the arbitration clause is contrary to louisiana public policy against a forum selection clause in an employment contract.an arbitration clause is a subset of a forum selection clause.see scherk,d.and third,the arbitration clause is invalid under the terms of the convention,because plaintiffs flsa claims are rooted in united states law and can not be resolved through foreign arbitration.
the district court denied dismissal,holding the arbitration clause violated louisiana law,which signaled a strong public policy against a forum selection clause in an employment contract and rendered the clause unenforceable.accordingly,the district court stated it did not need to address the other two exceptions advanced by plaintiffs.
osfi moved for rehearing or,in the alternative,for the district court to certify the jurisdiction and venue issues to this court for interlocutory appeal,pursuant to b.the district court chose the latter and offered the following controlling questions for interlocutory appeal whether the convention or the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,article vi,clause,requires enforcement of the arbitration agreement in the employment contract if so,whether there is an exception,based on louisiana selection clause statute.ann.a if the louisiana statute is not preempted,whether it applies to the employment contract and if so,whether plaintiffs agreed to,or ratified,the arbitration clause pursuant to the exception in the louisiana statute.our court granted osfi motion to appeal.
as the text of b indicates,appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals,and is not tied to the particular question s formulated by the district court.yamaha motor calhoun,d emphasis in original.the questions presented in the district court order assist in determining the propriety of the ruling but they fail to include the other two exceptions claimed in district court by plaintiffs,which are also advanced here and which we address.no authority need be cited for the rule that an issue presented in district court,but not ruled on there,may be raised on appeal in support of the ruling being challenged.osfi method of invoking the convention must be addressed first,however.
plaintiffs seek relief because osfi did not request the district court to stay these proceedings and order arbitration.osfi responds that,based on the arbitration clause,it properly moved to dismiss,under rules b lack of subject matter jurisdiction and b improper venue.as noted,foreign arbitration clauses are deemed a subset of foreign forum selection clauses in general.vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d.therefore,analysis of foreign forum selection clauses can be extended to foreign arbitration clauses.id.
our court has noted,but declined to address,the enigmatic question of whether motions to dismiss on the basis of forum selection clauses are properly brought as motions under.b or b haynsworth v.the corporation,cir,cert.denied,d.in any event,our court has treated a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause as properly brought under rule b improper venue.albany ins.almacenadora somex,cir.we have also affirmed,without comment on procedural posture,a district court granting a rule b motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause.mitsui usa,mira,cir.and,other circuits agree that a motion to dismiss based on an arbitration or forum selection clause is proper under rule b.see continental ins.polish,cir affirming rule b dismissal in favor of foreign arbitration lipcon underwriters at lloyd,london,cir,cert.denied,d motion to dismiss based on forum selection clause in international agreement should be brought under rule b argueta banco mexicano,cir rule b motion proper method to invoke forum selection clause frietsch refco,cir same.
although circuits are split on the issue of whether rule b or b is the proper motion for seeking dismissal based on a forum selection or arbitration clause,see wright miller,federal practice procedure,ed,neither side has substantively briefed the merits of the question.because our court has accepted rule b as a proper method for seeking dismissal based on a forum selection clause,we need not decide whether a rule b motion would be appropriate.
claiming a right to trial to determine whether they are required to arbitrate,plaintiffs rely on allowing a party aggrieved by the alleged failure,neglect,or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration to petition district court to direct arbitration.plaintiffs do not explain how this statute applies.because the issue is not adequately briefed,we decline to address it.see united states thames,cir see also fed.a a.
accordingly,we turn to the order under review.we need only address two issues because the convention and the supremacy clause require enforcement of the arbitration clause and there is no exception to that requirement based on any one of the three advanced by plaintiffs,including louisiana statute.
the supremacy clause provides that laws and treaties arising under the constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby const.art.vi,cl.it goes without saying that,upon the united states signing a treaty and congress adopting enabling legislation,the treaty becomes the supreme law of the land,sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican nat.oil,cir.it also goes without saying that whether the supremacy clause and the convention require enforcement of the arbitration clause is a question of law,reviewed de novo,witty delta air lines,cir.
in,congress enacted the convention enabling legislation,convention act.scherk,at.if an international arbitration clause falls under the convention act,the convention requires district courts to order arbitration.sedco,at see also the convention shall be enforced in united states courts.
the convention applies to international arbitration clauses when there is an agreement in writing to arbitrate the dispute,the agreement provides for arbitration in the territory of a convention signatory,the agreement arises out of a commercial legal relationship,and a party to the agreement is not an american citizen.francisco,at emphasis added see also listing same requirements.in francisco,our court considered a filipino seaman employment contract identical to the one at issue and clarified that such contracts arise out of a commercial legal relationship.at.thus,plaintiffs contracts are controlled by the convention the contracts are in writing they require arbitration in the philippines,a signatory to the convention they describe a contractual legal relationship and plaintiffs are not american citizens.plaintiffs seek reconsideration of our court holding in francisco that the convention applies to seamen employment contracts.barring a change of law,i t has long been a rule of this court that no panel of this circuit can overrule a decision previously made by another.legros panther servs.group,cir.
because the united states is a signatory to the convention,and congress enacted enabling legislation,the convention is applicable as federal law in this case.further,unless there is an exception,as discussed below,the convention requires the arbitration clause in plaintiffs employment contracts be honored.
accordingly,we turn to whether there is an exception to the convention mandate that the employment claims in question be arbitrated according to the standard terms.of course,whether a forum selection or arbitration clause is enforceable is a question of law reviewed de novo,mitsui,at.likewise,questions of preemption are reviewed de novo,witty,at.
osfi maintains the standard terms arbitration clause applies without exception to plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs dispute that on three bases.they maintain the clause is unreasonable,and therefore invalid,under the test announced in bremen zapata,d forum selection clause valid unless contravenes strong public policy,because the louisiana statute evinces a strong public policy against arbitration clauses in employment contracts the arbitration clause is invalid because arbitration is not warranted in seamen wage litigation and their flsa claims are not arbitrable,so the convention,by its own terms,does not apply.
unlike the convention,louisiana law prohibits employers use of choice of forum and choice of law clauses in employment contracts 
the provisions of every employment contract or agreement,or provisions thereof,by which any foreign or domestic employer or any other person or entity includes a choice of forum clause or choice of law clause in an employee contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement,or attempts to enforce either a choice of forum clause or choice of law clause in any civil or administrative action involving an employee,shall be null and void 
a.again,the supremacy clause declares that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.emphasis added.where state laws conflict with a treaty,they must bow to the superior federal policy.zschernig miller,d emphasis added.
osfi maintains the convention preempts louisiana law.it analogizes that preemption question to those presented in southland keating,d,and ope international,chet morrison contractors,cir.
southland held of the faa,which declares arbitration clauses in american contracts shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,preempted a california statute forbidding arbitration of disputes arising from interstate contracts between franchisors and franchisees.at.ope international held the faa preempted a louisiana statute forbidding arbitration of contracts for public and private works when one party was located,and the work was done,in louisiana.at.
osfi relies properly on southland and ope.in substance,the convention replicates the federal arbitration act.sedco,at.both statutes apply to employment contracts in general.see circuit city stores,adams,d faa applies to employment contracts other than seamen and transportation workers contracts as exempted by francisco,at convention applies to seamen employment contracts.
southland noted that,in the faa,congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.at.emphasis added.the louisiana statute conflicts directly with the convention mandate to enforce arbitration clauses.applying a straightforward preemption analysis,the convention,as the supreme law of the land,preempts the directly conflicting louisiana statute,unless,as plaintiffs claim,it satisfies an exception to the convention.
according to plaintiffs,the arbitration clause should not be enforced because it is contrary to strong louisiana public policy.the supreme court has held forum selection clauses in international contracts are prima facie valid and should be upheld absent a clear showing of unreasonableness,unjustness,overreaching,or fraud.bremen,at.bremen held a choice of forum clause may be unreasonable when enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.id.at.emphasis added.the convention mirrors this policy concern by allowing a court charged with enforcing an arbitral award to refuse enforcement if t he recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.convention,art.v,b emphasis added.
forum is broadly defined as a court or other judicial body a place of jurisdiction.black law dictionary ed.in performing the instant bremen reasonableness analysis,an underlying issue is which united states or relevant for purposes of the test.as they did in district court,plaintiffs assume louisiana is the relevant forum.the district court agreed,noting that,although plaintiffs raised claims under a federal statute flsa in federal court,they could have brought them in state court.it ruled the fortuity for defendant of plaintiffs electing to bring their claims in federal court should not exempt defendant from louisiana laws intended to apply to employers in this state.lim offshore specialty fabricators,wl.january order denying motions to dismiss emphasis added.
on the other hand,it is quite understandable that the convention and its enabling act imply that the forum at issue is national,rather than local.convention,art.v,a allowing a country to refuse enforcement of an arbitral award if the award violates the country public policy giving federal courts jurisdiction over cases to which the convention applies,regardless of amount in controversy.likewise,the convention envisions the applicable forum to be the signatory country,not individual states within it.see convention,art.xi,a clarifying that the oblig
