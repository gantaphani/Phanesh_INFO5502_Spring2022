bexar county hospital district university health system or uhs sued factory mutual insurance company factory mutual or fm for breach of contract,alleging that fm improperly calculated the deductible applicable to a claim uhs made on its fm property insurance policy.the district court eventually granted fm motion for summary judgment,denied a like motion by uhs,and dismissed uhs action.we affirm.
facts proceedings 
in may,uhs discovered water in its electrical switchgear room and central plant.it determined that its chilled water system was leaking badly.to keep the hospital functioning while it located the source of the leak and made the necessary repairs,uhs rented temporary cooling towers for its air conditioning system.uhs eventually found that a bypass line serving one of its cooling towers in the energy plant had developed a substantial leak.over a period of some days,uhs spent to repair the leak and the machinery it had damaged,plus to rent the temporary water chillers.
at the time the damage occurred,uhs had in place factory mutual global advantage policy the policy,an all risks property insurance policy covering both physical damage and time element business interruption loss.uhs filed separate claims,one for property damage repairs of leak and machinery,and another for time element loss rental expense for cooling towers.the policy required uhs to take all reasonable steps to prevent or minimize time element losses,so the cooling towers rental could not be ascribed to the direct cost of repairing the leaks and the damaged machinery.
fm paid uhs for its property damage loss but only for its time element loss.the property damage payment covered the full cost of repairing the leak and damaged equipment,less a deductible.the time element payment equaled the full costs to rent the temporary cooling towers,less a separate deductible for a time element loss resulting from boiler machinery damage,which fm calculated as,or the value of one day worth of uhs total projected operating revenue.
uhs complained to fm that the appropriate time element value to be used in calculating the particular deductible for that claim should have been the value of its actual time element the rental costs of the temporary cooling towers,as there had been no business interruption as such,thanks to the rented not uhs projected operating revenue.fm stuck to its position,so in march,uhs filed suit in texas state court for declaratory judgment and breach of contract.fm removed the case to the district court,basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship.after filing an agreed stipulation of material facts,both fm and uhs moved for summary judgment,each arguing that its proffered method for calculating the appropriate time element loss deductible was the only reasonable interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the policy.the district court granted fm motion and denied uhs,and dismissed the case.uhs timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment and its interpretation of the insurance policy involved de novo 
contract interpretation 
as this appeal involves a diversity action that turns on contractual interpretation,texas substantive law governs in texas,insurance policies are subject to the same standards of interpretation and construction as are applicable to contracts generally the texas supreme court has specified the methodology for courts to use when interpreting insurance contracts 
the primary concern of a court in construing a written contract is to ascertain the true intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.if a written contract is so worded that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning,then it is not ambiguous.parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity.
if,however,the language of a policy or contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations,it is ambiguous.whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.only where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties interpretation,and admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument 
accordingly,we must first decide whether the policy at issue is ambiguous.
an ambiguity does not arise merely because the parties advance conflicting contractual interpretations a contract is ambiguous only when there is a genuine uncertainty as to which one of two or more meanings is proper.in making that determination,courts must take care not to isolate particular phrases or sentences from their setting,and must consider the contract as a whole,giving effect to all of its provisions so that none is rendered meaningless words used in one sense in one part of the contract should be deemed to have been used in the same sense elsewhere in the contract unless there is a clear indication otherwise if a court determines that the policy is not ambiguous,it may construe the policy provisions as a matter of law.if,however,the court concludes that the policy is ambiguous on the point at issue,susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,it should adopt the interpretation that favors the insured this rule follows from the generally accepted principle that an ambiguous or inconsistent provision of a contract should be construed strictly against the party that drafted it 
relevant policy provisions 
deductibles 
the deductible provisions are found in section of the policy.the parties agree that the controlling provision is found in the boiler and machinery exception to the default policy deductible.this exception specifies that the deductible for a time element loss resulting from boiler and machinery damage will be day equivalent time element,subject to a minimum of.the policy defines day equivalent as 
an amount equivalent to the number of days stated times the daily time element value that would have been earned following the occurrence at the location where the physical damage occurred 
the dispute here centers on the meaning of time element value,which determines the calculation of day equivalent.
value reporting provisions 
section of the policy requires that t he insured will provide the company values by location.the values required to be furnished are property value,stock and supply value,and time element value.the time element values required are those values anticipated for the approximate term of the policy,here one year and the actual time element values for the previous month period.notably,this is the only other place in the policy in which the disputed phrase,time element value appears.
when it negotiated the purchase of the policy,uhs complied with section by submitting to fm a profit and loss statement by location detailing its operating revenues.uhs contends that it was required to provide these operating revenue reports to facilitate fm risk assessment function,and risk assessment was the sole purpose of the value reporting provisions.uhs thus denies that it provided any such information as a basis for computation of a time element deductible in the event of such a claim.none disputes,however,that uhs operating revenue data was the only time element information fm ever sought or uhs ever furnished.
competing interpretations 
factory mutual 
fm interpreted and computed the policy deductible provisions as follows the time element deductible for loss caused by boiler and machinery damage is day equivalent time element day equivalent is defined as 
an amount equivalent to the number of days stated times the daily time element value that would have been earned following the occurrence at the location where the physical damage occurred 
time element value equals the maximum time element risk covered under the policy,here uhs total operating revenue for the term of the policy,one year and the total operating revenue that would have been earned following the occurrence is uhs projected revenue,based on its reported revenue for the three months nearest in time to the date of the occur
