defendants appellants berry plastics corporation and covalence specialty coatings,llc collectively,berry appeal from a jury award of million in damages to plaintiff appellee packgen resulting from the failure of material berry had supplied to packgen.berry contends that the district court erred by denying berry motion to exclude packgen damages expert,allowing packgen employees to testify concerning potential packgen customers intent to purchase packgen new product,and failing to correct these errors by denying berry motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or to alter or amend the judgment.we affirm.
background 
factual background 
packgen manufactures a polypropylene intermediate bulk container used to transport and store catalyst,a hazardous and volatile chemical agent used to refine crude oil.no other company manufactures similar polypropylene containers,but refineries also lease metal flow bins to transport and store catalyst.in the mid,packgen redesigned its bulk containers.it made the redesigned container,called the cougar,out of a laminated fabric.berry supplied the laminated fabric and represented that it could meet packgen quality standards.
as part of the redesign,packgen worked with cri,a catalyst manufacturer and its largest customer at the time,to modify the new cougar to meet cri specialized requirements.after a lengthy process,cri began purchasing cougars in october of.from october to march,cri purchased cougars for nearly million,and it placed an order for cougars to be delivered in april.
packgen also began marketing the cougar to north american refineries in,focusing on refineries where cri supplied catalyst containers.those refineries were likely customers because they would experience the cougars cri used,and they were all long distances from their catalyst suppliers,so they would save significant transport costs using the lighter,more compact cougar rather than flow bins.packgen sales manager testified that at all refineries had told her that they were going to be purchasing the c ougars on their next turnaround cycle.at ten of the refineries had also told packgen president that they were willing to purchase and try packgen containers.
on april,one of the cougars cri had purchased split open while being moved.over the next weeks,packgen learned that other cougars had also failed,in some cases causing the catalyst inside to combust,and it began to investigate.packgen determined that the cougar had failed because some of the laminated fabric supplied by berry was faulty,and that it had sold cri approximately two thousand cougars made from the faulty laminated fabric.following the incident,cri cancelled its order of cougars for the month of april,and it never ordered another cougar.in addition,the refineries did not order cougars as packgen had anticipated.
procedural history 
packgen filed suit against berry in maine superior court,alleging breach of contract,breach of implied and express warranties,and negligence.berry removed the case to the united states district court for the district of maine.
packgen designated mark filler,a certified public accountant and certified valuation analyst,as an expert witness on damages.berry moved to exclude filler opinions and testimony under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,and the district court held a daubert hearing.on september,the district court issued a order denying berry motion to exclude.it concluded that a variety of facts supported filler projections of packgen lost profits from cri and the refineries,his assumption that packgen had a chance each year of selling cougars to each of the refineries,and his assumption that the refineries did not buy cougars only because of the product failure,and it determined that filler did not improperly combine forecasting methodologies from both business valuation and lost profits models.
prior to trial,berry filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude testimony by packgen employees concerning cri and the refineries intent to purchase cougars and why they decided not to make those purchases.the district court reserved ruling on the motion for trial.at trial,the district court ruled that packgen president could testify as to what a at cri told him about what cri intent to purchase cougars was but not why cri was ceasing business.the district court applied its ruling to subsequent testimony,allowing packgen president and sales manager to testify that at the refineries had expressed their intent to purchase cougars but not about why those refineries subsequently did not make purchases.
after a trial,on november,the jury returned a verdict against berry and awarded in damages to packgen.on january,the district court denied berry motion for judgment as a matter of law,for a new trial,or to alter or amend the judgment the district court entered judgment against berry on march,and berry timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
berry argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by admitting filler testimony regarding packgen lost profits from the refineries because he did not establish that the cougar failures caused packgen any lost profits from the refineries,no facts supported his loss period,and no facts supported his odds of selling cougars to the refineries.berry further argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting filler testimony regarding damages attributable to lost business from cri because no facts supported his assumption that cri would purchase units per month,no facts supported his loss period,and his analysis improperly combined and methodologies.in addition,berry asserts that the district court erred by allowing packgen employees to testify about cri and the refineries stated intent to purchase cougars,because their testimony relied on hearsay,and that it erred by denying berry motion for judgment as a matter of law,for a new trial,or to alter or amend the judgment.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting filler testimony 
a district court must ensur e that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert,at.to determine whether testimony is sufficiently reliable berry does not challenge the testimony relevance a district court must determine whether it is based on sufficient facts or data,was the product of reliable principles and methods,and whether the expert reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.fed.evid.exactly what is involved in reliability must be tied to the facts of a particular case.milward acuity specialty prods,cir.quoting beaudette louisville ladder,cir.so long as an expert scientific testimony rests upon good grounds,based on what is known,it should be tested by the adversarial process,rather than excluded for fear that jurors will not be able to handle the scientific complexities.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted quoting daubert,at.
we review a district court decision to admit an expert testimony for abuse of discretion,unless the district court altogether abdicate d its role under daubert.smith jenkins,cir.there is no plausible argument that the district court abdicated its role here,no matter how many times berry briefs repeat the word abdicate or a variant the district court held a daubert hearing and issued a page opinion addressing berry arguments and explaining the reasons filler testimony had sufficient support.our review is only for abuse of discretion.
filler testimony concerning the thirty seven refineries 
filler testified that he used simulation software to calculate packgen likely lost profits from sales of cougars to the refineries over a period beginning in april and ending in april.filler model assumed that each year packgen had a one in ten chance of selling cougars to each refinery.once a refinery began buying cougars,packgen w ould continue to sell cougars to that refinery until the end of the period.if packgen had not yet sold to a particular refinery,the model assumed packgen would try one more time.the model also subtracted actual mitigating sales to these refineries in the first four years of the period which were known and expected mitigating sales for the remaining six years.this yielded net lost profits of the difference between packgen likely net profits if the material that berry supplied had not been defective,and its likely net profits after the cougars failed 
a.there was sufficient evidence of causation to support filler testimony 
berry first argues that filler should have conducted a market survey to determine which refineries would actually have purchased cougars,rather than assuming that the refineries would have purchased cougars.berry also asserts that filler was required to account for other reasons cougars failed,improper exposure to freezing and thawing,mishandling,and punctures from a forklift.there was adequate evidence,however,that the refineries would purchase cougars,including testimony that those refineries would see substantial savings by using the cougars,that the refineries had expressed an intent to purchase cougars,and that those refineries would see cri using the cougars and be persuaded to try them.
moreover,filler was not required to do a market survey,as berry suggests.the existence of other methods of gathering facts does not mean that the facts he relied on were insufficient.see fed.evid.advisory committee note to amendment the amendment is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing principles or methods.filler based his calculations on facts meeting the minimum standards of relevance and reliability.microsoft,fed.cir.citing fed.evid.his testimony alone did not have to establish the validity of a central,disputed factual claim that the defective cougars caused the refineries to avoid buying cougars to have a factual basis and be admissible.int l adhesive coating bolton emerson int l,cir.berry was free to argue to the jury that filler failure to conduct a survey made his opinion less persuasive but that failure did not make his opinion inadmissible.
similarly,the fact that a few cougars failed for reasons in addition to berry defective product does not make filler testimony unreliable.an expert should adequately account for obvious alternative explanations.fed.evid.advisory committee note to amendments citing claar burlington,cir.filler did that here,finding that there w ere no social,environment al,or legal reasons why all of a sudden cri would stop buying cougars,and that the competitive market had not changed.the minor incidents of cougar failures that berry cites are very different in both type and impact from shipping two thousand cougars,and filler was not required to eliminate every other possible cause.ambrosini labarraque,cir.the fact that several possible causes might remain uneliminated only goes to the accuracy of the conclusion,not the soundness of the methodology.see also currier united techs,cir.holding that damages expert fail ure to take into account differences in situations between various employees was a matter of weight rather than admissibility cummings standard register,cir.affirming admission of damages expert testimony because,although using other variables would have resulted in a lower,and perhaps more accurate,figure whatever shortcomings existed in the expert calculations went to the weight,not the admissibility,of the testimony.
sufficient facts supported filler ten year loss period 
filler model calculated losses for a period.berry contends that the only support for this period is a conversation filler had with packgen president.filler did discuss a period with packgen president,determining that it would take five years for the negative effects of the cougar failures to wear off and another five years for sales to recover fully to where they would have been absent the failures.those discussions do provide some support for filler opinion.see mountain platform tennis,sherwin williams,cir.holding that testimony from plaintiff employees that it would take three years to rebuild the business supported an award of future lost profits.
filler period was also supported by other facts.filler considered the opinion of packgen catalyst expert that cougars would save the refineries substantial costs,packgen had an excellent market presence,and catalyst use would increase until the end of the period.in addition,packgen was the only supplier of intermediate bulk containers,and there were few other options for the refineries,suggesting that few if any other competitors would enter the market.
importantly,filler was not projecting market conditions for a full ten years.his loss period began when the cougars failed in,but the daubert hearing took place six years later.in those six years,no major new competitors entered the catalyst container market,and cougar sales to the refineries had begun to recover and exceed ed filler original projections.actual profits remained lower than the profits filler projected if berry material had not failed,however.accordingly,it was reasonable to assume that packgen lost profits would continue into the future,perhaps at least four more years.
taken as a whole,the evidence was more than sufficient to support filler loss period.
sufficient facts supported filler assumption that one refinery in ten would begin buying cougars each year 
filler model included an assumption that each year ten percent of the refineries not yet purchasing cougars would begin to do so.berry characterizes filler odds as untethered to any facts or data and again asserts that filler should have conducted a market survey.
filler relied on multiple facts in reaching his conclusion,including that the refineries would see cri using cougars,that cougars could provide substantial cost savings to the refineries,and the refineries expressed interest in cougars.filler also discussed the likely success rate with packgen personnel,who thought packgen success rate with the refineries would be a lot higher than ten percent.filler did not agree with packgen estimates,however,because packgen personnel had no evidence to support their estimates,and filler understood that there was a lot of inertia in the refinery market.
there are certainly sufficient facts to support an inference that packgen would make some sales to the refineries.the issue is whether those facts provided the minimal basis necessary to support filler assumption that one in ten refineries would begin purchasing cougars each year and allow him to present his calculations to the jury.in allowing filler to testify,the district court pointed to those facts and recognized that filler had rejected packgen much higher estimated success rate.the district court also rejected berry suggestion that filler was required to conduct a market survey,finding that berry could argue to the jury that filler reliance on packgen list of refineries made his opinion unpersuasive.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.an expert methodology must be consistent with standards of the expert profession.sms.maint.servs.digital equip,cir.experts may,however,make reasonable assumptions that are consistent with the evidence available to them.see cummings,at affirming the district court decision to allow a damages expert to testify where the expert assumptions were those made by similar experts with some frequency.
that is what filler did.when pressed on,filler admitted that t here is no empirical data on what percentage of the refineries would purchase cougars.the odds,however,produced results that filler thought were reasonable because the units sold in year ten were comparable to packgen sales to cri an existing customer before the cougars began to fail and produced a market penetration by year ten.
packgen points to facts suggesting that filler assumptions were,in fact,conservative packgen regional sales manager testified that,based on her discussions with the refineries,she expected to ninety percent of them to order cougars.in addition,packgen personnel told filler that they expected a sales rate that was a lot higher than the rate he used.berry is really challenging filler choice of a sales rate,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that that is an argument properly made to the jury.
berry other arguments concerning the refineries are not persuasive.
filler testimony concerning cri 
filler used a deterministic model which does not account for future contingencies to calculate packgen damages attributable to business lost from cri.he assumed that what packgen was selling to cri in the period prior to the cougar failures would have continued.this represented the period in which cri purchased the cougars.the average monthly sales for that period were cougars per month,and filler projected that average out for ten years.
berry argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting filler opinion because there was no factual support for the loss period filler used,he had no objective evidence that cri would continue to purchase cougars at the same rate it had in the first six months,and filler combined and methodologies,creating an untested,reviewed model.
berry argument about the loss period with respect to cri fails for the same reasons described above with respect to the refineries.there was sufficient evidence that the market was unlikely to change over ten years,and it did not,in fact,change in the six years following the accident and prior to the daubert hearing.
there was also sufficient evidence to support filler assumption that cri would continue to purchase cougars in at least the same quantities as it had in the six months prior to the cougar failures.cri had dedicated considerable effort to customizing the cougars for its needs,indicating that it found them useful and was likely to continue to purchase them.in addition,filler relied on substantial evidence that the market for catalyst containers was unlikely to change dramatically and that there were no other suppliers of intermediate bulk containers.it is common practice to estimate lost future profits by examining profits earned in the comparable past.atlas truck leasing,first nh banks,cir.that is precisely what filler did here.additional data would have been helpful,but berry was able to make that argument to the jury.berry contention that filler should have considered sales dating back to is misplaced.sales prior to the period were of a different product that had not been specifically tailored to cri needs,and so did not represent the comparable past.id.
berry assertion that filler improperly comingl ed and methodologies also fails.berry relies entirely on filler testimony comparing a lost profits calculation to the valu ation of a business that was destroyed using an income approach.berry nowhere ties this to filler actual calculations,however,to explain how they were flawed or inappropriate.filler explained in great detail how he calculated packgen lost profits using its likely sales to cri,prices,production and capital costs,and other expenses.that testimony,and the exhibits to filler report,make clear that he calculated lost profits for the period,and his references to business valuations were merely an explanatory analogy that did not affect the admissibility of filler opinions.
we find no error in the admission of filler testimony concerning cri.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting testimony concerning the refineries intent to purchase cougars 
the district court allowed packgen president and its sales manager to testify that at the refineries had told them,prior to the cougar failures,that they would purchase cougars the next time they needed catalyst containers over berry objection.the district court determined that the statements,although hearsay,were admissible as the refineries state of mind under fed.evid.
we review rulings admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion.shervin partners healthcare,cir.rule allows the admission of any statement of the declarant state of mind such as motive,intent,or plan.to be admissible under this exception,a declaration,among other things,must mirror a state of mind,which,in light of all the circumstances,including proximity in time,is reasonably likely to have been the same condition existing at the material time.colasanto life ins.of,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.because disputes over whether particular statements come within a exception are fact sensitive,the trial court is in the best position to resolve them.united states rivera hernández,cir.quoting colasanto,at.
statements by a customer or employee may be admissible under rule to show intent or motive.see catalan gmac mortg,cir.callahan,cir.upholding the admission of employees testimony that customers told them that they no longer shopped at the plaintiffs stores because of the defendant operations.in catalan,a plaintiff testified that a loan officer told her that the plaintiffs loan applications would not be approved until their foreclosure was removed.at.rule applied because the loan officer was speaking during the employment relationship concerning matters within the scope of her employment,and so her statement describ ed the bank collective intentions.id.at.here,each statement by a refinery reflected that refinery collective intention to purchase cougars the next time the refinery needed catalyst containers.
although packgen president and sales manager both attributed the refineries statements of intent to,berry contends that t his is not sufficient because the were not specifically named but the cases berry cites do not compel that conclusion.allen sybase,is inapposite because there,the testimony was impermissibly offered to prove the witness state of mind,rather than the declarants,cir.the testimony in smith fiberglass,ameron,was excluded because the declarant was identified only as a gentleman who stopped by a tradeshow booth,without describing who he was,where he worked,or whether he had authority for a potential customer,cir.here,packgen witnesses knew the declarants and testified that all declarants were at their respective refineries.
berry also maintains that there was an insufficient temporal connection between the refineries intent to purchase and their conversations with packgen president and sales manager because the refineries intended to purchase cougars during their next cycle,and refineries catalyst cycles could vary from six months to two years.as berry own cases explain,however,rule requires contemporaneity between the event that gives rise to the state of mind or intention and the declarant expression of that state of mind or intention.amerisource rxusa int l,cv jma,wl,at,metro.enter.united techs.int l,cv jba,wl,at,a statement must be contemporaneous with the mental state and it must be timely such that the declarant had no time to fabricate.here,berry argues only that the refineries expected purchase date was not contemporaneous to the statements,not their state of mind.that the refineries would actually purchase at a later date,however,does not mean that their statements of intent were not contemporaneous with their mental state.
the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting the hearsay testimony under rule.
berry post judgment motion 
berry arguments in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or to alter or amend the judgment rely entirely on its claims that the district court should have excluded filler testimony and the hearsay testimony concerning the refineries.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that testimony,and the evidence at trial was the same as that at the daubert hearing,it did not err by denying berry motion.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm district court judgment.
the trial judge was not the same as the judge who held the daubert hearing.
filler submitted his expert report in,but his loss period ran through.in estimating packgen sales following the cougar failures,he therefore used four years of actual sales data and projected the remaining six years.
berry did question filler basis for assuming that berry defective material caused refineries not to purchase cougars,but it chose not to conduct a market survey of its own and use the results to impeach filler testimony.
although filler specifically mentioned only cri,the question was not specific to cri,and
