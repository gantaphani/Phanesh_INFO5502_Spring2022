this case arises out of a dispute over whether employees divested in connection with the merger between mobil corporation and exxon corporation are entitled to severance benefits.in preparation for the merger,mobil implemented an enhanced plan the cic plan.
plaintiffs joe hooven,et,are former mobil corporation employees whose employment with the merged exxon mobil corporation was terminated when the division for which they worked was divested to tosco corporation.plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to benefits under the terms of a summary plan description the initial spd that mobil distributed to employees following the announcement of the merger.they sued defendants exxon mobil corporation and the mobil corporation employee severance plan together,exxon mobil under the civil enforcement provision of the employee retirement income security act of,asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty,equitable estoppel,procedural and reporting violations and federal common law breach of contract.
after a bench trial,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting judgment in favor of exxon mobil on the fiduciary duty,equitable estoppel and procedural and reporting claims.however,the district court agreed with plaintiffs that the initial spd established a unilateral contract that obligated exxon mobil to provide them with severance benefits when it terminated their employment following the merger.accordingly,it entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim and ordered exxon mobil to provide plaintiffs with severance benefits under the terms of the initial spd.exxon mobil appeals this portion of the district court order.
we disagree with the district court characterization of the initial spd as a unilateral contract the terms of which became fixed as the employees performed.as we will explain,the starting point for plaintiffs claim is erisa,not the common law of contracts.under this framework,plaintiffs rights to benefits under the initial spd never became due.because the plan documents that were in effect when plaintiffs claim to benefits would have accrued clearly establish that they are ineligible for severance,we will reverse and remand with instructions for the district court to enter judgment for exxon mobil 
a.the cic plan and spd 
exxon and mobil began merger discussions in june of.in september,in anticipation of a possible merger with exxon,mobil board of directors revoked the company existing severance plan and implemented the cic plan.the cic plan provided that employees in salary groups and below,together classified as tier employees,were not eligible for severance benefits if their business unit or activity was divested after the merger and they were offered comparable employment by the acquiring entity.plaintiffs were all tier employees.hooven exxon mobil,wl,at.
after the boards of directors of exxon and mobil formally approved the merger,mobil prepared and mailed the initial spd to its employees.the initial spd did not allude to the specific of divested employees,or even mention divestiture the district court found that the initial spd failed to advise plaintiffs that they would be ineligible for severance in the event of a divestiture.id.at.however,the initial spd cautioned that it was merely a summary of the plan and does not replace the official plan documents,which govern in all cases.id.at.see also id.if the plan description in this handbook does not agree with the plan text,the plan text will govern.it also stated that,although mobil reserved the right to modify,suspend,or terminate benefits at any time for any reason,the cic plan may not be terminated or modified while a change of control is pending,or within s ix months following a potential change in control,or t wo years following a change in control.id.at.
b.the merger and divestiture 
on november,the federal trade commission approved the mobil exxon merger,subject to divestitures of various mobil assets and other conditions.exxon mobil was created on december.also on december,mobil agreed to sell its marketing division,in which plaintiffs worked,to tosco corporation.tosco agreed to offer jobs with comparable or improved salaries and benefits to all of mobil marketing employees.id.at.
mobil announced the divestiture of its marketing division on december.at an employee meeting that day,mobil management discussed the divestiture and explained that all affected employees would be offered employment with tosco.at the same time,management advised tier employees that they would not be entitled to severance benefits because they had been divested and would receive comparable employment offers.in subsequent meetings,plaintiffs expressed surprise that they would not be offered severance benefits and complained that mobil had changed the terms of the cic plan.mobil management responded by distributing copies of relevant questions and answers from mobil internal website and the divestiture provision of the actual cic plan,which clearly established plaintiffs.id.at.
in february of,mobil distributed a notice of errata in the spd,which acknowledged that the initial spd had omitted the divestiture provision and clarified the conditions for eligibility for benefits under the cic plan,as follows 
the following text was omitted from the mobil corporation employee severance plan summary for employees in salary groups and below,distributed to all employees in those salary groups in august.please keep this with your summary for future reference.

you are no longer employed by the company or an affiliate due to a divestiture of any facility or sale or outsourcing of any business and are offered comparable employment by the purchaser or successor of such facility or business,regardless of whether you accept or reject the employment.
plaintiffs employment with mobil was officially terminated between march and may of.the district court found that each plaintiff was offered employment with tosco on terms comparable to his or her employment with mobil.after the divestiture,plaintiffs received the same salaries and benefits,and generally reported to the same supervisors,as they had before the divestiture.according to the district court,
no plaintiff who accepted a position with tosco missed any work between the date he or she left mobil and the date he or she began working for tosco.moreover,there was no break in any plaintiffs sic health care coverage from the date he or she left mobil until he or she started at tosco.

c.the district court opinion 
in their complaint,plaintiffs had asserted erisa claims for breach of fiduciary duty,equitable estoppel and procedural and reporting violations,as well as a federal common law breach of contract claim,as bases for the recovery of severance benefits the district court conducted an bench trial.thereafter,the district court issued a memorandum opinion granting relief based on a breach of contract,but denying plaintiffs erisa claims.
specifically,the district court determined that plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claim failed because there was no evidence that plaintiffs had detrimentally relied on the initial spd.id.at.detrimental reliance on a material misrepresentation made by the defendant is a necessary element of an erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim.see daniels thomas betts,cir.however,the district court concluded that plaintiffs continued to work for mobil after the merger was announced for the opportunity to work for exxon to collect enhanced severance benefits.hooven,wl,at.moreover,
n o plaintiff proved that he or she did anything in reliance upon the understanding that he or she would receive enhanced severance benefits in the event of a divestiture.no plaintiff turned down any specific job offer in reliance on the belief that he or she would receive severance benefits in the event of a divestiture.
plaintiffs equitable estoppel and reporting and disclosure violation claims failed for the additional reason that plaintiffs had failed to establish extraordinary circumstances,which generally involve acts of bad faith on the part of the employer,attempts to actively conceal a significant change in the plan,or commission of fraud.jordan fed.express,cir.the district court concluded that mobil failure to include the divestiture provision in the spd amounted to inartful drafting,not fraud or active concealment.hooven,wl,at.the district court noted that plaintiffs had not asserted a claim for recovery of benefits under erisa section a b see supra,but ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to severance benefits on their federal common law breach of contract theory.the district court first held that the cic plan was an offer of a unilateral contract that plaintiffs then accepted by continuing to work for mobil and,later,exxon mobil.id.at.as such,the terms of the plan or offer,as communicated to plaintiffs through the initial spd,became fixed as plaintiffs performed.id.quoting kemmerer ici americas,cir citing amatuzio gandalf.next,the district court determined that the terms of the initial spd differed from the terms of the cic plan,and that,under our decision in burstein retirement account plan for employees of allegheny health education research foundation,cir,the terms of the spd would control,hooven,wl,at.
thus,the district court reasoned,when plaintiffs learned,on december,that their division would be divested,their rights to severance as set forth in the initial spd had accrued.in these circumstances,it concluded,by virtue of plaintiffs performance on the unilateral contract,the court must enforce defendants corresponding obligation.id.at.
the district court march memorandum opinion and order became final on september,when the district court denied exxon mobil motion to amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law and to alter or amend the judgment.exxon mobil appealed the march and september orders.although plaintiffs originally the district court order as to the fiduciary duty,equitable estoppel and erisa reporting and disclosure claims,we dismissed the pursuant to a joint stipulation of the parties on january,in accordance with fed.b.thus,we limit our review to the portion of the district court opinion and order entering judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim and ordering exxon mobil to pay plaintiffs severance benefits under the terms of the initial spd.
the district court exercised federal question jurisdiction,pursuant to,over plaintiffs erisa and federal common law claims.our jurisdiction over this appeal from the district court final judgment arises under.
on appeal from a judgment entered after a trial,we review findings of fact for clear error.a,and conclusions of law de novo,henglein colt indus.operating,cir.because the primary issue on appeal is the district court analysis of the legal effect of the spd and initial cic plan,we will review its conclusions de novo.
it is one thing to acknowledge that contract principles apply in erisa cases.clearly,they do.generally,breach of contract principles,applied as a matter of federal law,govern claims for benefits due under an erisa plan.kemmerer ici americas,cir.however,it is quite another to say that an employee severance benefit can be grounded in,and enforceable based on,a unilateral contract outside of erisa remedial scheme.although this approach is intuitively appealing,and seemingly appropriate in this complex area,we conclude that it is inconsistent with the basic framework of erisa and,therefore,can not be.
the district court,addressing this issue of first impression,conducted a thoughtful analysis and proposed a reasonable solution.however,upon further review,we disagree with two aspects of its reasoning 
first,its determination that plaintiffs rights arose by virtue of a unilateral contract whereby their rights to severance somehow became fixed before plaintiffs employment was terminated,and 
second,its conclusion that,based upon burstein,the initial spd governed plaintiffs rights in this factual setting.
we begin with a fundamental premise every claim for relief involving an erisa plan must be analyzed within the framework of erisa.the district court found,and the parties agree,that the cic plan is an employee welfare benefit plan covered by erisa.hooven,wl,at citing.erisa is a comprehensive statute for the regulation of employee benefit plans,aetna health davila,d it is intended to occupy fully the field of employee benefit plans,reichelt emhart,cir 
the district court found that plaintiffs claim was not based on erisa,but nevertheless allowed it as arising out of a unilateral contract,whereby mobil obligation became fixed when plaintiffs accepted the cic plan by continuing to work for mobil up until and after the merger.unfortunately for plaintiffs,this construct just does not fit within the erisa structure.erisa requires that any contractually accrued rights be discernible from the written terms of the formal erisa plan documents themselves.carr first nationwide bank.although we occasionally employ unilateral contract concepts in erisa cases,we do so only where the asserted unilateral contract is based on the explicit promises in the erisa plan documents themselves.id.at.unilateral contract principles may not operate to create causes of action for plan benefits.
our observation in this regard is consistent with the case law on this issue.in reichelt emhart corporation,plaintiffs argued that their employer informal prior practice of paying severance to any employee who was involuntarily terminated created a unilateral contract that the employer could not amend or terminate by adopting formal severance plans.at.the second circuit court of appeals disagreed,concluding that plan documents,not prior practice,governed the plaintiffs rights to severance,see id.at,and that erisa preempts civil actions against employers for severance pay predicated on contract principles,id.at citing gilbert burlington,cir 
other courts of appeals have similarly refused to allow erisa plaintiffs to use unilateral contract rules as a basis to recover benefits promised in an employee welfare benefit plan where the particular erisa plan documents in question did not provide a basis for vesting or accrual of the claimed benefits.carr.at.see alday container of,cir rejecting plaintiff claim that benefit plan created unilateral contract because plan documents unambiguously provided that employer could terminate or modify the plan musto am,cir holding that plan documents that made perfectly clear that no immutable insurance benefits can be said to vest upon retirement defeated plaintiffs unilateral contract claims moore metro.life ins,cir stating that plaintiffs theory that various representations of the employer and actions of the employees in accepting those representations by remaining with the company gave rise to an contract would undermine erisa framework,as plan documents and the spds exclusively govern an employer obligations under erisa plans.
apparently recognizing that they can not maintain a common law claim outside of erisa,plaintiffs contend on appeal that their right to relief arises out of erisa section a b,a b.they assert,further,that whatever title they may have affixed to their claim to enforce the conflicting terms of the initial spd in their complaint,we must construe it to include a claim under erisa section a b in accordance with the liberal pleading standards of the federal rules of civil procedure.see appellees br.citing.a.we need not address this issue,or decide whether plaintiffs repeated disavowals of reliance on section a b,see hooven,wl,at,preclude them from taking a different position here,as we conclude that,even under section a b,plaintiffs are not entitled to relief.
a plaintiff seeking to recover under section a b must demonstrate that the benefits are actually due that is,he or she must have a right to benefits that is legally enforceable against the plan.see a b a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.emphasis added.benefits must have vested in order to be legally due.
