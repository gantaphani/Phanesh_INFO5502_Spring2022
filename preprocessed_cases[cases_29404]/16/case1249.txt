from to,covol fuels,llc covol and pinnacle mining,llc pinnacle were parties to a business agreement wherein covol conducted coal fines recovery operations at pinnacle mine in wyoming county,west virginia the pinnacle mine.after it became economically unfeasible for covol to continue those recovery operations,it initiated this civil action in the southern district of west virginia,alleging claims for breach of contract,tort,and unjust enrichment.pinnacle moved for summary judgment,which was awarded as to all claims.see covol fuels,llc pinnacle mining,llc,d the opinion covol has appealed the district court award of summary judgment on its contract and tort claims.as explained below,there are genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved with respect to covol breach of contract claim.on the other hand,we agree with the opinion that covol tort claims are barred by the gist of the action doctrine.we therefore affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
the pinnacle mine includes several stages of operations through which coal is recovered,beginning with mining coal from the pocahontas number seam that extracted material goes through pinnacle wash or prep plant the wash plant,which strips coal from waste the refuse material.pinnacle then pumps the refuse material through a slurry line and into its nearby smith branch impoundment the impoundment.
the impoundment is a,pond created by a dam on the downstream side of the impoundment,on the smith branch of pinnacle creek,near pineville,west virginia.it measures feet deep at the greatest depth,runs nearly a mile in length,and is between and feet across.the refuse material settles into the impoundment,which is filled with water.pinnacle is able to pump water out of the impoundment and into a toe pond downstream.from there,the water may either be pumped into an underground reservoir and then back into pinnacle wash plant or released,where it flows into pinnacle creek,the guyandotte river,and,eventually,to the ohio river,the mississippi river,and the gulf of mexico.
the refuse material contains coal coal fines not captured by the wash plant.if refuse material is lifted from the impoundment,it can be processed to extract those coal fines,which can be sold for various industrial purposes in october,beard pinnacle,llc beard initiated coal fines recovery operations at the pinnacle mine,wherein it dredged the impoundment for refuse material,which it processed at an adjacent facility the processing facility.
in february,covol executed a series of contracts with various pinnacle affiliates,whereby covol took over beard operations the principal contract at issue is the coal purchase and refuse recovery agreement the agreement the agreement a fully integrated contract was executed on february,and imposed a term,with the option for the parties to mutually agree to renew for additional terms.covol was authorized to unilaterally terminate the contract under section of the agreement if its operations became economically unfeasible.the agreement designates that it shall be governed by west virginia law.see agreement.
pursuant to the agreement,covol agreed to purchase and process all or part of the refuse material located in the impoundment,and to handle and process that material in such a way which does not interfere with pinnacle mining operations.see agreement.pinnacle disclaimed any representation or warranty as to the character or quality or amount of the refuse material covol removes or receives.id.pursuant to section of the agreement,pinnacle was required to provide covol with an area near the impoundment where covol could install and maintain its equipment ingress and egress across pinnacle property and any reasonably needed for covol to transport the refuse material from the impoundment to the processing facility.two provisions of the agreement sections and imposed contractual duties relating to applicable laws.section required covol and pinnacle,in performing their obligations under the agreement,to comply in all respects with and undertake all responsibilities under applicable state and federal laws relatedly,section required the parties to obtain and maintain any necessary permits or licenses 
the agreement provided for both pinnacle and covol to profit from the recovered coal fines.sections and set out that covol would sample and test the recovered coal fines to determine their quality.depending on the levels of ash and moisture,the coal fines would be categorized as either met coal or steam coal.see agreement.met coal which contains lower ash and moisture content and is therefore more valuable would be purchased by an affiliate of pinnacle,while pinnacle had an option but no obligation to purchase steam coal.see id.
covol paid million to purchase the processing facility,and then immediately spent another million renovating it.covol coal fines recovery operations were under way by the summer of.a number of issues and events arose in the following years that ultimately made it economically unfeasible for covol to continue in the business.covol ceased its operations at the pinnacle mine in.
the biggest obstacle covol faced related to the water level of the impoundment.to extract the refuse material,covol utilized a dredge machine with a mechanical arm that dipped into the water and dragged refuse material out of the impoundment.the mechanical arm was feet long,meaning that the dredge could only reach the top feet of water.covol requested several times that pinnacle adjust the water level so that covol dredge could capture refuse material located deeper in the impoundment.pinnacle,however,declined to do so.moreover,in,pinnacle adopted a new protocol that prevented it from pumping water out of the impoundment and lowering the water level the water management plan without those adjustments to the water level,covol was able to extract only a portion of the refuse material.
throughout covol coal fines recovery operations under the agreement,the parties were subject to mine plans required by the federal mine safety and health administration the msha,see,and operating permits required by the west virginia department of environmental protection the wvdep,see to.as of,a mine plan was in effect that had been submitted in and approved prior to beard opening the processing facility the beard mine plan.covol operated under that plan from until august,when the first two phases of a modified mine plan the modified mine plan were approved by both the msha and the wvdep during the parties relationship under the agreement,an approved mine plan required that any mining of the impoundment be performed concomitant with an incremental lowering of the water level 
beyond the problems covol encountered in accessing the refuse material located deeper than feet below the surface of the impoundment,it also faced a decline in the quality of coal fines.when covol began its operations at the pinnacle mine,pinnacle wash plant was relatively inefficient,meaning that it left a high level of coal in the refuse material.that remaining coal was of good quality in terms of ash and moisture content.covol,then,benefited from the wash plant inefficiency on the front end because it could recover that coal on the back end.during the negotiations leading up to the agreement,pinnacle was aware that the wash plant was inefficient and outdated,though it did not inform covol of any plans to update the wash plant.in fact,pinnacle did not approve that upgrade until.it subsequently notified covol of those plans in july.pinnacle completed its upgrades to the wash plant in.
in the face of those obstacles to its coal fines recovery operations,covol attempted to maximize the areas of the impoundment that could be mined.initially,covol was restricted as to what portions of the impoundment its dredge could reach under the beard mine plan.once the modified mine plan was approved,covol invested million to excavate spoil material from the banks of the impoundment,giving covol new access to millions of tons of coal fines the spoil removal project.that expenditure was properly approved in october and the project was completed in.covol realized no benefit from the spoil removal project,however,because its coal fines recovery operations had become economically unfeasible as a result of the static water level of the impoundment.therefore,in,covol was soliciting offers to sell its business.
covol filed this civil action against pinnacle in the southern district of west virginia on august,alleging four causes of action.first,covol charged pinnacle with breaching the agreement,maintaining that pinnacle had violated its obligations under both the express terms of the agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.covol claimed damages including lost profits from its share of more than million worth of coal.second,covol asserted a tort claim for fraudulent concealment,alleging that pinnacle hid its intentions to renovate the wash plant and to implement the water management plan while covol was spending millions of dollars to renovate the processing facility and undergo the spoil removal project.third,covol asserted another tort claim for negligent misrepresentation,predicated on the theory that pinnacle had breached its duty to provide covol with material information by failing to disclose its plans relating to the wash plant and water management plan.fourth,covol alleged an unjust enrichment claim stemming from the monetary benefit that pinnacle received due to covol investment in the spoil removal project.
after discovery had been completed,on october,pinnacle moved for summary judgment on all four claims.following briefing,the district court,as explained in its opinion,granted pinnacle summary judgment as to each claim.
with respect to covol breach of contract claim,the district court determined that the agreement is not ambiguous,and thus undertook to identify and enforce its plain and natural meaning.see opinion.more specifically,the opinion rejected covol contentions that sections,and of the agreement gave covol a right to access the refuse material.id.at.alternatively,the court determined that even if the agreement did provide such a right,allowing covol access to the bottom of the impoundment pond does not require pinnacle to affirmatively lower the water level.id.at.the court further reasoned that,as a matter of law,pinnacle did not breach the agreement because covol simply had to deal with more water in the impoundment where the refuse material was located,and the agreement explicitly disclaims any warranty regarding the quantity or quality of the refuse material.id.at.the court surmised that pinnacle may have made business decisions that ultimately made covol operations more difficult,but no evidence indicates that pinnacle breached the agreement.id.at.given that covol could not succeed on its contract claim arising under the terms of the agreement,the court ruled that covol good faith and fair dealing theory must similarly fail.that was so because there is no avenue through the applicable case law that affords covol an independent cause of action for a breach of that covenant.id.at.
next,the district court analyzed covol two tort claims together.the opinion briefly explained that the claims would not succeed on their merits,but emphasized that the tort claims were barred by the gist of the action doctrine because they would not arise independent of the existence of the agreement.see opinion.finally,the court granted summary judgment on covol unjust enrichment claim because the subject matter of this claim involves the performance of an express contract,which can not be the basis of an unjust enrichment claim under applicable law.id.at.
covol has timely noticed this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see desmond pngi charles town gaming,llc,cir.in so doing,it is elementary that t he evidence of the is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in its favor.greater balt.ctr.for pregnancy concerns,mayor of,cir en banc quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment may be granted only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.libertarian party of judd,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.dulaney packaging of,cir.a fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson,at.
on appeal,covol contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its breach of contract claim and on its tort claims.covol requests that the judgment be vacated and the matter remanded for trial.
we begin by addressing covol breach of contract claim.covol asserts that pinnacle breached the agreement by failing to lower the water level of the impoundment,thereby interfering with covol ability to access the coal fines contained therein.pinnacle,meanwhile,disputes that it was under any obligation to adjust the water level.covol maintains that such a duty was created by both the express terms of the agreement and by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.we address those contentions in turn.
first,whether the terms of the agreement obliged pinnacle to adjust the water level of the impoundment hinges on the language of that contract.the agreement makes no explicit reference to water levels.covol nevertheless relies on sections,and of the agreement individually and in combination as bestowing on covol a right to access the refuse material in the impoundment and imposing a corresponding duty on pinnacle to adjust the water level.
the supreme court of appeals of west virginia has explained that,in construing a contract,a reviewing court must first determine whether the contract is ambiguous,meaning that the language is reasonably susceptible of two different meanings,or that reasonable minds might be uncertain or disagree as to its meaning.see syl.pt,estate of tawney columbia natural,llc,whether or not a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.see syl.pt,id.at.if the contract is unambiguous,then the court should enforce its terms according to the plain and natural meaning of the language used without considering extrinsic evidence.see payne weston.if,however,the contract is ambiguous,then extrinsic evidence may be consulted to discern what the parties intended the rights and obligations of the agreement to include.see id.importantly,when the document has been found to be ambiguous,the determination of intent through extrinsic evidence become s a question of fact,rather than a question of law.id.
in section of the agreement,pinnacle undertakes several duties regarding covol right to access its property.relevant here,section ii provides that pinnacle must 
provide any reasonably needed by covol to transport the refuse material from the impoundment to the processing facility.
section ii clearly gives covol a relating to the refuse material.the parties disagree,however,as to the meaning of the term from the impoundment,and whether that term required pinnacle to adjust the water level of the impoundment.we therefore must determine whether section ii is ambiguous on that point.
covol characterizes section ii as requiring pinnacle to provide a within the impoundment itself,such that pinnacle must adjust the water level in order for covol to retrieve the refuse material.that interpretation is reasonable,given that the provision obliges pinnacle to provide any right of way reasonably needed.see agreement ii.pinnacle maintains that section ii only speaks to covol right to transport over the land from the impoundment to the processing facility,suggesting that the begins at the edge of the impoundment.see br.of appellee.that interpretation is also reasonable because the term from the impoundment makes no explicit reference to the extending into the impoundment.a third reasonable reading of section ii could be somewhere in the middle that it provides covol a within the impoundment to access any refuse material that covol could reach without pinnacle manipulating the water level.thus,there are at least three reasonable interpretations of section ii,indicating that the provision is ambiguous.
