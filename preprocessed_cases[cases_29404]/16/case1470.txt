this appeal arises from a claim for insurance coverage for damage caused by hurricane katrina.the district court interpreted a windstorm deductible endorsement in the appellee insurance policy to require coverage for the destruction of the insured buildings by katrina storm surge.based on principles of insurance contract interpretation,under mississippi law,we conclude that the deductible endorsement at issue here did not render the policy ambiguous or otherwise expand coverage to include losses excluded elsewhere in the policy.accordingly,we vacate the district court certified orders and remand for consideration of the underwriters summary judgment motion.
appellee penthouse owner association,penthouse owns a complex of condominiums in pass christian,mississippi,that are insured under a lloyd,london the underwriters policy policy with a policy limit of.the policy excludes water damage,including flood,surface water,waves,tides,tidal waves,overflow of any body of water,or their spray,all whether driven by wind or not.it also contains an causation clause acc clause,which states that such water loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause of loss or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.emphasis added.in addition,the policy includes an endorsement that defines a windstorm or hail deductible windstorm deductible.the deductible is set at,and the endorsement states,in relevant part 
the windstorm or hail deductible,as shown in the schedule,applies to loss or damage to covered property caused directly or indirectly by windstorm or hail,regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss or damage.if loss or damage from a covered weather condition other than windstorm or hail occurs,and that loss or damage would not have occurred but for the windstorm or hail,such loss or damage shall be considered to be caused by windstorm or hail and therefore part of the windstorm or hail occurrence.
the windstorm or hail deductible applies whenever there is an occurrence of windstorm or hail.
hurricane katrina completely destroyed penthouse property,leaving only the slab.penthouse recovered the policy limit from its flood insurer,and made a claim under the underwriters policy.the underwriters denied the claim,citing the policy flood exclusion and acc clause and the underwriters engineers determination that the buildings had been destroyed by flood.
penthouse filed this action on april,to recover under the policy,alleging breach of contract and negligent and bad faith breach of contract.the complaint alleged that the winds of hurricane katrina destroyed the condos several hours before the storm surge,and that therefore the loss was caused entirely by wind,not by flood.the underwriters moved for summary judgment,arguing that penthouse could not show that wind alone caused damages exceeding the policy windstorm deductible and penthouse previous recovery for flood damage.the district court denied the motion for summary judgment,and later denied the underwriters motion for reconsideration and motion for partial summary judgment all three orders were based on the court conclusion that the windstorm deductible operated to provide coverage for hurricane damage regardless of whether the damage was caused by wind or flood.on january,the district court issued a sua sponte order of clarification on the issues of liability and the measure of contract damages,in which the court granted judgment as a matter of law to penthouse on the question of the underwriters liability for all losses,again based on the court interpretation of the windstorm deductible.
after the case was reassigned to a different judge,the district court certified for appeal,under b,the july,order denying the underwriters motion for summary judgment,as well as the three related orders the july order denying the underwriters motion for reconsideration the january,order denying the underwriters motion for partial summary judgment and the january order granting judgment as a matter of law to penthouse on the issue of liability.we granted leave to appeal.
this court has jurisdiction to review any issue fairly included in orders certified pursuant to b.yamaha motor,usa calhoun.the legal question central to each of the certified orders here is whether,as a matter of contract interpretation,the windstorm deductible negates the policy exclusion of coverage for water loss.we review this question of law de novo.performance autoplex ii cas,cir.

here,the parties do not dispute that the policy exclusion for water losses is unambiguous,nor do they dispute that destruction of a building by a hurricane storm surge would fall into the exclusion.see corban,so d at.in fact,the original dispute in the district court was whether the underwriters properly concluded that the insured buildings were destroyed by water rather than wind.penthouse alleged in its complaint that only wind destroyed the buildings,which occurred before the storm surge arrived,implicitly acknowledging that the policy excluded water damage.there was no allegation that the windstorm deductible somehow expanded the policy coverage to include damage caused by water.the dispute now before us arose when the district court nevertheless concluded that the policy windstorm deductible endorsement effectively canceled the policy exclusion for water losses.
an endorsement to an insurance policy controls the policy insofar as it enlarges,modifies,or restricts the terms of the policy,and if there is any conflict between the rider and the policy,the rider controls in construing the contract expressly where the provisions of the rider are more specific.delta pine land,at quoting camden fire ins.ass new buena vista hotel,so d.a court should look at the policy as a whole,consider all relevant portions together and,whenever possible,give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result.corban,so d at.
the district court held that conflict in the policy here is created by the language in the windstorm deductible that explains when the deductible applies.the deductible applies to loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by windstorm or hail,regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss or damage.emphasis added.the emphasized phrase exactly tracks the language of the acc clause in the exclusions portion of the policy,which extends the water exclusion to damage caused directly or indirectly by water,regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.the district court concluded that,i n effect,the deductible endorsement operates as a reverse cause clause.order of july.that is,the district court held,the deductible does not serve to limit coverage,but expands coverage to include any damage caused concurrently or in any sequence to windstorm or hail damage,even if the damage otherwise would not have been covered under policy provisions that exclude flood damage.
we can acknowledge that some of the language of this deductible regardless of any other cause or event may be misleading,but only if read in virtual isolation.when the deductible is read in its proper context of the policy as a whole,and with the common understanding of how deductibles operate in insurance policies,any ambiguity about the effect of this language on the s
