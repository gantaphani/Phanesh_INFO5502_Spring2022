ii.background 
consistent with our standard of review,we recite the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the lewises.the lewises owned and lived in a house in glen rock,pennsylvania.on july,as part of a planned move to new york,they entered into a contract to sell that residence.the sales agreement provided that the lewises would deliver a vacant building to the buyer at the time of the closing,which was scheduled for august.appellee app.at.well aware of the need to move their belongings quickly to comply with the terms of the sales agreement,the lewises solicited a bid from atlas local agent,warners moving and storage warners,explicitly informing warners that their house had to be empty before august.the lewises also informed warners that they had purchased a new home in new york and that they intended to use the proceeds from the sale of their pennsylvania home to pay for it.
warners assured the lewises that,if hired,it would have their pennsylvania residence emptied by august,the day before the closing was scheduled to occur.on july,a warners sales representative executed an agreement with the lewises providing that warners moving and storage will arrive at your home on to box the household belongings with loading the household effects on.delivery is scheduled for or.appellee app.at.
however,notwithstanding its explicit promise,made with full awareness of the lewises obligation to present an empty home at closing on august and their need to pay for their new home in new york,warners dramatically failed to fulfill its commitment.on august and,warners did pack the lewises belongings as required,and on august,warners did provide a moving van at the lewises residence,and began loading the belongings into the van.despite its obligation to complete the loading by the following day,though,and knowing full well the possible consequences to the lewises,warners advised the lewises that the moving van was leaving that evening because the tractor and crew were needed to handle a move to north carolina for another customer the next day.
the lewises were still left believing that another crew would appear with a tractor trailer to finish their move as scheduled.but,on august,the day it had agreed to complete the loading,warners failed to show up at the lewises home.obviously concerned,the lewises attempted to contact warners.no one from warners appeared at the lewises home that day,and no one from warners offered any explanation for the delay.nor did warners appear on august,the day of the closing.aware that the real estate transaction was in serious jeopardy,the lewises again tried to contact warners and eventually spoke to jeff warner at around noon on august warner advised the lewises that there were no licensed drivers available to deliver a moving van to their residence.
later that day,the lewises attended the scheduled closing.not surprisingly,given warners failure to perform as promised,the lewises were unable to deliver a vacant home to the purchasers.the purchasers refused to go through with the sale.warners did not complete the loading of the lewises belongings until august,and did not deliver them to new york until september.
when the lewises belongings arrived at their new home in new york,richard lewis acknowledged their receipt by signing a household goods bill of lading and freight bill.that document provided that as a condition precedent to recovery,a claim for any damage or delay,must be filed within nine months after delivery when a claim is not filed in accordance with the foregoing provisions,carrier shall not be liable and such a claim shall not be paid.appellee app.at.
the following month,on october,the lewises attorney sent a letter to warners requesting compensation for losses incurred because of warners failure to timely perform as promised under the parties agreement.the letter requested damages equal to the loss of profit on the sale of their residence,additional mortgage payments that and lewis have had to pay on two mortgages on their pennsylvania residence which otherwise would have been paid off at closing,and various other miscellaneous expenses they would not have otherwise incurred.appellee app.at.the letter went on to explain that the lewises could not provide an exact dollar amount for their losses until they are able to sell their pennsylvania residence.appellee app.at.shortly thereafter,on november,warners counsel sent a letter to the lewises attorney acknowledging receipt of the october,letter,and requesting additional information and documentation.
on march,the lewises entered into a new contract to sell their pennsylvania property.the sale closed on june,at a price approximately lower than the amount the lewises would have received under the prior sales agreement,had that transaction been completed.during the period between the delivery of their belongings to new york and the sale of their pennsylvania residence,the lewises paid approximately in mortgage payments on the pennsylvania residence,approximately in additional utility bills,and over in additional taxes 
on november,the lewises sent a letter to warners fully explaining their damages and providing a detailed spreadsheet showing the expenses incurred because of warners failure to keep its promises.warners refused to pay,and the lewises were compelled to file suit.
in their complaint filed on august,against atlas in its capacity as warners principal,the lewises asserted claims for breach of contract and negligence and sought approximately in damages.atlas,relying on the carmack amendment,removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.atlas then filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.it argued that the lewises state law claims were preempted by the amendment and that the lewises could not obtain relief under that statute because they had not complied with an associated regulation,which requires a shipper to file a claim for a specified or determinable amount of money with the carrier within the time limits specified in the bill of lading.
on january,the district court denied atlas motion to dismiss,concluding that the carmack amendment did not preempt the lewises state law claims.however,on may,the district court granted atlas motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case.in doing so,the district court agreed with atlas that the lewises state law claims were preempted and that the lewises had not complied with the cited regulation.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
subsection a of the carmack amendment,a,provides in relevant part that 
a carrier providing transportation or service shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation that carrier is liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading.the liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property 
at oral argument,counsel for the lewises correctly conceded that the amendment preempts the lewises state law claims against atlas see,atlantic ry.blish milling.explaining that the carmack amendment covers all losses resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier duty as to any part of the agreed transportation moffit bekins van lines,cir holding that the carmack amendment preempted state law claims by a consumer shipper against a moving company based on late delivery of the shipper belongings.
as to claims under the carmack amendment itself,subsection e provides that a carrier may not provide a period of less than months for filing a claim against it under this section e.the contents of a valid claim are set forth in pursuant to subsection b of that regulation,a claim for loss,damage,or delay to cargo must include 
a written or electronic communication from a claimant,filed with a proper carrier within the time limits specified in the bill of lading and 
containing facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment or shipments of property,
asserting liability for alleged loss,damage,injury,or delay,and 
making claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money,
shall be considered as sufficient compliance with the provisions for filing claims embraced in the bill of lading 
consistent with subsection e of the amendment,the bill of lading that atlas gave to the lewises required that,as a condition precedent to recovery,a claim for any damage or delay,must be filed within nine months after delivery when a claim is not filed in accordance with the foregoing provisions,carrier shall not be liable and such a claim shall not be paid.appellee app.at.atlas delivered the lewises belongings to their new home in new york on september.thus,pursuant to the bill of lading and the amendment,the lewises had until june,to provide atlas with notice of their claim in a manner that complied with b.
on appeal,the parties do not dispute that the october,letter sent by the lewises attorney to atlas satisfies the requirements found in b and b.they disagree,however,on whether that letter makes a claim for a specified or determinable amount of money,as required by b.the lewises argue that the letter makes a claim for a determinable amount of money because it identifies their losses as the loss of profit on the sale of their residence,additional mortgage payments that they have had to pay on two mortgages on their pennsylvania residence which otherwise would have been paid off at closing,and various other miscellaneous expenses they would not have otherwise incurred.appellee app.at.according to the lewises,listing the nature of their damages renders their claim determinable because those damages are susceptible of being determined,found out,definitively decided upon,or settled.appellant br.at.atlas responds that,to make a claim for a determinable amount of money,the lewises claim must include,at minimum,some dollar amount,and the october letter fails to provide any dollar amount whatsoever.appellee br.at.we agree with the lewises that the october,letter stated a claim for a determinable amount of money as to the amount of their extra mortgage payments and the difference between the price at which they would have sold their pennsylvania home,but for warners actions,and the lower price at which the home ultimately sold.however,a claim for miscellaneous expenses is too vague to constitute a claim for a determinable amount of money,as contemplated by the regulation,and hence atlas is not liable for those expenses.
we begin our analysis of with the rule that t he basic tenets of statutory construction apply to construction of regulations and our starting point on any question concerning the application of a regulation is its particular written text.fed of sportsmen clubs,kempthorne,cir quoting wilson parole comm n,cir.in examining a regulation text,i t is a fundamental canon of construction that unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.csx transp.novolog bucks county,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
as noted already,b requires that a valid claim include a written communication m aking a claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.b emphasis added.because the regulation does not define the meaning of the term specified or the term determinable,we must apply the ordinary meaning of those words.determinable simply means a ble to be determined or ascertained.black law dictionary ed.specify,by contrast,means to mention or name in a specific or explicit manner tell or state explicitly or in detail.webster third new international dictionary,philip babcock gove,ed.the plain meanings of specified and determinable reveal a key difference between them and hence between the kinds of claims permitted by the regulation.a claim for a specified amount of money is a claim that explicitly gives the dollar amount of money being claimed.however,a claim for a determinable amount of money need not explicitly state the dollar amount claimed.instead,a claim is determinable if the amount of money claimed is merely cap able of being determined or ascertained.notably,because a claim for a specific amount of money must state the amount explicitly,such claims must be reduced to an exact dollar amount at the time the claim is made.by contrast,a claim that is determinable need not include any dollar amount at all.instead,all that is required is that the claim provide enough information to make it possible to assign a dollar amount to the claim at some point after the claim itself is filed.
our conclusion that specified claims under b include exact dollar amounts while determinable claims do not is not only consistent with the ordinary usage of both terms,it is also consistent with another canon of statutory and regulatory construction.we have explained that i f possible,we must give effect to every clause and word of a statute,and be reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage.tavarez klingensmith,cir citations and internal punctuation and quotation marks omitted.were we to accept atlas invitation to require that every claim must provide some dollar amount to comply with subsection b,we would be treating the term determinable as merely redundant of the term specified,and would be ignoring the use of the word or between the two terms 
atlas attempts to evade the ordinary meaning of the regulation language and the basic rules of textual construction by arguing that,while a determinable claim need not include the exact amount of the shipper claim,it must include some dollar amount.we find no support for atlas reading,either in the text of the statute itself or in common sense.requiring a shipper to list some dollar amount presents the shipper with some limited options.the shipper might list a single dollar amount,such as.as we have already explained,such a claim is a claim for a specified amount of money,not a determinable amount of money.second,a shipper might list an estimate of its damages,for example,by filing a claim for more or less.without further amplification,such a claim is not for a specified or determinable amount of money because d provides that 
w henever a claim is presented for an uncertain amount,such as more or less,the carrier shall ascertain as nearly as possible the extent,if any,of the loss or damage for which it may be responsible.it shall not,however,voluntarily pay such a claim unless and until a formal claim in writing for a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph b of this section.
the implication of the clause until a formal claim in writing for a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed is that a claim like more or less is different from and does not meet the specified or determinable standard.
however,we do not read d to bar all claims that are less than fully specific regarding the dollar amount at stake.instead,the plai
