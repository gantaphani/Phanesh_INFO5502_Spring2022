this case turns on the appropriate tax treatment of a contractual payment initially reported as ordinary income but later recharacterized as a capital gain.the internal revenue service irs denied a requested refund and,following a bench trial,the district court upheld that action.
this appeal touts four claims of error,the most significant of which require us to elaborate upon the use and meaning of,and then to apply,the strong proof rule.after careful consideration of all four claims,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
irwin muskat worked for years in a family business,jac pac foods,based in manchester,new hampshire the firm signature line of business was the processing and distribution of meat products to restaurant chains and other commercial entities.in,muskat assumed operating control of jac pac.under his stewardship,jac pac annual revenues soared to nearly.along the way,muskat developed valuable relationships with customers,suppliers,and distributors.
this litigation grew out of the acquisition of jac pac by manchester acquisition corporation,a subsidiary of corporate brand foods america,collectively,cbfa.in,george gillett,cbfa chairman,contacted muskat about a possible deal at the time,muskat was jac pac chief executive officer and the owner of of its outstanding stock.negotiations ensued.the negotiations touched in part on whether muskat would receive remuneration over and beyond his share of the sale price for jac pac assets.following lengthy deliberations,the parties agreed that muskat would continue to run the business after cbfa acquired the assets,and that he would receive incremental payments under both an employment agreement and a noncompetition agreement.
on march,representatives of cbfa and jac pac executed an asset purchase agreement,which provided that cbfa would buy all of jac pac assets save for certain real estate for in cash and cbfa assumption of enumerated liabilities.the asset purchase agreement contained several conditions precedent,three of which pertained to muskat execution of specific contracts,namely,a subscription agreement,an employment agreement,and a noncompetition agreement.
muskat signed the required agreements on may.the noncompetition agreement is of pivotal importance here.in it,cbfa pledged to pay muskat in return for a covenant not to compete over a period.the first installment to be paid immediately,with other installments to be paid in varying amounts and at varying intervals over the next thirteen years.these payment obligations were to survive muskat death.
muskat received the first installment in.on his federal income tax return he listed the payment as ordinary income and paid income and taxes accordingly.in,however,muskat reversed his field he filed an amended return for,recharacterizing the payment as a capital gain and seeking a tax refund in the amount of the irs denied the requested refund.muskat then sued in new hampshire federal district court,alleging that the payment was compensation for the transfer of his personal goodwill and,thus,was taxable as a capital gain.
in a pretrial ruling,the district court declared that,in order to prevail,muskat would have to show by strong proof that he and cbfa intended the payment to be compensation for personal goodwill.muskat united states muskat i,cv,wl,at.following a bench trial,the court determined that muskat had failed to adduce the requisite strong proof.muskat united states muskat ii,cv,wl,at.at the same time,the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over muskat claimed entitlement to a return of tax.id.at.consequently,the court entered judgment in favor of the government.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
this case plays out against two background principles of tax law the first principle holds that payments received in exchange for a covenant not to compete are usually taxable as ordinary income,whereas payments received for the sale of goodwill are usually taxable as capital gains.compare,baker comm r,cir holding payments under covenant not to compete taxable as ordinary income,with,patterson comm r,cir holding amounts received for goodwill taxable at capital gain rates.the second principle holds that the tax rates applicable to ordinary income are normally higher than those applicable to capital gains.see tax tables.we proceed against the backdrop of these principles.
in this venue,muskat advances four assignments of error.these include i the applicability of the strong proof rule ii the weight of the evidence as to whether the challenged payment constituted compensation for personal goodwill and,thus,should have been taxed at capital gain rates iii the exclusion of expert testimony and iv the lower court refusal to consider the claim for a refund of tax.we discuss these issues sequentially.
strong proof.
it is beyond hope of contradiction that,in a tax refund suit,the complaining taxpayer bears the burden of proving the incorrectness of the challenged tax treatment.see webb irs,cir.here,however,the parties disagree as to the quantum of proof required to satisfy that burden.appellate courts review abstract legal questions de novo,and a question comes within that purview.see united states goad,cir am.rayon comm r,cir see also putnam res.pateman,cir.accordingly,we review de novo the district court determination that muskat had to adduce strong proof to prevail on his refund claim.
the strong proof rule is peculiar to tax cases it applies when the parties to a transaction have executed a written instrument allocating sums of money for particular items,and one party thereafter seeks to alter the written allocation for tax purposes on the basis that the sums were,in reality,intended as compensation for some other item.the rule provides that,in order to effect such an alteration,the proponent must adduce strong proof that,at the time of execution of the instrument,the contracting parties actually intended the payments to compensate for something different.see harvey radio,comm r,cir leslie ray ins.agency,united states,cir.phrased another way,the party seeking to alter a written allocation must demonstrate an actual meeting of the minds with respect to some other allocation the heightened standard strikes the appropriate balance between predictability in taxation and the desirability of respecting the contracting parties real intentions.see harvey radio,at.in applying it,evidence that a written allocation lacks independent economic reality,though likely relevant,is not sufficient to satisfy the strong proof test id.at.
muskat vigorously contests the deployment of the strong proof rule in the circumstances of this case.he starts with the bald proposition that harvey radio is a relic of a bygone era and should not be perpetuated.we reject this assault on the continued vitality of harvey radio.
we have held,time and again,that in a circuit,prior panel decisions are binding upon newly constituted panels in the absence of supervening authority sufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent.united states wogan,cir.such supervening authority may take the form of a congressional enactment,a new supreme court opinion,or an en banc decision of our own.see united states allen,cir williams ashland eng g,cir.the second and third of these escape routes plainly do not apply here muskat has not cited to any overriding judicial decision that would call into question the durability of harvey radio.
this leaves only the escape route paved by statutory enactments.in this vein,muskat has argued that changes in the tax code have rendered lifeless the rationales undergirding harvey radio.but the strong proof rule is generic it applies to the entire universe of written allocations,not just to those where changes in tax treatment have occurred.more importantly,the modifications highlighted by muskat make no mention of the strong proof rule,nor do they necessarily imply that a different rule is desirable.accordingly,harvey radio remains good law in this circuit.
muskat fallback position is that the strong proof rule,even if velivolant,does not apply in the circumstances at hand because muskat was not a party to the written allocation.the factual predicate on which this privity argument rests is faulty.
we need not tarry.the record shows with conspicuous clarity that muskat was a party to the allocation of funds to the noncompetition agreement.for one thing,that agreement bears muskat signature in his personal capacity.for another thing,the testimony makes pellucid that,both individually and through his representatives,he negotiated the overall pac transaction.that muskat signed the asset purchase agreement on jac pac behalf was not a mere formality but,rather,an indicium of his deep involvement in the structuring of the deal.
finally,muskat contends that the written allocation is ambiguous and that this ambiguity renders the strong proof rule inapposite.the premise behind this argument is sound the strong proof rule does not apply to ambiguous contractual allocations.see,kreider comm r,cir peterson mach.tool,comm r,wl.but muskat attempt to rely upon this premise is an effort to force a square peg into a round hole.
whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.torres vargas santiago cummings,cir allen adage,cir.but a contract is not ambiguous merely because a party to it,often with a rearward glance colored by,disputes an interpretation that is logically compelled.blackie maine,cir.rather,a contract is ambiguous only if the language is susceptible to more than one meaning and reasonable persons could differ as to which meaning was intended.uncle henry plaut consulting,cir.
in this instance,the noncompetition agreement hardly could be clearer.it expressly states that the sums specified therein will be paid to muskat in order to protect jac pac goodwill and in consideration of his serial promises not to participate in rival businesses,not to solicit employees to leave cbfa,and not to divert business opportunities from cbfa.the specified payments are clearly allocated to this covenant not to compete.in short,the noncompetition agreement unequivocally its title a agreement not to compete.see black law dictionary ed see also ldds commc ns,automated commc ns,cir identifying agreement with similar restrictions as a noncompetition agreement heritage auto,comm r,cch,wl,at,treating agreement with similar provisions as covenant not to compete for tax purposes.
in an endeavor to blunt the force of this reasoning,muskat notes that the preamble to the noncompetition agreement recites that it was executed in consideration of the substantial benefits accruing to muskat under the asset purchase agreement that is itself ambiguous because it purports to allocate a purchase price even though jac pac received only from the sale.we fail to see how this arguable discrepancy,most likely explicable in terms of assumption of liabilities and other considerations,introduces an ambiguity into the allocation set forth in the noncompetition agreement.whatever ambiguities might permeate the asset purchase agreement,there are none in the noncompetition agreement itself to which the asset purchase agreement unambiguously allocates 
to sum up,none of muskat is persuasive.accordingly,we agree with the district court that muskat had to adduce strong proof that the contracting parties intended,at the time of the transaction,that the challenged payment would be compensation for muskat personal goodwill.it is to that issue that we now proceed.
weight of the evidence.
the court below found that muskat had failed to adduce strong proof that the contracting parties intended the challenged payment to be compensation for personal goodwill.muskat ii,wl,at.this is essentially a factual finding,and we review it only for clear error.see cumpiano banco santander,cir findings concerning an actor intent fit neatly within the integument of the clearly erroneous rule.consequently,we will not disturb the district court determination unless,on the whole of the record,we form a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.id.
the phrase strong proof is not.while the utilization of an enhanced level of proof is consistent with the spirit of our earlier cases,see,leslie ray,at,the precise import of the strong proof rule is arguably best worked out on a case by case basis,see,united states.educ.agency,cir.the tax court cases leave the matter pretty much up in the air that court has construed the strong proof rule to require proof beyond a mere preponderance of the evidence.major comm r,wl.
despite the advantages of a loose articulation,we think that a benchmark would be helpful.in our view,to constitute strong proof a taxpayer evidence must have persuasive power closely resembling the clear and convincing evidence required to reform a written contract on the ground of mutual mistake.see.ins.pana cmty.unit sch.dist,cir berezin regency sav.bank,cir see also austl.bank united states,collecting cases.this analogy seems compelling because,under the strong proof rule,a party seeking to vary a written allocation for tax purposes must show a meeting of the minds different from that professed in the written showing that bears a family resemblance to the showing required for the reformation of a contract.see.ins,at requiring party that seeks contract reformation to show a meeting of the minds resulting in an actual agreement between the parties different from that embodied in their written contract.
the sources of strong proof are.for that reason,an inquiring court,in determining whether there is strong proof that the parties to a transaction intended the allocation set forth in a written agreement to serve as a proxy for some other more genuine allocation,should closely examine the course of negotiations leading up to the agreement.see critz comm r,cch,wl feller comm r,cch,wl.
in this case,the trial testimony revealed no discussion of muskat personal goodwill during the negotiations.by the same token,none of the transaction documents including the early drafts of those documents mentioned muskat personal goodwill.muskat had ample opportunity to introduce the concept of personal goodwill into the noncompetition agreement which went through at least five iterations,but he did not do so.and although there is a reference to goodwill in the preamble to the noncompetition agreement,that reference is to an avowed purpose to protect jac pac goodwill.
this is telling evidence.in our judgment,the absence of any reference to muskat separate goodwill,combined with this express reference to jac pac goodwill,makes it extremely unlikely that the contracting parties intended the payments limned in the noncompetition agreement to serve as de facto compensation for muskat personal goodwill.
this intuition is reinforced by other pieces of evidence.cbfa president,benjamin warren,testified that he could not imagine that any goodwill other than jac pac was material to the transaction.the asset purchase agreement allocated almost of the sale price to jac pac goodwill,lending credence to warren testimony and making a focus on muskat separate goodwill implausible.seen in this light and with due deference to the district court prerogative to judge the credibility of the witnesses,the clear weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that the challenged payment was,as stated,compensation for the covenant not to compete,not compensation for muskat personal goodwill.
muskat musters two arguments designed to undermine this conclusion.first,he asserts that the noncompetition agreement survivability provision is a dead giveaway that the payments called for by the agreement are for something other than refraining from competition after all,muskat hardly could compete subsequent to his demise.second,he asserts that the terms of his employment and subscription agreements were so lucrative as to eliminate any realistic possibility that,at a relatively advanced age,he would cross swords with cbfa.
the common thread that binds these arguments together is that they are in service of muskat attempt to cast doubt upon the economic reality of cbfa need for a noncompetition agreement.that game may not be worth the candle proof that a written allocation lacks economic reality does not,in and of itself,constitute strong proof that the contracting parties intended some other allocation.see harvey radio,at.in any event,as we explain below,the noncompetition agreement possessed an adequate basis in economic reality.
muskat,by his own admission,had a considerable following in the trade that is the core element of the personal goodwill that he touts.while the presence of a survivability provision is in some tension with the categorization of an agreement as a covenant not to compete,see,in re johnson,cir.bap brinson comm r,cch,wl,at ackerman comm r,cch,wl,it is not wholly antithetic to that taxonomy.after all,a person who has the wherewithal knowledge,contacts,and the like to compete effectively is in a strong position to drive a hard bargain in exchange for his agreement to eschew competition.a survivability provision may be part of that hard bargain.thus,courts frequently have classified agreements that contain survivability provisions as valid noncompetition agreements for tax purposes.see,thompson comm r,cch,wl,at buchner comm r,cch,wl wager comm r,wl.we think that classification is apt here,notwithstanding the survivability provision contained in muskat noncompetition agreement.
so too muskat argument that it was unlikely that he would try to compete.it is true that competing would have had an cost.after the sale,muskat continued to work for cbfa in an executive capacity.he possessed a powerful financial incentive to remain with cbfa he had invested in the company through the subscription agreement,and his employment agreement paid him a base salary of per year,together with a comprehensive benefits package and the prospect of sizable bonuses.
on the other side of the balance,however,muskat had been enormously successful prior to the sale.there is no indication that he was committed to retirement,infirm,or otherwise situated so as to render his promise not to compete of little value.welch comm r,cch,wl,at finding that covenant not to compete lacked economic reality when taxpayer was terminally ill at time of sale.both gillett and warren testified that they valued muskat relationships with customers,suppliers,and distributors,and there is every reason to suppose that a man with muskat business acumen could have earned as much or more money by turning his back on cbfa and pursuing other competitive opportunities.indeed,gillett testified that the noncompetition agreement was meant to prevent that very possibility.the district court,as the arbiter of witness credibility,see fed.refin.klock,cir,was entitled to credit that testimony.the noncompetition agreement was,therefore,sufficiently grounded in economic reality.
the short of it is that the weight of the evidence is completely consistent with the district court conclusion that cbfa sensibly protected its substantial investment in jac pac assets and goodwill by its contractual arrangement with muskat.it follows inexorably that the court did not clearly err in holding that muskat failed to adduce strong proof that the contracting parties intended the payments delineated in the noncompetition agreement to be compensation for muskat personal goodwill.the payment received in was,therefore,taxable as ordinary income.see baker,at holding that payment under covenant not to compete is taxable as ordinary income.
expert testimony.
we review rulings admitting or excluding expert testimony for abuse of discretion.united states sebaggala,cir.we will reverse such a ruling only if the trial court committed a meaningful error in judgment.pepsi cola of bottling,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.such a bevue occurs when the court commits an error of law,considers improper criteria,ignores criteria that deserve significant weight,or gauges only the appropriate criteria but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them,cir.
at trial,muskat sought to offer the opinion testimony of george,a certified public accountant,in order to establish that most of the goodwill acquired by cbfa was attributable to muskat individually,not jac pac corporately.the court excluded the proffered testimony on relevancy grounds.muskat appeals,maintaining that opinion tended to show that he possessed a valuable asset personal goodwill that the contracting parties probably would have taken into account.
the government rejoinder begins with the suggestion that muskat neglected to preserve this objection.the record tells a different tale when the district court questioned the relevance of the proffered testimony,muskat counsel summarized what would say and explained how the testimony would support muskat position.no more was exigible to preserve the point for appeal.see.a see also curreri int l of teamsters,cir.
the government defense of the ruling on the merits is sturdier.the principal issue at trial was whether the contracting parties intended payments under the noncompetition agreement to represent compensation for the transfer of personal goodwill.if planned to testify that muskat possessed personal goodwill separate from jac pac goodwill,his testimony arguably may have been relevant to that issue.but according to the proffer,would not have testified to that effect rather,he would have testified that a large slice of jac pac goodwill was attributable to muskat.this is a significant distraction.all of jac pac goodwill,including any portion attributable to muskat,was sold under the asset purchase agreement.thus,testimony would have shed no light on the meaning of the noncompetition agreement.
that ends this aspect of the matter.it is law that district courts enjoy wide latitude in determining the relevancy vel non of evidence.morales feliciano rullán,cir.given the nature of the proffered testimony,the district court operated within the realm of its discretion in excluding it.
muskat final plaint concerns his separate claim for a refund of tax.he maintains,in the alternative,that the lower court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this claim that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint and that,in all events,he should have prevailed on a theory of judicial estoppel.
we review the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction de novo.dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir.the internal revenue code recognizes the value of an orderly refund process,requiring the exhaustion of remedies available through administrative channels prior to opening the courthouse doors.under that scheme,a district court has jurisdiction to adjudicate only those refund claims that have first been duly filed with the secretary of the treasury.a.relevant regulations provide that a filed claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which a refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the commissioner of the exact basis thereof.b.taken together,these provisions bar a taxpayer from presenting claims in a tax refund suit that substantially vary the legal theories and factual bases set forth in the tax refund claim presented to the irs.lockheed martin united states,accord charter united states,cir.it follows that a claim or theory not explicitly or implicitly set forth in the taxpayer administrative refund application can not be broached for the first time in a court in which a subsequent refund suit is brought.see lockheed martin,at.
here,the administrative refund claim filed on muskat behalf stated in full 
taxpayers are amending their tax return to properly record the allocation between the sale of goodwill and a covenant not to compete.this change results in the reclassification of income erroneously reported as fully ordinary income to the correct allocation between ordinary income and capital gain.
fairly read,this statement indicates that the sole purpose of the refund claim is to change the allocation of the payment between goodwill and noncompetition,emphasizing the former and deemphasizing the latter,to the end of taxing at the lower capital gain rate monies previously taxed at the higher ordinary income rate.the irs addressed that claim,and muskat ensuing judicial complaint neither mentioned an alternative claim for tax nor raised any other new issues.
at trial,muskat shifte
