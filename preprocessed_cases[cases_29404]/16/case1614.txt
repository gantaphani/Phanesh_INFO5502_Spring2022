plaintiffs are homeowners who sued their insurers,alleging that their homes were totally destroyed in hurricanes katrina rita.they appeal the district court order granting the motions to dismiss motions for judgment on the pleadings,concluding that louisiana value policy law does not apply when a total loss does not result from a covered peril.for the following reasons,we affirm the order of the district court dismissing the homeowners claims.
plaintiffs the homeowners,both individuals and putative class representatives,are homeowners who allege that hurricanes katrina rita rendered their homes total losses.when their homeowner insurers the insurers refused to reimburse them for the full value of their homes as stated in their policies the agreed face value,the homeowners filed suit against the insurers,alleging that they were entitled to the agreed face value pursuant to.ann,louisiana valued policy law vpl all of the insurance policies cover damage caused by wind and rain,but contain a clause excluding coverage for damage caused by flood 
the insurers filed fed.civ.proc.b motions to dismiss and fed.civ.proc.c motions for judgment on the pleadings,arguing,inter alia,that the vpl applies only to a total loss resulting from fire and even if the vpl extends to perils other than fire,the vpl does not allow full recovery when the total loss is not caused by a covered peril.in response,the homeowners argued that the vpl does apply to perils and that the vpl requires an insurer to pay the agreed face value when the property is rendered a total loss,even if the total loss is due to an excluded peril so long as a covered peril causes some damage,no matter how small,to the property 
in a opinion,the district court granted the insurers motions.assuming without deciding that the vpl applied to perils,the district court first held that,regardless of whether the statutory language of the vpl is considered ambiguous,the homeowners interpretation would lead to absurd consequences.the court concluded that the focus of the vpl was on establishing the value of the property in the event of a total loss,and was not intended to expand coverage to excluded perils.thus,the court determined that the vpl does not apply when a total loss does not result from a covered peril.
the homeowners then filed the instant appeal.while this appeal was pending,the homeowners filed a motion asking us to certify the questions regarding the construction of the vpl to the louisiana supreme court,which we denied the homeowners also filed a motion requesting that we stay our decision in this case pending the appeal of two louisiana state court decisions,which we also denied.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal pursuant to fed.civ.proc.b and c the standard for dismissal under rule c is the same as that for dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b we accept the plaintiff facts as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff the motion to dismiss should not be granted unless the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts that he could prove consistent with the complaint 
we also review a district court determination of state law de novo in the absence of a final decision by the state highest court on the issue at hand,it is our duty to determine,in our best judgment,how the highest court of the state would resolve the issue 
because we conclude that the vpl does not apply to a total loss not caused by a covered peril,we assume for purposes of this opinion that the vpl applies to perils.
a.the language of louisiana valued policy law 
the homeowners maintain that they are entitled to the agreed face value of their policy under the vpl because their homes sustained some damage from wind,a covered peril,even though the total loss resulted from flooding,a peril.on the other hand,the insurers contend that the vpl does not require them to pay the agreed face value of the policy because the total loss was not caused by a covered peril.
in determining which interpretation of the vpl the louisiana supreme court would likely adopt,we begin with the language of the statute and the rules of construction provided in the louisiana civil code.louisiana vpl provides,in relevant part 
under any fire insurance policy insuring inanimate,immovable property in this state,if the insurer places a valuation upon the covered property and uses such valuation for purposes of determining the premium charge to be made under the policy,in the case of total loss the insurer shall compute and indemnify or compensate any covered loss of,or damage to,such property which occurs during the term of the policy at such valuation without deduction or offset,unless a different method is to be used in the computation of loss,in which latter case,the policy,and any application therefor,shall set forth in type of equal size,the actual method of such loss computation by the insurer 
the statutory interpretation articles in the louisiana civil code provide that w hen a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences,the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made in search of the intent of the legislature.however,w hen the language of the law is susceptible of different meanings,it must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the purpose of the law.when interpreting a statute,t he words of a law must be given their generally prevailing meaning,and w hen the words of a law are ambiguous,their meaning must be sought by examining the context in which they occur and the text of the law as a whole.
we agree with the district court that the language of the vpl is not clear and unambiguous in particular,the critical language in the statute providing that in the case of a total loss the insurer shall compute and indemnify or compensate any covered loss of,or damage to,such property is susceptible of two possible meanings in the event of a total loss,an insurer is required to pay the homeowner the agreed full value of a policy as long as a covered loss causes some damage to the property,even if a peril renders the property a total loss or an insurer is only required to pay the homeowner the agreed face value of a policy when the property is rendered a total loss by a covered loss.we therefore must interpret the statute in a manner that best conforms to the purpose of the law 
the vpl was enacted to fix the value of the insured property in the event of a total loss and thus,operates as a form of liquidated damages as stated by the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal 
valued policy laws or total losses statutes dealing with fire ins.policies were enacted by many states in the late and early principally as a protective measure for insureds.in general,these valued policy laws require that in case of total loss to an insured property from certain specified perils,the amount stated in the policy declarations is considered the value of the structure at the time of loss and is payable in full.in other words,if the value of property is less than the amount of insurance on a policy covering a building in a state having such a law,the insurer is precluded in most states from arguing that a lesser sum be paid,actual cash value 
the legislative intent of these laws was to prevent and other abuses,that is,to keep insurers and their representatives from writing insurance on property for more than it is actually worth.
a second reason for valued policy laws is to encourage insurers and producers to inspect risks and assist prospective insureds in determining insurable value of properties it follows that failure of an insurer to inspect a risk for valuation purposes can lead to and can produce a moral hazard as well.in other words,if a building is insured for more than its actual worth,an insured might be indifferent about loss prevention.this situation might even give an insured an incentive to intentionally cause damage to his structure 
in other words,according to the louisiana courts,the vpl was adopted for two main purposes to keep insurers from writing insurance on property for more t
