through a series of transactions between and,jpmorgan chase bank and its predecessor served as agent for a number of lenders that had advanced credit to venture holding company llc,a company owned by larry winget and the larry winget living trust hereafter collectively referred to as winget.jpmorgan,on the basis of the various agreements between the parties,sought to inspect the financial records of two other companies owned by winget after venture filed for bankruptcy.the district court granted jpmorgan request for specific performance of the bank inspection rights,a decision that winget has appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.the parties relationship 
in october of,jpmorgan and winget entered into the eighth amendment of the credit agreement between the lenders and venture.a guaranty of payment winget guaranty was executed pursuant to the eighth amendment,which memorialized winget personal guarantee of venture obligations under the credit agreement.winget also entered into two pledge agreements winget pledges in conjunction with the winget guaranty,whereby winget pledged all of the present and future stock in two other companies owned by management and venco,llc venco.finally,and venco executed guaranties that were similar to the winget guaranty and the winget pledges guaranty and venco guaranty.
venture and a number of winget other companies later filed for bankruptcy.following the sale of various assets of the bankrupt companies,venture outstanding debt under the credit agreement stood at approximately million.on september,jpmorgan,through its counsel,sent a letter to winget requesting inspection of his personal financial records and the financial records of and venco pursuant to the terms of the winget guaranty.winget,on october,denied jpmorgan request.
relevant contractual provisions 
at issue in this appeal is the inspection covenant set forth in d i of the winget guaranty.this section provides in pertinent part as follows 
each of the guarantor controlled companies will permit the administrative agent,by its representatives and agents,to inspect any of the property,corporate books and financial records of such guarantor controlled company,to examine and make copies of the books and accounts and other financial records of such guarantor controlled company,and to discuss the affairs,finances and accounts of such guarantor controlled company with,and to be advised as to the same by,their respective officers at such reasonable times and intervals as the administrative agent may designate 
this inspection covenant is one of a series of covenants that govern the actions that may be taken with respect to winget companies,including and venco.these covenants include restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends d ii,the incurring of indebtedness d iii,mergers and consolidations d iv,investments and acquisitions d v,the creation of liens d vi,and transactions with specific affiliated entities d vii.the winget guaranty states that winget will cause the guarantor controlled companies to comply with each of the covenants.
another portion of the winget guaranty that is relevant to this appeal is,which sets out the limits on jpmorgan potential recovery under the credit agreement 
n o action will be brought for the repayment of the guaranteed obligations under this guaranty and no judgment therefor will be obtained or enforced against larry winget other than with respect to the pledged stock in accordance with the provisions of the related pledge agreements,provided that the guarantor shall be fully and personally liable for any damages arising from any violations of any of the agreements of the guarantor herein in favor of the lenders.no action for money judgment shall be commenced by the administrative agent arising from any alleged violation of the covenants contained in section d until the completion of collection and liquidation efforts as described in section of the pledge agreement of guarantor as to pim,unless there is a good faith allegation of material and irreparable harm.however,an action for specific performance injunctive relief can be brought at any time following an alleged violation.
although of the winget guaranty references only the pledge,of both the pledge and venco pledge contain identical language regarding any collection action against the pledged stock.these sections provide in pertinent part that 
n otwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary,the agent shall not exercise any rights or remedies under this pledge agreement until all reasonable efforts have been made by it to collect the obligations from other collateral held by the agent,it being intended that the collateral provided by this pledge agreement shall be realized upon by the agent only as a last resort.
the other collateral that must first be pursued by jpmorgan is not defined in the winget guaranty,but the pledged stock of and venco are explicitly excluded from the contemplated other collateral.an almost identical reasonable efforts provision appears in iii of both the and venco guaranties.finally,pursuant to of the winget pledges,winget can obtain a release of the and venco stock by paying jpmorgan not less than to satisfy each pledge.
procedural background 
in count i of the complaint,jpmorgan requests an order for specific performance under the winget guaranty,requiring winget to comply with the inspection requests outlined in its september,letter.winget filed both an answer,raising affirmative defenses,and a counterclaim,which was subsequently amended.jpmorgan moved to dismiss the amended counterclaim.the district court eventually dismissed the counterclaim without prejudice and permitted winget to assert those claims in a new,related case,which winget did.
jpmorgan then moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.in its motion,jpmorgan sought to have winget affirmative defenses stricken and requested a final judgment as to its request for specific performance.the district court granted jpmorgan request for specific performance and ruled that the affirmative defenses would be litigated as part of the companion case initiated on the basis of winget former counterclaim.
at the request of the district court,both parties submitted proposed orders that would implement the specific performance of jpmorgan inspection right.jpmorgan proposed order was adopted,which the district court subsequently modified to protect winget right to assert his fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination in other proceedings.the district court also entered a protective order that restricts the use of any confidential material produced during the inspection process.on appeal,winget argues that the district court erred by failing to apply the reasonable efforts provision to jpmorgan inspection rights,and granting an overly broad order of specific performance.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and applicable substantive law 
we review de novo a judgment on the pleadings granted pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,using the same standard as applies to a review of a motion to dismiss under rule b.roger miller music,publishing,llc,cir.for purposes of a motion for judgment on the pleadings,all material allegations of the pleadings of the opposing party must be taken as true,and the motion may be granted only if the moving party is nevertheless clearly entitled to judgment.southern ohio bank merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.but we need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.mixon ohio,cir.a rule c motion is granted when no material issue of fact exists and the party making the motion is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.paskvan city of cleveland civil serv.comm n,cir.
jurisdiction in the present case is based on diversity of citizenship.in diversity cases such as this,we apply state law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the state supreme court.allstate ins.thrifty,cir.accordingly,we apply michigan state law to the interpretation of the parties agreements and the district court order of specific performance.
b.the reasonable efforts provision 
winget contends that jpmorgan inspection rights as set forth in d of the winget guaranty are subject to the reasonable efforts provisions of the winget pledges,guaranty,and venco guaranty.he advances this contention by arguing that the district court misapplied the legal standard applicable to a judgment on the pleadings.according to winget,u nder c,this court must accept as true his allegation that jpmorgan failed to use all reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the guaranteed obligations from the other collateral.winget also claims that in the context of jpmorgan rule c motion,the district court was required to accept as true,given the state of the pleadings,that jpmorgan was contractually barred from taking action that would affect the rights of venco and 
we conclude that winget argument is both a misapprehension of the proper analysis under rule c and an incorrect interpretation of the language of the winget guaranty.although all material allegations of the pleadings of the opposing party must be taken as true,southern ohio bank,at,winget assertion that jpmorgan was contractually barred from exercising its inspection rights until it satisfied the reasonable efforts provision is a legal conclusion,not a factual allegation.accordingly,we are not required to accept winget argument as true.mixon,at.winget repeatedly asserts that the district court erred because it failed to accept his contention that jpmorgan had not used all reasonable efforts before seeking to exercise its inspection rights.in fact,the district court made no such error,because the court actually concluded that the reasonable efforts provision was inapplicable to jpmorgan inspection rights as agent.
the proper interpretation of a contract is a question of law.archambo lawyers title ins.thus,whether the reasonable efforts provisions of the guaranty and the venco guaranty are applicable to the agent inspection rights under the winget guaranty is a legal question that may be decided on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.according to winget,iii of the and venco guaranties limit jpmorgan inspection rights under d of the winget guaranty.section iii provides that jpmorgan shall not exercise any rights or remedies under this guaranty until all reasonable efforts shall have been made by it to collect the guaranteed obligations from other collateral held by the administrative agent.winget argues that because jpmorgan has failed to demonstrate that it has made all reasonable efforts to collect from other collateral,it can not exercise its inspection rights as agent.
the numerous,interrelated contracts governing the relationship between winget and jpmorgan are undoubtedly complex,and jpmorgan ability to seek certain forms of relief is circumscribed by the provisions of the various agreements.for example,of the winget guaranty provides that n o action for money judgment shall be commenced by the administrative agent arising from any alleged covenants contained in section d until the completion of collection and liquidation efforts as described in section of the pledge agreement of guarantor as to pim,unless there is a good faith allegation of material and irreparable harm.if jpmorgan were seeking a money judgment based on winget response to its request to inspect the financial records,this provision makes clear that jpmorgan must first complete the collection and liquidation efforts set forth in and make a allegation of material and irreparable harm.
the language related to jpmorgan inspection rights,in contrast,is consistent,unambiguous,and not circumscribed by any similar limitation.the winget guaranty,the guaranty,and the venco guaranty each unequivocally state that,with respect to the inspection rights,an action for specific performance injunctive relief can be brought at any time following an alleged violation.winget argues that we must look to the intention of the parties,and that the intention of the parties is clear from the contractual language.he specifically relies on iii of both the and venco guaranties,where the parties state that they intended that this guaranty and the collateral provided by the pledge agreement from the guarantor shall be realized upon by the administrative agent only as a last resort.
in other words,winget contends that jpmorgan may seek recovery from and venco only if no other assets are reasonably available.but jpmorgan is not seeking recovery from and venco.rather,jpmorgan is simply seeking to exercise its right to inspect the financial records of those two companies,a right that it may exercise through an action for specific performance at any time following an alleged violation.here the alleged violation is winget denial of jpmorgan request,sent by letter in september of,to inspect the financial records of and venco.
moreover,the winget guaranty,upon which the instant action is based,contains no reasonable efforts provision and no reference to recovery as a last resort.the absence of a reasonable efforts provision is a compelling indication that the parties did not intend that any of jpmorgan inspection rights under the winget guaranty would be circumscribed by such a requirement.this interpretation is consistent with the stated intention of the and venco guaranties that recovery must first be sought from other assets owned or controlled by winget.
because the last sentence of of the winget guaranty explicitly permits jpmorgan to exercise its inspection rights under d i at any time following an alleged violation,we conclude that the reasonable efforts provisions are inapplicable to such rights.jpmorgan was thus entitled to a judgment on the pleadings on this issue.
c.the specific performance order 
winget has also raised a number of arguments related to the propriety of specific performance as a remedy for jpmorgan alleged injury,and he challenges the scope of the district court order.in particular,he claims that jpmorgan failed to properly plead irreparable harm and clean hands,jpmorgan has not shown that winget has the authority to produce the financial records requested for inspection,and the order is improper because it entangles the district court in the supervision of the inspection process and is unnecessary because winget can satisfy his obligations under the agreement through the payment of million.
winget asserts that michigan law is settled that specific performance of a contract requires the plaintiff to allege and prove that it will suffer irreparable harm from a breach such that damages are not an adequate remedy.because jpmorgan failed to plead irreparable harm,winget argues,specific performance can not be granted.this argument,however,misstates the elements of specific performance under michigan law.
an inadequate remedy at law,not irreparable harm,is what must be alleged and proven in a claim for specific performance.laker soverinsky,specific performance will not be decreed where there is an adequate remedy at law.although one of the cases cited by winget,barbers local sealy,uses the term irreparable harm,it uses the term as synonymous with the more commonplace inadequate remedy at law.see lamar detroit apartments,explaining that specific performance rests on the incompleteness or inadequacy of the remedy at law as applied to the contract sought to be specifically enforced under the facts shown.
jpmorgan complaint in this case states that 
s pecific performance is appropriate and necessary.the agent will lack an adequate remedy at law if winget,through his control of and venco,engages in a liquidation,divestment,sale of assets,or any other course of action or dealing that results in a material diminution of the value of the foreign subsidiaries owned by and venco.in addition,allegations of misconduct and financial manipulation made in numerous lawsuits currently pending against winget raise concern as to whether winget remains in compliance with the covenants referred to in above.only through inspection of the records and assets that form the basis of the pledged shares value can the agent verify the value of its collateral and ensu
