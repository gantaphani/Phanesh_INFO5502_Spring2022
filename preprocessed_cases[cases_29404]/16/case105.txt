this case presents facial challenges under both state and federal law to two local ordinances enacted by the city of springfield.in broad terms,the ordinances impose new legal duties on property owner s to maintain property during the foreclosure process and provide a cash bond per foreclosure to the city and on mortgagees to attempt a settlement through a new particular system of negotiations before foreclosing.as to the first ordinance,the central point of contention is that its definition of owner includes mortgagees who are not in possession and have begun the foreclosure process,and it appears to impose these duties on foreclosing mortgagees regardless of whether the mortgagors are still in possession.
objecting to the imposition of these new duties,six banks brought this suit in state court,seeking to have the ordinances invalidated as inconsistent with and preempted,under both field and conflict preemption principles,by the comprehensive state laws governing foreclosure and property maintenance,and as inconsistent with federal and state constitutional guarantees.the plaintiff banks seek declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the city from enforcing the ordinances.the city removed the case to federal court on the grounds of federal question jurisdiction the banks filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,which the city opposed and countered with a to dismiss or for summary judgment.the district court decided that the ordinances were valid and granted the city motion.see easthampton sav.bank city of springfield,d.the banks now appeal,seeking reversal and entry of judgment in their favor.because the outcome of this case turns on unresolved questions of massachusetts law and raises significant policy concerns better suited for resolution by the massachusetts supreme judicial court,we certify the dispositive state law questions to that court.see.
the housing market collapse of led to a significant increase in the number of mortgage foreclosures,both nationally and in massachusetts.the city of springfield was particularly by foreclosures and concluded that properties left vacant during or after foreclosure can threaten the public safety by,among other things,attracting criminal activity or drawing squatters who,without any available utilities,may cause fires.these harms can in turn lower the values of neighboring properties,causing more foreclosures and creating a vicious circle.
in response,the city enacted the two ordinances relating to foreclosures.the first,the foreclosure ordinance,requires owner s of properties in the foreclosure process to provide hour security personnel or else secure all doors and windows,remove hazardous materials,turn off utilities,clear any trash or standing water,and maintain liability insurance,among other things see springfield.ordinances ch.et.it also defines the term owner to include mortgagees who have begun the foreclosure process,regardless of whether the mortgagee is in possession.id.ch.we set forth the ordinance full definition of owner in the appendix.the ordinance also requires owners to provide to the springfield building commissioner a cash bond of at least within thirty days of the property becoming vacant or within fifteen days of initiating the foreclosure process.if the owner fails to comply with the ordinance terms,the cash bond will be used to defray the city cost of maintaining the property.if the owner does comply,the bond is later returned,less some portion kept by the city to cover its administrative expenses the portion retained by the city may be used to fund the city expenses on other properties,including properties in which the owner has no interest.see id.ch.a.
the second ordinance,the mediation ordinance,requires mortgagors and mortgagees involved in a foreclosure of an residential property to participate in good faith in an approved mediation program.the mortgagee is subject to paying about of the cost of the mediation program.the ordinance says,inter alia,that a mortgagee must give good faith consideration to loan restructuring or forgiveness.the mediation ordinance inhibits a mortgagee from moving forward with a foreclosure otherwise authorized by state law without presenting a certificate from the mediator confirming that the mortgagee has participated in the mediation in good faith.it provides strong incentives to participate during the right to cure period established by state law.the penalty for noncompliance is a per day fine for the duration of the right to cure period.see springfield.ordinances ch.both ordinances apply retroactively to mortgages that existed on their effective date of december.
the banks brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief.in its present posture,their case rests on three primary arguments the ordinances violate the contracts clause of the constitution under the massachusetts constitution,the ordinances are preempted by massachusetts state law and the ordinances violate the massachusetts constitution by imposing an illegal tax.this opinion concerns certification of the last two claims raised by the banks.
the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc permits a federal court to certify a question to it if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this court.this case meets those requirements.and this court has a long history of certifying appropriate questions to the sjc.see,real estate bar ass for,real estate info,cir ropes gray llp jalbert in re engage,cir bos.gas century indem,cir globe newspaper beacon hill architectural comm n,cir.the sjc has affirmatively responded to those certified questions.
which may be determinative 
the issues of state law will be determinative in this case.the banks have raised two state claims as well as a claim under the contracts clause of the constitution.regardless of whether the ordinances violate the contracts clause as applied to contracts,only a decision based on state law or the massachusetts constitution will give the banks the full measure of relief they seek.as the ordinances are applied prospectively,the only issues are those of state law this satisfies the sjc requirement that the state law issues may be determinative of the case.as a result,we need not now reach the banks contracts clause argument because the state law issues,which will be determinative with respect to mortgages created after the enactment date of the ordinances,will also be determinative as to those existing before the enactment date.
no controlling precedent 
we have interpreted the sjc requirement that there be no controlling precedent to prevent certification in cases when the course the state court would take is reasonably clear.in re engage,at quoting nieves of,cir alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.the course that the state court would take is not reasonably clear when a case presents a close and difficult legal issue.id.this case presents close and difficult legal issues,and we can not say that the course that the sjc would take is reasonably clear.
to be sure,the legal standards to apply are relatively apparent with respect to the banks field and conflict preemption claims.see george greek orthodox cathedral of,fire dep t of springfield,l ocal action is precluded either where the legislature has made an explicit indication of its intention in this respect,or the purpose of state legislation would be frustrated so as to warrant an inference that the legislature intended to preempt the field.quoting town of wendell att y,tri nel,bd.of health of barnstable,providing for preemption if there is a sharp conflict between local ordinance and state law quoting take five vending,provincetown,fafard conservation comm of barnstable.but the application of those standards is difficult,and the outcome far from certain in this case.
