opinion of the court 
this appeal asks us to consider the circumstances in which a purchaser of assets bears liability for delinquent employee benefit fund contributions under the employee retirement income security act erisa as a successor in interest to the seller of those assets.appellant william einhorn,on behalf of employee benefit funds established pursuant to erisa,brought suit to recover unpaid contributions from appellee ruberton construction company.according to einhorn,ruberton was obligated to contribute to the benefit funds under two collective bargaining agreements as a successor employer to the original signatory,statewide safety.the district court applied the traditional common law rule of successorship liability,found that ruberton was not a continuation of statewide,and granted ruberton motion for summary judgment.einhorn appeals 
einhorn is the administrator of the teamsters pension trust fund and welfare fund of philadelphia and vicinity collectively,the funds.the funds are multiemployer benefit plans established pursuant to various provisions of erisa,et,and section c of the labor management relations act lmra,c.
statewide,a highway construction company with facilities in new jersey,plays an integral role in the dispute,although it is not a party to this lawsuit.under two collective bargaining agreements cbas with teamsters local union,statewide was required to make contributions to the funds.
in,statewide faced a series of financial hardships and the prospect of being debarred from public contract work in new jersey based on allegations of fraud.meanwhile,the funds began an audit of statewide payroll records,which revealed delinquencies owed under the aforementioned cbas.the delinquencies,including liquidated damages,totaled close to.
around this time ruberton,a general construction company,learned of statewide financial difficulties and entered into negotiations with statewide for ruberton purchase of statewide assets.local learned of the potential transaction and filed suit for an injunction because it feared that ruberton,a employer,would not agree to become party to statewide cbas.the district court issued a temporary restraining order tro enjoining consummation of the sale.soon after the tro was issued,negotiations began among local,statewide,and ruberton,this time with the union rights represented.
at the first meeting,einhorn discussed statewide delinquent contributions to the funds with statewide principal officer george smith and ruberton president andrew berenato.berenato testified that at that meeting he heard einhorn tell smith that statewide owed the funds about a half a million dollars.app.at.some days later,there was a second meeting among the same individuals.
according to berenato,ruberton principal objective during the second meeting,since they knew there was a problem with statewide and the funds,was to ensure that ruberton would not be held the successor to them and liable for that debt.app.at.for his part,einhorn aimed to protect the funds interest in delinquent and future contributions.local sought to ensure that ruberton would hire its workers hitherto employed by statewide,rather than continuing to use workers.by the end of this meeting,two agreements were executed.
the first agreement,between local and statewide,guaranteed that the union would dismiss the injunction suit without prejudice,and statewide promised to cooperate fully with the funds payroll audit and to timely remit all future contributions.the second agreement,between local and ruberton,provided that ruberton would hire,subject to its work needs,the existing workforce of statewide covered by the existing cba,that such employment would be governed by that cba on an interim basis,and a newly negotiated cba would cover all ruberton employees.neither agreement addressed ruberton potential successor liability to the funds for the delinquent contributions 
four days after the second meeting,on october,statewide sold its assets to ruberton for million in cash ruberton began making contributions to the funds in december that year.simultaneous with the sale,a real estate holding company related to ruberton,ral real estate,leased statewide facility in folsom,new jersey.under the lease agreement another entity related to ruberton,brianna,thereafter exercised its option to purchase the facility from statewide and leased the facility to ruberton.ruberton hired more than half of statewide former employees in the months following the sale,including its vice president and percent shareholder,and took over several of statewide projects.approximately two months after the sale,ruberton auctioned off many of the assets it had purchased from statewide that were not used in the expanded operations,realizing just more than.
statewide remained in business for some time after the asset sale using subcontractors to provide the necessary equipment and labor.ruberton was one such subcontractor,billing statewide more than for rented employees and equipment.in january,statewide ceased all field operations.a shareholder from statewide retained an office at the site now occupied by ruberton to wind down the business.ruberton profits increased as a result of the sale and the company is still engaged in the highway construction business.
on december,einhorn filed an action against statewide and ruberton.einhorn alleged that statewide owed the funds pursuant to the operative cbas and that ruberton owed the funds as a successor in interest to statewide.the parties reached a settlement agreement on march,wherein statewide agreed to pay the delinquent contributions in a series of installments.statewide breached the settlement agreement and einhorn filed the present action against ruberton in june the following week,einhorn obtained a judgment against statewide in the prior suit for the breach,which einhorn has been unable to enforce

at issue in this appeal is whether ruberton may be held liable for statewide debts to the funds under a theory of successor liability.it is settled that successor liability may be imposed for delinquent erisa fund contributions in the context of a merger.teamsters pension trust fund of phila.vicinity littlejohn,cir holding that under the federal common law,the surviving entity in a merger is liable for the debts of the predecessor regardless of whether the successor had notice of such debts.as the district court found and is undisputed by the parties,however,the transaction between statewide and ruberton was not a merger.rather,the transaction here was one in which a corporate entity bought the assets of another corporate entity.liability under that situation is not well settled.
at the district court,both parties assumed that the seventh circuit decision in upholsterers int l union pension fund artistic furniture of pontiac,cir,provided the applicable rule of law in the case.artistic furniture held that a successor purchaser of assets may be liable for the seller delinquent erisa fund contributions to vindicate important federal statutory policy where the buyer had notice of the liability prior to the sale and there was sufficient evidence of continuity of operations between the entities.id.at.in so holding,the seventh circuit departed from the general common law rule that an entity that purchases the assets of another does not assume the seller liabilities unless one of the following exceptions applies the purchaser expressly or impliedly assumed liability the transaction amounted to a de facto merger the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller or the transfer of assets was for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for unpaid debts.id.at.
the district court declined to follow the expanded successorship doctrine espoused by the seventh circuit in artistic furniture.guided by this court precedents,the district court distinguished golden state bottling nlrb,upon which the seventh circuit relied in artistic furniture.the district court interpreted our prior decision in littlejohn to hold that universal concepts of corporate law supplied the federal common law rule of successor liability in the present erisa case.because the district court found that none of the exceptions permitting liability applied,it granted ruberton motion for summary judgment.
the supreme court has recognized that striking a balance between the conflicting legitimate interests of the bona fide successor,the public,and the affected employee s to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility.golden state,at citations and quotations omitted see also eeoc vucitech,cir noting that successor liability is dreadfully tangled,reflecting the difficulty of striking the right balance between the competing interests at stake.while this court appreciates the district court efforts to balance the interests,like the seventh circuit we feel constrained to disagree with its ruling that labor law successorship principles can not support the imposition of liability upon ruberton.artistic furniture,at.
federal courts beginning with golden state have developed a federal common law successorship doctrine imposing liability upon successors beyond the confines of the common law rule when necessary to protect important policies.see brzozowski corr.physician,cir.in golden state,the supreme court held that the purchaser of a business could be held liable under the national labor relations act nlra for remedying the seller unlawful discharge of an employee where the successor employer had notice of the unfair practice and continued,without interruption or substantial change,the predecessor business operations.at.the remedy required that the successor reinstate the employee with back pay.
the supreme court acknowledged in golden state that the successor company was not party to the unfair labor practices and now operate s the business without any connection with his predecessor.id.at quotations omitted.nonetheless,it stated,other factors must be taken into account when balancing the equities.among those equities is that the successor is generally in the best position to remedy the violation and,because notice is required,potential liability can be reflected in the price the successor pays for the business,or the successor may secure an indemnity clause in the sales contract.id.quotations omitted.moreover,throughout its analysis,the supreme court emphasized the importance of providing protection for the victimized employee without a remedy against the now defunct predecessor entity.id.at.
as noted by the seventh circuit,golden state laid the foundation for a series of cases in this court and others that expanded successorship liability in the labor field holding that labor policies have superseded the competing interest of fluidity of corporate assets reflected in the common law rule.artistic furniture,at 
this court,following golden state,has extended the labor law successorship doctrine to employment discrimination claims under title vii.see brzozowski,rego arc water treatment of,cir in brzozowski,the plaintiff brought an action against her former employer alleging gender discrimination that resulted in of damages.at.when the plaintiff realized that the company was insolvent,she asserted a claim against the successor who had purchased the company assets.id.
taking into consideration the three principal factors applicable to successor liability in the employment discrimination context,we found that imposition of successor liability was appropriate because the successor was on notice,there was sufficient continuity of operations and workforce,and the predecessor was unable to provide adequate relief.id.at.we considered the balance of equities and the prime consideration of fairness.id.the had ample opportunity to insulate itself from liability during the negotiations.indeed,the sales agreement included an indemnity clause disclaiming the successor liability for certain law suits and eeoc claims.id.at.
our cases extending successorship liability from the nlra to the title vii context suggest important principles.first,we have not confined the theory of successor liability after an asset sale to the nlra context,but have extended it to other contexts based on the balance of equities.second,the imposition of a financial burden on the successor employer has not restricted imposition of liability see artistic furniture,at there is,of course,no relevant economic difference between the award of backpay or compensatory damages at issue in our previous successor liability cases and the delinquent contribution liability at issue here.the requirement of notice and the ability of the successor to shield itself during negotiations temper concerns that imposing successor liability might discourage corporate transactions.
we agree with the seventh circuit that the federal policies underlying erisa and the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa,stat,are no less important,and no less compel the imposition of successor liability than do the policies animating the nlra,title vii,or the other statutes to which the doctrine has been extended.id.in light of the seventh circuit comprehensive analysis,we need not reinvent the wheel.rather,we will address some of the concerns raised by the district court and summarize the principal considerations that provide our ratio decidendi.
a central policy goal underlying erisa enactment was to protect plan participants and their beneficiaries.littlejohn,at see also shaw delta air lines,erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.pittsburgh mack sales,int l union of operating eng rs,cir erisa was enacted to ensure that pension funds will be adequately funded,even when employers withdraw from them,and that employees who are relying on those funds will be protected.becker mack trucks,cir erisa is designed to protect benefits promised to an employee arising from a employment relationship.congress evinced a strong desire to further protect participants when it enacted the mppaa,which amended erisa to prevent the adverse consequences that result when individual employers terminate their participation or withdraw from multiemployer pension plans.supervalu,bd.of,cir quotations omitted.
statewide failure to pay contributions caused harm to plan beneficiaries and changed the nature of the employment relationship.as the district court noted during the settlement hearing in january,the health and welfare fund suspended benefits after the sale,leaving union workers and,in some cases,their families without health insurance.absent imposition of successor liability on ruberton,other employers will be forced to make up the difference to ensure that workers receive their entitled benefits.if these outcomes were permitted,it would contravene congressional policy for multiemployer pension funds.see artistic furniture,at providing an in depth discussion of the legislative history.
the rule promulgated in artistic furniture comports with our opinion in littlejohn.as noted above,we held in littlejohn that successor liability for delinquent erisa fund contributions could be imposed after a merger without notice.in so doing,we relied in part on the almost universally accepted state law principle that when two corporations merge,the surviving corporation assumes the liabilities of the extinct corporation.littlejohn,at.because the present case involves an asset sale rather than a merger,the universally accepted principle adopted in littlejohn does not directly apply here.
however,littlejohn established a framework by which to determine successor liability under erisa.as we stated in littlejohn,where the statute does not provide explicit instructions,it is well settled that congress intended that the federal courts would fill in the gaps by developing,in light of reason,experience,and com
