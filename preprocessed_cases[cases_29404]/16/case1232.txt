appellants severn peanut and severn insurer allege breach of contract and negligence claims against appellee industrial fumigant ifc.according to severn,ifc improperly applied a dangerous pesticide while fumigating severn peanut dome,resulting in fire,an explosion,loss of approximately pounds of peanuts,loss of business,and various cleanup costs.the district court for the eastern district of north carolina awarded summary judgment to ifc.because the contract consequential damages exclusion bars severn breach of contract claim,and because north carolina does not allow severn to veil that claim in tort law,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on april,severn and ifc entered into a pesticide application agreement paa requiring ifc to use phosphine,a pesticide,to fumigate a peanut storage dome owned by severn and located in severn,north carolina.the paa required ifc to apply the pesticide in a manner consistent with instructions and precautions set forth in its labeling.
in return for ifc services,severn promised to pay ifc plus applicable sales taxes.the contract specified,however,that this charge was based solely upon the value of the services provided and was not related to the value of severn premises or the contents therein.the contract also specified that this sum was not sufficient to warrant ifc assuming any risk of incidental or consequential damages to severn property,product,equipment,downtime,or loss of business.id.
phosphine is a pesticide often produced in either tablet or pellet form.upon reaction with moisture in the air,the tablets or pellets produce a toxic and flammable gas.phosphine is regulated by the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra and the north carolina pesticide law of.both laws require that it be administered only in a manner consistent with its labeling.a g.b.the product label of the brand of phosphine used by ifc,fumitoxin,in turn requires that the user avoid piling fumitoxin tablets up on top of each other when applying the pesticide.
on august,ifc dumped approximately tablets of fumitoxin into severn peanut dome through a single access hatch.this caused the tablets to pile up on one another.a fire began on or around august,and it continued to smolder despite the parties firefighting efforts.on august an explosion occurred,and the peanut dome sustained extensive structural damage.after all was said and done,severn insurer,plaintiff travelers insurance,paid severn over million to cover the loss of nearly pounds of peanuts,lost business income,the damage to the peanut dome,and severn remediation and fire suppression costs.
on january,severn,its insurer,and its parent company filed an amended complaint against ifc and rollins,ifc parent company,in the eastern district of north carolina.according to severn,ifc improper application of phosphine tablets caused the fire and explosion and gave rise to claims for negligence,negligence per se,and breach of contract.on march,the district court granted partial summary judgment to ifc and rollins,holding that the paa consequential damages exclusion barred severn claim for breach of contract.several months later,as the parties were preparing for trial on severn remaining negligence claims,the district court sua sponte ordered briefing on the issue of contributory negligence.after receipt of the parties briefs,and on its own motion,the district court found severn contributorily negligent and awarded summary judgment to ifc and rollins on severn remaining negligence claims.this appeal,contesting both of the district court summary judgment orders,followed.
severn argues that the paa consequential damages exclusion does not bar its breach of contract claim for damage to its dome and peanuts and its associated remediation and lost business costs.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
before examining the parties particular consequential damages exclusion,it is worth considering the utility of consequential damages limitations in general.in north carolina,
consequential or special damages for breach of contract are those claimed to result as a secondary consequence of the defendant.they are distinguished from general damages,which are based on the value of the performance itself,not on the value of some consequence that performance may produce.
pleasant valley promenade lechmere,quoting dan dobbs,law of damages,ed.while recovery for consequential damages may already be limited by the venerable rule that the victim of a breach of contract may be compensated only for those damages that may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract,williams union,quoting hadley baxendale,exch,enforcement of explicit contractual provisions allocating the risk of consequential damages to one party or another further maximizes parties freedom of contract and allows them to better achieve predictability in their business relations.
north carolina follows a broad policy which generally accords contracting parties freedom to bind themselves as they see fit.hall sinclair refining.its courts recognize that the right of private contract is no small part of the liberty of the citizen,and the usual and most important function of courts is therefore to enforce and maintain contracts rather than enable parties to escape their obligations.calhoun wha med.clinic,pllc,quoting tanglewood land wood.
enforcement of contractual liability limitations and damages exclusions is one aspect of this freedom of contract.for this reason,a person may effectively bargain against liability for harm caused by his ordinary negligence in the performance of a legal duty arising out of a contractual relation.hall,at.and while cases examining damages exclusions and liability limitations often necessarily involve bargains that look like raw deals in hindsight,defense of the liberty of contract requires that courts avoid the indulgence of paternalism and respect individuals entitle ment to contract on their own terms.gas house,bell,quoting williston on contracts.
contractual limitations on consequential damages also serve to further predictability in business relations.by allowing parties to bargain over the allocation of risk,freedom of contract permits individuals and businesses to allocate risks toward those most willing or able to bear them.parties who allocate risks away from themselves thereby cap their future expected litigation and liability costs.parties assuming risks often receive benefits in the form of lower prices in exchange.without the ability of contracting parties to protect against the imposition of consequential damages,some consumers might not be able to access needed goods and services at all.here,for example,while severn could have pursued a business strategy of hiring its own certified phosphine applicators and doing its pesticide services,it is not clear that it could have found other outside pesticide services companies willing to perform phosphine applications without assent to consequential damages exclusions like those required by ifc.
the benefits of consequential damages limitations for consumers and producers may explain why they are both widespread and widely enforced.in the context of sales of goods and products liability,for instance,north carolina and many other states follow the uniform commercial code and take the position that c onsequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.this policy of generally enforcing limitations on liability extends beyond the goods context.see,hyatt mini storage on green,enforcing contractual exclusion of liability for personal injury encountered on premises of facility lexington ins.tires into recycled energy supplies,enforcing lease provision limiting liability for fire damages covered by insurance.far from an outlandish exculpation of responsibility,consequential damage limitations like that in ifc and severn paa appear to be tools of doing business used throughout north carolina and many other states.
having reviewed north carolina background law,we turn to an examination of the particular consequential damages limitati
