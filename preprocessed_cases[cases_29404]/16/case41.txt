cne direct,cne is a massachusetts corporation in the business of buying and reselling bulk technological components.in november,cne reached an agreement with asset recovery associates worldwide,asset to purchase phone parts manufactured by blackberry corporation blackberry.asset thereafter failed to make the parts available at the price,causing cne to suffer a substantial loss in connection with its own commitment to resell the parts to other parties.in addition to suing asset,cne seeks to hold blackberry itself liable,contending that asset was acting as blackberry actual or apparent agent in the november transaction.after each party marshalled its best evidence following full discovery,and after entering default judgment against the asset,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of blackberry.cne direct,blackberry,cv fds,wl,at.after considering cne appeal,we affirm.
background 
as this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to cne,the,and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see martinez petrenko,cir.
on october,asset received an email from blackberry stating that it was looking to move excess memory parts and listing its excess units.asset forwarded the email to cne.cne thereafter entered into discussions with asset on the terms pursuant to which asset would supply the blackberry parts to cne.according to cne,cne and asset eventually reached agreement on the terms of a sale.cne then sent asset a purchase order to confirm the deal.the purchase order identified asset as the supplier of the parts and stated the price.asset then backtracked,first demanding a price increase of approximately,then an increase of approximately.cne claims that asset was an orchestrated attempt by blackberry to take advantage of cne position of weakness.cne complained to asset,and also sought intercession by blackberry,which declined.
as we will discuss,there was nothing about the foregoing transaction and dealings in october and november that would support an argument that asset acted as an actual or apparent agent of blackberry.as cne points out,though,it had prior dealings with asset for the purchase and sale of blackberry parts.those prior dealings,cne argues,provide a course of conduct,or at least context,sufficient to cast the aborted november transaction in a different light.so we turn to consider those prior dealings.
in may,christopher tejeda,then a trader at cne,first called blackberry to inquire about purchasing excess inventory.he reached chris efstathiou,the individual responsible for managing blackberry excess inventory.during their initial phone conversation,efstathiou told tejeda that if he wanted to purchase blackberry excess inventory,he should speak to stephen miele,the individual in control of asset.at the time,asset was one of many resellers to which blackberry sold its excess inventory.cne suspected this was the case by october and knew it to be true by october,notwithstanding miele best efforts to hold himself out as the exclusive source of blackberry parts or as blackberry agent and blackberry apparent lack of interest in helping to connect cne with a different inventory reseller.
cne thereafter dealt with miele.an initial phone call between tejeda and miele in may led to additional conversations regarding the available blackberry parts and negotiations over cne bid for the parts.once cne and asset reached an agreement,cne prepared a purchase order to confirm the purchase price,listing a company affiliated with asset as the supplier.when asset passed this documentation along to blackberry,blackberry objected and asked that it instead be listed as the supplier.cne changed the purchase order form to accommodate this request,received an invoice from blackberry in return,and wired the funds directly to blackberry.blackberry,in turn,paid asset a five percent commission on the sale.
the next relevant transaction,in august,followed a slightly different course.viewing the record most favorably to cne,it appears that blackberry first passed along a list of its excess inventory to asset.asset disseminated the lists to its customers,including cne,seeking bids.asset then collated the bids it received and shared the amounts of bids and identities of the bidders with blackberry,profiting by reserving for itself a markup on the products that varied between approximately and of the bid no written agreement governed the terms of asset relationship with blackberry,though the parties operated under an understanding that blackberry retained the right to refuse to sell to asset based on the amount it was willing to pay for the parts or the identity of the intended downstream purchaser 
once cne placed its bid with asset and blackberry had informed asset that the bid was acceptable,cne confirmed the transaction by issuing to asset a purchase order memorializing the price.asset then remitted a pro forma invoice to confirm the exact quantity of goods that would be sold.as with the original transaction,cne purchase order identified blackberry as the supplier.unlike the first transaction,cne did not pay blackberry but instead wired funds to asset or its affiliates.
between august and august,the parties conducted seven transactions for blackberry parts that followed this pattern and amounted to approximately.at no point in the parties dealings did asset take physical possession of the goods.rather,cne retrieved the parts at blackberry warehouse.
over time,cne grew frustrated with miele conduct.on august,cne emailed blackberry and expressed frustration with miele.on october,cne emailed blackberry to complain about miele lack of professionalism.cne at that point had determined that miele was untrustworthy and had lied to cne repeatedly.blackberry response,from a new manager who had taken over blackberry dealings with asset,characterized cne acquisition of the parts as involving two transactions,one between blackberry and asset,and a second between asset and cne.consistent with this characterization,the emailed response concluded as follows 
as for professional business standards,the purchase of the lcd was between you and stephen and that is the forum that should be maintained is it not sorry,but i do wish to get in the middle between yourself and stephen as relationships are important to myself and rim as a whole.i suggest you need to deal on this with stephen.i am not sure how else i can help you in this situation.
when cne thereafter emailed blackberry to try to address miele dealings with cne,blackberry called and turned down cne flatly,telling cne that it ha d to discuss it with miele.
after this conversation,cne and asset entered into one additional transaction in.then,in august,miele told cne to change the supplier listed on future purchase orders to asset,rather than blackberry.cne did so,and entered into at least six additional transactions totaling approximately following this new practice prior to the aborted november transaction.during this time,blackberry and asset appear to have had no further communication,save,perhaps,brief exchanges relating to the logistics of picking up inventory at blackberry warehouse.asset occasionally interfaced with blackberry to facilitate pickup on cne behalf.in one october email sent by catherine miele stephen miele wife and apparently an asset employee to blackberry,she explained that asset ordered the parts i sold the parts to cn direct sic and they are sending their trucker to pick up the parts.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.martinez,at.the moving party is entitled to summary judgment if it shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.
the parties agree that massachusetts law governs.t he question of agency,the massachusetts supreme judicial court has held,is usually an issue for the fact finder,but summary judgment can be appropriate if the party asserting the existence of an agency relationship fail s to advance specific facts sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to the putative agent a
