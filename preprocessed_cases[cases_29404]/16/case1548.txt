oca,formerly doing business as orthodontic centers of america,orthalliance new image,orthodontic centers of texas,pedoalliance,and orthalliance,collectively oca directly appeal the january,interlocutory order of the bankruptcy court granting partial summary judgment and holding that the business services agreements or management agreements collectively the bsas that oca entered with a number of orthodontists and their professional corporations collectively the orthodontists were illegal under texas law.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
this case arises out of a dispute over various bsas,which oca had entered into with orthodontists in the state of texas according to the terms of the bsas,oca purchased or leased office space and purchased equipment for each office.oca was also responsible for billing patients,filing insurance claims,hiring nondental personnel,setting dress codes,and managing a bank account through which the dental practice funds flowed.the orthodontists were not authorized to withdraw funds from the operating account,so oca periodically transferred money from these accounts to pay the orthodontists their compensation.in exchange,the orthodontists agreed to work a minimum number of hours each week at the practice and not to perform orthodontic work outside that office.the orthodontist would receive an hourly rate for seeing patients,and oca would receive an hourly management fee in addition to being reimbursed for its overhead.profits were then split according to the respective ownership interests of oca and the orthodontists.the bsas were to be in force for long periods of time,some up to forty years,and their terms severely restricted the orthodontists ability to terminate or assign them.
the orthodontists entered this case at various points in the litigation stream.appellee orthodontist buck initially brought suit against orthalliance,in texas state court seeking an accounting and a declaration that his bsa was void for illegality under texas law.the case was removed to federal court and later transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of texas on november.appellee orthodontist cole brought a similar suit that was eventually consolidated with buck case and others in penny orthalliance,penny,case,in the northern district of texas,in june the district court severed cole and buck cases from the penny litigation in july.oca filing for chapter protection in the proceedings below in the eastern district of louisiana stayed cole and buck cases on march.the bankruptcy court,however,lifted the stay for the purpose of allowing the northern district of texas district court to rule on whether buck and cole bsas were void for illegality under texas law.on november,the district court for the northern district of texas held that the bsas were void for illegality because they were nearly identical to the contracts in penny that were held to be illegal under texas occupation code a.the district court then transferred the remainder of the case to the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of louisiana.
appellee orthodontist izzard terminated his bsa in april,before oca filed for bankruptcy.appellees orthodontists wells,doan,dillingham,crosby,jordan,and woodworth were still performing under their respective bsas when oca filed for bankruptcy.
after filing for chapter protection,oca,as debtor in possession,commenced adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy court against hodgkins and izzard seeking a declaration that their bsas were not void for illegality under texas law.appellees orthodontists doan,crosby,wells,and dillingham brought adversary proceedings seeking to have their bsas declared void for illegality.in a contested proceeding,appellee orthodontist woodworth filed a motion for summary judgment,which sought to have his bsa declared void for illegality.the bankruptcy court held a joint hearing to determine the legality of all of the texas bsas on january.at this hearing,the bankruptcy court announced from the bench that it was granting the orthodontists motions for partial summary judgment and holding that the bsas were void for illegality under texas law based on several prior texas federal district court rulings in similar cases.the bankruptcy court entered its order granting partial summary judgment on january.
on january,oca moved to have the bankruptcy court certify its interlocutory judgment for direct appeal under d,and the orthodontists moved to have the january,order made final.on march,the bankruptcy court granted oca motion and certified that the requirements to directly appeal its january,order to the fifth circuit were present.it also denied the orthodontists motions to make its earlier judgment final oca filed its petition for direct review of the bankruptcy court interlocutory order with the fifth circuit on march.the petition was granted on may.
jurisdiction 
oca directly appealed to this court the bankruptcy court january,interlocutory order pursuant to d.this statute was enacted to provide for direct review of bankruptcy court judgments,orders,or decrees by the applicable court of appeals in cases where the bankruptcy court or the district court certify that there is no controlling decision from the supreme court or circuit court,the case involves a matter of public importance,there are conflicting precedents,or an immediate appeal may materially advance the progress of the bankruptcy proceeding.d a i iii.if this certification is made,the applicable court of appeals has jurisdiction if it authorizes the direct appeal.id.d a.
on march,the bankruptcy court certified that this case met the requirements for direct appeal because it involved a question of law on which there was no controlling decision by the fifth circuit or the supreme court,it involved a matter of public importance,and a direct appeal would materially advance the progress of the case.a panel from this court granted oca petition for leave to appeal under section d.the only question is whether section d permits this court to hear direct appeals from interlocutory orders of bankruptcy courts 
the text of the statute grants the courts of appeals jurisdiction of appeals described in the first sentence of subsection a.id.d a emphasis added.the first sentence of section a grants district courts jurisdiction over bankruptcy appeals from interlocutory orders or decrees if granted leave by the district court.id.a.since interlocutory orders are included in the first sentence of subsection a and all of the other jurisdictional prerequisites of section d are met,this court has jurisdiction to hear oca direct appeal from the bankruptcy court 
since this is an appeal from an interlocutory order from the bankruptcy court regarding a question of law on which there is no controlling precedent,we will treat this appeal essentially as we treat certified questions from district courts.see b.
discussion 
the texas occupations code prohibits a person from practicing dentistry without a license.texas defines practicing dentistry as engaging in any one of ten different activities.see.a.in this case,the bankruptcy court granted the orthodontists motions for partial summary judgment and held that the bsas between oca and the orthodontists were void for illegality because they enabled oca,which is unlicensed,to practice dentistry without a license by owning,maintaining,or operating a place of business in which it employed or engaged by contract someone else to practice dentistry.a oca argues that this ruling was erroneous because it is a corporation and is hence not a person under section a,the bankruptcy court should have permitted the parties to use the severability clause in the bsas to cure the bsas illegality,and the bankruptcy court failed to consider whether an assignment of part of oca rights or obligations under the bsas to an affiliate would have rendered the bsas legal.
standard of review applicable law 
when directly reviewing an order from a bankruptcy court,findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.fed.drive fin,jordan,cir.a lower court grant of summary judgment presents a question of law reviewed de novo.since all of the bsa in this appeal involved the practice of dentistry in texas,texas law governs their enforceability.see butner united states,d property interests are created and defined by state law t here is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.
ii.are corporations persons for purposes of section a 
legislation governing the operations of dentists is codified in the texas occupations code the code.when the code was recodified in,the legislature added section,which provides that the government code code construction act,applies to the construction of each provision in this code except as otherwise expressly provided by this code.the texas government code defines the term person to include corporations unless the statute or context in which the word or phrase is used requires a different definition.gov t code.
section a does not contain its own definition of person,but nevertheless,oca argues that the term should not be read to include corporations.the basis of its argument is that the recodification of the code was not meant to enact substantive change in the law and the prior version of section a did not itself expressly include corporations in its definition of person.see.a stating that the revisions were not meant to make any substantive changes.
the previous version of section a provided that anyone who engaged in the following conduct was engaged in dentistry 
any one who owns,maintains or operates any office or place of business where he employs or engages under any kind of contract whatsoever,any other person or persons to practice dentistry as above defined shall be deemed to be practicing dentistry himself,and shall himself be required to be duly licensed to practice dentistry as hereinabove defined and shall be subject to all of the other provisions of this chapter,even though the person or persons so employed or engaged by him shall be duly licensed to practice dentistry as hereinabove defined.stat.emphasis added article.
oca argues that the references to he,himself,and him limit the definition of person to natural persons.
oca also notes that article was passed in along with an identical criminal statute.penal code article,which only applied to natural persons.oca argues that the doctrine of in pari materia requires the civil statute and the penal statute to be read in harmony because they were adopted by the same legislature regarding the same subject matter.see garrett mercantile bank at dallas,braun state.consequently,the civil statute should be read to only apply to natural persons because the criminal statute application was limited to natural persons.
one problem with this argument is that when these statutes were passed texas did not subject corporations to criminal liability.see robert hamilton,corporate criminal liability in texas,noting that texas did not subject corporations to criminal prosecutions at that time see also linda anderson,corporate criminal liability for specific intent crimes and offenses of criminal direction of texas law,mary,stating that the texas penal code was revised in,and that revision incorporated many of professor hamilton suggestions and imposed criminal liability on corporations.since texas did not subject corporations to criminal prosecution before,the fact that article did not apply to corporations tells us little about whether article a,a civil statute,was meant to apply to corporations 
that still leaves oca argument that the previous iteration of section a did not apply to corporations.however,since at least it has been the law in texas that in civil statutes unless a different meaning is apparent from the context the word person includes a corporation.article revised civil statutes of texas,repealed by acts,leg.ch.this provision was essentially replaced by the above referenced provision of.gov t code,likewise enacted by acts,ch.see also,james tardy co tarver,person in texas civil statute includes corporation under article wyche wichita engineering,writ ref same united states texas construction,cir same not citing article.
assuming arguendo that oca argument is correct,we would have to determine how to apply recodified section a when,on the one hand,there is the general legislative directive that the recodification was not meant to make substantive changes to the law.a,and,on the other hand,the current statutory definition of person includes corporations unless the statute or context in which the word or phrase is used requires a different definition.gov t code.when presented with a similar situation,the texas supreme court held that a legislative statement that an amendment did not make substantive changes to a law does not overcome the unambiguous language of a recodified statute that the legislature enacts,even if the language in the new statute does change the prior law.fleming foods of,rylander.in reaching this decision,the texas supreme court noted that if the general statement that none of the changes made during the recodification was allowed to overturn the current plain language in the statute,no citizen would be able to know what the current law was without combing through volumes of session laws.id.at.that was deemed to be an unacceptable result.id.at.given the holding in rylander,the only remaining question would be whether the current statutory language unambiguously includes corporations within the definition of person.as stated above,the code definition of person includes corporations unless the statute text or context requires a different definition.gov t code.the text of the statute does not require a deviation for the general definition because its wording does not refer exclusively to a natural person.a.
this construction is supported by another subsection of the statute and a revisor note.following the definition of what constitutes practicing dentistry,the statute specifically excludes a number of persons from that definition.a.in this section,dental health service corporations incorporated under the texas corporation act are specifically excluded.id.a if corporations were not persons under section a,there would have been no reason for the legislature to specifically exclude these particular entities.additionally,the section revisor note four comments that the previous version of section a article section referred to a person,firm,group,association,or corporation,but that was replaced with person because under section,government code code construction act,person is defined to include a corporation or any other legal entity.that definition applies to the revised law.a revisor note for the revision of article into the occupations code.oca argues that the revisor note is inapplicable because it refers to section a relating to dental appliance fitting,not section a.this objection is misplaced,however,because person has the same meaning throughout section a.
since the plain language of the code unambiguously includes corporations in its definition of person,that language must be given effect even if the previous version of section a did not apply to corporations.
iii.are the bsas illegal 
under texas law,a contract is illegal,and thus void,if the contract obligates the parties to perform an action that is forbidden by the law of the place where the action is to occur.miller lumber.contracts are presumptively legal,so the party challenging the contract carries the burden of proving illegality.franklin jackson,paso,writ denied.when two constructions of a contract are possible,preference will be given to that which does not result in violation of law.lewis davis.
the bankruptcy court,relying on decisions from various federal district courts for the northern,eastern,and western districts of texas interpreting similar bsas,granted partial summary judgment in favor of the orthodontists and held that the bsas were illegal under texas occupation code a because,as written,they allowed oca to practice dentistry without a license by owning,maintaining,or operating a place of business in which oca engaged someone else in the practice of dentistry.see
