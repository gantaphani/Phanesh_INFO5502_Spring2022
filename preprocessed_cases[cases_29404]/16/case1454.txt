appellants filed this suit to recover costs of wreck removal from underwriters of the liftboat andre danos resulting from the capsizing and sinking of that vessel in the gulf of mexico during hurricane katrina.the district court found that the wreck removal costs were covered by the policy but that the value of the salvage of the sunken vessel exceeded the removal costs and denied recovery.
we agree that the costs of removing the wreck are covered but disagree that the value of the salvage exceeded those costs.for reasons that follow,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiff appellant danos marine,danos marine is a louisiana corporation owned by allen danos.danos marine owned two liftboats,andre danos and sarah david.plaintiff appellant danos curole marine contractors,llc danos curole is a louisiana limited liability company owned by allen danos and his brother,hank danos danos curole was the bareboat charterer and operator of the liftboat andre danos.the bareboat charter agreement required danos curole to obtain insurance on andre danos.the charter also required danos curole to return andre danos to danos marine in the same condition as when the charter commenced.danos curole purchased protection indemnity insurance from the underwriters,the defendants appellees.the policy,which included both danos companies as named insureds,included coverage for wreck removal expenses.the hull of andre danos was insured by a different insurer for,with a deductible of.danos curole owned six liftboats,which it operated in addition to the andre danos and the sarah david.
in,allen and hank danos decided to sell all eight liftboats and related assets owned by the two danos companies.they hired an investment banker to present a bid proposal package to prospective purchasers.andre danos was appraised for,and sarah david was appraised for.on august,hercules,a liftboat operator,submitted the highest bid,for all vessels and related assets.the danos companies countered at,and hercules conditionally accepted the.in that hercules conditionally agreed to pay the appraised value of for the andre danos and for the sarah david to the boats owner,danos marine.the remainder of the purchase price was to be paid to danos curole.
the next day hurricane katrina hit the louisiana coastline and capsized the andre danos.shortly after the storm,hercules and the danos companies resumed negotiations.at that point,although the parties knew that andre danos suffered damage,the value of the boat could not be ascertained because it was still submerged.relatedly,the appellants offered evidence that the widespread damage to oilfield equipment in the area drove up the prices of operating liftboats,including the appellants seven other liftboats.according to the appellants,although andre danos obviously lost value,the other seven liftboats appreciated in value due to the destruction of liftboats and other oilfield equipment along the coastline as well as increased demand for this equipment.in other words,the resumed negotiations not only entailed subtracting value from the bid due to the sinking of andre danos,the negotiations also included adding value to the other seven liftboats because their market value had increased due to the change in supply and demand for liftboats after the hurricane.
the parties negotiations ultimately resulted in an agreed purchase price of for all eight vessels.in the amended purchase agreement apa,hercules agreed to pay toward the cost of raising the capsized boat and to reimburse danos for the deductible with respect to the hull policy on andre danos.although andre danos was still submerged at the time of the agreement,the apa contained a schedule that allocated the purchase price among the eight vessels,listing the purchase price of andre danos as.additionally,the parties added article to the agreement to treat the transfer of ownership of andre danos in a different manner than the other seven liftboats,which were to be transferred to hercules at the closing of the transaction.they agreed to transfer the ownership of andre danos on the date repairs were completed or at the closing,whichever occurred later 
on october,danos curole obtained a survey report indicating that the wrecked andre danos has no value as it lies,capsized and partially sunk in the gulf of mexico and is most likely a liability however,a ssuming that the vessel is salvaged under the current no cure,no pay contract,it is the opinion of the undersigned that the hull and salvaged appurtenances would have an estimated value in the range of depending upon the extent of salvage related damage.prior to closing,hercules inquired of hank danos as to how the danos companies wanted the purchase price divided between danos marine,and danos curole marine contractors,llc.hank danos instructed hercules to divide the funds as per the agreement.the sale closed on november.at that time,andre danos had not been removed from the gulf of mexico.
on september,in an attempt to recover andre danos,danos curole entered into a salvage contract with coral marine.coral marine attempted to salvage the vessel but hurricane rita slammed into the gulf,shutting down salvage operations.rita caused the vessel to shift in such a position that coral marine equipment was inadequate to remove it.after rita struck,none of the vessel was showing above the surface of the gulf it was submerged approximately six feet below the surface.coral marine hired don jon marine to remove the wreck.on october,don jon brought the boat to the surface,but the slings broke and the boat sank to the ocean floor.eventually,on may,danos curole contracted with bisso marine to remove the vessel.on may,bisso brought the wrecked vessel to shore.danos curole attempted to sell it for scrap,but the cleaning costs were prohibitive.instead,danos curole had to pay larose salvage scrap to dispose of the wreck.the total cost of removal,including the marking,raising and disposing of the wreck,was.
pursuant to the apa,because andre danos was a total loss,danos curole refunded to hercules.this amount represented the insurance proceeds minus the deductible and hercules share of salvage costs,all as agreed to in the apa.
the danos companies filed a claim with the defendant appellee underwriters for the costs of removing the wreck,and the underwriters denied coverage.the danos companies then filed suit against the underwriters,seeking for the costs of removal.the danos companies filed a motion for partial summary judgment,seeking a ruling that removal costs of the wreck were covered under the policy.the underwriters filed a cross motion for summary judgment,seeking a ruling that coverage was not afforded for these expenses because the removal was not compulsory and alternatively that the amount danos received for the vessel from hercules exceeded the removal costs.the court granted danos motion in part,ruling that the plaintiffs had a duty to remove the vessel because it was an obstruction and therefore the policy covered costs of wreck removal.the court also granted the underwriter motion in part,holding that danos sold the wrecked vessel for and because this exceeded the cost of removing the wreck,danos was not entitled to any recovery.the court then entered a take nothing judgment in favor of the defendants.the danos companies filed a timely notice of appeal and the underwriters.
this appeal requires us to interpret and apply to the facts of this case the following provision in defendant policy which states that it will indemnify the insureds for 
liability for cost or expense of,or incident to,the removal of the wreck of the vessel named herein when such removal is compulsory by law,provided,however,that 
a there shall be deducted from such claim for cost or expenses,the value of any salvage from or which might have been recovered from the wreck,inuring,or which might have inured,to the benefit of the assured.
more specifically,the questions are whether the removal of the wrecked vessel from the gulf of mexico was compulsory by law and what,if any,of the funds involved in the appellants sale of the liftboats to hercules constitute value of any sal
