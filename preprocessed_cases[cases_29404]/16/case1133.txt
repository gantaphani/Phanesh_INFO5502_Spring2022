opinion of the court 
sheldon danuff,skat capital,and joel zychick collectively,appellants challenge a district court order rejecting their claims for compensation under a plan of allocation for a class action settlement.at the threshold,this case requires us to decide whether appellants notice of appeal was timely filed.under the rules of civil and appellate procedure,the notice was timely filed only if the district court order ruling against appellants was not a separate document within the meaning of federal rule of civil procedure.to determine whether the order satisfied the requirement,we must resolve two subsidiary questions whether rule mandates that a district court issue two distinct documents when disposing of a case,and whether a lengthy recitation of facts and procedural history prevents an order from complying with the requirement.
while we reject the contention that the rule requires two separate documents,we hold that a lengthy discussion of facts and procedural history precludes an order from complying with rule.because the final order in this case was not a separate document that triggered the typical appeal period,appellants seemingly late notice of appeal fits in the safe harbor rule and federal rule of appellate procedure a provide,and was timely filed we thus have jurisdiction over the case.
as to the merits,we determine that appellants are not entitled to compensation under the terms of the allocation plan.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant facts are undisputed.appellants held common stock in getko group,which was acquired by cuc international cuc cuc then merged with another company,hfs incorporated,to form cendant corporation cendant.as a result of these combinations,appellants received stock in cendant in exchange for their stock in getko.
cuc accounting irregularities spawned a securities class action suit,filed on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of cendant and cuc and who were injured thereby.a plan of allocation of net settlement fund the plan,which was previously approved by this court,in re cendant,cir,was crafted to resolve all potential claims.as members of the plaintiff class certified by the district court,appellants were entitled to seek compensation from the net settlement fund under the terms of the plan for losses sustained by holding cendant previously cuc stock during the period from may,to august,the class period.this case arises from the claims administrator determination that appellants were not entitled to any compensation.
at issue is the plan netting provision,which ensures that claimants only recover for net losses.all three appellants sold a substantial share of their cendant holdings during the class before the public disclosure of cendant accounting the stock price was artificially inflated due to the accounting irregularities they also sustained considerable losses on securities held after those irregularities were disclosed.each appellant,with the possible exception of skat,made a net gain and skat reaped a net gain unless its losses are computed on the basis of the date on which its shares became freely tradeable september,rather than the date on which its shares were acquired june.processing appellants claims on the basis of the date of acquisition,the claims administrator found that appellants did not merit compensation under the plan because the profits they made by selling stock at artificially inflated prices cancelled out any losses they suffered on stock held after the irregularities were disclosed.
the district court held a hearing to consider the objections of class members whose claims had been rejected.at the hearing,appellants argued that the netting provision should not have been applied to their claims because the part of the plan that governs their compensation does not provide for losses to be offset by gains.the district court rejected this contention,noting that appellants argument was at odds with the commonsense principle embedded in the plan if there were a net impact of the fraud upon a claimant holding as a benefit,then there is little reason to compensate such claimant for any losses.app.
on august,the district court issued an order granting the class lead plaintiffs motion to adopt the claims administrator recommendation to reject all disputed claims the order.it was entered on the docket on august.appellants thought that the district court had not satisfied the requirement of rule,and were apparently under the impression that they could not appeal the order until a complementary judgment was separately entered hence,on january,appellants filed a motion for entry of judgment on the order.appellants now claim that this motion was rendered moot on january,when they say entry of judgment was effected by operation of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b b,and they appealed within days thereafter february.
we address two questions.first,we determine whether appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.as noted above,this requires us to decide whether the district court order satisfied the rule.second,assuming appellants notice of appeal was timely filed,we determine whether appellants are entitled to compensation under the plan.
ii.jurisdiction rule 
background 
federal rule of appellate procedure frap conjunction with federal rule of civil procedure out the mechanism for determining when the time to appeal begins.frap a a requires with exceptions irrelevant here that notices of appeal be filed within days after the order appealed from is entered.thus,appellants typically would have had days from the entry of the order to appeal.under frap a a ii,however,if federal rule of civil procedure a requires a separate document to put the parties on notice that the time to appeal has started,the appeal period begins on the earlier of when that separate document is entered or when days have run from the entry of the order in the docket.
because certain exceptions in rule do not apply here,the general requirement of rule governed e very must be set forth on a separate document.a.to know whether appellants appeal was timely,we must determine which date in rule a a ii applies to begin the appeal period august,or january.if the former,appellants on february,too late if the latter,the appeal was timely.the answer depends on whether the district court order qualifies as a separate document.
both rule and rule were amended in.before,if a district court did not enter a separate judgment,the appeal period never thus theoretically never ended.after the amendments,the lack of a separate document only gives the potential appellant another days.the situation for potential appellants is now more certain,but the touchstone of the requirement remains a judgment separate from an opinion or decision.
we face the question whether the order issued by the district court after an oral ruling meets the requirement,as it contains an extensive factual and procedural background discussion.
appellants assert that the order was not a separate document in the way required by rule a.instead,they claim that judgment was entered by operation of law on january,pursuant to rule b b providing that a judgment entered in the civil docket and subject to rule a,but not set forth in a separate document,will be deemed entered when days have run from entry in the civil docket august.one hundred fifty days from august,is january.appellants filed their notice of appeal almost six months after the order was entered but less than days from the date on which appellants claim the judgment was entered by operation of law.whether their notice of appeal was timely filed thus depends on whether the order was a separate document within the meaning of rule a.if it was,appellants notice of appeal was not timely filed and their appeal must be dismissed.
our court application of rule a is controlled by local union,ibew okonite,cir.there we held that an order denomination as an order,rather than a judgment,does not mean that it fails to satisfy the separate document requirement.id instead,we explained that an order will be treated as a separate document if it meets three criteria first,the order must be and separate from the opinion second,the order must note the relief granted and third,the order must omit or at least substantially omit the district court reasons for disposing of the parties claims.see id.noting,by way of qualification as to the third criterion,that some courts of appeals have found that including a bit of analysis does not run afoul of the separate judgment requirement,but reserving judgment on that issue.
the order satisfies the first criterion.the whole just the last presented as an order,rather than an opinion,and this designation is confirmed by the docket.the order is in the sense that it is not stapled or otherwise attached to an opinion or memorandum.indeed,the only opinion that the district court offered was its oral ruling on may,
appellants argue that the order is not separate from the district court prior oral ruling because it is the sole document issued by the district court that purports to dispose of appellants claims.the only authority they cite for this proposition is miller marriott international,cir,where the ninth circuit held that,because the dismissal order provide d the basis for the entry of judgment,it is but a single document,and one document,by definition,can not also constitute a separate document.id.at.
while on its face miller seems logical,we decline to follow it for several reasons.rule does not expressly state that the separate document must be distinct from another document as opposed to an oral decision on the record.and we can not discern any value that would be furthered by finding a rule implicit in the text.hence,the rule is most reasonably read to mean only that the judgment must be set forth in a document that is independent of the court opinion or decision,regardless whether that opinion takes written form.
notably,miller is at odds with every other authority we have found,including earlier ninth circuit precedent.in united states schimmels in re schimmels,cir,for example,that court held that a short order satisfied the requirement even though the order was not followed by an additional document entering judgment.id.at the court observed 
the separate judgment rule does not always require the filing of two separate documents w hen a court enters a short order that clearly constitutes a final decision,that short order meets the separate judgment rule.similarly,if a court grants a summary judgment without writing an opinion or memorandum,then the order granting summary judgment is enough to meet the separate document requirement the separate judgment rule requires that the court enter a judgment or an does not require that a court enter an initial memorandum or opinion.
see also pac.empls.ins.domino pizza,cir u nder rule,a district court is not even required to file two separate documents.laidley mcclain,cir holding that a summary judgment order met the requirement and that the rule thus did not require that two documents be used instead of one,superseded by rule on other grounds united states perez,cir per curiam holding that a district court order did not violate requirement of rule,as t he mere fact that the first sentence of the order adopts the magistrate report and recommendation does not require that two documents be used by the district court rather than one,superseded on other grounds as recognized in kadelski sullivan,cir united states clearfield state bank,cir rejecting as unfounded the argument that two documents are required in all cases,and holding that rule was satisfied where no opinion was written because the order granting summary judgment was itself a separate document.
in short,the order satisfies the first of the three criteria set forth in okonite for a separate document to exist under rule a because it was a document that was separate from the district court oral opinion.
the second criterion set out in okonite is also met,as the order does state the relief granted 
that leaves the third of reasoning.as noted above,our court has yet to rule whether an order that includes a modicum of analysis may satisfy the rule.see okonite,at.we need not resolve this question now,as the prefatory whereas clauses of the order contain only facts,procedural history,and summary reasoning.hence,the practical question we must decide is not whether a little bit of reasoning is acceptable,but whether a protracted recitation of facts and procedural history precludes the order from serving as a separate document under rule a.
the aim of the requirement suggests that a lengthy description of facts and procedural history takes an order outside the realm of rule a.as the supreme court has explained,the sole purpose of the requirement was to clarify when the time for appeal begins to run.bankers trust mallis,d per curiam.clarification was needed because,prior to the adoption of the rule,court clerks would often enter judgments in the civil docket on the basis of opinions or memoranda containing some apparently directive or dispositive words.id.internal quotation marks omitted.if the opinion or memorandum on which an entry was based did not contain all the elements of a judgment,or if the judge later signed a formal judgment,it then became a matter of doubt whether the purported initial entry of a judgment was effective for purposes of starting the appeals period.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the addition of the requirement to rule was intended to eliminate these uncertainties by requiring that there be a judgment set out on a separate from any opinion or memorandum id.quoting.advisory committee notes on amendments emphasis added.
the goal of rule a is to impose a clear line of demarcation between a judgment and an opinion or memorandum.the question thus becomes whether an extensive recitation of facts and procedural history is as fatal,for purposes,as an extensive recitation of legal reasoning and analysis.
conclusions of be either stated orally at the close of evidence or written in an opinion or memorandum.a.neither are to appear in the rule judgment.id.a lengthy overview of background information,while not setting out the basis for a decision as much as does legal reasoning,nevertheless partakes more of a judicial opinion or memorandum than it does of a judgment.just as for legal reasoning,the purpose of providing such a factual overview is not to lay out the relief granted,but to offer context in which the court decision may be understood.because of the purpose of rule eliminate because a putative judgment containing an extensive factual discussion might look to a party more like an opinion than a judgment,the mechanical application of rule does not,we believe,contemplate judgments containing extensive factual recitations to be separate documents.
our conclusion that the requirement does not allow for an extended presentation of facts and procedural history is supported by model forms and of the federal rules of civil procedure judgment on jury verdict and judgment on decision by the court.see.advisory committee notes on amendments.added as part of the amendments to rule,these forms are intended to facilitate mechanical application of the rule by providing examples of qualifying documents.we note the contrast between the forms brief statements of the terms of the judgments and the extended recitation of factual and procedural history in the order before us.
the proposition that an extended presentation of facts and procedural history runs afoul of the requirement also finds support in the case law.see,diamond mckenzie,per curiam holding that a order containing two sentences on the case procedural posture and three sentences summarizing the court conclusions transformed the order into a combined decision and order.indeed,we do not know of any authority holding that facts and procedural history should be treated differently than reasoning for purposes of determining whether an order satisfies the requirement.in all cases of which we are aware,the court analysis has focused on the extent to which the order includes material not traditionally found in a judgment,regardless whether that material consists of facts,history,or reasoning.see,schimmels,at holding that an order denying a motion for reconsideration satisfied the requirement where t he order contains only a recitation of the procedure,documents,and arguments considered by the court in denying the motion.there is no explanation of the reasoning of the court.
here,the district court issued a order,five pages of which were devoted to expounding the background of the case.significantly,this overview was not needed to state the relief granted.see.advisory committee notes on amendments it is easy to prepare a separate document that recites the terms of the judgment without offering additional explanation or citation of authority.emphasis added.nevertheless,the overview and the judgment were both set out in the same document.in these circumstances,the order does not satisfy the requirement.after all,the rule is designed to simplify and make certain the matter of appealability.bankers trust,at.internal quotation marks omitted.that goal would be thwarted by foreclosing an appeal where a party was reasonably in doubt whether a final order complied with the formalities of rule a.see united states indrelunas,d per curiam t he separate document provision is a mechanical change that must be mechanically applied in order to avoid new uncertainties as to the date on which a judgment is entered.internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at.emphasizing that the purpose of the requirement was to remove uncertainties as to when a judgment is entered 
in sum,appellants notice of appeal was only timely if the order was not a separate document within the meaning of rule a.the order was not because it contained an extended discussion of facts and procedural history.this discussion raised doubt to appellants whether a final judgment had been entered.doubt is exactly what the requirement was designed to avoid.see bankers trust,at.rule should be interpreted to prevent loss of the right of appeal,not to facilitate loss.internal quotation marks omitted diamond,at it is precisely this kind of uncertainty about whether the district court intended to enter a final order that warrants the mechanical application of rule.
our decision here is designed to make the mechanical application of rule easier,and simpler,for judges and parties.for judges,the separate judgment should be as minimal as possible to comply with rule requirements,and should include little more see,for example,forms and of the federal rules of civil procedure.in fact,the district court language quoted in our footnote is all that the court needed.for parties,these minimal judgments make clear when the time to appeal is at hand 
in this context,appellants were entitled to consider january,as the magic date to begin their appeal period.filing that appeal on february,was thus timely.
iii.merits 
because the notice of appeal was timely filed,we now reach the merits.we must decide whether the district court erred in granting lead plaintiffs motion to adopt the claims administrator recommendation to reject all disputed claims,including that of appellants.
the backdrop for these rejections is as follows.appellants were denied any payment from the settlement,which they claim to be an error.their principal contention although the different appellants each have different individual arguments is that the district court improperly netted their gains on the sale of cendant stock against the losses calculated under the plan.this netting of gains and losses left them with no payments due under the plan.
section iv of the plan gives specific calculations of allowed loss amounts for each share held to the end of the class period but section v b does two things.first,it matches stock acquisitions with subsequent stock sales on a matching provision.second,it subtracts all profits from any losses to reduce claimant netting provision.we quote section v b in full adding emphasis to show the matching and netting provisions 
for class members who made multiple purchases,acquisitions or sales during the class period,the earliest subsequent sale shall be matched with the earliest purchase and chronologically thereafter for purposes of the claim calculations.
please note all profits shall be subtracted from all losses on all transactions of cuc and cendant securities during the class period to determine the net claim of each class member.if a class member made a net profit,the value of his,her or its claim shall be zero.
appellants all want some recovery based on the shares they held to the end of the class period shares for danuff shares for skat and shares for zychick.each appellant made some profits on the stock they sold during the class period.and the district court found on the netting profits outweighed any losses appellants had on the shares they continued to hold,thus giving them no recovery.
appellants make three arguments in opposition to the plan netting provision.first,all assert that the general netting provision of the plan does not apply to any of them because their specific loss calculations are governed solely by another plan section,which does not contain a netting provision.second,danuff and skat claim that the netting provision does not apply to them because they did not engage in multiple transactions that trigger netting.third,skat contends that,even if deemed subject to the netting provision,it was entitled to compensation because it did not reap a net gain.
we address each claim in turn 
whether netting provision applies to appellants 
appellants first claim that the netting provision in section v b of the plan does not apply to them because the plan elsewhere provides that their losses should be calculated solely on the basis of the methodology set forth in plan section iv.as section iv carves out a specific rule for cendant stock obtained in exchange for the stock of acquired companies such as getko,section v general provisions,they argue,do not apply to them.
we disagree.although the specific usually controls the general in contract construction,we are to construe a contract as a whole.capitol bus blue bird coach lines,cir.both provisions apply to the pool of claimants they simply have different functions.section iv covers all claimants,dividing potential claims into five categories its five corresponding parts calculate the loss amount for each kind of claim.but the loss amount is not the same as the net claim.section v applies to all claimants who sold stock acquired during the class period or who made profits on cendant stock sales.section v does not change the way that losses are calculated,but it provides that those losses should be offset by any profits to arrive at the net claim amount.both provisions are specific within their spheres.section iv is specific to loss amounts as the title specific loss amounts indicates,and section v is specific to net claims by reducing loss amounts for claimants who have made profits on cendant stock sales.moreover,because section iv governs the loss calculation of every claim,accepting appellants argument would rob section v of any effect.
the text of the netting provision of the plan section v b quoted above is the only part of the plan printed in all caps,and its language could not be more explicit all profits shall be subtracted from all losses.yet appellants not only fail to offer a valid basis for arguing that the netting provision does not apply to them,but they also fail to explain why the plan might be crafted to compensate shareholders who reaped a net profit.
section v b matching provision is also part of the plan general purpose,designed to apply to every claimant who sold shares during the class period.complementing section v b is section ii b.it describes how loss amounts will be calculated in general and provides that,i n calculating the loss amount for each claim,a sale of a security during the class period will be matched first against those securities in the opening position,held before the class period,and then matched chronologically against each purchase or acquisition of that security made during the class period.plan ii b emphasis in original.this makes clear that matc
