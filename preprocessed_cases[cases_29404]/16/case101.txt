it seems that a story that involves throwing gasoline on a smoldering fire is unlikely to have a happy ending.that is true here,but the parties to this appeal have sifted through the embers and identified what some might regard as an oxymoron an interesting insurance coverage question.after careful consideration,we conclude that the district court properly construed the relevant insurance contracts and proceeded to answer the coverage question correctly accordingly,we affirm.
andrew zamsky is an insured under three homeowners policies issued to his parents by vermont mutual insurance company vermont mutual.each of these policies covered a separate parcel of residential real estate owned by the zamskys.in relevant part,they require vermont mutual to defend and indemnify all persons insured thereunder,including andrew zamsky,against claims stemming from bodily injury caused by a covered occurrence,subject,however,to various exclusions.one such exclusion appearing in all three policies,which we shall refer to as the ul exclusion,pretermits coverage for injuries a rising out of a premises owned by an insured but not itself an insured location.the zamskys owned a fourth piece of residential real estate,not insured by vermont mutual.the case before us concerns an accident that occurred there and turns on the applicability vel non of the ul exclusions contained in the vermont mutual policies.
the background facts are susceptible to succinct summary.on the night of november,zamsky,renata ivnitskaya,and several friends drove to a house in falmouth,massachusetts owned by zamsky parents.it is undisputed that the falmouth house was not an insured location as defined in the policies.
at some point after their arrival,zamsky retrieved from a shed on the property a portable fire pit that he had purchased earlier that year.the fire pit was somewhere around inches wide and about inches high.it weighed between and pounds.
the group positioned the fire pit on a deck attached to the house.they tried to start a fire,but the wood that they had collected for that purpose was damp and would not burn readily.
one member of the group,aaron bronstein,told zamsky that he wanted to get something to help the fire along.zamsky suggested that bronstein look in either the garage or the shed.bronstein retrieved a container of gasoline and poured it on the fire.
the consequent conflagration set at least three of the assembled persons aflame.one of these individuals ivnitskaya suffered especially severe burns.
in due course,ivnitskaya sued zamsky for bodily injuries in a massachusetts state court,alleging a golconda of negligent acts and omissions.that suit is still pending vermont mutual and massachusetts property insurance underwriting association fair plan have been sharing the cost of defending zamsky.vermont mutual,however,has done so pursuant to a reservation of rights.scottsdale insurance company scottsdale has been keeping a watchful eye on the proceedings because it provides umbrella coverage,excess liability coverage to the zamsky family.
after ivnitskaya state court suit was brought,vermont mutual filed this declaratory judgment action in the federal court.it named as defendants zamsky,fair plan,ivnitskaya,and scottsdale premised federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,see a and prayed for a declaration that the ul exclusions in its policies pretermitted any obligation either to continue to defend zamsky in the negligence suit or to indemnify him against any damage award 
once answers were filed and discovery completed,the parties for summary judgment.the district court denied vermont mutual motion and granted the appellees motions,holding that the ul exclusion did not apply and that vermont mutual owed zamsky a duty to defend.see.mut.ins.zamsky,d,see also.mut.ins.zamsky,wl.this timely appeal followed.
the question before us is a limited one.vermont mutual asked the district court to declare nonexistent any duty on its part either to defend or to indemnify.the district court did not take the bait but,rather,restricted its judgment to the duty to defend.see zamsky,d at.this makes sense as,in the ordinary course,the duty of an insurance carrier to defend the insured is broader than its duty to indemnify.b t masonry constr.pub.serv.mut.ins,cir construing massachusetts law.had the appellees been intent on securing a more complete declaration of their rights extending,say,to the duty to indemnify,they could have.they did not do so.in the absence of a,only the duty to defend is properly before us.see haley city of boston,cir it is law that even though an appellee can argue in support of a lower court ruling in his favor on any ground made manifest in the record,he can not,without a,argue against a judgment in his favor in an endeavor either to expand his rights or to diminish the appellant rights.we proceed accordingly.
this is a diversity case and,with respect to the limited question before us,the law of massachusetts supplies the substantive rules of decision.see b t masonry,at liab.ins.selman,cir.in massachusetts,the duty to defend arises when the facts alleged in the complaint and those facts which are known by the insurer,bos.symph,commercial union ins,demonstrate a possibility that the liability claim falls within the insurance coverage,b t masonry,at internal quotation marks omitted.the initial burden is on the insured to demonstrate that the overall coverage provisions apply.if the insured successfully makes that showing,the burden then shifts to the insurer to demonstrate that some exclusion defeats coverage.see id.at all times,ambiguity in the language of the policy must be construed in favor of coverage or,put another way,in favor of the insured.see id.
in this instance,the parties agree that,based on the allegations in ivnitskaya complaint and facts known to vermont mutual,coverage attaches unless some exclusion operates to defeat it.we thus proceed directly to the second stage of the inquiry and ask whether vermont mutual has identified such an exclusion.
to this end,vermont mutual says that the ul exclusion carries the day.the district court disagreed.see zamsky,d at.our task is to determine the accuracy of the district court conclusion that the ul exclusion does not apply.
our standard of review is familiar.we examine district court rulings on summary judgment de novo.see certain interested underwriters at lloyd,london stolberg,cir.this standard dovetails with the proposition,in massachusetts,that the interpretation of an insurance policy typically embodies a question of law for the court.see cody.life ins.
in the case at hand,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact these undisputed facts tee up a question about the meaning and effect of the ul exclusion.this is a question that the highest court of massachusetts the supreme judicial court sjc has yet to answer.in such a situation,it is our obligation to make an informed prophecy as to how that court,if confronted with the question,would be likely to rule.see andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir.when making such a prediction,we may look to a variety of sources,including decisions of the lower courts in massachusetts,persuasive adjudications by other courts,scholarly works,and considerations touching upon public policy.see blinzler marriott int l,cir.
we start close to home.while decisions of a state intermediate appellate court are not binding on a federal court sitting in diversity,such opinions are entitled to some weight.andrew robinson,at.two decisions of the massachusetts appeals court,each of which construes the ul exclusion,are instructive here.
the first of these cases is callahan quincy mutual fire insurance.there,an insured dog had bitten a third party at premises owned by the insured but not covered by quincy mutual.see id.at.the victim sued the insured for personal injuries.in the ensuing coverage dispute,the court held that the ul exclusion in quincy mutual policy did not pertain because the dog was not a condition of the premises.id.at.thus,while the occurrence happened at the uninsured location,it did n
