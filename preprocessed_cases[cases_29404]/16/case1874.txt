doug clark is the sole shareholder of two corporations through which he has conducted a business selling medical devices,oregon,ocd and northwest,ncd doug clark,ocd and ncd will be collectively referred to in this opinion as clark unless a distinction between them is necessary.in,clark entered into two agreements with sulzer carbomedics carbomedics to sell carbomedics heart valves.one agreement covered oregon and a small part of the state of washington oregon contract,and the other covered other parts of the state of washington washington contract for a term of four years,those contracts gave clark the exclusive right to sell carbomedics heart valves in the covered regions,and made clark exclusive to carbomedics,subject to termination provisions in the two contracts.that right of termination is absolute,and provides that a party availing itself of such right will not be liable to the other party for any loss,damage,indemnity,cost,expense,or thing of any kind or nature whatsoever,and any and all claims of such liability and the right to make such claims are expressly waived.the contracts further provide in no event will either party be liable to the other for incidental,special or consequential damages,including but not limited to loss of anticipated revenues or profits or good will,for the lawful termination or cancellation of this agreement for any reason whatsoever.the contracts also contain clauses.for one year after his relationship with carbomedics ended,for any reason,the contracts prohibit clark and his subrepresentatives from contacting former customers for purposes of selling,offering for sale or promoting the sale of any competing heart valves.
in the fall of,clark communicated jude medical,and jude medical together,jude,another seller of heart valves.clark met with jude top executives to discuss his becoming a jude sales representative.at the end of,clark entered into five agreements with jude.two of these contracts,both effective january,involved the sale of jude medical devices.one contract was for the sale of jude pacemakers in oregon and the other was for the sale of jude heart valves in eight designated hospitals and medical centers in oregon under the heart valve contract,clark was not eligible for commissions for two years.however,clark and jude entered into a separate agreement guaranteeing clark a minimum commission of annually for the first two years,under both of the jude contracts.the latter agreement also provided that jed reay,a subrepresentative of clark,would be entitled to a guaranteed minimum commission of annually for the first two years.the parties also executed an indemnity agreement,under which jude would indemnify clark against claims arising from his contractual relationship with jude.
on december,after his contracts with jude were in place,clark sent a letter to carbomedics,terminating his contracts with carbomedics effective january.ten months later,carbomedics filed this lawsuit.in its complaint,carbomedics asserted claims against clark for breach of contract and fiduciary duty for terminating the agreements early,for sharing confidential information,for engaging in activity that conflicts with clark faithful performance under the carbomedics contracts,and for breaching the clauses,and claims against jude for tortious interference with economic relations and unjust enrichment.
defendants clark and jude moved for summary judgment,and carbomedics moved for partial summary judgment.the district court granted clark motion on the claim that he breached the contract by terminating early,holding that the plain language of the oregon contract was unambiguous and clearly precluded any damages for early termination.the district court denied clark summary judgment motion on the,confidentiality,conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty claims.however,it stated that there is no direct evidence that any breach by clark caused any damages to carbomedics whatsoever and thus further cautioned that unless,at trial,carbomedics presented more evidence of damages,it would grant a directed verdict for clark.the district court also entered summary judgment for jude on the unjust enrichment claim.
following presentation of carbomedics case in chief,jude and clark filed motions for judgment as a matter of law under.the district court carried the motion as to the tortious interference claim against jude,but granted defendants motions on many other issues,finding no evidence that any violation by clark of the conflict of interest,confidentiality,and clauses of his carbomedics contracts or the alleged fiduciary duty violations caused any damages to carbomedics.thus,the court submitted to the jury only the tortious interference claim against jude.on that claim,the jury returned a verdict for carbomedics of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.
after the jury rendered its verdict,the court considered jude motion for judgment as a matter of law and its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial.in ruling on these motions,the court remitted the jury award to in compensatory damages,and held that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury punitive damages award.
appellant jude first asserts that the district court erroneously interpreted oregon law when it denied jude motion for judgment as a matter of law on the tortious interference claim.the standard of review of the court decision to deny judgment as a matter of law is de novo.stokes emerson,cir.judgment as a matter of law is proper after a party has been fully heard by the jury on a given issue,and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party on that issue.a.
there is no dispute that oregon intentional interference with economic relations law applies here.the elements of such a claim are the existence of a professional or business relationship,intentional interference with that relationship,by a third party,accomplished through improper means or for an improper purpose,a causal effect between the interference and damage to the economic relations,and damages.uptown heights assocs.seafirst,or,en banc.in its order,the district court stated that it had struggled with the fourth element of the above analysis,but nevertheless found that jude inducement of clark to breach his ongoing contract with carbomedics constituted an improper means,such that the fourth element was satisfied.the district court found that the other elements were satisfied and thus denied jude rule motion on the tortious interference claim.jude contends that the court erred in denying its motion on that issue,because inducement to breach the contracts,which the court found,does not satisfy the improper means requirement.
the improper motive or means requirement reflects the longstanding oregon rule that to prove the tort of intentional interference with economic relations,the claimant must show that the interference resulting in injury to another is wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.top serv.body shop,allstate ins,or,en banc.the court in top service elaborated that these improper motive or means may be wrongful by reason of a statute or other regulation,or a recognized rule of common law,or perhaps an established standard of a trade or profession.id.it further described as examples of improper motive or means violence,threats or other intimidation,deceit or misrepresentation,bribery,unfounded litigation,defamation,or disparaging falsehood.id.in top service,allstate discouraged claimants from taking their repair work to top service by disparaging top service work and directing business from top service to repair shops on allstate preferred list.id.at.top service was formerly on the preferred list,but after a dispute with allstate,the owner of top service decided not to be a shop for allstate.the oregon supreme court held that allstate behavior did not constitute improper motive because it was wholly consistent with allstate pursuit of its own business purposes as it saw them id.however,the court noted that such behavior may have constituted improper means,but since that theory had not been presented to the jury,the court did not reach it.id.at.
jude argues that the mere inducement to breach a contract can not satisfy the improper motive or means test.carbomedics responds that inducing the breach of a binding contract is wrongful conduct under oregon law,and that the record contains ample evidence of such inducement by jude.
in uptown heights,the defendant bank asserted that plaintiff allegations that the bank refused to deal with a corporate third party,wrc,unless wrc broke off its relations with plaintiff,were legally insufficient to withstand the bank motion to dismiss.uptown heights,at.in holding that the case was not subject to dismissal,the oregon supreme court noted two scenarios described in the comment section of restatement second of torts.id.at.in the first example,a defendant hears of a third party contact with the plaintiff and thus refuses to deal with that third party.id.when asked by the third party to explain its conduct,the defendant explains that its reason is the third party contact with the plaintiff.id.thereafter,the third party cancels his contract with the plaintiff.in the second scenario,upon hearing of the third party contact with the plaintiff,the defendant writes the third party,advising that it could not tolerate the third party involvement with the plaintiff,if the third party terminated its relationship with the plaintiff,the third party would be more than compensated,and if the third party does not advise the defendant within ten days that it has terminated its relationship with the plaintiff,the defendant will not do any further business with the third party.id.in this example,after receiving the letter,the third party cancels its contract with plaintiff.id.the court in uptown concluded that the defendant would be liable in the second scenario,but not in the first.id.the court found that the defendant alleged promise to wrc that a loan to it would be forthcoming,if it broke off its relationship with plaintiff,went beyond a mere silent refusal,and was more akin to the second example in the restatement scenario than the first.id.at.the court concluded that the plaintiff complaint described a form of affirmative inducement for wrc to remove uptown from the joint venture,which satisfied the improper motive or means element.id.
here,the district court noted that jude knew about clark contracts with carbomedics and that jude lawyers drafted a lucrative contract with clark that explicitly required clark to violate his covenants not to compete with carbomedics.based on the law as articulated by the oregon supreme court,we conclude that the district court properly held that such conduct was sufficient to satisfy the improper motive or means element.
jude next contends that the district court erroneously interpreted the contractual limitation of liability provision when it denied jude summary judgment motion on the tortious interference claim.this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the denial of summary judgment.brown slenker,cir.it can,however,review on a de novo basis the legal and factual issues raised by jude rule motion on this issue 
the district court held that the plain language of the limitation of liability clause in clark contract with carbomedics precluded carbomedics claims against clark for early termination.the court also held,however,that the same clause did not protect jude from liability for tortious interference.according to the district court,a party who tortiously interferes is liable for the plaintiff losses rather than its own profits,but does not receive the benefit of the plaintiff limitation of liability.
jude now argues that the limitation of liability clause precludes recovery against jude,as any other interpretation allows carbomedics to recover from jude on an intentional interference claim for inducing the very same breach for which it could not recover from clark.
carbomedics responds that jude can not escape tort liability based on a contract provision to which it is not a party and,in any case,the limitation of liability clause does not shield clark from liability.
the carbomedics contract contains a provision mandating that texas law will govern all the terms of the contract.the provision at issue here states 
damages.in no event will either party be liable to the other for incidental,special or consequential damages,including but not limited to loss of anticipated revenues or profits or good will,for the termination or cancellation of this agreement for any reason whatsoever.
jude relies heavily on marcus,stowell beye gov t,jefferson inv,cir.in marcus,the fifth circuit addressed the question of whether the correct measure of damages for tortious interference under texas law is the defendant profit or the plaintiff loss.in holding that the plaintiff loss was the proper measure of damages,the court noted that 
it would be inconsistent to require the party inducing a breach to disgorge its excess profits while permitting the breaching party to retain its excess profits.given this apparent inconsistency as well as texas case law indicating that the measure of damages for interference with contractual relations is identical to that for breach of contract,the district court properly limited the plaintiff actual damages award to the plaintiff loss suffered as a result of the interference.

since the court found no damages were proved as to clark,and the limitation of liability clause was applicable to clark in any case,marcus seems to compel a result favorable to jude.however,the district court correctly noted that the contract in marcus did not contain a limitation of liability clause like the one in this case.because of its existence,the damages against clark and jude would be different unless the party,jude,gets the benefit of the limitation.to allow jude to enforce the limitation would undermine the aim of awarding damages for tortious interference,which is to place the injured party in the same economic position it would have been in had the contract not been breached.marcus,at.the district court correctly noted that texas law holds that although such damages are not recoverable for breach of contract a party found liable for tortious interference with a contract may be liable for,among other things,emotional distress or actual harm to reputation,if those injuries are reasonably to be expected to result from the interference.exxon allsup,christi,writ denied citing king acker,dist,no writ and restatement second of torts.but see hallmark hand,paso,writ denied.thus,the measure of damages for breach of contract and tortious interference with a contract are not necessarily the same.in fact,as the court in allsup stated,a claim for interference with contract is one in tort and damages are not based on contract rules therefore,it is not required that the loss incurred be one within the contemplation of the parties to the contract itself at the time the contract was made.allsup,at citing restatement second of torts cmt.d see also juliette fowler homes,welch,that contract was terminated in compliance with notice provision was no defense to tortious interference with contract performance.the district court therefore did not err in determining that the limitation of liability provision in carbomedics contract with clark did not preclude jude liability for tortious interference.

carbomedics asserts that the district court read the limitation of liability provision in isolation,thus flouting the rules of contract construction.carbomedics argues that even though the parties painstakingly set out how and when the agreements could be terminated,the defendants contend the parties intended to waive any and all damages,whether or not the termination provisions were followed.carbomedics asserts that the district court erroneous interpretation of the limitation of liability clause renders meaningless the termination provisions.clark urges that the plain language of the limitation of liability clause could not be any clearer,and that it precludes damages against clark for early termination.
in determining whether the language of the contract is unambiguous courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.clardy marine midland bus.loans,cir,cert.denied,d citing coker coker,emphasis added.here,the provision at issue seems clear enough and,contrary to carbomedics position,it does not render meaningless the section of the contract setting out the specific grounds for termination.as clark points out,w hile the contract is still in effect,it confers various rights on the parties.even after the agreement is terminated,the clause does not bar claims for moneys sic owed prior to termination,and it does not bar the possibility of injunctive relief.because the contract is unambiguous,its language must be enforced as written,looking at the objective intent as manifested by the language used,rather than interpreting it by attempting to divine the subjective intent of the parties.id.citing sun oil delaware madeley.as the trial court noted,the language of the contract clearly states that in no event shall a party be liable for incidental,special,or consequential termination damages for any reason whatsoever.thus,the district court did not erroneously interpret the contract when it determined that clark could not be liable for damages for early termination.
after carbomedics put on its,the district court granted clark motion for directed verdict on the remaining claims against him.the court reasoned that because of the limitation of liability clause,clark was not responsible for damages for termination breaches.in apparently concluding that the limitation of liability clause did not apply to the other claims,the court further ruled,as a matter of law,that there was no evidence that clark violation of the conflict of interest,confidentiality,or clauses of its contracts with carbomedics caused any damages to carbomedics.
by cross appeal,carbomedics asserts that the limitation of liability provision does not preclude recovery for breaches other than those relating to early termination.since the district court rulings are not to the contrary,and carbomedics does not point to any evidence that would undermine the district court ruling on the merits of those claims,its appellate point is without merit.
on the issue of compensatory damages,jude asserts that the district court erred in finding sufficient evidence to support compensatory damages of.jude attacks the compensatory damage award on two grounds the absence of proof of causation for carbomedics drop in sales,lost profits,and carbomedics failure to prove,to a reasonable degree of certainty,any lost profits.on causation,jude asserts that the only claim submitted to the jury was the claim for inducing for damages caused by any supposedly wrongful conduct that occurred after the termination.it then argues that carbomedics offered no evidence linking clark departure from carbomedics to the decline in carbomedics sales,and that jude offered proof that factors other than clark departure directly caused the drop in oregon sales,such as the expiration of a major hospital contract,changes in the medical practices in which carbomedics products had been used,doctors who stopped practicing or moved out of state,jude new competitive product,and higher rate for patients using carbomedics heart valves.carbomedics asserts that it introduced sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on causation.
carbomedics can only recover damages for lost profits if it can prove those damages with reasonable certainty.willamette quarries,wodtli,or,en banc citing buck mueller,or,see also great pines water,cir.reasonable certainty means probability.welch bancorp realty and mortgage trust,or,citing cont l plants measured mktg,or,en banc.to meet this test,carbomedics must have adduced evidence that its heart valve sales were hampered or lost because of jude tortious interference with carbomedics contract with clark.willamette,at.in other words,the record must support the conclusion that,but for the alleged interference,more would have bought carbomedics heart valves.id.see generally cont l plants measured mktg,or.however,carbomedics need not have introduced specific evidence from actual or potential customers that they would have bought carbomedics heart valve if clark had been selling it.cont l plants,at.oregon jurisprudence does not require such exactitude of proof.id.
carbomedics points to the following evidence of causation testimony that in the heart valve industry,the loss of a valued salesman like clark could be very harmful,or cause substantial damage testimony that after clark departure he immediately began calling on his former carbomedics customers,accompanied by the jude heart valve representative testimony that clark had bragged that he had broken the barriers of resistance with surgeons to using the jude valve,and that in three months carbomedics sales would dry out carbomedics sales in oregon dropped by in at the same time its national sales were up and its sales in the western united states were up during the same time,jude mechanical valve sales in the oregon region rose carbomedics contemporaneous internal sales reports identified the loss of clark and his unlawful competition as major contributors to carbomedics drop in sales and the accounts set out in clark heart valve contract with jude were all accounts he serviced while under contract with carbomedics.
the evidence in this case is more like that in continental plants,in which the oregon supreme court found the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury determination of causation,than like that in willamette,in which the oregon supreme court found the evidence insufficient to establish causation.the plaintiff in continental plants was an auctioneer of industrial machinery who contracted with the defendant to mail brochures advertising the sale of newly acquired machinery.id.however,through the defendant error,many of the brochures were mailed to wood fabricators instead of the intended recipients,metal fabricators.to prove that the auction was unsuccessful because of the defendant error,
p laintiff introduced evidence that the number of persons who registered for its sales were in a fairly constant proportion to the number of brochures which were mailed,and that the number of persons who purchased at its auctions were in constant proportion to the number who registered for the sale.it then showed that the proportion of registrants to the number of brochures mailed for the sale in question was enormously reduced as compared with prior and subsequent sales it conducted over a period of months.plaintiff also introduced evidence that the average return from the other sales was per cent of the machinery cost,while the return from the sale in question was only per cent of plaintiff cost,and that the present sale was the only one in which it had suffered a loss.
id.at.the oregon supreme court in continental plants found such evidence sufficient to prove causation,in contrast to the evidence in willamette.there,the plaintiff contracted with one of the defendants to establish a rock quarry on that defendant land and to have the exclusive right to remove rock from the premises.willamette,at.however,that defendant entered into an agreement with an in
