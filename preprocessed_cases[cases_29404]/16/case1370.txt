plaintiff marta korotynska brings this action on behalf of herself and others similarly situated against defendant metropolitan life insurance company metlife under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the action was originally brought in the united states district court for the southern district of new york but was transferred to the united states district court for the district of maryland pursuant to.no class has been certified,and korotynska is currently the sole plaintiff.
metlife issues group insurance policies which fund employee benefit plans sponsored by employers,including disability plans.for some plans,metlife acts as plan fiduciary,managing the operation and administration of the benefit plan.plaintiff korotynska,through her previous employment as an librarian at montgomery community college in maryland,was a participant in a disability plan for which metlife acted as insurer and fiduciary.korotynska is no longer employed by montgomery community college or otherwise covered by a metlife disability insurance plan.
around august,korotynska filed a claim for,and received,disability benefits due to severe and disabling chronic pain,degenerative disc problems in her back,and fibromyalgia.after these disability benefits expired,korotynska filed a claim for disability benefits.metlife determined that korotynska was eligible for such benefits and paid her for two years beginning in august.in august,however,metlife conducted a review of korotynska claim and terminated her benefits.korotynska appealed the adverse benefit determination,and on june,metlife affirmed its decision to terminate.
in this action,korotynska maintains that she is not seeking individualized review of her adverse benefits determination under a b.instead,korotynska seeks equitable relief under a.section a provides,a civil action may be brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a.
korotynska seeks equitable relief under a for metlife alleged violations of,another provision of the same subchapter which outlines fiduciary duties under erisa.specifically,korotynska alleges that metlife has breached its fiduciary duties by engaging in systematically flawed and abusive claims administration procedures,including,inter alia,
targeting types of claims that have symptoms,lack of objective medical findings supporting the claims,or an undefined diagnosis,without due regard for the actual impact of the claimants conditions on their ability to work 
targeting claimants for denial termination with the expectation that such claimants will not have the wherewithal or financial incentive to engage counsel to pursue their rights,or have the physical or emotional fortitude to fight over these benefits 
employing claim practices that ignore treating physician opinions,ignore subjective complaints of pain,ignore the effects of medications upon claimants abilities to work 
failing to consider in its handling of these claims,pursuant to h iv,all comments,documents,records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim 
requesting inappropriate,unnecessary and burdensome materials from claimants,all in furtherance of delaying claims determinations 
designing a system in which claimants can not receive a full and fair review of their claims,by virtue of its reliance upon medical examinations from interested physicians called independent medical examinations,functional capacity evaluations fce peer reviews 
utilizing the services of professional entities that perform medical vocational reviews,including but not limited to national medical review,that are biased against claimants based upon financial incentives provided by met life 
developing and utilizing claim management plans that are designed to terminate benefits not based upon the actual condition of claimants,but,rather,upon duration guidelines used to determine when to terminate claims 
developing claim management plans to deny or terminate claims without due regard for the actual impact of the claimants conditions on their ability to work and 
by employing numerous other practices that pressure claims handling personnel into denying or terminating legitimate claims.
under a,korotynska seeks reform of the systemic improper and illegal claims handling practices that metlife uses to deny her and other erisa beneficiaries a full and fair review of their claims for disability benefits and a full and fair review of claims including korotynska that have been denied or terminated,as well as other appropriate equitable relief.
metlife filed a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that korotynska lacked standing to bring the action and that korotynska was not entitled to bring a claim for equitable relief under a,because adequate relief was available to her through a b.the district court held that,although korotynska had standing,under varity howe,d,equitable relief was only available for injuries not adequately redressed elsewhere in erisa statutory scheme.because korotynska ha d available to her the alternative remedy of bringing an action under a b,her action under a was dismissed.korotynska metro.life ins,wl.korotynska appealed,and metlife contests the district court standing determination.
we review de novo a district court decision to grant judgment on the pleadings.see burbach broad.of elkins radio,cir.
assuming that korotynska previous denial of benefits and alleged subjection to improper claims procedures qualify her to bring a claim under a that statutory provision is only available for claims of breach of fiduciary duty in the circumstances outlined by the supreme court in varity.see at.in varity,the supreme court held that a authorizes some individualized claims for breach of fiduciary duty,but not where the plaintiff injury finds adequate relief in another part of erisa statutory scheme.id.at.the court,taking both parts of a as one whole,concluded that the provision creates a catchall which act s as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy.id.at.but where congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary injury,there will likely be no need for further equitable relief,in which case such relief normally would not be appropriate.id.at.
varity itself provides an example of an injury that did not find adequate relief in other provisions of erisa.the varity plaintiffs suffered an injury when their employer consolidated many of its unprofitable divisions into a new subsidiary and then persuaded employees to transfer their benefit plans to the new subsidiary through deceptive depictions of its financial outlook.id.at.when the subsidiary failed and the employees lost their nonpension benefits,many sued for reinstatement of the benefits they would have been owed under their previous plan.id.at.the supreme court found
