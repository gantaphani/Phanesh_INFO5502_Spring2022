millennium petrochemicals,millennium appeals the district court denial of its motion for partial summary judgment,which sought a declaration that the indemnity provisions in a maintenance contract the contract with brown root,and root,collectively brown root,were valid and enforceable,and that brown root owed millennium an indemnity obligation for claims filed against millennium by individual plaintiffs.millennium also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of brown root holding that the indemnity provisions in the contract unambiguously precluded an indemnity obligation on the part of brown root for the underlying asbestos claims.because we find the disputed indemnity provisions unambiguously provides millennium indemnity for claims,we reverse the district court.
factual and procedural background 
millennium and brown root entered into the contract in under which brown root would perform maintenance services at one of millennium plants in,the parties amended the indemnity provision in order to clarify the respective obligations of the parties regarding any suits against millennium the parties again amended the indemnity provision in under the terms of the contract,either party could terminate it with days written notice.by letter dated april,millennium terminated the contract.
beginning in,brown root employees filed suits in texas state courts claiming injuries from exposure to asbestos in millennium workplaces and naming millennium as premises defendant.citing the indemnity provisions of the contract,millennium notified brown root of the claims and requested indemnity,which brown root refused to provide.
millennium then filed a declaratory judgment action in which it moved for partial summary judgment declaring that the indemnity provisions were valid and enforceable and that brown root owed millennium an indemnity obligation for the plaintiff claims.the district court,however,held that there was no valid and enforceable indemnity obligation,and that brown root had no duty to indemnify millennium.the district court held that millennium termination of the contract terminated the indemnity obligations as a matter of law,even for those brown root employees who had been performing services at millennium facilities under the contract before it was terminated in.alternatively,the district court held that even if the termination of the contract did not terminate brown root indemnity obligation,the amendment to the contract effectively eliminated such obligation.the district court then granted brown root motion for summary judgment,dismissing millennium indemnity claims.

discussion 
millennium motion for summary judgment 
millennium requested the district court to hold,through a partial summary judgment order,that the indemnity provisions were valid and enforceable and that brown root owed it an indemnity obligation for the underlying plaintiffs claims.because,as we explain below,the contract language unambiguously indicates an intent by the parties to provide millennium with the indemnification it seeks,we find that the district court erred in denying millennium summary judgment request for a declaratory judgment that brown root owed an indemnity obligation.
ii.brown root motion for summary judgment 
termination of the contract 
the district court held that because the contract was terminated pursuant to millennium april,letter,and the letter did not reserve any rights,any obligations brown root owed to millennium were extinguished.we disagree with this conclusion.
civ.prac.rem.code ann.c provides that upon termination all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.as we have previously stated,we are aware of no texas authority that provides that the termination of agreements automatically applies retroactively to extinguish vested rights.sid richardson carbon gasoline interenergy resources,cir.other circuits have also held that rights that have vested or accrued under a contract prior to the termination of the contract,are not automatically extinguished upon termination.see,premier economic research analysts,cir ruling that the expiration of a brokerage contract did not discharge a broker indemnity obligation for illegal sales it made prior to expiration,when the indemnity action was brought subsequent to expiration standard oil of perkins,cir ruling that prior vested contractual rights may be extinguished only if parties intended to do so under subsequent contract.the parties have not cited,nor has our research revealed,any cases from other circuits which hold otherwise.
this appeal therefore raises two key questions.first,whether millennium owed any obligations to brown root under the contract and successive amendments from through may,which would lead to a conclusion that the contract was truly executory on both sides,thus terminating any obligations that brown root owed millennium for this period.second,whether millennium intended to extinguish any vested indemnity rights under the contract due to the termination.we answer both in the negative.
millennium hired brown root to perform maintenance services at millennium facility.millennium owed brown root an obligation under the contract to pay for the work brown root performed,and to use brown root services until such time as the contract was terminated.brown root,for its part,owed an obligation to millennium to perform the maintenance services.brown root also owed,however,an indemnity obligation to millennium for any claims it incurred due to injuries sustained by the brown root employees during the period of the contract.this indemnity obligation was consideration offered by brown root for becoming millennium maintenance provider.on may,millennium owed no further obligations to brown root because it had paid brown root for any work it had done,and had used brown root as its maintenance provider until the contract was terminated.on brown root side,it had performed all the maintenance work that it was required to do under the contract and its successive amendments.there is no assertion by brown root that there existed any unfulfilled obligations under the contract on millennium part.thus,the only remaining obligation on either side was brown root indemnity obligation.
brown root,and the district court,also cite griffin,foodmaker,dist,to support the argument that under texas law an indemnitor contractual indemnity obligation absolutely terminates upon termination of a contract by its terms.however,their reliance on that case is misplaced.in griffin,unlike here,the indemnitee employee was injured and suit was filed after the expiration of the contract that contained the indemnity provision.id.at.both this court and the texas supreme court have held that an injury occurs at the moment of exposure to the asbestos.see,guaranty ins.azrock,cir for purposes of determining insurance coverage,injury occurred at time of asbestos exposure,rather than at time disease manifested itself pustejovsky,the plaintiff injury is the inhalation of fibers and the invasion of his body by those fibers,thus causing him physical damage.quoting gideon sales,cir.in this case,it is undisputed that at least some of the claimants may have been exposed to the asbestos between and,and hence prior to the termination of the contract.while the griffin indus.court pointed out that the indemnity action in that case was not filed until after the contract had expired,nothing in that opinion indicates that had the injury occurred prior to the expiration of the contract,the indemnitor obligation to indemnify the indemnitee would have been terminated.at.we further note that nowhere in the may,termination letter does millennium indicate an intent to extinguish or surrender any rights that may have vested in its favor under the contract.
because at least some of the alleged underlying asbestos injuries at issue here may have occurred prior to the termination of the contract,and the contract was not executory on both sides,thereby precluding extinguishment of brown root indemnity obligations under section c,we hold that the district court erred in ruling that the termination of the contract extinguished all of brown root indemnity obligations.
b.the amendment 
intent of the parties 
the district court also held that as a matter of law the amendment was adopted with the mutual consent and understanding of both millennium and brown root,and that it was adopted for the express purpose of superceding all previous amendments to the agreement indemnity provisions,reasoning that it is well established that a modified contract prevails over an old contract to the extent of any inconsistencies.we disagree.
as millennium correctly points out,the explicit language of the may,amendment clearly stated that it was to be retroactively effective beginning january.furthermore,there is no language in the amendment stating that it supercedes all previous versions of the contract.certainly,it would appear that by deleting the language of the version of the contract that provided millennium indemnity protection for its own negligence the parties intended to remove such protection in the future.however,it is by no means certain,considering the expressly stated effective date of the amendment,that millennium also intended the amendment to apply retroactively to any periods as well.
under texas law contract terms are to be given their plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning unless the instrument shows that the parties used them in a technical or different sense.see lopez munoz,hockema reed.further,when ascertaining the intent of parties from written expressions,a court should read all parts of a contract together,ensuring that each provision of such contract are given effect and none are rendered meaningless.instone travel,at applying texas law.here,the plain contract terms of the may,amendment provide that it was to be retroactively effective beginning january.under the interpretation advanced by brown the may,amendment effectively superceded and extinguished application of all the previous indemnity retroactivity language is rendered superfluous and meaningless.only if the language of the may,amendment is read out of the contract can brown root claim that it was millenium intent to have it apply retroactively prior to january.but,disregarding such language would violate the jurisprudence of this court and the texas supreme court.
while brown root points to cases standing for the principle that an amendment to a contract supercedes the earlier version of the agreement to the extent of any inconsistencies it has not cited any case supporting its more specific proposition that an amendment or subsequent contract will automatically retroactively effect any rights or obligations that may have vested or accrued under a prior version of the agreement.nor could it do so.texas courts have made clear that rights or obligations that may have vested or accrued under previous versions of a contract can only be modified or extinguished through the inclusion of express language that manifests such intent.see lake lbj mun.utility dist.coulson,no pet.finding that an amendment to a service contract which stated new territory to be serviced,but which did not mention territory covered under the previous contract,did not show that parties intended to extinguish service provider obligation to continue to service territory listed in that earlier agreement hall professional leasing,no writ.finding that a purchase contract which provided that equipment subject to an existing lease contract was to be purchased outright by lessee,showed the intent of both the lessee and lessor to extinguish any prospective lease payment obligations under the lease,because by law the lessor was only entitled to lease payments for the equipment to the extent lessor still possessed title at the time the lessee was using the equipment emphasis added.
in this case,the absence of any language expressly indicating that the amendment was to apply to periods,and the inclusion of language making the may,amendment retroactively effective to january,strongly indicates that the parties intended the amendment to apply prospectively from january.we find millennium argument compelling that in the absence of a clear expression,the only reasonable interpretation of the contract is that the parties intended the effective date to delineate the periods of work to which each of the three indemnity clauses would apply,an interpretation which would give effect to all the clauses in the contract.see heritage resources,nationsbank.millennium is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this issue.
timing of the plaintiffs asbestos suits as it effects millennium ability to bring indemnity actions against brown root.
the district court held that the date that the underlying plaintiffs were exposed to the asbestos was irrelevant,and that an indemnity claim does not accrue,and thus become actionable,until all of the potential liabilities or damages of the indemnitee become fixed and certain.citing pustejovsky,causes of action for latent occupational diseases,such as asbestosis,do not accrue until a plaintiff symptoms manifest themselves to a degree or for a duration that would put a reasonable person on notice the he or she suffers from some injury and he or she knows,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known,that the injury is work related.valero energy,time indemnity claim accrues.the district court concluded that because the underlying plaintiffs first filed claims in,the earliest date on which these plaintiffs asbestos symptoms manifested themselves would have been january,after the contract had been terminated,and thus are not covered by any of the indemnity provisions.
the district court decision appears to be based on an assumption that the indemnity provisions at issue here are claims based,rather than.as noted above,this court has considered at what point in time coverage is triggered for cases in the closely analogous context of insurance.see guaranty ins.azrock,cir.in guaranty national insurance,cognizant of the difficulty of assigning manifestation of asbestosis to a specific date,this court instructed that in assessing an insurer coverage liability,courts must first identify when the exposure to asbestos occurred and then determine whether the policy was in effect at that time.accord in re cva general contractors,coverage is triggered in any policy period in which the exposure to the cause of injury occurred,even if the harmful effects of the exposure were not diagnosed until after the policy expired pilgrim,maryland cas,dist,no pet.application of the accepted exposure theory to personal injury insurance coverage cases does not require that the occurrence of the event which ultimately causes an injury be discovered while an insurance policy is still in effect for an insurance company to be liable.in insurance coverage cases,a court must also determine whether the policy was or in decid
