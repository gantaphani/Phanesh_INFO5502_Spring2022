this appeal involves a matter of first impression for this circuit whether section of the federal arbitration act faa requires the appointment of a substitute arbitrator when the arbitrator designated by the parties is unavailable.dell,appeals from the district of new jersey denial of dell motion to compel arbitration and stay plaintiff claims.dell contends that the district court erred in denying its motion to compel arbitration based on the district court belief that the arbitration provision was rendered unenforceable because it provided for the parties to arbitrate exclusively before a forum that was unavailable when khan commenced suit.the district court also refused to appoint a substitute arbitrator,finding that it could not compel the parties to submit to an arbitral forum to which they had not agreed.
factual background 
dell designed,manufactured,and distributed the computer from to.khan purchased a dell computer in september for approximately.khan purchased the computer online through dell website.to complete the purchase,khan was required to click a box stating i agree to dell terms and conditions of sale.just beneath the box was a notice stating 
the terms and conditions of sale contain very important information about your rights and obligations as well as limitations and exclusions that apply to you.they contain limitations of liability and warranty information.they also contain an agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration,rather than through litigation.please read them carefully.
as dell notice indicated,its terms and conditions of sale contained an arbitration provision that reads as follows 
binding arbitration.any claim,dispute,or controversy whether in contract,tort,or otherwise,whether preexisting,present or future,and including statutory,common law,intentional tort and equitable claims between customer and dell,its agents,employees,principals,successors,assigns,affiliates collectively for purposes of this paragraph,dell arising from or relating to this agreement,its interpretation,or the breach,termination or validity thereof,the relationships which result from this agreement including,to the full extent permitted by applicable law,relationships with third parties who are not signatories to this agreement,dell advertising,or any related purchase shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the national arbitration forum naf under its code of procedure then in effect available via the internet at http,or via telephone at.the arbitration will be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between customer and dell.neither customer nor dell shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against other customers,or arbitrate any claim as a representative or class action or in a private attorney general capacity.this transaction involves interstate commerce,and this provision shall be governed by the federal arbitration act faa.any award of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on each of the parties information may be obtained and claims may be filed with the naf at box,minneapolis,mn.
rule of the naf code and procedure,referred to in paragraph above,provided that t his code shall be administered only by the national arbitration forum or by any entity or individual providing administrative services by agreement with the national arbitration forum.also,as we can see in paragraph,the arbitration provision did not designate a replacement forum in the event that naf was unavailable for any reason.but,as we see,the terms and conditions did incorporate the federal arbitration act.
in addition,the terms and conditions provided that texas law would govern interpretation of the agreement and of any sales.the terms and conditions did not contain a severance provision and any alterations to the terms and conditions required the signature of both parties.
khan alleged that his suffered from design defects,causing his computer to overheat and thereby destroy the computer motherboard.khan replaced the motherboard multiple times.after the third replacement,dell refused to issue another replacement,claiming the warranty had expired.the allegedly suffered from other design defects,which prevented it from being used in a manner consistent with dell marketing.
on july,khan filed a putative consumer class action on behalf of himself and other similarly situated purchasers and lessees of defectively designed computers sold from approximately through.khan asserted seven claims for violations of the new jersey consumer fraud act,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for particular purpose,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unjust enrichment.at the time the lawsuit was filed,the naf had been barred from conducting consumer arbitrations by consent judgment,which resolved litigation brought by the attorney general of minnesota the consent judgment barred the naf from the business of arbitrating credit card and other consumer disputes and ordered the naf to stop accepting any new consumer arbitrations or in any manner participate in the processing or administering of new consumer arbitrations.this was the result of government investigations revealing that the naf engaged in various deceptive practices that disadvantaged consumers.
according to khan,such practices included 
representing to consumers and the public that it was neutral 
convincing credit card companies and other creditors to include exclusive arbitration forum provisions in their contracts and making representations to such entities that it would favor the entities in the arbitrations and 
identifying and appointing arbitrators and withholding referrals to arbitrators who decided cases against companies.
khan also alleged that the minnesota investigations found that these practices encouraged some corporations to select the naf as their arbitration forum because of this prospect of favorable results.however,although khan suggested that dell must have chosen the naf based on its disposition,the record does not show that dell was aware of these practices at the time that it selected the naf as the arbitral forum governing khan purchase or that dell selected the naf for any improper reason.
on october,dell moved to compel arbitration,arguing that the arbitration provision was binding and covered all of khan claims.khan did not dispute that the terms and conditions governed the contract.khan did,however,assert that the arbitration provision was unenforceable because the naf,which the arbitration provision designated as the arbitral forum,was no longer permitted to conduct consumer arbitrations.khan further contended that the naf designation was integral to the arbitration provision.he argued,for that reason,that,because the naf could not perform its function,the arbitration provision in the terms and conditions should not be enforced and the parties should proceed to litigation.
on august,the district court denied dell motion to compel arbitration and stay claims.see khan dell,jap,wl august.after surveying the relevant case law,and acknowledging that the third circuit has not spoken on the issue,id.at,the district court found that the clause in the terms and conditions shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration and administered by the national arbitration forum naf under its code of procedure then in effect demonstrated the parties intent to arbitrate exclusively before a particular arbitrator,not simply an intent to arbitrate generally.id.at.the district court noted that s ome courts have held that of the federal arbitration act faa provides a mechanism for the appointment of an arbitrator when a chosen arbitrator is unavailable,id.at,but that the designation here of the naf as the arbitrator was integral to the arbitration clause.id.citing carideo dell,no,wl,and ranzy extra cash of texas,no.h,wl.march.the court concluded that granting dell motion to compel and appointing a substitute arbitrator would improperly force the parties to submit to an arbitration proceeding to which they have not agreed.id.at.

iii.analysis 
in this appeal,we must determine whether the provision in the terms and conditions that the naf be the arbitrator is exclusive to the naf and is an integral part of the agreement between dell and khan,thus preventing the appointment of a substitute arbitrator.because this is a question of arbitrability,it is governed by the faa.puleo chase bank usa,cir.congress passed the faa in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.at t mobility llc concepcion.the faa reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr.the supreme court has unequivocally stated that questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.id.however,the faa respects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,rent a center,west,jackson,and that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion,stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,quoting volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior.
the particular problem presented in this case the unavailability of the naf is addressed in section of the faa,which provides a mechanism for substituting an arbitrator when the designated arbitrator is unavailable see brown itt consumer fin,cir where the chosen forum is unavailable or has failed for some reason,applies and a substitute arbitrator may be named.in determining the applicability of section of the faa when an arbitrator is unavailable,courts have focused on whether the designation of the arbitrator was integral to the arbitration provision or was merely an ancillary consideration.see,reddam kpmg llp,cir,abrogated on other grounds by atlantic trust llc hawley ins,cir brown,at.as the eleventh circuit has articulated the standard o nly if the choice of forum is an integral part of the agreement to arbitrate,rather than an ancillary logistical concern,will the failure of the chosen forum preclude arbitration.id.in other words,a court will decline to appoint a substitute arbitrator,as provided in the faa,only if the parties choice of forum is so central to the arbitration agreement that the unavailability of that arbitrator brings the agreement to an end.reddam,at.in this light,the parties must have unambiguously expressed their intent not to arbitrate their disputes in the event that the designated arbitral forum is unavailable.
according to khan,this standard has been met because the terms and conditions designate the naf as the exclusive arbitral forum,implying that disputes should not be arbitrated if the naf is unavailable.khan relies on the contract language that states that all disputes shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the national arbitration forum.
in our view,this language is ambiguous exclusively could be read to modify binding arbitration,the national arbitration forum,or both.
khan,however,points out that the naf rules are incorporated into the contract,and that these rules provide that all arbitrations must be conducted by the naf or an entity having an agreement with it.we conclude,however,that this requirement is also ambiguous as to what should happen in the event that the naf is unavailable.the naf rules provide that they shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the faa and that,if any portion of the naf rules are found to be unenforceable,that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the rules shall continue to apply.
our finding of ambiguity is confirmed by the conflicting interpretations of this language adopted by the courts that have considered it.
the court in brown supports dell position that exclusively modifies binding arbitration.the arbitration agreement in brown was interpreted as demonstrating an intent to arbitrate that trumped the designation of a particular arbitrator who was no longer available.in brown,a former itt employee argued that the arbitration clause between the parties which was virtually identical to the clause here was void because the naf had been dissolved.id.at.the eleventh circuit found that the unavailability of the naf did not destroy the arbitration clause because section of the faa provided a mechanism for appointing a replacement arbitrator.id.at.the court did note the integral exception but found that there was no evidence supporting the employee claim that the forum provision was integral to the arbitration clause.id.
adler dell,wl,also supports dell position.the facts and arguments proffered in adler are identical to those before us.after noting the integral exception,the adler court articulated the presumption in favor of enforceability of section of the faa as follows when the arbitrator named in the arbitration agreement can not or will not arbitrate the dispute,the court does not void the arbitration agreement.instead,it appoints a different arbitrator,as provided in the federal arbitration act.id.at.in addition,the adler court found the clause shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration adminstered by the national arbitration forum was ambiguous on the issue of whether the naf exclusive designation was integral to the provision or whether the intent to arbitrate superseded the naf designation.id.the court concluded that the arbitration provision did not meet the standard that an arbitration provision will fail only when the designation of an arbitrator is as important a consideration as the agreement itself.id.at.
on the other hand,in carideo dell,no,wl,a case factually similar to this one,the plaintiff who had bought an allegedly defective dell computer,brought suit against dell.dell moved to compel arbitration,pursuant to the arbitration provision that designated the naf as the arbitral forum.applying the ninth circuit decision in reddam,the court in carideo held that the parties selection of the naf was integral to the arbitration agreement.carideo,wl at.because the court found that the selection of the naf and of its rules was integral to the arbitration provision,it concluded that appointing a substitute arbitrator would be a wholesale revision of the arbitration agreement.id.at.in coming to its conclusion,however,the court stated that i n general,the faa provides that where the chosen arbitrator is unavailable,the court may appoint a substitute arbitrator.id.at emphasis added.we do not agree with the language used by the carideo court.we note that section provides that in the case of an unavailable arbitrator,upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator.emphasis added.the difference between may and shall significant.we do not find carideo persuasive.
although courts are divided on the issue,we conclude that the liberal federal policy in favor of arbitration counsels us to favor the brown line of cases.the language relied on by khan is at best ambiguous as to whether the parties intended to have their disputes arbitrated in the event that naf was unavailable for any reason.because of the ambiguity,it is not clear whether the designation of naf is ancillary or is as important a consideration as the agreement to arbitrate itself.see brown,at.therefore,we must resolve this ambiguity in favor of arbitration.see seus john nuveen,cir,overruled on other grounds by green tree fin.randolph.
we note moreover that the arbitration provision in the terms and conditions specifically incorpora
