this litigation springs from the affidavit by barnett,a former cooper tire employee at its plant in tupelo,mississippi.when the affidavit was prepared with farese,barnett was in the process of having her employment terminated for allegedly embezzling gift certificates and college football tickets from cooper tire company picnic fund.in exchange for its not filing criminal charges,cooper tire required barnett to execute the separation agreement,which,inter alia,contained the following clause 
i agree a not to make any public statement or statements to the media or,directly or indirectly,provide information of any kind,whether written or,to,or otherwise collaborate in any way in the taking of any action with,any third party concerning cooper tire,without first receiving the written approval of cooper tire and b not to take action or make any statements which could cause cooper tire any embarrassment or humiliation or otherwise reflect negatively on cooper tire or cause cooper tire to be held in disrepute.in the event of a violation of the terms and conditions of this section,i agree cooper tire shall have the right to seek any injunctive,equitable and other legal relief available to it.
emphasis added.
the separation agreement,which was prepared on or about october,advised barnett to seek legal representation before signing it.barnett retained farese of farese,farese farese,in ashland,mississippi.during their initial meeting on october,barnett informed farese that she and another employee,sheila hall,had burned documents at the behest of hogan cooper,her manager at cooper tire the documents were allegedly discoverable in pending litigation in arkansas.see whitaker cooper tire rubber.
while barnett was still at farese office,and without her knowledge,farese telephoned tab turner,a products liability lawyer in arkansas who,farese remembered,had recently obtained a large verdict against cooper tire in mississippi.the telephone conversation lasted approximately minutes.turner suggested that farese acquire a lot of detailed information from barnett.
after farese had talked with turner,he drafted an affidavit for barnett,containing her statements.she executed it that day.almost immediately after it was executed,farese telephoned turner and read the affidavit to him.
a few days later october,cooper tire emailed to farese its proposed separation agreement prepared initially on or about october.among changes proposed by farese,he made the following to its clause,in order to shift the separation agreement effective date from to october and make the clause prospective,by inserting hereafter before its operative language.farese emailed the revised separation agreement to cooper tire on october.
almost immediately after emailing his proposed revisions to cooper tire,and without barnett knowledge,farese faxed her affidavit to tab turner the cover sheet stated tab lucky dog attached is a copy of the affidavit.prior to this email,farese had never addressed turner as lucky dog.as developed in subsequent discovery,farese believed that,had he provided the affidavit to turner after barnett signed the separation agreement,we would have breached the separation agreement.
cooper tire rejected farese proposed changes to the clause and the separation agreement effective date,but did acquiesce in a number of other changes.executed by barnett on october,the separation agreement states,inter alia i hereby voluntarily resign from employment at cooper tire effective october,this agreement does not become effective or enforceable until seven days from the date on which i execute this agreement the effective date and,at the bottom of the final page,effective date october.emphasis added.
on october the day before barnett executed the separation agreement,turner emailed kaster and paul byrd,plaintiffs counsel in the arkansas whitaker action,to inform them of the existence of barnett affidavit,but did not disclose her identity,stating she is not yet ready to come forward due to a pending employment problem,but is very concerned about what she has done.on the other hand,turner did provide kaster and byrd with a general overview of the affidavit contents and ended by stating 
i thought you should know about this so you can ask some questions to set the situation up.i would suggest that you be very careful about how you do this so as not to tip anyone off about what you might know.
subsequent to this email,byrd and his partner,james swindoll,telephoned turner repeatedly,asking whether the affiant was ready to come forward.by a march email,turner disclosed barnett identity to byrd.swindoll soon obtained a copy of the affidavit from turner and provided it to kaster.
the week after obtaining the affidavit,byrd met with farese at his law office in ashland,mississippi,where they discussed barnett,her affidavit,and what farese knew about sheila hall as noted,she is identified in barnett affidavit as having burned documents with barnett.at his deposition in this action,byrd testified that farese informed him he would have to subpoena barnett if he wanted to depose her.cooper tire asserts farese did this in order to get around the language of the separation a greement.
cooper tire learned from kaster of the affidavit existence during a march hearing in the whitaker litigation.kaster initially resisted cooper tire requests to reveal barnett name and for a copy of the affidavit.the district court in arkansas reviewed the affidavit in camera and,in,ordered kaster to produce it to cooper tire.
on april,the whitaker plaintiffs noticed barnett deposition for april.the record does not reflect whether she was subpoenaed.byrd testified in his deposition in the instant action that he did so but,he changed his testimony on the deposition errata sheet,stating he could not remember whether he had.farese never determined the validity of the subpoena assuming barnett was subpoenaed nor,prior to barnett deposition being noticed,did he tell her that he had been in contact with the whitaker plaintiffs counsel.
by a faxed april letter,farese notified greg meyers,cooper tire counsel,of barnett deposition,set for april.farese asked if meyers believed the separation agreement prevented barnett testifying advised barnett had done nothing since the execution of the separation agreement to violate it and claimed the separation agreement became effective october.
by a faxed april letter,meyers responded that the separation agreement did not prevent barnett from being deposed pursuant to a valid federal court subpoena.meyers took exception,however,to farese assertion that barnett had done nothing since the execution of the separation agreement that would violate its terms.meyers asserted the separation agreement stated the effective date was october the affidavit was in violation of the agreement and if barnett had executed the affidavit prior to executing the agreement,then it was bad faith not to disclose this to cooper tire.
by a faxed april letter,farese replied to meyers you are correct about the effective date of the agreement it was october.emphasis added.he stated,however,that the separation agreement was silent regarding any disclosures made prior to its effective date.
barnett was deposed on and april.approximately two weeks later may,her affidavit was leaked to a national business television news organization,which gave the story wide coverage.the story broke that same day,with cooper tire stock price dropping approximately million in the first hour of trading and closing the day down million.
on may,barnett was subpoenaed to attend a may hearing in district court in little rock,arkansas,in the whitaker litigation.farese held a minute telephone conversation with the whitaker counsel the morning the subpoena was sent to barnett however,neither party to that conversation recalls its subject matter.at the hearing,and in a subsequent deposition,barnett testified that she had not wanted to attend the hearing.despite her not wanting to do so and her living in another state,over miles from the courthouse in arkansas,farese made no effort to quash the subpoena.see.c a ii on timely motion,the court by which a subpoena was issued shall quash or modify the subpoena if it requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than miles from the place where that person resides emphasis added.
the hearing concerned the whitaker plaintiffs sanctions motion for cooper tire alleged spoliation of evidence.at the hearing,and contrary to her affidavit,barnett testified that she had not been instructed by hogan cooper or anyone else at cooper tire to burn documents.she testified that,instead,she was afraid of being blamed for the failure to remain current with cooper tire document retention policy and of adverse consequences if anyone found out.when cooper tire attempted to question barnett about the circumstances surrounding its terminating her employment,the whitaker plaintiffs objected,asserting the questions were violative of the separation agreement.as a result,the court subsequently struck barnett entire testimony because the defendants including cooper tire had been prevented thereby from properly her.at the end of the hearing,which included testimony by sheila hall and hogan cooper,the court found there was no credible evidence that anyone at cooper tire instructed barnett or hall to burn documents.the whitaker action subsequently settled on july for an undisclosed amount.
the whitaker plaintiffs counsel sent farese a check for.in a subsequent affidavit,kaster stated it was intended as a gift.after receiving the check,farese telephoned barnett and offered her,without disclosing the amount received.per barnett instructions,farese made the check payable to barnett father,in order to hide the proceeds from barnett husband,who was still employed by cooper tire.on his federal income tax return,farese listed his as income.when deposed in the instant action,barnett invoked her fifth amendment right against when asked how she treated her for income tax purposes.
on december,cooper tire filed this action against farese and his law firm,claiming tortious interference with its contract with barnett and tortious interference with its business relations.after obtaining additional information,cooper tire added turner,kaster,and their law firms as defendants,as well as a civil conspiracy claim.the district court bifurcated trial on liability and damages.
cooper tire claims against turner and his firm were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,the dismissal being certified under federal rule of civil procedure b as a partial final judgment.cooper tire appeal from that partial judgment was dismissed voluntarily after a settlement with turner.
farese answered and counterclaimed for abuse of process.the counterclaim was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
on september,instead of filing an answer,kaster moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.simultaneously,he moved to stay discovery,joined later by farese,pending disposition of the motion to dismiss.on november,the district court,inter alia,stayed discovery for days.on december,it stayed all scheduled depositions for days,but allowed written discovery during that period the discovery deadline was vacated and never reset.
on january,farese moved for summary judgment.pursuant to rule f,cooper tire moved to stay farese motion pending completion of discovery cooper tire described in the requisite rule f affidavit the numerous outstanding discovery disputes preventing its responding to farese motion.see.f.
the district court did not rule on the motion until june,almost four months later.in the interim,on february,cooper tire submitted an additional rule f affidavit addressing additional disputes that had arisen during discovery,most notably kaster numerous claims of privilege and cooper tire outstanding motions to compel.
shortly before expiration of the discovery stay on february,kaster,joined by farese,moved to extend it.the district court granted the motion on march,with the stay being extended an additional days,or until a ruling on kaster motion to dismiss,whichever occurred first.the order,however,allowed cooper tire to conduct any scheduled depositions in march and april.
in june,the district court denied cooper tire rule f motion,ruling that it had ample time to conduct discovery.cooper tire rubber farese.june unpublished order.subsequently,kaster motion to dismiss was denied.kaster answered cooper tire complaint,and,shortly thereafter,filed a summary judgment motion similar to his motion to dismiss.
on august,without additional discovery being conducted,the district court awarded summary judgment to farese and kaster and their firms.the court held the separation agreement was ambiguous as to the effective date this ambiguity was caused by cooper tire draft ing the final version of the separation a greement in direct response to somehow discovering the existence of the barnett affidavit under mississippi law,agreements are void per se for illegality under mississippi law,the separation agreement was unconscionable and because the separation agreement was invalid,cooper tire claims failed as a matter of law.cooper tire rubber farese,slip op.at.august emphasis added farese.
a summary judgment is reviewed de novo,applying the same standard as the district court,ford motor.dep t of,cir.such judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing a summary judgment.murray earle,cir citation omitted.
an issue is genuine if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.hamilton segue software,cir citation omitted.a fact issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.thompson goetzmann,cir citation omitted.
cooper tire contends the district court abused its discretion in denying the rule f motion made improper factual findings on summary judgment regarding material fact issues and erred in concluding the separation agreement clause was void for illegality and unconscionability under mississippi law.because the summary judgment is vacated,it is not necessary to reach the rule f issue.
as an affirmative defense,kaster raises an agreement between cooper tire and the whitaker plaintiffs attorneys,reached during settlement negotiations for that action and which was described on the record at a hearing in district court in arkansas regarding those negotiations.because of that agreement,kaster asserts accord and satisfaction for any claims arising out of the use of barnett affidavit or anything else stemming from the whitaker action.
the agreement states neither side will assert sanctions ethical complaints or allegations against anyone arising out of the whitaker case emphasis added.in court,kaster characte
