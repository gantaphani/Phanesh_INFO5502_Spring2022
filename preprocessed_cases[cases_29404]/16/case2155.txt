defendants david massman and general motors corporation gm appeal from the district court order granting plaintiff james mattis motion to remand and amend his complaint.mattis had initially raised four separate claims in his complaint filed in the michigan state court.gm subsequently removed the case to federal court on the grounds that all mattis claims were preempted by of the labor management relations act.in the district court,mattis moved to amend his complaint and eliminate two of his four claims.he argued that the remaining two tort claims were not preempted because they did not implicate the collective bargaining agreement governing mattis employment.the district court agreed and granted the motion to remand.because we find that mattis remaining claims were preempted by,we now reverse.
gm employed james mattis as an hourly production worker in a metal fabricating plant in flint,michigan.because mattis was a member of a bargaining unit represented by the united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural implement workers uaw,his employment was governed by the collective bargaining agreement cba entered into by uaw and gm.he worked at the plant up through october,when he was terminated after allegedly striking his supervisor,david massman.mattis disputed this allegation and subsequently filed a complaint against both massman and gm in the michigan state court.
in his complaint,mattis raised four separate claims against gm interference with an existing contract tortious interference with an advantageous economic relationship or expectation tortious interference with contractual relationship and intentional infliction of emotional distress.to support each claim,mattis alleged that he had been wrongfully terminated and that he had been subjected to repeated harassment by massman long before his termination.according to mattis,massman harassment included assigning workers with less seniority to the more desirable jobs,preventing mattis from learning how to perform certain tasks,following mattis around and recording when he was late,forcing mattis to perform the more difficult jobs in the plant,causing mattis to lose vacation days,and refusing to grant mattis an excused absence when he was ill.on the day mattis allegedly struck massman,mattis claimed that massman had insulted his daughters.
on august,gm removed the case to federal court on the ground that mattis claims were preempted by of the labor management relations act lmra.mattis responded,on september,by filing a motion to amend his complaint and remand the case back to state court.mattis wanted to amend his complaint by eliminating counts i and iii listed above.according to mattis,because counts ii and iv,the remaining claims were not preempted by,the case should be remanded back to the michigan state court.gm disputed this claim,arguing that counts ii and iv were still preempted by.although counts ii and iv were tort claims,gm argued that they were essentially claims for breach of contract,which were clearly preempted by.
after a hearing on the issue of preemption,the district court found that counts ii and iv were not preempted by and granted mattis motion to remand and amend his complaint.in reaching its decision,the district court reasoned that the tort claims were not preempted because they were premised on the alleged harassment,rather than the wrongful termination.the district court granted the motion on december,and gm filed a motion for reconsideration on january.the district court denied this motion on february.gm now timely appeals both the granting of mattis motion to remand and amend his complaint,along with the denial of gm motion to reconsider.
we must decide whether the district court erred in finding that counts ii tortious interference with an advantageous economic relationship or expectation and iv intentional infliction of emotional distress were not preempted by.we review the district court decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction de novo.long bando of,cir.
section provides that 
suits for violations of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties 
a.as this court has explained,t he supreme court has interpreted this language to require federal of state actions when those actions are inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.jones motors,cir citing lueck,d and textile workers union lincoln mills,d internal quotations and citations omitted.the supreme court has justified its interpretation by emphasizing the importance of uniform federal law in this area.
t he subject matter of section a is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law the possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective agreements the importance of the area which would be affected by separate systems of substantive law makes the need for a single body of federal law particularly compelling.the ordering and adjusting of competing interests through a process of free and voluntary collective bargaining is the keystone of the federal scheme to promote industrial peace.state law which frustrates the effort of congress to stimulate the smooth functioning of that process thus strikes at the very core of federal labor policy.

given the importance of maintaining uniform federal law,the supreme court has made clear that of the lmra preempts any claim arising from a breach of a collective bargaining agreement.smolarek chrysler,cir en banc.preemption under applies not only to contract claims,but has been expanded to include tort claims as well.id.at citing,at.not every tort claim,however,relating to employment will be subject to preemption under.id.at.to survive preemption under,the tort claims must be independent of the cba.lingle norge div.of magic chef,d,at.analyzing claim to determine if it was independent of any right established by contract,or,instead,whether evaluation of the tort claim was inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract decoe motors,cir citing lingle.
in,for example,the plaintiff brought a wisconsin tort claim of handling of an insurance claim against the defendant.the plaintiff right to insurance,however,had been established by the collective bargaining agreement entered into by his union and the defendant.in finding the claim to be preempted,the supreme court explained,b ecause the right asserted not only derives from the contract,but is defined by the contractual obligation of good faith,any attempt to assess liability here inevitably will involve contract interpretation.at.yet,in lingle,the supreme court found that the plaintiff retaliatory discharge claim,which alleged retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim,was not preempted by.the supreme court reasoned,the remedy in this case is independent of the agreement in the sense of independent that matters for purposes resolution of the claim does not require construing the collective bargaining agreement.at.thus,the basic question before this court is whether mattis tort claims are independent of the cba that governed his employment.
to determine whether a claim is sufficiently independent to survive preemption,this court has adopted a inquiry.decoe,at.first,courts must determine whether resolving the claim would require interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.if so,the claim is preempted.second,courts must ascertain whether the rights claimed by the plaintiff were created by the collective bargaining agreement,or instead by state law.id.at.if the rights were created by the collective bargaining agreement,the claim is preempted.in short,if a claim fails either of these two requirements,it is preempted by.using the approach established in decoe,we now evaluate each of mattis two claims.
