prg is a delaware corporation and an experienced developer of independent power projects.tnmp is a texas electric utility under the authority of the puc.prior to,tnmp contracted with texas utilities electric company to purchase power.in,tnmp issued a request for proposal for energy to fill its anticipated need for or.prg responded to the request,proposing construction of a qf,a natural generation facility,to be located in lewisville,lewisville power project.in march of,prg and tnmp entered into negotiations for the lewisville power project to provide power to tnmp.the lewisville power project was certified as a qf on september,pursuant to a.prg secured sources of equity,identified a site,held zoning discussions,and undertook various other steps in furtherance of the lewisville power project.on february,prg made a final written commitment which,it argues,gave rise to a leo.tnmp then denied the existence of a leo and refused to execute an agreement with prg.tnmp instead renegotiated with its previous provider at a rate higher than that offered by prg.
on august,prg petitioned the puc to order tnmp to purchase power from prg lewisville power project.on march,the puc dismissed prg petition without prejudice,interpreting the applicable rule,puc subst.f b,such that utilities were required to purchase from a qf pursuant to a leo only if the qf could deliver power within days of notifying the utility that energy would be available.the puc determined that under texas law,because prg qf was not yet completed and therefore incapable of producing power for delivery within days,a leo was not created when prg offered to supply energy to tnmp.
prg then sought judicial review of the puc order in state court in travis county,texas.the travis county district court affirmed the puc final order on march.prg appealed the ruling to the third court of appeals in austin.on january,that court affirmed the texas trial court and the puc,holding that the puc interpretation of rule f b is reasonable and not preempted by federal law and that the puc did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in refusing to compel tnmp to contract with prg.power res.group,pub.util.comm of.pet.denied.prg petitioned for review by the texas supreme court that petition was denied on october.
prg then petitioned ferc pursuant to h b,requesting that ferc undertake an enforcement action against the puc for its failure to implement purpa regulatory scheme.after ferc had not acted on prg petition for days,prg filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of texas,as authorized under h b providing that a united states district court may require such state regulatory authority to comply with such requirements of section f,and such court may issue such injunctive or other relief as may be appropriate.
the puc and tnmp,as an intervenor,moved to dismiss prg action,arguing that the doctrine barred district court review of prg claim because proper review of the federal question was available via a petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court because the texas state courts had decided the issues presented,res judicata collateral estoppel barred the same claims in federal court prg had no standing under h b because it is not a qf and sovereign immunity barred pursuit of the claim in federal court.prg responded that,res judicata,and collateral estoppel did not apply because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims under purpa.it also argued that it was a certified qf and,therefore,had standing,and that the prospective relief it requested was not barred by sovereign immunity.
