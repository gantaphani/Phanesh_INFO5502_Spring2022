this is an appeal from the district court vacatur of an arbitration award.finding that the district court improperly vacated the award,we reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate the arbitration award in favor of the.
factual background 
are individuals who were employees of seagull energy.the plaintiffs comprised virtually all of the employees of the operations and construction group group,a division of seagull.this division provided maintenance,repair,regulatory support and other services connected with operating pipelines for various client chemical companies of seagull.seagull had adopted a management stability plan the plan in which provided that employees involuntarily terminated within two years after a change in control,such as a merger,would receive specified severance benefits.all parties agree that the plan is an erisa plan.however,this erisa plan had a somewhat different twist.it provided that disputes under the plan should be submitted to arbitration,but the arbitrator standard of review of the committee decision on benefits would be the standard of review which would be used by a federal court in reviewing such decision under the provisions of erisa.
federal law on arbitration is firmly and clearly established.erisa,a newer federal law,that preempts much state law,is likewise firmly established in a number of areas.both the plan administrator under erisa and the arbitrator under the federal arbitration act faa are generally entitled to considerable deference in their decision making.by electing to send this case to arbitration,and then appealing the arbitrator decision to federal court,defendant has presented this court with the responsibility of reviewing,under firmly established arbitration law,a decision of an arbitrator who had the responsibility of interpreting an erisa plan under federal erisa law.
in the fall of,seagull officials began talking openly to its employees including plaintiffs about the possibility of layoffs in connection with a company downsizing as well as possible mergers.then,on november,seagull announced a merger with ocean energy,with ocean being the surviving entity.shortly after this announcement,seagull principals began meeting with buckeye pipeline buckeye to discuss the possibility of a separate acquisition of the group by buckeye rather than to take the business into the merger with ocean.seagull ultimately made the decision to sell the group to buckeye.
plaintiffs argue that the employees were an important consideration in the sale because the assignment of any contracts to buckeye required the consent of the customers.plaintiffs assert that the customers were interested in and had purchased the services that personnel could provide with little concern for the hard assets utilized in completing the work.therefore,ensuring that the employees were on board for any sale of the group was critical in completing the sale.
in an effort to reassure personnel as to their job security,and to keep these employees working for seagull while seagull obtained the necessary consents from its customers,on january,seagull cfo,william transier,sent a memo to the personnel stating that as to any employee terminated prior to the merger in a reduction in force and any employee terminated after the merger,plan benefits would be available.the memo also stated that the merger would constitute a change in control which would trigger the payment of plan severance benefits.the memo concluded,we will continue to communicate with you regarding decisions affecting you and the future of your position at seagull.emphasis added.there was a summary plan description attached to the memo which further provided 
if you obtain new employment while you are receiving benefit payments under the plan,your severance benefits will not be reduced by your compensation or benefits earned with your new employer.
emphasis added.
the january transier memo was followed up by a fourth amendment to the plan this amendment provided for payment of severance benefits in the event the merger was consummated.it was enacted on january,retroactive to january and provided,in pertinent part 
other than with respect to the transactions contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger between seagull energy corporation and ocean energy,dated as of november,which if consummated,shall constitute a change in control for all purposes under the plan,following which severance benefits shall be payable as provided herein,the plan shall be,and is hereby,terminated.
on or about february,seagull and buckeye signed the purchase and sale contract to sell the group to buckeye for million.the plaintiffs then spent the month of march securing the necessary customer consents to allow the assignment of the contracts to buckeye.
the merger was set to close on march.on the evening of march,the seagull board adopted a fifth amendment to the plan.it provided,in pertinent part 
that the term involuntary termination shall not include a termination for cause,a termination of a covered employee employment occurring as a result of or in connection with the sale or other divestiture by the employer of a division,subsidiary,or other business segment if such covered employee is offered continued employment by the acquirer of such business segment immediately upon such sale or divestiture 
plaintiffs assert that in spite of the january assurances of cfo transier,seagull had surreptitiously developed a scheme to keep the personnel working for seagull during the merger process,but to exclude them from severance benefits under the plan.in order to accomplish this,they contend that the company enacted the aforementioned amendments four and five to the plan,the fourth amendment to keep the employees working and affirm the benefits in question and the fifth amendment to take away the same benefits.plaintiffs assert that the fifth amendment was specifically designed to prevent them from being entitled to plan severance benefits by its redefinition of involuntary termination.in fact,james hackett,ceo of seagull admitted that but for the fifth amendment,the plaintiffs would have been entitled to severance benefits under the plan.seagull and ocean officially merged on march.on march,the plaintiffs were terminated from and they went to work for buckeye on april.
when the plaintiffs did not timely receive severance benefits pursuant to the terms of the plan,they each filed a claim with the ocean organization and compensation committee the committee.the primary task of the committee was to decide executive pay.however,it was also the named fiduciary with the power to administer the plan and to review claims.it was primarily composed of outside directors and senior ocean executives.
this was the first time the committee had been called upon to make a decision regarding plan benefits.the arbitrator opinion recites that testimony at the arbitration hearing indicated that a packet of information was provided to the members of the committee,at a called meeting,at which the claims of the plaintiffs were considered.a part of the packet was a denial letter previously drafted by general counsel,richard reeves,who was also the recording secretary for the committee.the committee met for one hour and considered twelve items.plaintiffs claims were the last item on the agenda and the committee spent less than five minutes on that item.a denial letter was sent to each plaintiff and thereafter each exercised his appeal rights under the plan.
the committee was also designated as the appeals forum.when the appeal of the denial of benefits was brought before the committee,reeves was again present and had a prepared response and denial letter which the committee adopted with little consideration and no changes.also present was ivey,who was ultimately defendant trial counsel through the course of this litigation.
feeling aggrieved,the plaintiffs filed suit in texas state district court.ocean removed to federal court and then moved the district court to compel arbitration.the district court ordered plaintiffs claims to be arbitrated.the parties agreed on an arbitrator and submitted the case.the arbitrator entered a page opinion awarding the plaintiffs benefits under the plan totaling some million plus attorney fees and interest and interest.
ocean then filed an application to vacate the award in the district court.ocean did not file a transcript of the arbitration proceedings nor any of the exhibits submitted to the arbitrator as part of the record for review by the district court.accordingly,even if it was appropriate to do so,the district court could not have reviewed the factual basis of the arbitrator findings.the only documents filed supporting the application to vacate the arbitrator award were the plan,the legal briefs filed with the arbitrator,and the arbitrator opinion.the only other document found in the record is exhibit c to plaintiffs response to ocean application to vacate arbitration award which is plaintiffs statement of claim submitted to the arbitrator.this document calls into issue the entire decision making process concerning the fourth and fifth amendments to the plan as well as the decision to deny benefits.plaintiffs statement of claim clearly presented to the arbitrator all of the issues decided by the arbitrator.there is no indication,before the court,that defendant objected to any of the issues submitted to arbitration by plaintiffs,until after the arbitrator decided against defendant.
the district court vacated the award,finding that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers,misunderstood the law,and misread the contract.the district court further wrote t he arbitrator exceeded his power by applying the wrong standard for reviewing the compensation committee decision.
the issues 
plaintiffs have appealed,asserting that the district court improperly applied a de novo standard of review ignoring the considerable deference due arbitration awards.ocean contends here and contended in its application to vacate in district court that the arbitrator wrongly took up the breach of fiduciary claim.ocean also argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by reviewing the merits of the plan and its amendments.plaintiffs contended that ocean never disputed the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to resolve all disputes between the parties arising from the plan until the application to vacate was filed.plaintiffs also point out that it was ocean that moved to compel arbitration and that it was not until the arbitrator ruled against ocean that ocean was heard to complain of the arbitrator jurisdiction.ocean contends that the arbitrator both exceeded his power and acted in manifest disregard of the law by not applying,or in misapplying,the correct standard of review,a contention that the district court,at least implicitly,agreed with.
standard of review 
this court reviews the district court decision to vacate an arbitration award under a de novo standard,prestige ford ford dealer computer services,cir,with an exceedingly deferential view of the arbitrator award.see brabham edwards sons,cir citing glover ibp,cir.
a district court review of an arbitration award is extraordinarily narrow.prestige ford,at quoting gateway technologies,mci telecommunications,cir.in united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel car,d the supreme court held 
respondent major argument seems to be that by applying correct principles of law to the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement it can be determined that the agreement did not so provide,that therefore the arbitrator decision was not based upon the contract.the acceptance of this view would require courts even under the standard arbitration clause to review the merits of every construction of the contract.this plenary review by a court on the merits would make meaningless the provisions that the arbitrator decision is final,for in reality it would almost never be final.this underlines the fundamental error which we have alluded to in united steelworkers of america american manufacturing,d.as we there emphasized,the question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator.it is the arbitrator construction which was bargained for and so far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different than his.
emphasis added.if an award is rationally inferable from the facts before the arbitrator,the award must be affirmed.see antwine prudential bache securities,cir.
this court has held that whatever indignation a reviewing court may experience in examining the record,it must resist the temptation to condemn imperfect proceedings without a sound statutory basis for doing so.prestige ford,at quoting forsythe,gibbs oil of texas,cir.the statutory bases for vacating an arbitration award are set forth in the federal arbitration act at a which provides that an award may be vacated 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud or undue means 
where there is evidence of partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers 
besides the four statutory grounds,manifest disregard of the law and contrary to public policy are the only nonstatutory bases recognized by this circuit for vacatur of an arbitration award.see prestige ford,at,brabham,at.see also,williams cigna financial advisors,cir,cert.denied,d.this court has specifically disavowed arbitrary and capricious as a ground for vacatur.see brabham at.the brabham court also clarified that the essence test the award failed to draw its essence from the contract is not a separate nonstatutory ground for vacatur but is part and parcel of a of the faa the arbitrator exceeded his powers.brabham at.
this court has referred to the so called essence test as rather metaphysical.executone information systems,davis,cir.to draw its essence from the contract,the award must,in some logical way,be derived from the wording or purpose of the contract.id.at,quoting brotherhood of trainmen central of georgia,cir,cert.denied,d.under the essence analysis,t he single question is whether the award,however arrived at,is rationally inferable from the contract.operating tennessee gas pipeline,cir.
the district court vacated the arbitration award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his powers,misunderstood the law,and misread the contract.the only one of these three grounds that is recognized by fifth circuit law is that the arbitrator exceeded his powers.it should be observed that the district court concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers because his ruling was contrary to law.the district court seems to have mixed a statutory basis for vacatur exceeded his powers with a nonstatutory basis,not recognized by the fifth circuit,that is,the arbitrator failed to follow the law.the district court did not appropriately consider fifth circuit precedent as to either of these grounds and showed only passing deference to the arbitrator decision.
ocean incorrectly asserts that this circuit recognizes three nonstatutory grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award.those being,the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law,the award failed to draw its essence from the contract,and the award was arbitrary and capricious.as previously stated,only one of these nonstatutory grounds is recognized by the fifth circuit,manifest disregard of the law.thus the only issues to be considered by this appellate court are did the arbitrator exceed his powers or was his award in manifest disregard of the law we will address fifth circuit law as to these two grounds for the vacatur of an arbitration award.
did the arbitrator exceed his powers 
it is that the arbitrator jurisdiction is defined by both the contract containing the arbitration clause and the submission agreement.if the parties go beyond their promise to arbitrate and actually submit an issue to the arbitrator,we look both to the contract and the scope of the submissions to the arbitrator to determine the arbitrator authority.
