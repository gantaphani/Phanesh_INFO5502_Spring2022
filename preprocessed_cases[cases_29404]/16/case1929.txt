in,the heirs of northup,predecessors in interest to appellant northup properties,northup,executed an lease of acres in kentucky the lease to united fuel and gas company,the predecessor in interest to appellee chesapeake appalachia,chesapeake.for nearly forty years,no either oil or gas from the leased property.northup then filed suit in kentucky state court for a judgment declaring the lease null and void.chesapeake removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,and the two parties filed for summary judgment.after a hearing,the district court granted summary judgment for chesapeake and denied northup motion.northup appealed,and we affirm.
neither party disputes the facts in this case.in relevant part,the lease contains the following provisions 
it is agreed that this lease shall remain in force for the term of ten years from this date and as long thereafter as the said land is operated by the lessee in the search for or production of oil or gas,with an extended term by payment of rentals as hereinafter set forth.
in the event that lessee does not market the gas from said premises,lessee is to pay delay rental until such time as the gas is marketed.
lessee shall pay the lessor a rental at the rate of per acre per annum payable quarterly in advance beginning three months from the date hereof,in lieu of development of the entire leased acreage provided,however,that each gas well drilled by lessee on any portion of said land,whether the same be productive or,shall liquidate and abate said delay rental with reference to acres of the leased premises.
it is agreed that said lessee may drill or not drill on said lands as it may elect,and the consideration and rentals paid and to be paid constitute adequate consideration for such privilege.
within the initial ten years or primary term of the lease,chesapeake drilled three wells on the property that yielded neither oil nor gas.no other drilling occurred,and chesapeake plugged two of the original wells.northup has yet to receive any oil or gas royalty as a result of the lease.in fact,since the lease began,the only pecuniary benefit to northup arises from what northup terms nominal payments of each year.this nominal payment amounted to approximately each year,or for years.
northup accepted a quarterly payment in january,but the next two quarterly payments never arrived.when chesapeake eventually tendered another payment in december of the same year,northup returned the check and notified chesapeake that it considered the lease expired by its own terms and therefore terminated at will,and requested that chesapeake execute a release in order to remove any possible cloud on the estate.in defense of the lease validity,chesapeake pointed to its payment of delay northup acceptance of the nearly four decades.
after northup filed suit in state court seeking to quiet title,chesapeake removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.northup contested the removal,arguing that the case failed to satisfy the amount in controversy,but the district court denied northup motion to remand.the parties filed joint stipulations and then for summary judgment.after a hearing,the district court concluded that the lease did not terminate by its own terms and granted summary judgment for chesapeake.after unsuccessfully moving to alter,amend,or vacate the judgment,northup timely appealed.
in denying northup motion to remand,the district court credited the affidavit of chesapeake petroleum engineer,john adams,which stated that the amount in controversy exceeded as required by a.specifically,adams estimated the future cash flows from the natural gas well at the discounted present value of the well as between and the value of the remaining undeveloped acreage of the entire leasehold estate at and the initial cost of drilling the well as exceeding.we review determination of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.smith nationwide prop.cas.ins,cir.the burden is on chesapeake to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the allegations in the complaint at the time of removal satisfy the requirement.hayes equitable energy res,cir.the district court concluded that chesapeake anticipated loss,as set forth in the adams affidavit,exceeds the jurisdictional minimum,and we agree.
the parties dispute turns on how to ascertain the amount in controversy in a case where the litigation does not seek monetary damages,but declaratory or injunctive,the cancellation of a a mineral interest.one principle is for actions seeking a declaratory judgment,we measure the amount in controversy by the value of the object of the litigation.hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d see,cincinnati ins.zen design group,cir.but the question remains whether we understand the value of this lease as purely a possessory interest in the land or whether we account for the underlying mineral interest.complicating matters is the fact that the lease never resulted in the marketing of either oil or gas.
from chesapeake perspective,the amount in controversy is not solely a possessory interest but involves the underlying mineral interest.in other words,chesapeake argues that this court should measure the jurisdictional amount by weighing chesapeake loss of its right to the natural gas contained under the acres of land.pointing to adams affidavit,chesapeake argues that the amount in the discounted future cash flow,the leaseholds minimum value,and the cost to drill the original exceeds.
weighing in chesapeake favor is the fact that several courts,when faced with similar facts,apply metrics similar to those used by adams those metrics include the tract fair market value,see occidental chem.bullard,cir using fair market value in assessing the amount in controversy,even though that value exceeded the contract price thomas well,williams natural gas,wl,at,perrin tenneco oil,ehrenfeld webber,finding the requirement unsatisfied where an expert witness testified that the market value of the tracts at issue amounted to both fair market value and net value of the mineral interest,ladner tauren exploration,wl,at,and the diminished value of the land burdened with an lease or the increased value without the lease,mckoy,schonwald,cir.
of course,accounting for mineral interests is not an exact science.the supreme court acknowledged as much in asarco,kadish,d,noting that a possible distinction between mineral leases and the lease of lands for other purposes is that mineral rights can be difficult to appraise.id.at.even so,the court maintained that the speculative character of such interests does not defeat the existence of a market value in mineral rights.id.citing.ry.warren.and as the seventh circuit observed in a tax context,a mineral lease is not worthless even in a tract where a sole well lies long as some possibility exists to drill other wells that might result in finding oil and gas in productive quantities.davis,cir.indeed,the davis court rejected the tax court argument that stopping work on the one well was an abandonment of the entire leasehold,and proof of the lack of value of the entire lease at that time.id.at.
here,chesapeake affidavits prevent the accounting of the mineral interest from becoming a matter of judicial.see frystak cabot oil gas,wl,at.june,accepting an affidavit equating the jurisdictional amount with the value of the lease and contending that the full value of the object of the litigation exceed ed.because chesapeake convinces us that the amount in controversy more likely than not exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of,the district court properly denied northup motion to remand.
proceeding to the merits,we review de novo the grant of summary judgment,including all relevant issues of law.see jones potter,cir.drawing all inferences in northup favor,we will affirm where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and chesapeake is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
northup first argues that the lease expired by its own terms after the primary term concluded and that chesapeake can not force northup to extend the lease by the payment of nominal delay rentals.but we reject this argument,concluding that the lease expressly allows for extension by payment of delay rentals.
a brief historical excursus underscores the uniqueness of the lease terms.leases contemporary to the lease often followed a form known as a producer.see owen anderson et,hemingway oil gas taxation ed.hemingway oil gas.a producer lease customarily provides that the primary term shall terminate upon any anniversary date of the lease during its primary term,unless the lessee either pays the delay rental then due or commences the operations for the drilling of a well prior to each such date.hemingway oil gas.if such operations occurred,a secondary term would ensue that typically depended on mineral production for continued existence.ordinarily,the primary term involved a definite number of years for exploration and development of the minerals,while the secondary term included an as long as or so long as clause that operate d to extend the lease as long as oil or gas was produced by the lease.williston symonds,note,the michelangelo of the oklahoma oil gas industry the cessation of production clause,spontaneous lease terminations,and cyclical or marginal production problems.city,emphasis added.the secondary term allowed the lessee to recover minerals on the lease without the risk of sudden termination.id.at.
the lease does not follow the typical producer form,and its very language confirms that delay rentals extended the lease.rather than including a habendum clause that sets forth a secondary term holding the lease as long as,or so long as,oil or gas is produced,see hemingway oil gas,the lease explicitly acknowledges that delay rental payments extend the contract through a secondary term 
it is agreed that this lease shall remain in force for the term of ten years from this date and as long thereafter as the said land is operated by the lessee in the search for or production of oil or gas,with an extended term by payment of rentals as hereinafter set forth.
the lease discussion of a secondary term held by delay rentals does not include any language equivalent to the typical as long as or so long as production phrases.rather,it provides 
in the event that lessee does not market the gas from said premises,lessee is to pay delay rental until such time as the gas is marketed.
the lease very language contemplates the possibility of gas not being produced from the the lease extending by way of delay rentals.
northup arguments to the contrary are meritless.northup cites hiroc programs,robertson,for a discussion of the term marketed,arguing that the duty to market requires due diligence and a effort to market gas.id.at.but the lease in hiroc included a habendum clause that specifically provided the life of this lease shall extend as long as oil or gas is marketed from the property hereby leased.id.a case that includes a habendum clause dictating that the lease term turns on production is inapposite to the lease here,which includes no such language.next,northup points to vaughn hearrell,arguing that the lessee in that case unsuccessfully attempted to extend the lease by the payment of delay rentals by relying on language in the lease that seemed to grant an open ended option to extend the lease beyond the primary term by continuing the payment of delay rental.but vaughn merely dictates that kentucky law will not extend a lease by delay rentals where the habendum clause contains indirect,ambiguous,and negative language.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.here,there is an express provision that discusses the payment of delay rentals to extend the lease.finally,northup contends that to interpret the lease as subject to extension by delay rentals would render the primary lease term the lease requirement still carries meaning because it forces a lessee to make some attempt at developing the land.
the plain language of the negotiated document,and not a producer that delay rentals may extend the lease terms.indeed,the parties conduct suggests that they understood the lease to extend upon payment of delay rentals chesapeake paid the rentals without contest for over thirty years,and northup became a after the time when it now alleges that the lease terminated.we conclude that the district court properly held that the lease expressly provides for extension by payment of delay rentals.
next,northup argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for chesapeake because the lease is void as contrary to public policy.according to northup,chesapeake is attempting to create a permanent lease by its tender of delay rentals after the end of the initial term.such leases,northup argues,are contrary to public policy as set forth in kentucky revised statute krs.specifically,krs notes that kentucky public policy is to encourage exploration for mineral resources and to encourage the maximum recovery of all oil and gas from all deposits thereof now known and which may hereafter be discovered.krs.and arguing by analogy,northup cites to a case,electric water plant board of the city of frankfort south central bell telephone,which notes that kentucky law does not favor contracts running into perpetuity,and will void such clauses as contrary to public policy.id.at.in south central bell,the contract at issue contained no language explaining how long the agreement would continue,and a s worded,the arrangement would continue forever.id.given that chesapeake has held the lease for forty years without oil or gas production,northup argues that the lease is permanent or perpetual,and thus contrary to kentucky public policy.we reject this argument.
the district court properly observed that the kentucky statute focuses on the importance of the conservation of all mineral resources,the exploration of such resources,and the importance of preventing waste and unnecessary surface loss,and not contractual relationships between lessors and lessees.as the court noted,northup failed to cite to krs,which warns against construing krs as superseding,impairing,abridging or affecting any contractual rights or obligations now or hereafter existing between the respective owners of oil,gas,coal,or other minerals,or any interests therein.krs.
in wheeler lemaster oil gas henley,the kentucky court of appeals held that it recognize d a strong policy against a lessee holding land for an unreasonable length of time simply for speculative purposes,or because of a lack of due diligence,but that holding resulted where the lessor only revenue result ed from royalty payments received from continued production.id.at.such is not the case here.for thirty years,chesapeake paid delay rentals,which,according to hemingway oil gas,may be of substantial value where large tracts of land are involved.hemingway oil gas.in fact,the treatise adds that w here no production is obtained,the right to delay rentals may well be the most valuable right of the owner of the mineral estate.id.
hemingway acknowledges that l leases are discouraged in the industry because of the migratory character of substance.see id.u ndeveloped petroleum may be drained by production from adjacent lands.for this reason the industry soon abandoned fee conveyance or leases.but here,the policy to uphold the bargain struck between the who likely understood the migratory nature of oil and chesapeake position.see collings scheen,the essential thing is for the court to look at the contract from the standpoint of the parties at the time they executed it,and the purpose they had in view in doing so.the predecessors in interest to the lease bargained for a contract that allowed for extension by rentals,and rejected use of a form contract like a producer in order to include clauses that provided for such delay rentals.we conclude that the lease does not violate kentucky public policy.
finally,northup challenges the district court summary judgment on the ground that the lease lacks mutuality of obligation.essentially,northup construes chesapeake as seeking a unilateral right to extend an expired lease by tendering quarterly payments.but as the district court observed,the lessors had a remedy if they were so disposed to avail themselves of it by giving sufficient notice to the lessee and d
