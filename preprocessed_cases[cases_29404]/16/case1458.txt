this is an insurance coverage dispute.it arose after a state court judgment established liability for a serious accident.the district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the insurance companies,finding there to be no coverage.we hold that the district court erred in denying coverage based on the argument that the injury did not arise from use of the vehicle.another exclusion under the relevant policies remains to be considered,however,that was not addressed because of the district court initial ruling.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
juan miguel bonilla leased truck,a mobile catering truck,from jolly chef express,in dallas,texas.he also leased a space on jolly chef commissary and parking lot.daily,bonilla hired a driver and cook for each of his trucks.at the end of each day the driver and cook would return to the commissary to clean the truck and prepare for the next day route.
on february,bonilla hired fabricio fernandez to drive and isabel molina to serve as a cook on truck.molina and fernandez completed their route and returned truck to jolly chef lot.while truck was parked,fernandez poured a flammable substance,likely gasoline,on the floor of the truck to loosen the grease.fernandez then left the truck in order to turn in the money they had earned for the day.as molina began washing the dishes and trays for the day,she heard an explosion and was suddenly in flames.a pilot light from the stove had ignited the substance that fernandez had poured on the floor.molina was severely injured.
molina sued bonilla and jolly chef in texas state court.bonilla did not have insurance of his own.truck was listed,though,on jolly chef three insurance policies.jolly chef trucks were insured by employers mutual casualty company under a commercial general liability cgl policy and a commercial umbrella policy.jolly chef had also purchased a commercial auto liability policy from emcasco insurance company.the auto policy covered all of jolly chef trucks.emcasco and employers mutual are jointly represented.they will be referred to as emc except where a distinction is needed.
emc defended both jolly chef and bonilla under a reservation of rights.molina won a judgment against bonilla in the amount of.molina took nothing against jolly chef.
emc filed the present declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of texas.both bonilla and molina were named as defendants,and they are separately represented.emc denied any liability under any policy for the claims asserted in the state court suit.
in due course,each of the parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted emc motion,finding no coverage under any of the policies.there was no coverage under the cgl policy because neither bonilla nor molina was an insured.no issues are raised on appeal about the cgl policy.there was no coverage under the auto policy because the fire did not arise out of the use of the vehicle as a vehicle or the maintenance of it.there was no coverage under the umbrella policy because the meaning of use in that policy was the same as under the auto policy.
bonilla and molina appealed.

the district court concluded that none of the three policies purchased by jolly chef provided coverage for molina claims.we start our analysis with a description of each of these policies.
overview of the policies 
jolly chef purchased an auto policy,a cgl policy,and an umbrella policy.the umbrella policy gave coverage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,operation,use including loading or unloading,or entrustment to others of an automobile,if there was coverage provided under a primary policy.the coverage provided by this policy will not be broader than the coverage provided by the primary insurance policy.therefore,the umbrella policy supplemented the liability limits of the auto policy.the umbrella policy also provided coverage in the absence of coverage under a primary policy provided one was using the vehicle with the permission of a named insured.the reach of this additional coverage is contested,a contest we need not resolve.
under the auto policy,the insurer will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.
the cgl policy covered bodily injury and property damage arising from occurrences defined as accidents taking place in the coverage territory.the cgl policy synchronized with the auto policy by excluding coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any auto owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.there may have been additional exclusions under the cgl policy,but the general manner in which the two policies dovetailed is clear.
we look to texas law to determine the effect that the existence of multiple policies might have on our issues.in the principal case cited to us by both parties,the texas supreme court relied extensively on two treatises.see ins.of lindsey.one of the treatises embraced by the court,in a section not quoted,explained the interplay of two insurance policies that use the phrase arising out of ownership,maintenance,or use of a motor vehicle 
the term arising out of the operation,maintenance,or use of a vehicle typically arises in two distinct contexts first,in the context of an inclusory provision as to coverage in an automobile liability policy and second,in connection with an exclusionary provision in general liability or homeowners insurance policies.in keeping with the general rules of construction,the term may be construed differently in each context,as the coverage provision is generally entitled to liberal construction in favor of coverage,while the exclusion is subject to a narrow construction against the insurer.
couch on insurance ed footnotes omitted hereinafter couch.
the author states that both the language of exclusion and of inclusion should be read to favor coverage.we interpret that language in light of the texas supreme court identification of what it calls the fundamental point,namely,to determine what coverage is intended to be provided by insurers and acquired and shared by.lindsey,at.jolly chef intent is relevant,along with that of the insurers,in determining the reasons for the use of different policies.
the cgl policy that jolly chef purchased was found not to apply because bonilla was not an insured.that decision is not challenged on appeal.though coverage by the cgl policy is not an issue,the policy itself is relevant.had an insured under both the cgl and the auto policy been the claimant jolly chef,for example,the dispute would have had a much different form.if the auto policy did not cover the occurrence because the injury did not arise from the use of a covered auto,then the cgl policy exclusion of injuries arising from the use would not have applied and the claim would have been another exclusion.the two policies together created a range of coverage for jolly chef.
emc has argued that the accident is covered by the cgl policy,thereby excluding coverage by the auto policy.when language of coverage in a business auto policy is virtually identical to language of exclusion in a cgl policy,s ome accidents would be covered by the auto policy,others by the cgl.a single accident could not be covered by both.travelers indem.citgo petroleum,cir.
in addition,even with a liberal reading of insurance policies,it is doubtful that dovetailed policy terms such as this should be interpreted a certain way if the named insured were seeking coverage but differently if someone else such as those who are not the purchasers seek coverage.had jolly chef been found liable in the state court suit,would this claim have been considered outside
