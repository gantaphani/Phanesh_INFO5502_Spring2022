background 
in,three separate vessels carried shipments of steel from ghent,belguim,to burns harbor,indiana.the steel was damaged in transit.in,continental,the subrogee of the owner of the damaged steel,sued fednav the carrier,the vessels,and other defendants in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois in three separate cases.continental sought to recover damages under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,u.et.the bills of lading designated burns harbor as the port of discharge and specified that the united states district court having admiralty jurisdiction at the port of discharge would be the forum for any action arising out of the shipment.the bills of lading incorporated the cogsa statute of limitations of one year from the date of discharge.instead of transferring the cases to the northern district of indiana,where the bills of lading required continental to file its actions,the district court dismissed the cases.
continental appealed,and the three cases were consolidated.in,we affirmed the district court dismissal of continental cogsa claims for improper venue.continental ins.orsula,cir.because continental had made the mistake of suing fednav in the wrong court,and because the statute of limitations had run,the first phase of litigation ended in a decisive victory for fednav and a stinging loss for continental.fednav incurred substantial expenses,including attorney fees,in the process of obtaining the win.
in,fednav initiated this lawsuit against continental in the northern district of illinois to recoup these expenses.fednav predicated the district court jurisdiction over its action on diversity of citizenship.it did not invoke any other basis for jurisdiction.in its complaint,fednav sought damages for continental alleged breach of the clauses contained in the bills of lading for the goods shipped.it claimed that continental breached by filing its earlier lawsuits in the northern district of illinois,the wrong forum.fednav alleged that,as a result of the breach,it suffered damages in the form of the attorney fees,costs,and expenses it incurred defending against the lawsuits brought by continental.
continental moved the district court to dismiss fednav lawsuit on three grounds fednav lawsuit is an impermissible attempt to collect attorney fees and expenses incurred in the earlier litigation fednav may not sue continental for breach of contract because there is no privity of contract between fednav and continental and fednav filed suit in the wrong venue because the clauses in the bills of lading required fednav to bring this lawsuit in the northern district of indiana.in response,fednav characterized its lawsuit as an action for common law breach of contract and asserted that the american rule does not bar its action,that continental became a party to the relevant contracts,and that fednav lawsuit is in the proper forum.the district court granted continental motion to dismiss on the first ground offered by continental.the district court found that the american rule,which had been adopted in illinois law,barred fednav lawsuit to collect attorney fees and that no exception to the rule applied.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see.b tamayo blagojevich,cir.when analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint,we construe it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,accept facts as true,and draw all inferences in the nonmoving party favor.id.fednav has stated a claim only if it has alleged enough facts to render the claim facially plausible,not just conceivable.ashcroft iqbal,bell atl.twombly.
jurisdiction 
before addressing the district court ruling on continental motion to dismiss,we must consider the issue of jurisdiction.because federal courts have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto,bender williamsport area sch,we are bound to evaluate our own jurisdiction,as well as the jurisdiction of the court below,sua sponte if necessary,int l union of operating eng rs,local ward,cir.
in its complaint,fednav stated that it is a barbadian corporation with its principal place of business in montreal,quebec,canada.however,in its appellate submission,fednav asserted that it is a canadian corporation with its principal place of business in montreal,quebec,canada,and that continental is a new hampshire corporation with its principal place of business in new york.at oral argument,we asked fednav counsel whether fednav is incorporated under the laws of canada or the laws of barbados,and whether fednav is a corporation limited by shares,an organization limited by guarantee,or an organization akin to a partnership,in which case we would need to know the identity of each investor.we ordered fednav to supplement its submission with information regarding its citizenship.
fednav supplemental submission shows that it is organized under the laws of barbados and that it is a company limited by shares.no issue exists regarding continental citizenship or the amount in controversy.consequently,the district court had,and we have,jurisdiction over fednav claim under a.
fednav breach of contract claim and the american rule 
on appeal,fednav relies on several grounds in challenging the district court dismissal of its case against continental.we begin with the ground addressed by the district court in dismissing fednav common law breach of contract claim the district court determined that the american rule barred fednav claim seeking litigation expenses and attorney fees as damages based upon continental alleged breach of the clauses in the bills of lading.fednav argues that the district court erred in applying illinois law and the american rule.
in a case such as this one,in which federal court jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship,state law applies to substantive issues.rli ins.conseco,cir.when neither party raises a conflict of law issue in a diversity case,the applicable law is that of the state in which the federal court sits.id.in a diversity case,federal law governs procedure.thorogood sears,roebuck,cir.
fednav filed this case in a federal district court in illinois,and the parties did not raise any conflict of law issue.fednav claim of entitlement to expenses and attorney fees as damages under a breach of contract theory is a substantive issue.accordingly,we look to illinois law in evaluating fednav common law breach of contract claim and the availability of such damages 
to state a colorable breach of contract claim under illinois law,a plaintiff must allege the existence of a valid and enforceable contract substantial performance by the plaintiff a breach by the defendant and the resultant damages.reger,city bank,cir quoting vincent first colony life ins.in its motion to dismiss,continental challenged fednav claim by attacking the first and fourth elements and argued that the clauses,which doomed continental earlier lawsuit against fednav,also doomed fednav lawsuit because fednav chose to bring this case in the wrong court.like the district court,we find the fourth element regarding damages determinative.
illinois generally recognizes the american rule that,absent a statute or contractual provision,a successful litigant must bear the burden of his or her own attorney fees.champion parts,oppenheimer,cir citing kerns engelke,ritter ritter,see also in re weinschneider,cir stating that illinois follows the american rule,under which attorney fees are not available unless the parties have agreed to them or a statute provides for them taylor pekin ins.in ritter,the supreme court of illinois observed that t he cases all confirm the rule that attorneys fees and expenses of litigation can not sic be recovered in a subsequent suit as dam
