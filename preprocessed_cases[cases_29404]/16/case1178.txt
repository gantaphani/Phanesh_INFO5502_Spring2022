richard schmidt,schmidt,an orthopedic surgeon in bala cynwyd,pennsylvania,brought this qui tam action pursuant to the false claims act fca,et,against defendant zimmer,zimmer,a manufacturer,seller,and distributor of orthopedic implants.the district court dismissed schmidt complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we will reverse the judgment of the district court.
in his first amended complaint,which is at issue in this appeal,schmidt purported to allege fca violations against both zimmer and mercy health systems mercy in particular,schmidt alleged that zimmer entered into a contract with premier purchasing partners premier,an organization which acts as a purchasing agent for a group of entities,including mercy,that provide medical services for which reimbursement may be sought under the medicare program premier participants.the contract committed zimmer to provide orthopedic implants to the premier participants for a period of five years.
under this contract,the premier participants were rewarded if they purchased zimmer products in sufficient numbers to increase zimmer market share.among these rewards was a conversion incentive.this incentive was intended to compensate the premier participants for purchasing implants from zimmer rather than its competitors.under the conversion incentive,when a premier participant purchased more than the total number of implants it had purchased the year before,each additional implant could be purchased for a reduced price of.in addition,the contract allegedly provided that each premier participant would receive a bonus on implant purchases if the premier participant met the market share and volume purchase commitments.finally,the contract allegedly provided for additional incentives targeted to offset the costs associated with competitive conversion.each premier participant would forfeit the foregoing rewards if they failed to meet the commitments by zimmer.
schmidt further alleged that the rewards provided under the contract were paid to mercy and the other premier participants in cash or cash equivalents,and that these payments are a classic example of kickbacks.moreover,it was alleged that zimmer and mercy induced certain of its physicians and orthopedic departments to assist in meeting zimmer prescribed volume and market share levels by sharing with them all or part of the rewards received from zimmer under the contract.
according to schmidt,each premier participant reported its costs associated with the purchase of orthopedic implants in annual cost reports that were submitted to the united states government under the medicare program.the reporting form,united states department of health and human services form,required a health care provider to certify that the costs being submitted were true and correct,and that the provider had complied with all laws and regulations regarding the provision of health care services such certification,schmidt alleged,was a condition precedent for premier participants to obtain medicare funds from the federal government and to retain medicare funds advanced by the federal government.schmidt alleged that,despite these requirements,the cost reports submitted by mercy and the other premier participants did not disclose the rewards that they allegedly received from zimmer under the contract schmidt further alleged that mercy and the other premier participants also falsely certified on their cost reports that they were in compliance with all laws and regulations regarding the provision of health care services.
according to schmidt,the remunerations paid by zimmer to mercy and the other premier participants under the contract were made in violation of the federal act.in particular,mercy was alleged to have violated b by knowingly and wilfully soliciting or receiving such unlawful remunerations,and zimmer was alleged to have violated b by knowingly and wilfully paying or offering to pay such unlawful remunerations both mercy and zimmer were alleged to have violated a by failing to disclose to the federal government the allegedly unlawful remunerations 
schmidt first amended complaint also alleged that both mercy and zimmer violated the act also known as the stark act,by presenting,or causing to be presented,medicare reimbursement claims for services furnished pursuant to prohibited referrals specifically,the complaint alleged that there was a financial relationship between mercy and certain physicians that worked at mercy facilities,and that such a relationship also existed between mercy and zimmer.despite these alleged financial relationships,according to the complaint,mercy nonetheless unlawfully sought medicare reimbursements for services furnished under prohibited referrals.
finally,based on these alleged violations of the act and the stark act,schmidt alleged that mercy certifications of compliance with federal health care law,contained in its annual cost reports submitted to the federal government on form,were false.mercy false certifications,according to the complaint,constituted violations of three provisions of the fca,rendering both mercy and zimmer liable a,which prohibits knowingly presenting,or causing to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false claim for payment or approval,a,which prohibits knowingly making,using causing to be made or used a false record,claim,or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the federal government,and a,barring false certifications intended to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to refund medicare payments made by the federal government.
both mercy and zimmer responded to the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss.zimmer motion to dismiss was granted with prejudice mercy motion was granted without prejudice and schmidt was allowed to file a second amended complaint against it.ultimately,schmidt claim against mercy was settled,and he filed this appeal of the order granting zimmer motion to dismiss.
the district court explained its decision to dismiss schmidt fca claim against zimmer in the following manner 
it is undisputed that zimmer never submitted any cost reports zimmer could be liable under the fca only if it caused mercy to submit an allegedly false cost report.but the amended complaint does not allege zimmer reviewed,approved,or received copies of mercy cost reports or participated in their preparation nor does it allege zimmer certified the truthfulness of mercy cost reports.
courts have found a party caused the submission of a false claim by another party only where the party purposely and intentionally duped the submitting party to submit the false claim.

we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal of a claim for failure to state a cause of action under.b.pinker roche holdings,cir a court should not dismiss a complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim for relief unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claims which would entitle him to relief.pryor national collegiate athletic ass n,cir quoting conley gibson,d.in evaluating the propriety of the dismissal,we accept all factual allegations as true,construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the complaint,the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.pinker,at citing colburn upper darby township,cir.
according to zimmer,it is apparent from the face of the first amended complaint that its marketing program did not violate the act or the stark act.because it concluded that zimmer was not alleged to have caused the presentation of a claim,the district court did not reach this issue,assuming without deciding that violations of those acts had been alleged.based on our reading of the first amended complaint,it is not clear that the alleged conduct of zimmer passes muster under the and stark acts.we therefore conclude that these issues can not be resolved in the context of a motion to dismiss.accordingly,like the district court,we assume without deciding for purposes of this appeal that zimmer marketing program violated both acts.
zimmer insists that the act provides a safe harbor for marketing programs offering discounts to health care providers and that its program was designed to take advantage of this safe harbor.see b a h.when the record is fully developed,this may turn out to be the case,but the complaint alleged that the rewards given to mercy were paid to it in cash or cash equivalents and this appears to be inconsistent with zimmer safe harbor theory.see h i the term discount does not payment or cash equivalents except that rebates as defined in h may be in the form of a check.
similarly,we can not say that it is clear from the face of the complaint that zimmer marketing program was consistent with the stark act.the marketing scheme,according to the complaint,allegedly involved both zimmer and mercy sharing remunerations with physicians at mercy in order to induce these physicians to help in meeting zimmer prescribed volume and market share levels.in providing such help,these physicians allegedly made prohibited referrals for mercy to provide health services for which mercy then allegedly sought medicare reimbursement.inasmuch as the complaint alleges a compensation arrangement,a referral for services,and a medicare claim for those services,zimmer marketing scheme does not appear to be consistent with the stark act.see a healthcare,at.
the fca provides,in relevant part 
any person who 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 
conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid or 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government,is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person 
a.in this context,the terms knowing and knowingly mean that a person,with respect to information has actual knowledge of the information acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.b 
a suit to enforce the liability thus created may be instituted in two ways 
the united states department of justice may file suit to collect damages suffered as the result of fraudulent claims which cause government money to be expended from the united states treasury.alternatively,a private plaintiff may bring a qui tam action on behalf of the government to recover losses incurred because of fraudulent claims.b.when a private plaintiff brings a qui tam action,the government is permitted to intervene.but the private plaintiff may continue his suit even if the government declines to intervene.c.if the qui tam suit is ultimately successful,the private plaintiff,known as a relator,is entitled to up to of the funds the government recovers.d.
hutchins wilentz,goldman spitzer,cir,cert.denied,d.the united states declined to intervene in this case and schmidt accordingly proceeded as a qui tam relator.
to establish a prima facie claim under a,a plaintiff must show that the defendant presented or caused to be presented to an agent of the united states a claim for payment the claim was false or fraudulent and the defendant knew the claim was false or fraudulent.hutchins,at.in order to prove a claim under a,a plaintiff must also show that the defendant made or used or caused someone else to make or use a false record in order to cause the false claim to be actually paid or approved.see john boese,civil false claims and qui tam actions b,at ed citing united states ex rel.aakhus dyncorp,cir.finally,a claim under a requires a plaintiff to prove a reverse false claim that is,that the defendant made or used or caused someone else to make or use a false record in order to avoid or decrease an obligation to the federal government.see kennard comstock resources,cir pursuant to a,relators are required to allege that the defendant had an existing,legal obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government and that the defendant submitted false statements or records to conceal,avoid,or decrease that obligation.internal quotations omitted 
in united states ex rel.marcus hess,the supreme court explained the purpose of the provisions of the fca extending its coverage to those who cause a false claim to be presented and to those who conspire to obtain payment of such claims 
these provisions,considered together,indicate a purpose to reach any person who knowingly assisted in causing the government to pay claims which were grounded in fraud,without regard to whether that person had direct contractual relations with the government.
at.this statement of purpose structures the issue for decision here can it fairly be said that zimmer knowingly assisted in causing the government to pay claims which were grounded in fraud construing the facts alleged in the first amended complaint in a light most favorable to schmidt,we conclude that it can.
a false certification of compliance with applicable law creates liability under the fca when certification is a prerequisite to obtaining a government benefit.united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir see healthcare,at involving alleged violations of the and stark acts harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.a certificate of compliance with federal health care law is a prerequisite to eligibility under the medicare program.see f iv healthcare,at.it follows that schmidt alleged a violation of the fca when he alleged that mercy certified its compliance with federal health care law knowing that certification to be false.the issue for resolution is thus whether,under the allegations of the complaint,zimmer knowingly assisted in mercy false certification.
it is true,as the district court stressed,that the amended complaint does not allege that zimmer reviewed,approved,or received copies of mercy cost reports or participated in their preparation.the case law indicates,however,that a party may assist the filing of a false claim in other ways.
in hess,for example,a group of electrical contractors had devised a scheme under which they collusively bid contracts being let by municipalities and school districts that were participating in a federal program providing federal funding.at.claims were submitted to the government by the local sponsors and there is no indication that the electrical contractors participated in the preparation or submission of those claims.nevertheless,because those contractors had knowingly pursued a scheme that,if successful,would ultimately result in the submission of a false claim to the government,they were held to have caused those claims to be presented.
similarly,in united states bornstein,d,a defendant subcontractor supplied a prime contractor with falsely marked substandard electron tubes,knowing that the tubes would in turn be used in the manufacture of radio kits sold by the prime contractor to the united states.although the precise issue in the case was the number of statutory forfeitures assessable against the subcontractor under the fca,the subcontractor fca liability itself was not questioned.in fact,the supreme court,citing to hess,noted that i t is settled that the fca gives the united states a cause of action against a subcontractor who causes a prime contractor to submit a false claim to the government.id.at.
it does not appear from the opinion of the court in either hess or bornstein that the party actually presenting the claims to the government was aware of the fraudulent conduct.this was not a matter material to the court analysis,however.given the court view that the crucial issue was whether the defendants knowingly assisted in the presentat
