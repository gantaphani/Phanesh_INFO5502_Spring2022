this insurance case primarily involves the issue of whether the instant insurance policy provides coverage for a slander of title claim.the district court concluded that the policy did not provide such coverage and that the insurer had no duty to defend the insured against any such claim.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
background facts 
during the,lake caroline,lci constructed the lake caroline subdivision located in madison county,mississippi the subdivision is hereinafter referred to as lake caroline.on august,the madison county board of supervisors the board lake carolina from agricultural to planned unit development.accordingly,on december,lci executed a declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions for lake caroline.lci also created the lake caroline planned unit development lci pud.
properties,llc afp was interested in constructing and operating a golf course in lake caroline.on september,lci and afp entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of real properly the contract under which lci agreed to give afp acres of lake caroline hereinafter referred to as the golf course lands in consideration for afp building and maintaining a golf course for a period of not less than ten years,until december.the contract and warranty deed provided that the golf course lands would be subject to zoning ordinances and other governmental regulations.afp constructed and began operating the golf course in.
on february,the board adopted the master plan for the lci pud.the master plan was,according to lci,the first plan adopted for the lci pud and reflected the conditions of lake caroline,including the existence of the golf course.
in,afp became disillusioned with running the golf course and instead wanted to residentially develop the golf course lands.afp twice petitioned the november and april the golf course lands to allow for residential development.both attempts were opposed by lci,the lake caroline owners association,and hundreds of individual homeowners.the board tabled the november petition as premature because afp was contractually obligated to operate the golf course until december.the board denial of the april petition on the same grounds was affirmed on appeal by the circuit court of madison county and then the mississippi supreme court.see,llc madison county bd.of supervisors,so d.
on december,afp filed suit in state court against lci alleging breach of contract,breach of warranty deed,and slander of title claims.according to the afp complaint,the board had initially approved a master plan for lake caroline in.however,the board lost the only physical copy of the master plan,prompting it to adopt a new master plan in.afp alleges that it knew nothing of the master plan because lci withheld the fact that it was presenting a new plan to the board.afp further alleges that lci withheld from the board that afp was free to make other use of its property after the contract term expired.afp also claims that lci repeatedly misrepresented to the board that lci was the only developer within the lci pud,implying that afp was not a developer and did not have rights to develop the subject property.afp characterizes lci conduct as intentional malicious.
lci owns an insurance policy the policy issued by nationwide mutual insurance company nationwide.on november,nationwide filed suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the allegations in the afp complaint do not trigger its duty to defend under the policy.the relevant provisions policy are as follows 
coverage a governs property damage and provides,in pertinent part 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result.
property damage is defined to include 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
however,coverage is limited to property damage caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory.an occurrence is defined in the policy to mean an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.finally,the policy contains an expected or intentional conduct exclusion.thus,coverage does not apply to property damage that is expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
coverage b governs personal and advertising injury and provides,in pertinent part 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for personal and advertising injury to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any offense and settle any claim or suit that may result.
personal and advertising injury is defined in the policy to include o ral or written publication,in any manner,of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services.however,the policy also contains a knowledge of falsity exclusion.thus,coverage does not apply to any p ersonal and advertising injury arising out of oral or written publication of material,if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.
on september,the district court entered judgment in favor of nationwide on the ground that the afp complaint alleges only intentional conduct thereby triggering the expected or intentional conduct exclusion under coverage a and the knowledge of falsity exclusion under coverage thus,according to the district court,nationwide has no duty to defend lci against the afp complaint because the allegations in that complaint do not arguably fall within the scope of coverage.lci filed this timely notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court summary judgment ruling de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.wyatt hunt plywood,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.on a motion for summary judgment,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see hockman westward commc ns,llc,cir.in reviewing the evidence,we must therefore refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.turner baylor richardson med,cir.

iii.analysis 
under mississippi law,an insurer duty to defend an action against its insured is measured,in the first instance,by the allegations in the plaintiff pleadings,and only if the pleadings state facts which bring the injury within the coverage of the policy is the insured required to defend.mulberry,at quoting eeoc south.publ g,see also meng bituminous cas.an exception to this rule exists when the insurer is presented with extrinsic facts,of which the insurer has knowledge or could obtain knowledge by means of a reasonable investigation,that trigger coverage under the policy.id.at citing merchants amer.motorists ins,in such situations,the duty to defend is triggered.id.in evaluating whether a potential for coverage exists,we look not to the particular legal theories but to the allegedly tortious conduct underlying the suit.ingalls shipbuilding fic,cir citation omitted.the rules of construction of insurance contracts under mississippi law are as follows 
first,where an insurance policy is plain and unambiguous,a court must construe that instrument,like other contracts,exactly as written.second,it reads the policy as a whole,thereby giving effect to all provisions.third,it must read an insurance policy more strongly against the party drafting the policy and most favorably to the policy holder.fourth,where it deems the terms of an insurance policy ambiguous or doubtful,it must interpret them most favorably to the insured and against the insurer.fifth,when an insurance policy is subject to two equally reasonable interpretations,a court must adopt the one giving the greater indemnity to the insured.sixth,where it discerns no practical difficulty in making the language of an insurance policy free from doubt,it must read any doubtful provision against the insurer.seventh,it must interpret terms of insurance policies,particularly exclusion clauses,favorably to the insured wherever reasonably possible.finally,although ambiguities of an insurance policy are construed against the insurer,a court must refrain from altering or changing a policy where terms are unambiguous,despite resulting hardship on the insured.
centennial ins.ryder truck rental,cir.with these principles in mind,the first question is whether the allegations in the afp complaint trigger coverage under the policy.if not,the next question is whether nationwide knew of facts or could have reasonably ascertained facts that would have triggered coverage under the policy.because the parties focus almost exclusively on coverage b,we begin our analysis there.
personal and advertising b 
the parties agree that the only possibility for coverage under coverage b arises out of subsection d of the definition personal and advertising injury,which includes coverage for injuries arising out of o ral or written publication,in any manner,of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services.coverage is excluded,however,if the publication was done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.
the district court held that because the afp complaint alleges that lci conduct was intentional,the knowledge of falsity exclusion applies to preclude coverage.in doing so,the district court erred.the afp complaint alleges that lci conduct was intentional malicious.malice in this context does not require knowledge of falsity.instead,a party can be deemed to have acted with malice under mississippi law upon a showing of a reckless disregard for the truth.see eckman cooper tire rubber,so d,bulloch city of pascagoula,so d.a reckless disregard for the truth requires only that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.journal publ g mccullough,so d,quoting commc ns,connaughton,d.
this court has held under mississippi law that knowledge of falsity exclusions do not apply to conduct constituting a gross and reckless disregard of the truth.eeoc south.publ g,cir see also am.home assur.united space alliance,llc,cir i f liability can be imposed without proving that the false statements were made with the knowledge that they were false,the knowledge of falsity exclusion will not apply to preclude coverage.indeed,limiting the reach of the knowledge of falsity exclusion in this regard is consistent with the principle under mississippi law that exclusions are to be construed in favor of the insured whenever reasonable.centennial,at.thus,because the afp complaint alleges that lci acted with malice,which is defined to include a reckless disregard for the truth,we conclude that the knowledge of falsity exclusion does not apply to preclude coverage in this case.
however,we affirm the judgment of the district court on other grounds.see holtzclaw dsc commc ns,cir we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground supported by the record,even if it is different from that relied on by the district court.the parties agree that the only claim that even arguably creates the possibility for coverage is the slander of title claim.according to the mississippi supreme court 
slander of title is a phrase commonly employed to describe words or conduct which bring or tend to bring in question the right or title of another to particular property,as distinguished from the disparagement of the property itself.the slander may consist of a statement in writing,printing,or by word of mouth,and may relate to personal as well as real property t he general rule of liability for slander of title is stated as follows one who falsely and maliciously publishes matter which brings in question or disparages the title to property,thereby causing special damage to the owner,may be held liable in a civil action for damages.
words spoken of property are not in themselves actionable.but the publication of false and malicious statements,disparaging of plaintiff property or the title thereto,when followed,as a natural,reasonable and proximate result,by special damage to the owner,are actionable.the false statement may consist of an assertion that plaintiff has no title to the property of which he is the ostensible owner,or that his title is defective,or that defendant has an interest in or lien upon the property.whatever be the statement,however,in order for it to form the basis of a right of action it must have been made,not only falsely,but maliciously.
walley hunt,so d,internal quotations and citations omitted.however,the policy itself expressly limits coverage to the slander of a person or organization or disparagement of a good,product,or service.although mississippi courts have not yet addressed this issue,other courts are unanimous in holding that slander of title claims pertain only to real property,which is not a person,organization,good,product,or service.see,abm,zurich am.ins,no,wl,fid.guar.saddle ridge,wl,kickham group,am.fire ins,wl,etchison westfield ins,wl,dist.lexis,thompson.cas,wylin auto owners ins,wl.lexis,acme constr,cont l indem,wl,ohio,bank one,breakers.we see no reason why mississippi courts would rule differently.thus,we conclude that mississippi courts would follow this unanimous trend and conclude that slander of title claims do not trigger coverage under policies that limit coverage to the slander of a person or organization or disparagement of a good,product,or service.
none of the cases cited by lci compels a different result.indeed,the polices at issue in each of those cases provided coverage for slander generally and did not limit coverage to the slander of a person or organization or disparagement of a good,product,or service.see,valley improvement ass,cir policy covered damages arising out of the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or of other defamatory or disparaging material classic charter oak fire ins,wl,same royce citizens ins,policy covered damages arising out of libel,slander.
although we conclude that the policy at issue does not cover slander of title claims,lci is correct that this court review is not limited to the particular legal theories alleged in the afp complaint.see ingalls,at w e look not to the particular legal theories but to the allegedly tortious conduct underlying the suit.merchants.at holding under mississippi law that duty to defend is triggered when there is any basis for potential liability under the policy for the allegations raised in the action employers reinsurance martin,gordon jones,i t is the facts alleged,not the pleader legal conclusions,that are relevant to the insurer duty to defend.see also,sheboygan emergency med,cir f or example,if the complaint alleges facts that if proved would show that the insured had infringed the plaintiff copyright,the policy kicks in even if the complaint charges the insured only with fraud or intentional infliction of emotional distress.thu
