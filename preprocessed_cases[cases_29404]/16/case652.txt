the principal question presented is whether local union of the international brotherhood of electrical workers the union,waived its right to bargain over the effects of a particular decision made by rochester gas and electric rochester gas or the company.
the union and rochester gas bring for review of the august,decision of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board,in which the board concluded that rochester gas had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain over the effects of its decision to discontinue its policy of permitting union members to take company vehicles home at night the vehicle policy change,and by refusing to provide the union with information regarding the alleged business reasons for the vehicle policy change.the board determined that rochester gas was not obligated to bargain with the union about the company policy decision as opposed to bargaining over the efects of that decision on employee benefits,concluding that the board general counsel had withdrawn this allegation from his complaint.finally,the board granted the union a modified version of a transmarine remedy awarding back pay to the affected employees for the lost value of no longer being able to use company vehicles after work.
in its for review,rochester gas argues that the union,by operation of the parties collective bargaining agreement the cba,waived its right to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change,and that because the union had no right to bargain over that change,it had no right to receive the information it requested.the union,in turn,argues that the cba required rochester gas to bargain with the union over both the decision and its effects,and that the modified transmarine remedy was insufficient to make the affected workers whole.
we hold that a framework determines whether there has been a valid waiver of a statutorily protected right to bargain.we ask whether the applicable cba clearly and unmistakably resolves or covers the disputed issue,whether with respect to the challenged management decision or the challenged effects,and if not,whether the party asserting the right to bargain has clearly and unmistakably waived that right.
applying this framework,we deny both petitions for review and enforce the order of the nlrb in its entirety.the cba allowed rochester gas to make changes in employee work practices and to control the use of company property,but those provisions did not clearly and unmistakably allow the company to forgo any negotiation with the union over the effects of the vehicle policy change,nor did they clearly and unmistakably waive the union right to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change.moreover,we conclude that the board did not abuse its considerable discretion in granting the modified transmarine remedy.
background 
rochester gas is a utility company serving both natural gas and electricity customers in nine new york counties.the union represents rochester gas employees,including employees in the trouble maintenance and repair tmr department,which as relevant here includes a group responsible for equipment carrying up to volts.at the time of the vehicle policy change,this group was composed of seven technicians who were responsible primarily for meter installations and replacements and one inspector.
from at least until january,the rochester gas vehicle policy permitted employees to drive company vans to and from work and to keep them at their homes during their hours.rochester gas paid for the vehicles,maintenance,and gasoline,and withheld taxes from each employee pay corresponding to the value of this benefit.the company maintained this arrangement even though,as one employee testified,it was a rare occurrence for a technician to proceed directly to a work location without first reporting to the company offices.
in november,rochester gas announced the vehicle policy change by notifying the union president that,beginning on january,the tmr employees would be required to park their service vehicles in the company garage overnight.the union repeatedly demanded that rochester gas bargain over the vehicle policy change.the response of rochester gas relied upon a provision of the cba stating that the company shall have the exclusive right to issue,amend,and revise safety work rules,customs,regulations,and practices,except as expressly modified or restricted by a specific provision of this agreement.in the view of rochester gas,this provision of the cba permitted it to make the vehicle policy change without bargaining with the union over either the decision or its effects on union members.
on january,the union filed a grievance with the company labor relations analyst,arguing that w ages,benefits,hours and working conditions are mandatory topics of collective bargaining,and asserting that the vehicle policy change changed the terms and conditions of employment for its affected members.by letters dated march,and june,the union also requested the following from rochester gas a list of bargaining unit,union jobs and personnel permitted to take company vehicles home at night any company analysis of the cost of the prior policy a list of personnel permitted to store company vehicles at their homes and an indication of whether the company had also changed its vehicle storage policy with respect to any personnel.by letter dated july,rochester gas responded solely to the first of these information requests.the union then withdrew its grievance in order to pursue its remedies under the national labor relations act the act.
ii.procedural history 
the union filed an unfair labor practices charge with the nlrb regarding the vehicle policy change on june,and filed amended charges on august,and september.on october,the general counsel of the board the general counsel,having evaluated the charges made by the union,commenced this proceeding against rochester gas,under the act,by filing a formal complaint.the general counsel complaint alleged,inter alia,that rochester gas had made the vehicle policy change without prior notice to the union,and without affording the union an opportunity to bargain with rochester gas with respect to the vehicle policy change and the effects of the vehicle policy change,all in violation of a and of the act joint app x at.on january,the general counsel amended the complaint the amendment,eliminating its opposition to the decision itself and leaving only its allegation that rochester gas had failed to bargain with the union with respect to the efects of the vehicle policy change.id.at emphasis added.
after a hearing on february,an administrative law judge alj issued a written opinion concluding that rochester gas had violated a and of the act by refusing to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change and by failing to provide requested information to the union.rochester gas,case ca june,rochester gas i,reprinted in joint app x at.the alj did not address whether the vehicle policy change itself constituted an unfair labor practice because he determined that the portion of the complaint dealing with the policy decision itself had been withdrawn by the amendment of january.id.at.by its decision and order dated august,the board affirmed the decision of the alj and ordered a modified transmarine remedy.rochester gas,at,wl,rochester gas ii.these followed.
in this appeal,rochester gas argues that the board erred in holding that rochester gas violated a of the act by refusing to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change and holding that rochester gas violated a of the act by failing to provide information requested by local union.the union,in its petition,submits that the board erred in failing to address whether rochester gas violated a of the act by refusing to bargain over both the decision to promulgate the vehicle policy change and the effects of that decision and ordering only a modified transmarine remedy rather than a remedy.
discussion 
i.the requirement of decision bargaining and effects bargaining 
section a of the act requires that employers engage in collective bargaining with their employees prior to changing employees wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment.first maint,d quotation marks omitted.the act specifies that employers are required to engage in bargaining not only over the decision itself decision bargaining,but also over the effects that the decision might have upon employees terms and conditions of employment effects bargaining.see new eng.newspapers,st cir torrington extend a care emp.ass,cir applying the rule requiring effects bargaining where the underlying decision was at the employer discretion.
contractual interpretation and waiver 
we have observed that i t is axiomatic that an employer violates its duty to bargain under a of the act by changing employees terms and conditions of employment without notifying and bargaining with the collective bargaining representative of its employees.united techs,cir.nevertheless,i t is equally clear that a union may waive its statutory right to bargain over a particular term or condition of employment.id.at.such a waiver must be clear and unmistakable,for we will not infer from a general contractual provision that the parties intended to waive a statutorily protected right unless the undertaking is explicitly stated.metro.edison,d.where a union disputes the existence or extent of a waiver,t he burden of proving a union waiver rests with the employer.olivetti ofice,cir.
we have held that a clear and unmistakable waiver may be found in the express language of the collective bargaining agreement or it may be implied from the structure of the agreement and the parties course of conduct,cir see also united techs,at such waiver may be found in an express provision in the parties collective bargaining agreement,or by the conduct of the parties,including their past practices and bargaining history,or by a combination of the two.however,no waiver can be inferred absent evidence that the parties knew of,and intentionally waived,the right at issue.see apponi sunshine biscuits,cir waiver of a right under section of the labor management relations act of,requires an intentional relinquishment of a known right internal quotation marks omitted united states olano,d w aiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.internal quotation marks omitted.
deference to the nlrb decision on waiver 
when considering a decision of the board about whether a right to bargain has been waived,the amount of deference we owe to the board decision depends on the grounds for that decision.it is settled that the board is entitled to deference in its interpretation of the act,so long as its interpretations are rational and consistent with the act.litton fin.printing div,a div.of litton bus,d litton quotation marks omitted see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d indeed,we have long deferred to the board clear and unmistakable waiver requirement as the legal standard to be applied when determining whether a party has waived a statutory right provided by the act.see fafnir bearing,cir relying upon the clear and unmistakable waiver rule quotation marks omitted fayer town of middlebury,cir reiterating that waiver of a statutory right must be clear and unmistakable see also in re tide water oil,n,establishing the clear and unmistakable standard for waivers of statutorily protected rights.that remains the governing legal standard.
we do not,however,defer to the board interpretation of a contract such as a cba because the interpretation of contracts falls under the special,if not unique,competence of courts.litton,at.as the supreme court observed in litton,a lthough the board has occasion to interpret cbas in the context of unfair labor practice adjudication,the board is neither the sole nor the primary source of authority in such matters.id.at internal citation omitted.instead,courts are still the principal sources of contract interpretation.id.quotation marks omitted because w e would risk the development of conflicting principles were we to defer to the board in its interpretation of the contract in some statutory contexts and not in others,the court held,w e can not accord deference in contract interpretation here.id.at see also honeywell int l,applying litton and explaining that t he courts remain the ultimate arbiters of contract disputes because deferring to the board contract interpretation would risk the development of conflicting principles for interpreting collective bargaining agreements.internal citations,brackets,and quotation marks omitted 
ii.the waiver analysis 
where,as here,the board determination regarding waiver is based upon an interpretation of a contract,we begin by making a threshold,de novo determination of whether a matter is covered by the contract meaning that the parties have already bargained over the matter and set out their agreement in the contract.only if we conclude as a matter of law that the matter was not covered by the contract can we consider whether the board finding regarding waiver was supported by substantial evidence 
put another way,we use a framework to decide whether there has been a valid waiver of the right to bargain over a particular decision or its effects.at the first step,we ask whether the issue is clearly and unmistakably resolved or covered by the contract.if so,the question of waiver is inapposite because the union has already clearly and unmistakably exercised its statutory right to bargain and has resolved the matter to its satisfaction.see bath marine draftsmen ass,cir waiver standard is irrelevant if the unions have already exercised their right to bargain.postal,q uestions of waiver normally do not come into play with respect to subjects already covered by a collective bargaining agreement.the interpretation of such a contract is a question of law.see id.at.
if we determine that the applicable cba does not clearly and unmistakably cover the decision or effects at issue,we proceed to the second step,at which we ask whether the union has clearly and unmistakably waived its right to bargain.as noted above,such a waiver may be found in an express provision in the parties collective bargaining agreement,or by the conduct of the parties,including their past practices and bargaining history,or by a combination of the two.united techs,at.whether a party has effectively waived its statutory right to bargain is therefore a mixed question of law and fact 
under this process,an employer can successfully carry its burden of proof by showing either that the cba or any other contract governing the relations between the parties covers a particular decision,or that the union has waived its right to bargain over a particular decision.see olivetti office,at noting that t he burden of proving a union waiver rests with the employer.at either step,however,the contractual indicia of exercise of the right to bargain or proffered proof of waiver must clearly and unmistakably demonstrate the coverage or waiver sought to be proved.metro.edison,at see chesapeake potomac,cir a union intention to waive a right must be clear before a claim of waiver can succeed.
iii.the contractual coverage approach 
it bears noting that,although we have used the term covers,we have not adopted the contractual coverage approach,which several other courts of appeal use.see,bath marine draftsmen ass n,at.while some of our sister courts of appeals have decided that,although the board is obligated to apply the clear and unmistakable waiver standard,they owe no deference to the board choice of standard when the unfair labor practice turns solely on the interpretation of a labor contract,we think that approach is inconsistent with the supreme court holdings in metropolitan edison,at,and mastro plastics,and our own precedents interpreting those decisions.
although the contract coverage approach aligns with the supreme court admonition that courts are still the principal sources of contract interpretation,litton,at,ignoring the clear and unmistakable waiver standard undermines our national labor policy that disfavors waivers of statutorily protected rights,olivetti office,at.especially in the context of effects bargaining,the contract coverage approach can lead to the unwitting relinquishment of rights.taken to its logical conclusion,the contract coverage approach means that a contract granting an employer the unilateral right to make a decision almost always means that the union has also given up the right to bargain about the effects of that decision.see enloe med.ctr.nlrb,it would be rather unusual to interpret a contract as granting an employer the unilateral right to make a particular decision but as reserving the union right to bargain over the effects of that decision.as discussed previously,however,a union has a statutory right to bargain over the decision itself and the effects that that decision might have upon employees terms and conditions of employment 
our analysis preserves the precedent requiring that the relinquishment of statutory rights be deliberate and obvious,while retaining the judicial authority to interpret contracts de novo.we must interpret the relevant contract with particular attention to the heightened waiver standards that apply in the labor context.just as w e will not thrust a waiver upon an unwitting party,at,we will not find a contractual exercise of the right to bargain over a decision or its effects unless the contract clearly and unmistakably demonstrates that the parties bargained with respect to the disputed matter.
effects bargaining in this case 
rochester gas alleges that,to the extent the union had a right to bargain with rochester gas over the efects of the vehicle policy change,the union waived that right in the cba specifically,rochester gas argues as follows 
the cba gives rochester gas the right in its sole and exclusive judgment to regulate the use of machinery,facilities,equipment,and other property of the company the exclusive right to issue,amend and revise reasonable policies,rules,regulations,and practices article and the exclusive and unilateral right to issue,amend,revise or terminate any or all benefits article.
petitioner cross respondent br.at see also joint app x at,cba articles and.these clauses of the cba,rochester gas asserts,clearly reserved to the company discretion the right to change the overnight location of company vehicles.id.at.
the board,however,found that the technicians use of company vehicles was a term or condition of employment,see rochester gas i,joint app x at,which antedated the execution of the cba.accordingly,the board held that the company was,absent waiver,obligated to bargain with the union over the effects of the change.id.we agree,and now hold that the provisions of the cba invoked by rochester gas are not specific enough for us to determine that the union clearly and unmistakably waived its right to bargain over the effects of a change under those clauses.
the general right given to rochester gas to regulate the use of its machinery,facilities,equipment,and other property,joint app x at,does not explicitly or implicitly include the right to alter the terms and conditions of employment even if those terms and conditions are related to rochester gas use of its covered property.although an intent to permit the company to change its policy regarding vehicles without the need to bargain over the effects of such a decision may be a plausible reading of the contract,it is not a clear and unmistakable exercise of the union bargaining power regarding those effects.thus,although the cba reserves to rochester gas the right to make the decision to implement the vehicle policy change we conclude that it does not clearly and unmistakably cover the disputed issue.that is,the cba does not clearly and unmistakably set out whether and how rochester gas must account for the effect that the vehicle policy change has on the employee benefits relating to the vehicles.therefore,at step one of our analysis,we conclude that the union did not already exercise its statutory right to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change.
at step two,we examine the board determination that the union had not waived its right to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change.we agree with the board finding that the union did not waive this right,and we hold that this finding is supported by substantial evidence.the board adopted the extensive factual findings and conclusions of law of an alj,after a bench trial principally devoted to the issue of waiver.see rochester gas ii,wl.we defer to the board expertise as to its application of the clear and unmistakable waiver doctrine to the operative factual findings.united techs,at.
the alj,in a portion of his opinion adopted without alteration by the board,wrote as follows 
i can not find any evidence that the union has clearly and expressly waived its right to bargain over the effects of the respondent decision.nothing in the evidence relating to the negotiations for collective bargaining speaks to any intent by the union to consciously waive its right to effects bargaining and the collective bargaining agreement is silent as to effects bargaining,though arguably giving the respondent the right to unilaterally make changes in otherwise mandatory subjects of bargaining.clearly there were no negotiations over the effects of the decision to take away the private use of respondent vehicles by low voltage employees and there is no language dealing with this issue in the cba 
none of the contractual provisions in the cba address the effects of taking any action under their wording nor do they address the removal of service vehicles at all.there is nothing that clearly gives respondent the right to avoid effects bargaining from any action it might take in reliance on these articles.there is nothing in the evidence in this record about negotiations that deals with effects bargaining.
rochester gas i,joint app x at.having reviewed the board interpretations of the contract de novo and its other findings for substantial evidence,we uphold the board determination that the union had not waived its right to bargain over the effects of the vehicle policy change.
we think there is no adequate basis for implying the existence of waiver without a more compelling expression of it than appears in this cba.metro.edison,at alterations and quotation marks omitted.like the board,we will not infer from the general contractual provision here,which permits the company unilaterally to determine the use of its property,that the parties intended to waive the statutorily protected right to bargain over effects of a contractually authorized unilateral change affecting petitioners terms and conditions of employment.id.
in sum,rochester gas was required to bargain with the union over the effects of the vehicle policy change.
ii.decision bargaining 
in its for review,the union argues that the board erred in failing to consider whether rochester gas unlawfully refused to bargain over the decision to implement the vehicle policy change.
as a general matter,d of the act commits to the general counsel of the board the final authority with respect to the issuance of complaints.d.the general counsel has discretion to decide whether or not to issue a complaint,and to determine which issues to include in that complaint.wiliams,cir internal citations omitted.thus,the general counsel refusal to include an issue in the complaint is final and unreviewable.id.
a.the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion of the general counsel 
paragraph viii c of the initial complaint in this case alleged that rochester gas promulgated the vehicle policy change without affording the union an opportunity to bargain with respect to this conduct and the effects of this conduct.joint app x at emphasis added.the general counsel later issued the amendment,revising paragraph viii to allege that rochester gas promulgated the vehicle policy change without affording the union an opportunity to bargain with respect to the efects of this conduct id.at emphasis added.on review,the board recognized that the original complaint had alleged a decision bargaining violation,but held that the general counsel amendment to the complaint withdrew the allegation.rochester gas ii,wl,at.
notwithstanding the general counsel amendment and the board determination,the union insists that the allegations of the complain
