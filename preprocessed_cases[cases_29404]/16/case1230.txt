seeking fuel for a newly constructed power plant,virginia electric and power company,doing business as dominion virginia power dominion,contracted with bransen energy,bransen,and paid nearly million for coal product which would satisfy rigid specifications and environmental regulations.however,the product bransen delivered,consisting of coke breeze and waste coal,fell far short of these requirements.after dominion filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,the district court awarded dominion partial summary judgment on claims related to bransen delivery of coke breeze,and then held for dominion after a bench trial on its claims related to the delivery of waste coal.in total,the district court awarded over million in damages.bransen filed this appeal,arguing that the district court erred by ruling in favor of dominion as to both liability and damages.finding no error,we affirm for the reasons that follow.
in june,dominion began constructing the virginia city hybrid energy center the plant in wise county,virginia.the plant is a,powered electrical generation facility.the commissioning process for a new power plant includes a testing phase to assure compliance with regulatory standards.in november,dominion began the testing phase.
three years earlier,in,dominion began soliciting suppliers of performance fuel,a coal product,for the testing phase.as an industry standard,power plants use performance fuel to test equipment and determine operating capacity because of the quality and consistency of the fuel,which is higher than the quality of fuel a plant uses.dominion sought performance fuel that would be acceptable directly at the plant without further processing and would comply with environmental permits acquired from the virginia department of environmental quality.ultimately,bransen contracted with dominion to supply about half of the expected performance fuel necessary for testing,totaling tons of coal product for nearly million.the testing phase lasted around eight months,and the plant was commissioned and began commercial operations as planned on july,the commercial operations date or cod.
before the plant commissioning,the parties entered three contracts relating to the testing phase the master coal purchase and sale agreement the master agreement the confirmation for the purchase of performance fuel the confirmation and the coal services agreement the services agreement.the parties entered into two additional agreements for the purchase of up to three million tons of waste coal for a term beginning on the commercial operations date the confirmations dominion also entered a land lease agreement the lease with coal technology international,llc cti,to lease property on which dominion would store and blend coal purchased from bransen before delivery to the plant.
the master agreement,dated november,governed all subsequent dealings between the parties.it required the parties to enter transactions regarding the sale and purchase of coal by way of written confirmation a separate contract between the parties pursuant to the master agreement.if such confirmation is inconsistent with the master agreement,the confirmation prevails over the master agreement unless the master agreement otherwise provides.
the confirmation,dated january,required bransen to provide between and tons of coal,of which dominion was required to buy at least tons with an option to purchase an additional tons.in the confirmation,dominion clarified that it would only accept coal by placing an x over a line next to a paragraph defining coal.by contrast,two other products and their definitions coal and waste coal appear,respectively,above and below the paragraph for coal.there was no x marked next to either of those product descriptions.
the confirmation defines coal as conforming to specifications provided in another section of the confirmation,and it required the coal to be substantially consistent in quality throughout a shipment,and to have no intermediate sizes including fines added or removed,but it allowed limited amounts of extraneous material.the specifications referenced in this definition,entitled performance fuel specifications,establish rejection limits for criteria such as the btu measurement,moisture rate,and sulfur and ash composition.given the different technology of the plant boilers and stringent environmental limits,the confirmation also allowed dominion to suspend deliveries if the coal adversely affect ed operation of the plant within two years of the commercial operations date.id.at.
dominion entered the lease as well as the services agreement on the same date as the confirmation.though bransen was not a party to the lease,the opening recital of the lease acknowledges the pre and confirmations along with the services agreement.indeed,the lease would terminate upon the termination of the services agreement or any confirmation then in effect,either before or after commissioning.the services agreement assigned bransen a host of duties related to the transportation,management,regulation,and testing of the coal held at the cti property,including analyzing the coal to ensure compliance with the performance fuel specifications,which were identical to those in the confirmation.
the agreements limit relief available in the case of either party breach.the master agreement allows a nondefaulting party to terminate the master agreement and all other transactions between the parties u pon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default.events of default include,
the failure of the defaulting party to comply with any material obligation under a transaction covered by this master agreement except for seller obligations to deliver coal pursuant to the specifications contained in a confirmation,the exclusive remedy for which is provided in sections,and and such failure continues uncured for three business days after written notice thereof 
emphasis supplied.section thus provides three exclusive remedies for product delivered pursuant to a confirmation that does not conform to the specifications in that confirmation.
section allows for quality adjustments for nonconforming product,resulting in price modifications calculated pursuant to formulae provided in an exhibit to the agreement.alternatively,section provides dominion rejection rights,which allow either rejecting a shipment or reaching a mutually acceptable price adjustment or other arrangement with bransen,if an independent analyst determines that the shipment does not conform to specifications.id.as yet further recourse,section provides suspension rights pursuant to which dominion may suspend the receipt of future shipments after receiving multiple nonconforming shipments without rejecting them.id.at.for breach of any provision for which the master agreement does not provide an express remedy,the master agreement limits recoverable damages to direct actual damages,excluding consequential,incidental,punitive,exemplary or indirect damages,lost profits,or other business interruption damages.id.at capitalization removed.
from february through december,bransen billed dominion for,and delivered to the cti property,tons of material bransen included in this amount,however,tons of coke breeze,a industrial byproduct that was not an approved fuel source and did not qualify as performance fuel.and dominion had not acquired environmental permits to use coke breeze as fuel.coke is not coal.rather,according to the american society for testing and materials,it is a carbonaceous solid produced from coal,petroleum,or other materials by thermal decomposition with passage through a plastic state.id.at.coke breeze consists of the fine screenings from crushed coke or from coke as taken from coke ovens.id.
bransen pursued coke breeze suppliers before executing the confirmation and accepted coke breeze shipments after executing the confirmation.the shipping notices and summaries bransen provided dominion regarding the confirmation deliveries described the material delivered as coal,but bransen included the total amount of coke breeze in its invoices without disclosing that fact to dominion.see id.at.dominion provided full payment for these invoices,which totaled.a may email from michael peters,the president of bransen energies,indicates that he ceased buying coke breeze around that time because he was a lil sic nervous about dominion not approving.id.at.
the impurities in bransen deliveries were not limited to amounts of coke breeze.at trial,peters conceded that aside from the coke breeze,the product he delivered was garbage of bituminous or gob coal.indeed,peters stated that he referred to the type of coal delivered pursuant to the confirmation as gob,it is garbage of bituminous.id.at.and although peters maintained that gob coal is synonymous with coal,another one of bransen former employees who had worked in the coal industry for over years admitted that gob is synonymous with waste coal,id.at,and expert testimony established that coal is categorically distinct from gob coal.specifically,whereas coal is,gob coal is the waste or refuse remaining after removing clean coal from the product.id.at.
in december,dominion received a letter from an anonymous tipster indicating that subpar product had been surreptitiously delivered to the cti property.dominion thus began investigating the allegation,leading to an interview with peters.a summary of the interview,which peters signed and verified as true and correct to the best of his knowledge,states that the cti property had a very unsuitable,wet surface,which peters claimed required a base layer before using it for coal storage.peters claimed that he therefore purchased tons of coke breeze on which he stored around sixty percent of the stockpile.he admitted,however,that dominion had no knowledge of the coke breeze and he accept ed full responsibility for having improperly charged dominion for the coke breeze.id.at.
as a result,in january,dominion hired an independent laboratory,sgs north america sgs,to analyze the product and determine whether it was suitable performance fuel despite its impurities.the sgs reports showed that the moisture content and btu value of the delivered product exceeded contractual rejection limits additionally,in april,bransen assembled three samples of product which bransen represented to be free of coke breeze,but further testing revealed that the samples also contained trace amounts of coke breeze and produced size,moisture,and btu measurements exceeding rejection limits 
in light of the discovery of this subpar product,dominion deemed the shipments unacceptable and did not deliver them to the plant for use.in early,when the parties relationship began to deteriorate due to disputes over how to deal with bransen product,bransen attempted to resolve the issue by proposing to replace the entire amount of coke breeze,buy back the product for which dominion paid,or replace the product with material from a source.dominion rejected these proposals,however,because they depended on further contingencies,potentially delayed commissioning beyond the projected commercial operations date,and required continuing relations with bransen,whom dominion no longer trusted.
during the first half of,with the commercial operations date approaching,dominion sought and obtained performance fuel from alternative sources.in the spring of,still seeking to use coke breeze as fuel in order to salvage some value out of the product bransen delivered,dominion contacted the virginia department of environmental quality.the department of environmental quality determined,however,that dominion could not use coke breeze as fuel without modifying its existing permits.dominion thereafter applied for and obtained modifications to its air permits and waste permits in october and november,respectively.the air permits required in application fees.
endeavoring further to recover some utility out of bransen product,dominion also pursued methods of cleaning the product and blending it with higher quality material in an effort to render it suitable for use.dominion engaged harold keen service,llc,to manage this process on the cti property.but this proved problematic.the stockpile would not be depleted for eight to ten years,while the cti lease was for a much shorter period and did not guarantee extension.dominion therefore sought to clean and blend the product in nearby preparation plants with a target completion date of december.
on june,dominion counsel sent bransen counsel a letter ordering bransen to cease and desist accessing or delivering coal material on the cti property.dominion claimed it could not affirmatively terminate the contracts between the parties earlier than because early termination of the master agreement or any confirmation would also terminate the lease pursuant to its own terms,meaning dominion could thereby abandon any product for which dominion paid and stored on the property.to avoid this potential loss,on june,dominion and cti entered into two amended leases at increased rental prices for subsequent terms ending on june.
a year later,in june,bransen sent dominion a letter demanding that dominion allow bransen performance pursuant to the confirmations.specifically,bransen interpreted the confirmations as requiring dominion to order coal product from bransen after commissioning bransen therefore demanded that dominion continue to order and accept deliveries from dominion.the following month,dominion counsel provided formal notice of bransen alleged breach of the master agreement,confirmation,confirmations,and services agreement.the alleged breaches revolved around bransen delivery and concealment of,and billing dominion for,quantities of coke breeze that contaminated the stockpile.when cure periods for those contracts expired without response from bransen,dominion notified bransen that it was terminating the contracts between the parties.
on september,dominion filed the operative complaint,alleging bransen breached the contracts it entered with dominion,and seeking over million in damages.bransen answered and counterclaimed,asserting an affirmative defense of waiver for dominion alleged failure to utilize the remedies specified in the contracts,and counterclaims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the case progressed in two phases the first considered for partial summary judgment for the amount of product consisting of coke breeze the second,which proceeded to trial,considered the remaining amount of product consisting of gob coal.
dominion moved for partial summary judgment on its contract claim for bransen delivery of coke breeze and against bransen counterclaims.bransen also moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that it provided adequate assurance of performance by offering to replace the coke breeze shipments,and that dominion accepted the deliveries,failed to timely reject or revoke its acceptance pursuant to the virginia analog of the uniform commercial code ucc,and breached the confirmations by refusing to order three million tons of waste coal.
the district court granted dominion motion,holding,coke breeze is not coal and therefore could not have met the specifications in the confirmation.the district court also rejected bransen counterclaims,holding that the breach doctrine barred those claims and that the contracts between the parties departed from ucc acceptance and rejection provisions,thereby validating dominion rejection.the court further held that bransen proposed resolutions were not commercially reasonable,and that dominion complied with applicable termination procedures while bransen made no attempt to cure during the time it was contractually allotted though bransen ability to cure may have been questionable.id.at.the court thus awarded dominion in direct damages flowing from the delivery of coke breeze,consisting of the amount bransen charged dominion for the coke breeze plus the environmental application fees associated with using coke breeze as fuel.
the parties proceeded to a bench trial on dominion remaining contract claim,alleging that the remaining coal that did not contain coke breeze nevertheless failed to satisfy contractual standards.the district court held bransen liable on this claim,crediting expert testimony that the gob coal bransen delivered to dominion was waste coal and thus not the coal for which dominion contracted stemming from this breach,the court reasoned dominion was entitled to damages for expenses incurred in processing,improving,and storing the gob coal,and for purchasing replacement coal from other suppliers.relying on dominion expert report,the court calculated total damages of,and awarded these damages to dominion less the previous award of,amounting to an award of for the noncompliant coal.

t he elements of a breach of contract action are a legally enforceable obligation of a defendant to a plaintiff the defendant violation or breach of that obligation and injury or damage to the plaintiff caused by the breach of obligation.navar,fed.bus.council,alteration in original quoting ulloa qsp.bransen does not contest the enforceability of the agreements between the parties the following section therefore addresses the latter two elements.
a party who commits the first breach of contract,if material,is not entitled to enforce the contract and thereby excuses the nonbreaching party from performance.horton horton.a material breach is a failure to do something that is so fundamental to the contract that the failure to perform that obligation defeats an essential purpose of the contract.id.at.
as an initial matter,bransen argues dominion was the first breaching party by deciding as early as to cease doing business with bransen and accordingly refusing to purchase coal from bransen through pursuant to the two confirmations.appellant br.even if dominion decided against further business with bransen at that time,however,that decision would not violate the confirmations.those confirmations only obligate bransen to deliver tons of product over the term of the contract depending on dominion weekly order amounts.this provision therefore granted dominion an option not a requirement to purchase coal from bransen after commissioning.
the essential purpose of the agreements between the parties,horton,at,was to provide dominion with coal that would be acceptable performance fuel to test the plant operating capacity and comply with environmental regulations.therefore,as the court held,bransen delivery of coke breeze and subpar coal was the first material breach of the master agreement,confirmations,and services agreement.bransen defeated the essential purpose of the agreements by delivering a mixture of coke breeze and gob coal,neither of which were coal nor,as testing established,satisfied contractual quality standards.
moreover,the hoops through which dominion has had to jump to bring about any utility to dominion product underscore the materiality of bransen breach.indeed,bransen subpar product required extensive testing,which proved time consuming and costly.and the consequent findings required dominion to obtain modifications to its environmental permits at no small cost,along with locating alternative suppliers and hiring coal processors to salvage bransen product.
bransen argues that because the coke breeze made up only around seven percent of its total shipment,its delivery of coke breeze was not a material breach.but this argument rests on an essential misunderstanding of the procedural history and the characteristics of the coal separated from the coke breeze.the district court did not render judgment on a claim involving dominion aggregate shipment instead,the district court held at summary judgment that the delivery of approximately tons of coke breeze violated the contract because,put simply,coke breeze is not coal.
in an apparent attempt to create a triable issue of fact contrary to the district court summary judgment ruling,bransen points to deposition testimony of one of dominion employees,edward roarty,who concedes that the coke breeze met the specifications for sulfur and moisture.see appellant br.citing.but in the same breath,bransen acknowledges that roarty also recognized that the coke breeze was above the reject limit on btu.moreover,even if the coke breeze satisfied sulfur and moisture requirements,it would not refute the simple fact that coke breeze is not coal.
in any event,the district court verdict against bransen involved a separate issue whether the remaining coal product,separate from the coke breeze,satisfied the contract specifications the district court based its finding that gob coal is not coal by crediting expert testimony to that effect.specifically,the testimony demonstrated that gob coal is waste coal or refuse,which is not r m ine coal.given that bransen only contrary evidence was nonexpert testimony of bransen current or former employees,we can not say that this finding was clearly erroneous.see raleigh wake citizens ass n,at united states wooden,cir.overturning factual finding in face of conflicting expert testimony but cautioning courts reviewing for clear error to be reluctant to do so.and even aside from the categorical distinction between gob and coal,those amounts of coal purportedly separated from the coke breeze still contained trace amounts of coke breeze and failed to satisfy the specifications to which the parties agreed.
bransen also argues that because dominion processed the coal product in order to use it after commissioning,dominion can not claim a material breach of the contracts between the parties.but this argument conflates the materiality of bransen breach with dominion response to bransen breach.more importantly,the central purpose of the contract was to provide dominion with fuel for use before commissioning the plant,not after,so any use of the product after commissioning only underscores the materiality of bransen breach.
on the element of damages,bransen sole argument is that dominion damages expert failed to establish any damages stemming from bransen breach of the services agreement.this argument is conclusory at best and misleading at worst.bransen fails to explain how its failure to ensure compliance with performance fuel specifications,identical to those in the confirmation and required pursuant to the services agreement,did not produce dominion damages.and bransen omits that when asked about damages stemming from the services agreement,dominion damages expert declined to opine on whether his damages calculation stemmed from a breach of the services agreement but recognized the services agreement as relevant to his analysis because it required processing that effected costs associated with storing and testing the coal product.
thus,bransen is liable for delivering product consisting of coke breeze and gob coal,neither of which satisfied the contracts between the parties.the following section therefore assesses the remedies available for this breach and,in turn,the propriety of the district court damages award.
a contractual remedy is exclusive of other possible remedies only where the language employed in the contract clearly shows an intent that the remed
