tenet healthsystem surgical,appeals the judgment of the district court dismissing its claims for breach of lease and other claims against the defendant jefferson parish hospital service district,operator of west jefferson medical center.based on our conclusion that west jefferson denial of consent to tenet proposed assignment of the lease was unreasonable,we reverse.
in april,tenet healthsystem surgical,tenet contracted to lease space in a building owned by marrero shopping center,msc in marrero,louisiana.the lease provided for an initial term of five years and granted tenet the right to renew for additional terms through april.under terms of the agreement,tenet was permitted to use the premises for out patient surgical procedures and general medical and physicians offices,including related uses and for other purposes reasonably acceptable to landlord.the lease allowed the lessee to assign the lease with the consent of the lessor and provided that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.tenet occupied the premises and began operating an outpatient surgical center.
in june,west jefferson medical center west jefferson purchased the property from msc subject to the tenet lease and other leases affecting the shopping center.the leased premises are located adjacent to the west jefferson hospital campus and were a strategic purchase by west jefferson to allow for future expansion of its facilities.
tenet ceased doing business as a surgery center in august.it sought to assign the lease to pelican,pelican.pelican intended to use the premises for an occupational medicine clinic.occupational medicine clinics primarily provide medical services to industry,treating mainly workmen compensation cases,although business from the general public is also accepted.the services offered include urgent care,primary care,physical examinations,phlebotomy,drug and alcohol testing,laboratory services,and minor surgical procedures.
on august,tenet dispatched a letter to west jefferson requesting consent to assign the lease to pelican for use permitted under the lease and to alter the leased premises according to a plan that had been attached.west jefferson responded that it would not approve the assignment,and,after a request by tenet,explained that one of the reasons it had denied the requested assignment was that pelican intended to use the premises in a manner that competed with west jefferson.the other stated reasons were later mooted by settlement or withdrawn.
tenet filed suit in the judicial district court in jefferson parish in september,asserting claims for breach of the lease,violation of the louisiana unfair trade practices act and consumer protection laws,and unconstitutional deprivation of tenet property rights.the suit was subsequently removed to federal court on federal question grounds.west jefferson asserted a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that its refusal to consent to the sublease was reasonable and that its refusal did not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of tenet property rights.in its argument in favor of summary judgment on the reasonableness of its consent,west jefferson added the argument that it was reasonable in refusing consent to the assignment because the proposed use of the facility was not a permitted use under the terms of the lease.
on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of west jefferson on its counterclaim.the district court held that the reasonableness of west jefferson actions must be considered from the perspective of west jefferson.it also held that west jefferson did not unreasonably withhold consent to the proposed assignment to a third party who intended to open an urgent care,occupational medicine,and primary care facility whose operations were outside the scope of the activities of the assignor lessee,and intended to broaden the operations on the leased premises to include new areas of competition with the lessor.because it found that west jefferson actions did not breach the lease,tenet other claims failed as well.
after the court granted summary judgment,the parties agreed to settle their claims related to proposed alterations to the premises however,they expressly preserved tenet right to appeal the district court holding that west jefferson acted reasonably in denying the sublease because pelican would provide more competition with west jefferson.tenet now appeals.

article of the louisiana civil code governs a lessee right to sublease or assign the lease.
the lessee has a right to underlease,or even to cede his lease to another person,unless this power has been expressly interdicted.
the interdiction may be for the whole,or for a part and this clause is always strictly construed.

these rules have been applied in few louisiana cases,but the following applications emerge.a lessor may reasonably refuse his consent to a proposed sublease or assignment if the proposed sublessee or assignee is financially inferior to the present lessee.casino cruises if the sublessee activities do fall within the permitted uses in the lease or if the sublessee use would inhibit the lessor ability to lease other spaces in the leased property,van geffen herbert,so d.cir if the sublessee wo delineate his proposed activities or if the sublease causes the lessor to lose a tenant on the same property,fourchon docks,milchem,cir.a lessor refusal to consent to a sublease or assignment will be found to be unreasonable if the reasons given for the refusal are pretextual,caplan,or if the proposed sublessee is identical to the lessee in financial status and proposed use of the property,pinhook plaza wiener,so d.cir.
