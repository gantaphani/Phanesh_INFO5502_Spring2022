defendant malease foods corporation appeals the district court november,order requiring malease to convey its leasehold interest in certain properties to plaintiff,the kroger company,or in the alternative,to post an appropriate bond pending appeal.this order followed the partial grant of kroger motion for summary judgment,wherein the district court found that kroger had properly exercised purchase options on the subject properties.
prior to the september,order,malease had filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss under.b for lack of personal jurisdiction.because the exercise of personal jurisdiction was integral to the order on appeal,the panel has reviewed this issue and concludes that the district court erred in its denial of defendant motion to dismiss.therefore,this case is remanded to the district court for entry of an order to dismiss,without prejudice,for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to the ohio statute.further,it follows that the order for injunctive relief must be vacated.
factual and procedural history 
the facts underlying this controversy are complex.on april,the kroger company kroger,an ohio corporation,entered into three transactions with balkhouse properties corporation balkhouse properties,a tennessee corporation.transactions involve the sale of a piece of real property,usually by a high credit owner to an investor.the original owner then leases the property back.the properties involved in this case are three industrial facilities located in bowling green,kentucky murfreesboro,tennessee and san marcos,texas.as a result of the transactions,balkhouse properties became the owner of the properties and kroger was the lessee.
the three lease agreements were essentially identical,with variances based only on square footage and other specifics relevant to the individual properties.each lease was for a term,with possible extension for a total of thirty years.each lease included an option for kroger to purchase the real property at the end of the term.
on june,balkhouse properties conveyed fee simple interests in the properties to balkhouse associates.then,balkhouse properties entered into a lease agreement wherein it leased the properties back from balkhouse associates.on the same occasion,balkhouse properties assigned all its rights under the lease agreements with balkhouse associates to malease foods corporation malease,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york city.malease and balkhouse associates then entered into three separate agreements which were identical in form,relating to each piece of property.each agreement divided the respective property interests,with malease having the rights as master lessee and balkhouse associates being the fee simple owner.
the agreements also acknowledged kroger purchase options.each agreement allocated the rights and responsibilities with respect to the option between balkhouse associates and malease,in the event that kroger exercised the option.each agreement states 
if a purchase option is exercised pursuant to article xxxv of the occupancy lease,partnership balkhouse associates shall be obligated to sell and convey partnership interest in the premises to occupancy tenant kroger simultaneously with the sale of the master lessee malease interest in the premises to occupancy tenant by the master lessee.partnership and master lessee shall execute and deliver a partial surrender of lease to release the premises from the master lease.partnership interest and master lessee interest in the premises shall be sold and conveyed in accordance with article xix of the occupancy lease,subject however,to compliance with the following the rest discusses the determination and pay out of the purchase price.
agreement,june.
as a result of these transactions,balkhouse associates held fee simple title to each property,malease held the master lessee interest and was the primary tenant,and kroger was malease subtenant.this relationship continued until,when kroger purchased the fee simple interest in each of the properties from balkhouse associates.along with the properties,kroger was assigned the leases and the agreements between malease and balkhouse associates.this purchase was not conducted under the terms of the option,but was negotiated separately two years ahead of the time provided for under the purchase options.this resulted in kroger becoming the lessor to malease,who continued to be the master lessee to its tenant,kroger.kroger paid rent to malease,and malease,in turn,paid rent to kroger.on february,kroger notified malease by letter that it intended to purchase the master lessee rights under the terms of the original lease between kroger and balkhouse properties at the expiration of the lease term on april.malease refused to allow kroger to exercise the option,contending that kroger purchase of the property from balkhouse associates rendered the purchase options void 
as noted in your notice letter,and in the notice dated july,to which you refer,the kroger,is already the owner of the subject properties,having purchased the same outside the scope of the purchase options.by your actions in purchasing these properties,and without regard to and outside the scope of the purchase options and in disregard of the interests of malease foods,you negated and repudiated and rendered the purchase options meaningless,null and void.
malease letter to kroger,march.malease refusal to honor the lease purchase options precipitated this litigation.
procedural history 
on june,kroger filed a complaint in the southern district of ohio,seeking a declaratory judgment that it had validly exercised its rights under the purchase options to acquire the leases at issue.kroger relied on for jurisdiction over malease,stating that all parties are diverse and the amount in controversy exceeds.the complaint also alleged anticipatory breach and requested an order for specific performance of the options.malease filed a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction on january.an order denying the motion was entered on september.
malease filed an answer with counterclaims on october.malease requested a declaratory judgment that kroger attempt to exercise the options was invalid.the counterclaim also alleged that kroger purchase of the properties from associates was null and void,requiring that the transaction be rescinded.finally,malease sought money damages for the rent it claims was due because of an automatic renewal of the leaseholds.
the parties then filed for summary judgment.kroger moved for summary judgment on its claims for declaratory judgment,breach of contract,and specific performance,as well as each of malease counterclaims malease moved for summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim,requesting that the court find that kroger did not validly exercise its purchase options,and that the master leases automatically renewed.malease also moved to recover the back rent due as a result of the alleged automatic renewal of the leases.
the district court granted in part and denied in part kroger motion for summary judgment on july.the court awarded kroger declaratory judgment,finding that kroger had properly exercised its rights under the agreements,and denied malease corresponding request for a declaratory judgment.the court also granted kroger request for specific performance of the purchase options,and held that malease actions amounted to a breach of its obligation to convey the leases in accordance with the purchase options.rather than granting kroger motion for a calculation of damages,the court ordered the matter set for trial.
in response to the district court order,malease filed a motion to dismiss kroger damages claim on july.kroger filed a motion to show cause,or for injunctive relief on september.the district court granted kroger motion on november,finding that malease motion was untimely,and requiring the parties to submit memoranda concerning the amount of bond malease was to provide while pursuing its appellate rights.however,malease elected to convey its leaseholds to kroger,but requested that kroger post a bond pending appeal.the district court denied this request.the court ordered a closing date for the leaseholds within sixty days of the order dated december.
malease filed this interlocutory appeal on december,appealing the district court november,order which granted kroger motion to show cause,or in the alternative for leave to request injunctive relief,and denied malease motion for leave to file a motion to dismiss kroger damages claim.as part of this appeal,both parties have briefed and argued the district court denial of malease rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction,based on the parties diversity of citizenship pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a,because the question on appeal involves the grant of injunctive relief.while the denial of defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is not specifically referred to in the notice of appeal,the district court order holding that it may exercise personal jurisdiction is inextricably linked to the order being appealed,and therefore is proper for review.see james moore et,moore federal practice a ed.the court considers the order appealed from as well as any other orders and any other questions,although themselves interlocutory and not otherwise appealable,that underlie,and that are inextricably involved with the order being appealed.see also brown williamson tobacco,cir it is elementary that an appeal from the denial of injunctive relief brings the whole record before the appellate court and that the scope of review may extend further than the immediate question on which the district court ruled to allow disposition of all matters appropriately raised by the record,including entry of a final judgment.id.citing wright miller,federal practice and procedure 
iii.analysis 
the district court denied the defendant rule b motion to dismiss,finding that the exercise of jurisdiction over malease comported with the requirements of the ohio statute and the requirements of constitutional due process.because personal jurisdiction is a threshold determination linked to any subsequent order issued by the court,we must determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction over malease was proper before deciding whether the district court erred in the injunctive order.
personal jurisdiction 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court denial of a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.see reynolds int l amateur athletic fed n,cir.the district court exercised personal jurisdiction in this diversity case without an evidentiary hearing.in such a case,the burden is on the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing that jurisdiction over the defendant is proper.compuserve,patterson,cir.the court need only find that plaintiff has set forth specific facts that support a finding of jurisdiction in order to deny the motion to dismiss.see serras first.bank ass n,cir 
discussion 
in order to establish jurisdiction over a corporation in a federal diversity matter,the defendant must be shown to meet one of the criteria enumerated in the ohio statute ohio code ann,and be within the bounds of constitutional due process.see reynolds,at.here,the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over malease under the ohio statute.it is therefore unnecessary to reach the constitutional issues.
a the ohio statute 
the district court found that kroger made a prima facie showing that jurisdiction over malease was proper under the ohio statute.the court stated 
malease acknowledgment of kroger rights and assumption of duties to kroger as a landlord put malease and kroger in a relationship or perhaps even makes kroger a beneficiary to the two party agreements.in any event there was some kind of business relationship between malease and kroger.in addition,malease receipt of rent payments from kroger over a period means that malease had dealings with kroger within the meaning of the long arm statute.
order of district court,september.
in this appeal,malease asserts that the district court erred in exercising jurisdiction over malease pursuant to ohio code a.this provision states a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent,as to a cause of action arising from the person t ransacting any business within the state id.in kentucky oaks mall mitchell formal wear,ohio,the ohio supreme court discussed the parameters of a.the court found that the broad wording of the statute permits jurisdiction over defendants who are transacting any business in ohio.the court stated that transact 
means to prosecute negotiations to carry on business to have dealings the word embraces in its meaning the carrying on or prosecution of business negotiations but it is a broader term than the word contract and may involve business negotiations which have been either wholly or partly brought to a conclusion 
id.at emphasis in original citation omitted.
the kentucky oaks court determined that the defendant,mitchell formal wear mitchell was transacting business within the scope of the statute.mitchell,a georgia corporation,negotiated a lease agreement with an limited partnership,kentucky oaks mall company kentucky oaks.the transaction involved the lease by mitchell of warehouse space owned by kentucky oaks,located in kentucky.after negotiating the terms by telephone,mitchell executed a lease in georgia and returned it via mail to kentucky oaks in ohio.id.at.
the ohio supreme court held that the lease arrangement was transacting business within the purview of this section of the ohio statute.even though mitchell had no presence in ohio and the leased space was located in kentucky,the court stated that u ndoubtedly,both parties sought the benefit of each other bargain in hopes of realizing a pecuniary gain.id.the court summarized its ruling stating,a ccordingly,we hold that a commercial lessee,for purposes of personal jurisdiction,is transacting any business within the plain and common meaning of the phrase,where the lessee negotiates,and through the course of dealing becomes obligated,to make payments to its lessor in ohio.id 
kroger relies on kentucky oaks to demonstrate that jurisdiction over malease is proper.while there are similarities between kentucky oaks and the instant facts,there are also substantial differences.in kentucky oaks,mitchell directly negotiated the terms of the lease with kentucky oaks.in contrast,malease never entered into any negotiations with kroger regarding the terms of the lease,let alone direct negotiations.instead,malease became involved with kroger simply by virtue of the assignment of the leases from balkhouse.in essence,malease was one step removed from the bargaining process,so it can not be said that malease directly sought the benefit of the bargain for purposes of mutual pecuniary gain,because malease did not negotiate the lease with kroger originally.
further,the primary contacts between kroger and malease were the rent checks sent from ohio by kroger to malease in new york.as malease points out,the rent checks could have been sent from the warehouse locales,or any other place in the united states.the fact that kroger chose to send rent checks from their corporate office in ohio does not constitute doing business in ohio by malease.while malease did assume the landlord duties pursuant to the lease assignments,all required duties were performed at the facilities,not in ohio.the entire course of dealing between these entities occurred outside the state of ohio.finally,malease has never maintained an office,a bank account,a telephone listing,or any kind of presence in ohio.
moreover,the party roles in kentucky oaks are the opposite of those here.kentucky oaks was the ohio resident,and the landlord of the kentucky property.in negotiating for rental of the space,mitchell intentionally entered into a transaction involving an ohio landlord,to whom they were required to pay rent in ohio.in addition to rent payments,mitchell submitted maintenance costs,annual reports,association fees,and sales reports to kentucky oaks in ohio.kentucky oaks,at.kentucky oaks also main
