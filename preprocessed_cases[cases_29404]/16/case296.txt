faced with a motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court held an evidentiary hearing,reserved decision,and thereafter granted the requested relief.waldron geo.weston bakeries,d.that ukase is the focal point of this appeal.
we rehearse the facts as found by the district court,consistent with record support.the plaintiffs,robert waldron and christopher mills,are citizens of maine who own exclusive rights to purchase and distribute,within designated geographic territories or routes,baked goods purveyed by the defendants,george weston bakeries and george weston bakeries distribution collectively,weston.each of these affiliated firms is a delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in pennsylvania.
the terms of the arrangement between the parties are limned in distribution agreements.under these agreements,each plaintiff agrees,in substance,to purchase from weston and bakery products to develop and maximize sales and to cooperate with weston in marketing programs.in turn,weston grants each plaintiff an exclusive route agrees to supply baked goods for sale along that route and promises to assist in the marketing endeavors.
the distribution agreements are of unlimited duration and specify that the plaintiffs will work as independent contractors.nevertheless,the relationship is one of mutual dependence.it is plain that each party must rely on the other performance.
over time,the bond between the plaintiffs and weston became frayed.in april of,a number of including the plaintiffs accused weston of a gallimaufry of allegedly unfair business practices.for the most part,these complaints grew out of the conviction that weston was exercising a degree of operational control that was inconsistent with its promise to treat them as independent contractors.that lawsuit came to naught.see gagne geo.weston bakeries,wl,at.june.
despite this defeat,the plaintiffs persisted in pursuing their perceived plaints.in,they sued weston in a maine state court,alleging breach of contract,unconscionability,and violations of various statutes once again,the action centered on the degree of control that weston was attempting to exercise over the.after a bench trial,the judge upheld the distribution agreements against the claim of unconscionability and concluded that weston had not breached those agreements.the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
on july,one day before the deadline for submitting the plaintiffs appellate brief their counsel pressed for settlement.the lawyer efforts are chronicled in exquisite detail in the district court rescript,see waldron,d at,and it would serve no useful purpose to repastinate that soil.we focus instead on the critical communication a voicemail message left by the plaintiffs lawyer for defense counsel.having demanded to settle the pending litigation,the plaintiffs lawyer warned 
my clients are not going to put this behind them regardless of how the appeal comes out.that is,there will be information provided to the appropriate taxing authorities,workers compensation board.if we not able to come to a mutually agreeable settlement today,and i understand that quick but we talking about,jim,which is much less than what it cost your client to work on this appeal.if the settlement is not agreeable then all bets are off.there will be no offer of settlement beyond today and your clients can expect to continue to be involved in some type of hearings of some nature,proceedings of some nature in the near future regarding their status of an employer as opposed to an independent business entity or there can be a settlement.i hope that the way we go.
weston did not accept the proffered settlement,and the record is tenebrous as to the fate of the appeal.
a few days after the proposed settlement cratered,weston pounced.it terminated the plaintiffs distribution agreements on the basis of section thereof,which gave weston a right to terminate immediately,without an opportunity to cure,if the actions involve criminal activity or fraud,threaten public health or safety,or threaten to do significant harm to weston.each termination notice referred to the voicemail and stated in pertinent part that it is the position of weston that your threat to do significant harm to weston if it does not meet your settlement demand constitutes a breach of your distribution agreement.weston proceeded to assume control of the plaintiffs routes.
the plaintiffs did not submit meekly to this preemptive strike but,rather,sued weston in a maine state court.their complaint contained four substantive counts breach of contract,tortious interference with advantageous economic relations,restraint of trade,and breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.a fifth count requested a declaratory judgment on the claim of wrongful termination.the plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction.
weston removed the action to the federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.see a.that court convened an evidentiary hearing on the motion for injunctive relief.following that hearing and an exchange of legal memoranda,the court issued a preliminary injunction restoring the plaintiffs to their routes and suspending weston attempted termination of the distribution agreements pendente lite.the court found that the plaintiffs not only had established a likelihood of success on their contract and implied covenant claims but also had satisfied the other requirements for preliminary injunctive relief.see waldron,d at.this interlocutory appeal ensued.we have jurisdiction under a.
when a party appeals from the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction,review is for abuse of discretion.ross simons of warwick,baccarat,cir.within that framework,we scrutinize the district court findings of fact for clear error and its handling of abstract legal questions de novo.coquico,rodríguez miranda,cir air line pilots ass n,int l guilford transp,cir.in the gray area between those two poles,we afford considerable deference to the trial court balancing of equities.coquico,at.we will set aside such judgment calls only if the trier has ignored pertinent elements deserving significant weight,considered improper criteria,or,though assessing all appropriate and no inappropriate factors,plainly erred in balancing them.ross simons,at.
we recently explained that t he propriety of preliminary injunctive relief depends on an amalgam of four factors i the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits ii the possibility that,without an injunction,the movant will suffer irreparable harm iii the balance of relevant hardships as between the parties and iv the effect of the court ruling on the public interest.coquico,at.the first factor likelihood of success normally will weigh the heaviest in this decisional calculus.new comm wireless,sprintcom,cir.
here,another familiar principle comes to mind.we have reiterated several times that when a district court adroitly takes the measure of a case and articulates a persuasive rationale in disposing of it,there is scant need for a reviewing court to write at length merely to hear its own words resonate.see,vargas ruíz golden arch,cir cruz ramos sun oil,cir holders capital cal.union ins.in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire litig,cir.this is just such an instance the court below made supportable findings of fact on the relevant issues,applied the law faithfully to the discerned facts,and exercised its discretion in an appropriate manner.it set out these findings and conclusions with admirable clarity and tied them together with a plausible rationale justifying the issuance of a preliminary injunction.no more was exigible.hence,we affirm the judgment below essentially for the reasons advanced in the district court thoughtful rescript.we add only a few comments directed to the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits.
first.weston hinges its right to terminate the distribution agreements on the voicemail threat to inform tax and workers compensation authorities about its treatment of the as employees.weston posits that this threat trans
