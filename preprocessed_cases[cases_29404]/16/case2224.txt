summary judgment order 
we first address the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of mmg on midwest counterclaim.in opposition to mmg motion for summary judgment,midwest argued that mmg failed to pay cameron motorsports for the and therefore breached the financing agreement.in support of this argument,midwest relied entirely on two letters it received from cameron motorsports in which cameron motorsports claimed it had not been paid for the and deposition testimony from its employees containing similar assertions.the district court excluded midwest evidence on hearsay grounds.the district court further held that mmg had presented the form of testimony from mcmaster and receipts attached to a it had paid cameron motorsports for the.the district court concluded that midwest had failed to offer proof that mmg had breached the financing agreement and granted mmg motion for summary judgment.

a party may not rely on inadmissible hearsay to avoid summary judgment.eisenstadt centel,cir.the evidence midwest offered to establish that mmg had failed to pay cameron motorsports for the is classic hearsay.rather than offer the sworn testimony of a cameron motorsports employee the declarant,midwest instead offered only the testimony of its own employees repeating what cameron motorsports had told them.similarly,midwest offered an unsworn statement,in the form of the letter,from the declarant.midwest offered these statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted,namely that mmg had not paid cameron motorsports for the shipped to midwest.the district court correctly points out that the sworn testimony of a cameron employee would have been easy to obtain if midwest assertions were true.midwest makes no discernable argument that the district court evidentiary ruling was incorrect,and the district court correctly excluded the evidence.
nonetheless,midwest argues that the district court erred in granting mmg summary judgment on midwest claim.midwest makes a curious argument that the evidence it presented at trial demonstrates that the grant of summary judgment was in error.our review of the district court summary judgment order,
