appellant alasko foods,alasko and appellee foodmark,foodmark wage a pitched battle over the meaning of certain provisions in their representation agreement and sales management agreement,which governed their nearly relationship.the district court found that,in accordance with its contractual obligations,alasko owed foodmark a non renewal termination fee when it decided to part ways with foodmark.having so concluded,the district court granted foodmark motion for summary judgment,and alasko appealed.at stake is approximately million.although alasko attacks the district court decision on a multitude of fronts,alasko contractual obligations are clear,and the record reveals no genuine issue of fact for trial.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
the underlying facts are generally undisputed.we set them forth in the light most favorable to alasko as the party,rivera colón mills,cir,reserving some for our discussion of the parties specific legal arguments.
foodmark is a massachusetts corporation that assists food manufacturers in marketing and products to retailers alasko is a canadian corporation headquartered in montreal,québec that sells frozen fruit and vegetables to retail outfits.sometime in,foodmark approached alasko to discuss the possibility of marketing alasko products in the united states,a market alasko had yet to tap into.after a period of negotiation,on july,the parties signed a representation agreement and sales management agreement agreement.
terms of the agreement 
alasko retained foodmark to provide private label sales management and act as its exclusive private label sales management team with respect to target accounts,which consisted of supermarkets and club stores in the united states.see agreement.foodmark was to manage sales of alasko frozen fruit and vegetable products,referred to in the agreement as product lines.agreement.the agreement sets forth the scope of foodmark duties as follows 
foodmark responsibilities and obligations 
to exclusively represent alasko and the designated product lines to the target accounts within the territory 
to review and to familiarize its staff with all facets of the current product line,production costs and margin requirements 
to manage appoint brokers and insure sic that the product line is presented to the specified target accounts 
d.if necessary,to process all orders from accounts and brokers,including edi when applicable 
to assume all normal expenses in the performance of its assigned responsibilities includes entertainment,travel,food and lodging 
to hold in strictest confidence all information deemed to be sensitive includes product composition,manufacturing procedures,distribution methods and customer lists.
agreement.in exchange,alasko promised to pay foodmark a management fee of of the net invoice sales of all products in the united states agreement.e.
but foodmark compensation was not limited to its management fee.alasko agreed that,under certain circumstances,it would pay foodmark a termination fee at the end of their business relationship.although the agreement provides different mechanisms for ending the parties work together,we need only concern ourselves with those few sections applicable here.
the agreement broke the parties relationship into terms of one or three years that would renew automatically unless either party notified the other of its intent not to renew.section,inserted at alasko behest,allowed it to terminate the agreement during the middle of any term upon notice.agreement.should it elect not to renew the agreement for any year term,alasko would pay foodmark a non renewal termination fee.agreement.d.this fee was to be calculated based on the net invoice sales for the last week period of the term,annualized,for accounts managed by foodmark.agreement.f.as applicable here,the termination fee amounted to of alasko sales up to million,of sales between million and million,and of sales over million.agreement.
the agreement also envisioned a circumstance in which alasko could end its relationship with foodmark without owing a termination fee.section,breach of agreement,provides each party the right to terminate if the other party defaults in the performance of any material obligation hereunder or materially fails to comply with any provision of this agreement or materially breaches any representation contained herein.agreement.unlike section,section makes no provision for a termination fee.
the agreement life and death 
with the agreement in place,foodmark started trying to secure united states buyers for alasko products.it began by familiarizing itself with alasko products,capabilities,and strategies.it then engaged in discussions with alasko about the best course of action for sales and decided to pursue retail private label sales.having charted this course,foodmark analyzed the relevant market,made appointments with retailers to present alasko products,and obtained feedback from its own preexisting clients to determine whether any of alasko products needed ing before being put on the market.all told,foodmark peddled alasko products to retailers in the united states,all at its own expense.
by december,foodmark had brought in a broker,tbg,llc tbg,to assist it in pitching alasko products to sam club,a major united states retailer at some point the record does not disclose exactly when,foodmark decided it would introduce tbg to alasko.in july,sam club committed to purchase frozen food from alasko.alasko subsequently entered into a direct brokerage agreement with tbg for its new sam club account 
the brokerage agreement sets tbg up as alasko broker with respect to alasko sales to sam club.see brokerage agreement and schedule its specific obligations were spelled out as follows 
tbg shall maintain a business organization and workforce adequate in every way to 
regularly contact its accounts buying office 
diligently and with reasonable frequency solicit and promote the sales of all alasko products.
work diligently at an acceptable frequency to secure orders from alasko accounts listed in schedule a,sam club and walmart attached hereto.
on sales of products on orders submitted by broker and accepted by alasko,broker will lend complete and regular assistance in effecting prompt and full payments by customers for all deliveries of products sold and 
broker agrees to adhere to alasko schedule of prices,terms,and conditions of sale,and to submit orders taken under these conditions to alasko for approval in the routine manner and 
meet sales goals and objectives for the business.
brokerage agreement.tbg further agreed to assist alasko with any customer disputes,inquiries or deductions,product problems,product withdrawals or recalls,and collections.brokerage agreement.
the brokerage agreement does not state tbg will manage any accounts,assume any sort of management role over anything,or seek to secure new accounts.neither was tbg declared to be a sales management team like foodmark.and alasko agreed to pay tbg a broker fee not a management fee based on alasko net sales to the sam club account.brokerage agreement and schedule c.this fee,we note,is equal to the broker fee contemplated by foodmark and alasko agreement.
alasko subsequently renegotiated foodmark management fee on the sam club account,and foodmark ultimately accepted a reduced fee of alasko began shipping products to sam club in october.it sent foodmark management fees,calculated from alasko sales to sam club,in the months that followed.
meanwhile,private equity firm catterton partners acquired a controlling interest in alasko in july.at the request of the new owners,foodmark ceased its work for the most part while the company reconsidered its united states sales strategy on october,alasko informed foodmark it had opted,pursuant to section,to terminate the agreement as of january.alasko did not say that foodmark had failed to perform any of its contractual obligations,nor did it mention section provisions governing termination for cause.
alasko continued to pay foodmark management fee for the sam club account through the end of their relationship.payments between the notice of termination and january,amounted to.over the entire life of the agreement,alasko paid foodmark a total of in management fees,all of which related to the sam club account.
after receiving the notice of termination,foodmark demanded payment of the non renewal termination fee contemplated by section.f,but alasko refused.
the litigation 
unwilling to surrender,foodmark filed a complaint in massachusetts state court.count alleged that alasko refusal to pay the termination fee constituted a breach of the agreement and of its covenant of good faith and fair dealing.count requested relief under the provisions of massachusetts consumer protection statute.alasko removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the parties proceeded to bombard the district judge with a flurry of dispositive motions and.
alasko sought summary judgment on all counts,arguing that its termination of the agreement in the middle of a term pursuant to section did not trigger its obligation to pay a termination fee.foodmark returned fire with its own,asserting that regardless of whether alasko ended the agreement during or at the end of a term,foodmark was entitled to a termination fee because alasko had opted not to renew the agreement.the district court whose reasoning is not germane here sided with foodmark and permitted the parties to conduct limited discovery on damages.
foodmark filed a summary judgment motion,this time seeking in damages based on alasko sales to sam club during the final thirteen weeks of the agreement.alasko resisted,arguing foodmark was not entitled to anything because it did not actually manage the sam club account,as the agreement required.the district court rejected alasko arguments,found that foodmark did manage the sam club account,and entered judgment awarding foodmark.
refusing to admit defeat,alasko timely appeal followed 
ii.standard of review 
although the agreement choice of law provision implicates the substantive law of québec,where foreign substantive law applies we nonetheless utilize our own procedural rules.see servicios comerciales andinos,del caribe,cir.accordingly,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.ponte steelcase,cir.we affirm if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,alasko does not contest the district court allowance of foodmark first motion for summary judgment,or the denial of its own.rather,it only challenges the district court resolution of foodmark second summary judgment motion on damages.
before diving into our analysis of the agreement,we briefly set forth the controlling legal principles.
contract interpretation under québec law 
the parties agree that québec law governs their contractual obligations,and we see no reason to disturb this choice.see barclays bank plc poynter,cir forgoing choice of law analysis where the parties agreed to utilize the substantive law of a particular jurisdiction and there was at least a reasonable relationship between their dispute and that jurisdiction.each party has submitted an affidavit from a québec legal practitioner setting forth the substantive rules of law,which is an appropriate method of proving the law of a foreign country.see welding prince,the proof of the law of a foreign country may be by the introduction in evidence of its statutes and judicial decisions,or by the testimony of experts learned in the law,or by both.evans cabinet kitchen int l,cir applying québec law as set forth in the affidavit of a canadian attorney.
after carefully reviewing the parties submissions,we find their views of québec law are substantially similar.we do not hesitate,however,to supplement their submissions with our own research,where necessary.
our ultimate goal under québec law is to give effect to the contracting parties intent.to that end,t he common intention of the parties rather than adherence to the literal meaning of the words shall be sought in interpreting a contract.civil code of québec,code,can.although the parties do not contend their agreement is ambiguous,we are permitted to refer to the code principles to guide our analysis of their contractual obligations 
when dealing with contractual language,each individual clause is interpreted in light of the others so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole.code.a clause is given a meaning that gives it some effect rather than one that gives it no effect.code.should there be any doubt,a contract is interpreted in favour of the person who contracted the obligation and against the person who stipulated it.code.
further,we may take into account the nature of the contract,the circumstances in which it was formed,and the interpretation which has already been given to it by the parties.code.and we can also look to the parties usage,that is,the manner in which they have performed.id.
with these underlying principles in mind,we soldier on.
did foodmark manage the sam club account 
alasko begins by arguing foodmark was required to perform all of its contractual obligations in order to have managed any particular account.according to alasko,foodmark obligations under section of the agreement were collectively deemed to comprise account management.appellant br.at foodmark does not contest this proffered definition,and so we adopt it for purposes of this appeal.
this brings us to the central issue in this case whether there is a disputed issue of fact with respect to foodmark management of the sam club account.we address the parties arguments in turn,providing necessary details as we go along.
tbg involvement with the sam club account 
alasko argument is that no termination fee is owed because tbg,not foodmark,managed the sam club account.foodmark,however,says that bringing tbg was consistent with its own contractual duties to manage that account.
the agreement expressly provides for foodmark appointment of brokers for the accounts it landed,and for brokers to oversee the handling of those accounts.agreement.foodmark responsibilities with respect to any particular account are obvious,as foodmark was required to process all orders from accounts and brokers only i f necessary.agreement.d.the agreement also calls for a broker fee,which is exactly what alasko agreed to pay tbg with respect to the sam club account.agreement.thus,the parties plainly envisioned foodmark working with or through a broker on any account it secured.
furthermore,comparing foodmark responsibilities to tbg shows the two companies fulfilled quite different roles for alasko.the brokerage agreement limited tbg obligations to the sam club account itself foodmark job,on the other hand,was to go out and pitch alasko products to numerous united states vendors in order to drum up business and secure new accounts for alasko.it was also tasked with managing any brokers brought in to handle these new accounts to ensure their performance was up to par.
in sum,foodmark was involved in alasko big picture business concerns in a way tbg simply was not.that tbg provided broker services on the sam club account was foreseen by and entirely consistent with foodmark own management responsibilities.nothing in the agreement clear language precluded both foodmark and tbg from fulfilling their own,unique obligations with respect to the sam club account.we conclude,therefore,that tbg involvement did not preclude foodmark from managing the account within the meaning of the agreement 
this determination,however,does not get us through the battle lines we must still answer the final question of whether there is a triable issue as to whether foodmark actually managed the sam club account within the meaning of the agreement.our march continues.
ii.the parties course of conduct 
as we hone in on our objective,we consider the evidence as to how the parties performed under the agreement and how they interpreted their responsibilities during the course of their business relationship.see code.
foodmark argues the undisputed evidence demonstrates alasko recognized its management of the sam club account because it paid foodmark management fee without complaint,even after tbg entered the scene.alasko,however,explains that the agreement entitles foodmark to management fees with respect to all of alasko sales in the united states even if it did nothing to bring about a particular sale,but that foodmark only gets a termination fee for accounts it affirmatively managed.thus,alasko would have us find that its payment of management fees does not by itself mean that foodmark managed the sam club account.
alasko position must give way in the face of the agreement plain language and the uncontested evidence in the record.for starters,alasko argument is irreconcilable with its proffered definition of management,to wit,fulfillment of every one of foodmark section responsibilities.the idea that management could mean foodmark did not have to do anything to earn management fees which ultimately exceeded defies all bounds of common sense and commercial logic,and is contrary to the plain meaning of the agreement.indeed,this construction reads the nature of foodmark duties out of the agreement and runs afoul of the québec civil code admonition to interpret contractual language in a way that gives it some effect rather than one that gives it no effect.code.
and apart from being inconsistent with the agreement language,alasko position is flatly contradicted by the uncontested evidence in the record.there is no dispute that alasko continued to pay foodmark management fee albeit reduced to from the with respect to the sam club account after it entered into its brokerage agreement with tbg.alasko never gave foodmark any notice of nonperformance,nor did it seek to terminate the agreement for cause,as would be expected had alasko felt foodmark was not providing the services required of it and which would have relieved alasko of any obligation to pay a termination fee.see agreement.thus,we reject alasko implication that it would have paid foodmark more than for no work.
what more,alasko has turned a blind eye to the commercial reality that it did not have any united states sales before hiring foodmark as its exclusive sales management team.given this exclusivity provision,any sales alasko realized would likely have been procured through foodmark work.yet,throughout this appeal alasko ascribes no value at all to foodmark contributions towards developing the sam club account,an account which alasko does not dispute is expected to generate approximately million in annual sales.nothing in the record does alasko it would have realized any united states sales but for foodmark groundwork at the beginning of their relationship and its later introduction of tbg.
all told,the undisputed evidence demonstrates alasko acknowledged foodmark management role with respect to the sam club account.and as we discuss below,there is no evidence in the record from which to draw a contrary conclusion,as would be necessary to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial.
iii.uncontested evidence of management 
alasko does not contest any of foodmark evidence showing that it spent time familiarizing itself with alasko products,that it conducted market research and met with alasko and its own clients to discuss sales strategy and the competitiveness of alasko offerings,and that it ultimately presented alasko products to retailers in the united states.alasko admits foodmark introduced it to tbg,and the uncontested evidence is that alasko landed the sam club account sometime after tbg became involved.all of these activities are plainly within the scope of foodmark section duties.
furthermore,the record reveals that foodmark work with tbg was directed specifically at sam club.this evidence comes in the form of affidavits from foodmark employees describing just what foodmark did on alasko behalf,along with email communications between foodmark and tbg appended to each affidavit.alasko has not contested the authenticity or contents of any of these emails 
foodmark affidavits and emails span pages of the summary judgment record.the emails were exchanged both before and after tbg entered into its brokerage agreement with alasko.they show that foodmark was actively involved with product packaging,product pricing,and delivery of sample products,and that it coordinated meetings and assisted tbg presentations.they also detail foodmark market research into the activities and pricing strategies of competing companies.all of these activities directly related to the sam club account.furthermore,the emails detail foodmark and tbg attempts to establish a separate account with walmart.thus,the uncontested evidence demonstrates foodmark played a role in managing tbg,as provided for by the agreement.
alasko marshals one final effort to get around the maginot line presented by the uncontested evidence.the evidence in the record here provides a much more effective defense than did france physical bulwarks.
alasko says that the parties renegotiation of foodmark management fee from to of sales to sam club is indicative of foodmark vastly diminished far less than account management relative to this particular account.appellant br.at.but the renegotiation only strengthens the conclusion that foodmark continued to manage the account.a diminished management role remains,by definition,a management role.and the fact that the parties did not simultaneously negotiate any alteration to the termination fee buttresses our conclusion that alasko recognized foodmark continued to manage the sam club account within the meaning of the agreement,despite the renegotiation.
iv.conclusion 
after cutting through the fog of war,we find that the uncontested evidence in the record demonstrates both that foodmark fulfilled its section duties with respect to the sam club account,and that alasko recognized its management role even after concluding the brokerage agreement with tbg.accordingly,there is no genuine issue of fact for trial,and foodmark is entitled to a termination fee in the amount calculated by the district court.
the parties inform us that a food product appears on store shelves under its manufacturer name.a food product,by contrast,bears a name differing from that of its manufacturer.
alasko further agreed that it would compensate all brokers with a broker commission based on the net invoice sales of all products.agreement.f.
tbg is an american company and is headquartered in fayetteville,arkansas.
the brokerage agreement also contemplated sales to wal mart.any such sales the record does not reveal whether or not there were any are irrelevant to the issues we must decide.
although the parties do not agree on the reasoning behind this reduction,the disagreement is immaterial because it is uncontested that alasko continued to pay foodmark a management fee albeit a reduced one with respect to the sam club account,even after the renegotiation.
foodmark asserts it continued to present alasko with new business opportunities,a claim to which alasko has not responded.
we note a jurisdictional wrinkle not mentioned by the parties.foodmark summary judgment motions raised only the first count of its complaint.the district court judgment,however,resolved all questions of liability and damages,and imposed pre and interest.this disposed of the case in its entirety and left nothing further for the district court to do.for its part,foodmark affirmatively relied on the judgment finality by applying for a writ of is no doubt that the district court entered final judgment in foodmark favor.see in re forstner chain,cir a final judgment is the concluding judicial act or pronouncement of the court disposing of the matter before it see also hickey duffy,cir finding jurisdiction over an appeal where the district court believe d a particular ruling ended the litigation.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.see limiting our appellate jurisdiction to final decisions of the district courts.
this is where the parties interpretations of québec law diverge.foodmark tells us we may resort to the code principles even where a contract is not ambiguous,but alasko would have us forgo their use altogether unless we find
