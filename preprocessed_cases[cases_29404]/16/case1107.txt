opinion of the court 
appellant victor mckeever pleaded guilty in to charges,including two counts arising under the pennsylvania corrupt organizations act pacoa.b.he was sentenced to years imprisonment.in,the supreme court of pennsylvania held that pacoa does not apply to individuals operating wholly illegitimate businesses.commonwealth besch.mckeever,falling within that class of persons,filed a habeas corpus petition on july,pursuant to,in the eastern district of pennsylvania.he now appeals the district court order granting his writ of habeas corpus and staying the writ for days so that the commonwealth of pennsylvania could vacate mckeever pacoa convictions and resentence him or,alternatively,release him from incarceration.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm.
the district court had jurisdiction over mckeever habeas petition under.we have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to.because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on mckeever sentencing claims,we review its legal conclusions de novo.see outten kearney,cir duncan morton,cir.
on january,the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed an information against mckeever arising out of his possession and delivery of heroin.he was charged with six counts of delivery of a controlled substance,one count of dealing in proceeds of unlawful activities,one count of criminal conspiracy to violate the state drug act,one count of possession of a controlled substance,and two counts of violating the pennsylvania statute,pacoa.mckeever pleaded guilty on july,to ten counts in exchange for the commonwealth promise not to object to a sentencing scheme set forth in the agreement.under the scheme,mckeever two pacoa counts merged with each other,and were made concurrent with one of the six drug delivery counts.they did not have any effect on the actual length of his sentence.the drug delivery counts were made consecutive with each other,and concurrent with the criminal conspiracy and drug dealing charges 
in,the supreme court of pennsylvania held that pacoa did not apply to individuals who operated wholly illegitimate businesses.commonwealth besch.later that year,the pennsylvania legislature,responding to this interpretation,amended pacoa to apply to businesses with wholly illegitimate operations.in,however,the supreme court of pennsylvania held that the amended act was to be applied prospectively only.commonwealth shaffer.
mckeever,on january,collaterally challenged his sentence under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra asserting that his guilty plea was based upon mutual mistake of fact that he was not liable under pacoa because he operated a wholly illegitimate business and that his guilty plea should be rescinded.
the court of common pleas,erie county,dismissed the pcra petition as untimely and not subject to any exceptions under.b.it held that mckeever petition would have been timely if filed by january,one year from the effective date of the amendments to pacoa because,however,it was filed on january,more than six years from that date,it was untimely.the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed.
on july,mckeever filed a habeas corpus petition,pursuant to,in the eastern district of pennsylvania.he alleged that under pennsylvania statutory and case law,he was actually innocent of the two pacoa counts included in his plea agreement.magistrate judge hart issued a report and recommendation finding that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case,that mckeever should be excused from exhausting all state court remedies,that his petition was not,and that he was actually innocent of the two pacoa counts.magistrate judge hart recommended that the district court grant mckeever petition and order the state court to vacate the two pacoa convictions and resentence mckeever accordingly.mckeever objected to the report and recommendation of magistrate judge hart,and argued that the appropriate remedy was the rescission of the plea agreement.
on march,judge diamond issued an order,with an attached memorandum,adopting the report and recommendation by magistrate judge hart,granting the writ of habeas corpus relief,and staying execution of the writ for days to permit the commonwealth to fashion the appropriate remedy.mckeever moved to alter or amend the order on the ground that the commonwealth did not attach the district court memorandum when filing a motion for resentencing hearing in the state court on march.he asserted that in its motion,the commonwealth misrepresented the district court order,in that the commonwealth stated that the district court ordered,rather than leaving the remedy to the state discretion.the district court,on april,denied mckeever motion,noting again that it does not have the power to order the state to provide a specific remedy.mckeever now appeals the district court order.
on april,mckeever was resentenced in the court of common pleas of erie county to an aggregate term of to years in prison.the court of common pleas denied various motions filed prior to,including a motion to withdraw his guilty plea appellee app x,doc.a.mckeever appealed,and the superior court affirmed.appellee app x,doc.b.mckeever then filed a petition for allowance of appeal,which was denied by the supreme court of pennsylvania on september.commonwealth mckeever.
mckeever contends that his guilty plea violated the due process clause,const.amend,because it was not knowing and voluntary in light of the fact that,based upon a subsequent judicial decision,he was actually innocent of the two pacoa counts to which he pled guilty,and that the appropriate remedy is rescission of his guilty plea in its entirety.
first,we note that the district court was correct in granting mckeever writ of habeas corpus but leaving the precise remedy in the hands of the commonwealth.both the historic nature of the writ and principles of federalism preclude a federal court direct interference with a state court conduct of state litigation a habeas court does not have power to directly intervene in the process of the tribunal which has incorrectly subjected the petitioner to the custody of the respondent official.barry brower,cir internal citation omitted see also,dunn colleran,cir dickerson vaughn,cir a state should be given the opportunity to correct its own errors and federal remedies should be designed to enable state courts to fulfill their constitutional obligations to the defendant.heiser ryan,cir.
in granting the writ of habeas corpus,the district court left the choice of remedy to the state court.mckeever argues that the district court erroneously failed to order the state court to vacate his guilty plea in its entirety and either retry or release him.he contends that his guilty plea should be vacated in its entirety because it was premised on the belief of both parties that he was guilty of the two pacoa counts and was,therefore,neither voluntarily or intelligently made.however,brady united states,d,held that a plea need not be vacated due to a subsequent change in the statute upon which only part of the plea was premised.
j udgments may be made that in the light of later events seem improvident,although they were perfectly sensible at the time.the rule that a plea must be intelligently made to be valid does not require that a plea be vulnerable to later attack if the defendant did not correctly assess every relevant factor entering into his decision.a defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea merely because he discovers long after the plea has been accepted that his calculus misapprehended the quality of the state case or the likely penalties attached to alternative courses of action.more particularly,absent misrepresentation or other impermissible conduct by state agents,a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in the light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise.
brady,at.internal citation omitted emphasis added.we decline to adopt a rule that renders a plea agreement per se invalid when a subsequent change in the law renders a defendant innocent of some,but not all,of the counts therein and reject the argument that such a plea could never be entered by a defendant voluntarily and intelligently.
mckeever suggests that because the plea agreement was based upon a mutual mistake,it should be rescinded.ordinary contract law principles are applicable to disputes over plea agreements,provided that the defendant is also afforded the protections of due process.see united states floyd,cir see also,united states bownes,cir united states brunetti,cir per curiam united states,cir united states giorgi,cir.the restatement second of contracts defines mutual mistake as follows 
where a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances,the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in.
in determining whether the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances,account is taken of any relief by way of reformation,restitution,or otherwise.
id.emphasis added.
first,this court notes that contrary to mckeever contention,the mistake here was one of law,not fact.moreover,the mistake was not material.mckeever admits that had it not been for the mistake,he may,or may not,have pleaded guilty rather than risk trial.appellant brief.pursuant to the restatement second of contracts cmt.c,i t is not enough for a party to prove that he would not have made the contract had it not been for the mistake.he must show that the resulting imbalance in the agreed upon exchange is so severe that he can not fairly be required to carry it out.based upon this standard and mckeever own admission,the mistake of law clearly did not have a material effect on the plea agreement.
in brady,the supreme court refused to vacate a plea agreement on the grounds that part of the statute to which petitioner pled was later deemed unconstitutional,despite the fact that petitioner may have relied upon it in informing his bargaining position.e ven if we assume that brady would not have pleaded guilty except for the death penalty provision of the statute,this assumption merely identifies the penalty provision as a but for cause of his plea.that the statute caused the plea in this sense does not necessarily prove that the plea was coerced and invalid as an involuntary act.brady,at.thus,even if the pacoa counts informed mckeever bargaining position,and were the but for cause of his decision to plead guilty,this does not rise to the level of materiality necessary to avoid the agreement in its entirety.
this conclusion is supported by the record,which reflects that the heart of mckeever plea agreement was not the pacoa charges,but rather the drug trafficking charges.in fact,the bargain struck in the plea agreement resulted in a minimum sentence of fifteen years and a maximum of years.when resentencing,the court sentenced mckeever to the same aggregate scheme,despite the removal of the pacoa counts.this occurred because,in the original sentencing scheme,the two pacoa counts were merged with each other and concurrent with a count for delivery of a controlled substance.they carried no mandatory minimum sentence,unlike each of counts v through x,the delivery of a controlled substance counts.see.a i and ii.nor did the pacoa counts carry a higher maximum sentence or a greater mandatory fine than count i,which charged mckeever with dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities.moreover,the sentencing scheme and the nature of the crimes themselves make it clear that the prosecution of mckeever was fundamentally based upon his delivery of heroin.
the dissent assumes that the parties were mistaken as to the reach of pacoa at the time the plea was entered,and would require that the plea be voidable.the premise of the dissent argument,however,is flawed.first,at the time the plea agreement was made,pacoa did,in fact,cover mckeever conduct.no party was mistaken in his understanding of this.the law did not change until after mckeever pled and was sentenced.
in support of its theory,the dissent relies on united states bradley,cir.in bradley,defendant pled guilty to both counts of his indictment.the court of appeals held that there was a mutual mistake when no one understood an essential element of the crime with which bradley was charged at the time of the plea agreement.id.at.similarly,the dicta in bousley united states,d,cited by the dissent,indicates that when a court accepts a guilty plea from a defendant to a crime,the elements of which neither he,his counsel,nor the court correctly understood,the plea would violate the due process clause.id.at.neither of these decisions address the due process implications of vacating counts based upon a subsequent change in the law that rendered the defendant actually innocent of those counts,and holding a defendant to his admissions of guilt on other properly charged and correctly understood counts for which there is no evidence of actual innocence.
second,the dissent relies upon its understanding that all pleas are packages,and thus an infirmity as to part of the plea causes the entire plea to become voidable.this understanding is erroneous both as to the contours of the sentencing package doctrine as well as to the circumstances of mckeever plea agreement.the sentencing package doctrine generally applies to sentences with interdependent,consecutive counts,and not to concurrent sentences.see united states murray,cir united states davis,cir.here,the precise agreement reached also demonstrates that the two pacoa counts on which mckeever was sentenced were independent of the other counts.the court of common pleas sentenced mckeever separately on all counts.the two pacoa counts were concurrent with one of the six drug delivery counts,which were consecutive with each other.the pacoa counts and the drug delivery counts clearly were not interdependent.
even assuming,however,that mckeever sentence was a package,it is within the bounds of due process to resentence a defendant on remaining counts after some,but not all counts,are vacated.the decision in united states barron,cir en banc,is squarely on point.barron pled guilty to three counts count i,felon in possession of a firearm,carrying a maximum of ten years,or a minimum of fifteen years imprisonment if defendant had previously engaged in certain criminal conduct count ii,possession of ounces of cocaine with intent to distribute,with a sentence range of ten years to life imprisonment and count iii,possession of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking pursuant to c,with a sentence of five years consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed.three years after he was sentenced,the supreme court decided bailey united states,d,which held that use of a gun under c requires active employment of the gun in relation to the drug offense.because barron admitted to concealing a gun,but not to using the gun,the parties agreed that the facts did not justify his conviction on count iii.
barron filed a petition seeking habeas relief.the district court held that barron could have the plea agreement set aside on the ground that it was not knowing and voluntary because of ignorance of the law declared by bailey.barron,at.a panel of the ninth circuit first affirmed but was then reversed in an en banc decision which held that the guilty plea to criminal acts can remain in force even as the sentence imposed upon an innocent act is set aside there is no reason for reducing remedies to two discharge or new trial when a plea agreement is in force t he district court can distinguish the convictions that are still valid,reinstate the judgment,and resentence.id.at.it further held that a collateral challenge to the legality of a particular count of conviction does not constitute a breach of or withdrawal from a plea agreement,and the remainder of the plea agreement remains in effect.id.at.similarly,in united states watkins,cir,the court found no due process violation when defendant collaterally attacked one count of a package sentence imposed pursuant to a plea agreement,and the district court vacated that count and resentenced defendant on the remaining counts.
the dissent reliance upon united states lewis,cir,is misplaced.the plea in lewis only covered one count.thus,the issue of the constitutionality of vacating one count in a plea agreement simply was not before the court.moreover,the lewis court relied upon language in the barron panel opinion,which had not yet been reversed en banc.lewis,at.
contrary to mckeever contention,rescission of the entire plea agreement was not the only appropriate remedy.this court,in spinetti serv.int l,cir,cited to the restatement first of contracts for the proposition that a bargain that is illegal only because of a promise or a provision for a condition,disregard of which will not defeat the primary purpose of the bargain,can be enforced with the omission of the illegal portion by a party to the bargain who is not guilty of serious moral turpitude unless this result is prohibited by statute.the restatement second of contracts,similarly states,i f less than all of an agreement is unenforceable under the rule stated in,a court may nevertheless enforce the rest of the agreement in favor of a party who did not engage in serious misconduct if the performance as to which the agreement is unenforceable is not an essential part of the agreed exchange.because we hold that the pacoa charges were not an essential part of the agreed exchange,rescission of the plea is not necessary and the commonwealth did not err in vacating the two pacoa counts and resentencing mckeever based upon the remainder of the plea agreement 
furthermore,the mistake later change in law that was beneficial to the not of the type that is per se sufficient for avoidance of the plea agreement,as the allocation of risk of future changes is part of the bargaining process.see bownes,at in a contract and equally in a plea agreement one binds oneself to do something that someone else wants,in exchange for some benefit to oneself.by binding oneself one assumes the risk of future changes in circumstances in light of which one bargain may prove to have been a bad one.that is the risk inherent in all contracts they limit the parties ability to take advantage of what may happen over the period in which the contract is in effect.accordingly,in the circumstances of this case,vacating mckeever plea agreement was not the only legally permissible remedy 
we hold that the district court did not err in granting mckeever writ of habeas corpus and leaving the remedy to the commonwealth the order of the district court will be affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.i believe that the plea agreement here,negotiated and entered into on the basis of a shared misapprehension as to the reach of one of the statutes under which the defendant is charged,is voidable as based on a material mutual mistake.
because one aspect of the procedural history in this case is important to this dissent and is not sufficiently set out in the majority recitation of the facts,i briefly summarize it here.the district court found that mckeever conviction of the two pacoa counts violated mckeever due process rights because pacoa,as later interpreted by the supreme court of pennsylvania,did not reach wholly illegal organizations such as the one in which mckeever participated.the district court then issued a writ of habeas corpus but stayed the writ for days to permit the commonwealth to vacate the petitioner convictions related to the pennsylvania corrupt organizations statute and resentence him accordingly.order adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,mckeever warden sci graterford,wl,
subsequently,the state courts took several actions on mckeever case.first,on april,the erie county court of common pleas denied as untimely mckeever motion to withdraw his guilty plea.the court then vacated the pacoa convictions and resentenced mckeever to the same aggregate sentence as before.com.mckeever,of.at erie of common pleas june.in its opinion,the court reasoned that the motion was untimely the plea was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary and if the federal court had intended for this court of common pleas to permit defendant to withdraw his guilty plea,that court would have so indicated in its order.id.at.in january,the superior court affirmed,holding that the motion to withdraw the guilty plea relate d,directly and exclusively,to appellant pacoa convictions and was therefore moot com.mckeever,table,wda,slip op.at.
ii.the sufficiency of the remedy 
the majority concluded that the district court was correct in granting mckeever writ of habeas corpus but leaving the precise remedy in the hands of the commonwealth.i do not agree that offering the state court the choice of fashioning a remedy is the proper solution because i find only one of release unless mckeever is allowed to withdraw the entire plea constitutionally sufficient.
moreover,in its order,the district the court of common pleas not present the state courts with a choice of several sufficient constitutional remedies that would avoid mckeever release.rather,the order suspended the granting of the writ on the condition that the state courts implement one specific of the pacoa counts.contrary to the majority view,i believe that a district court has the authority to issue a conditional writ as long as the condition offered embodies a remedy sufficient to cure the constitutional error.only where more than one remedy is sufficient to cure that error,should the state court be permitted to choose the remedy.
the precedent invoked by the majority is not to the contrary.the majority cites barry brower for the proposition that a habeas court does not have the power to directly intervene in the process of the tribunal which has incorrectly subjected the petitioner to the custody of the respondent official,cir internal citation omitted.but barry unremarkably stands for the proposition that a federal court power is limited to ordering a prisoner released unless the state court takes certain actions and does not extend to directing the state to do anything.barry,however,does not hold that a federal court is without power to say which actions will be sufficient to correct a constitutional infirmity and avoid the prisoner release.indeed,in barry we held that the district court did not have the power to direct the state to reinstate a prisoner appeal but should instead have issued a conditional writ ordering him released unless the state court,within a certain time period,enter ed an order reinstating the prisoner appeal and permitting the public defender to represent him in that appeal.id.at.similarly,in henderson frank,cir,we specified that conditional writs must be tailored to ensure that all constitutional defects will be cured by the satisfaction of that condition.id.at 
thus,the district court was entirely within its authority in issuing a conditional writ of habeas corpus specifying that mckeever should be released unless the state courts adopted a specific remedy to correct the constitutional infirmity.its error was not in naming a remedy,but in naming the wrong one because the remedy it identified was not sufficient.the court should have ordered mckeever released unless he was allowed to rescind the entire plea agreement.
iii.effect of mutual mistake on a guilty plea 
this is not the first time that federal courts have been confronted with the question presented in this effect on a guilty plea of a shared misapprehension as to the reach of a criminal statute.rather,both the supreme court and several sister circuits faced this issue following the supreme court decision in bailey united states,d,which significantly narrowed the reach of the provision prohibiting the use of firearms in relation to the commission of a drug crime,c.these decisions put forward two principles first,where the parties involved are mistaken in the shared belief that a certain conduct is reached by a statute,the guilty plea to the counts arising under the specific statute is constitutionally invalid because the plea could not have been knowing or intelligent and second,because a plea agreement comes about as a package,a misapprehension shared by the defendant,his counsel,the prosecutor,and the trial court as to the reach of the statute constitutes a mutual mistake with material effects on the bargain,so that the entire plea agreement becomes voidable at the petitioner request and the parties are returned to their positions 
in bousley united states,d,the supreme court held that,if a plea is to counts arising under a statute later found not to reach the defendant conduct,that plea is constitutionally invalid.in bousley,the petitioner challenged his plea of guilty to using a firearm in violation of c.the petitioner argued that because the district court failed to inform him at the time of his plea that the statute required active employment of the firearm as the supreme court later clarified in bailey,his plea was not knowing or intelligent.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the supreme court did not reach the merits of bousley claim rather,it remanded for clarification of whether bousley could factually make out a claim of actual innocence to excuse procedural default,but it stated in strongly worded dictum that where a record reveals that neither the petitioner,nor his counsel,nor the court correctly understood the essential elements of the crime with which he was charged,the petitioner plea is constitutionally invalid.id.at.
although the petitioner in bousley had pled guilty to multiple counts as mckeever did in this case,he,unlike mckeever,did not challenge the entire plea on the basis of the shared misapprehension rather he attacked only the validity of the specific plea to the section c violation.thus the issue of the potential invalidity of the entire plea agreement was not brought to the attention of the court.two sister circuits,however,have been confronted with this question and have held that,when the plea as to one violation is constitutionally invalid because the parties did not understand at the time that the statute did not reach the defendant conduct,the entire plea agreement must be voided courts should not simply sever the invalid pleas and treat the remainder of the plea agreement as valid.
in united states lewis,cir,the petitioner had been charged with eleven counts of offenses involving drugs and firearms but,under a plea agreement,had pled guilty to just one of the counts,use of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense under c.after the supreme court decided bailey,lewis attacked his conviction and sentence,arguing that he was unconstitutionally imprisoned because the statute under which he was convicted and sentenced did not reach his conduct.lewis,however,did not request that the entire plea be voided as that would leave him potentially vulnerable to prosecution on the other ten counts rather,he requested immediate release,since he was imprisoned on the section c count only.the tenth circuit held that,where a plea agreement is based on a mutual mistake as to the elements of a charge,the only appropriate remedy is to void the entire plea agreement,because a plea agreement is a package deal that a district court has the authority to vacate when a conviction that is part of the plea package is vacated.id.at.because the petitioner was the party affected by the parties mutual mistake,h is plea agreement with the government was voidable,if he so chose.id.at.the court expressly declined to hold that the plea agreement was invalid only as to one part lewis guilty plea to the c count and not another the dismissal of the other counts if lewis chose to pursue his habeas petition,the entire deal would be off and he could face prosecution on all the originally dismissed counts 
in support of its reasoning,the lewis court quoted approvingly the ninth circuit opinion in united states barron,cir 
given the realities of plea bargaining,it makes good sense to apply the sentence package concept when a petitioner challenges one of multiple convictions obtained under a plea agreement because the district court can not possibly know what convictions or sentences a defendant would have received had he not pleaded guilty to the section c count,an appropriate remedy is to put the defendant in the position he was in before he entered into the plea agreement or before the district court accepted the plea based on conduct which did not constitute the crime charged.
lewis,at,quoting barron,at see also united states,cir noting in dictum that where a defendant attacks a plea agreement,the attack is directed at the entire agreement,and,if successful,may render the entire agreement void or voidable,so that the proper remedy in such a case might be to vacate or allow withdrawal of the guilty pleas and reinstate the charges dismissed under the plea agreement united states bunner,cir where defendant,relying on bailey,had successfully attacked his conviction under section c,the underlying purpose of the plea agreement was frustrated,and the government plea agreement obligations became dischargeable thus,at the government election,the parties could be returned to position they occupied before bunner entered his guilty plea.
the seventh circuit court of appeals recently reached the same conclusion in united states bradley,cir.bradley also involved a mutual mistake as to the reach of c,although in this case it was independent of the supreme court holding in bailey.on direct appeal,the court held that bradley should be allowed to withdraw his entire plea,not just the plea to the section c count.it reasoned,first,that the specific plea to section c was not knowing and voluntary,and second,that because there was no meeting of the minds on all the essential terms of the plea agreement,the entire plea agreement,and not just the plea as to section c,was tainted.id.at.
the supreme court decision in brady united states,d,cited by the majority for the proposition that a plea agreement that fails to anticipate a change in the law is not per se unknowing and involuntary,is distinguishable from bousley,lewis,and bradley.brady had pled guilty to kidnaping a and had received a sentence of years imprisonment,later reduced to.nine years later,the supreme court held in united states jackson,d,that the death penalty provision in section a mandating the death penalty for defendants convicted under this statute,if the victim was not liberated unharmed and if the jury recommended it,but providing that the judge could not impose the death sentence if the defendant pled chilled the exercise of the right not to plead guilty and to go to trial,because the defendant could not be sentenced to death if he pled guilty,but faced a significant likelihood of capital punishment if he went to trial.relying on jackson,brady then challenged his guilty plea to kidnaping,claiming among other things that his plea was not intelligent because his counsel had wrongly advised him that the jury had the power to condemn him to death the power later found unconstitutional in jackson.
the court rejected brady argument,holding there was 
no requirement in the constitution that a defendant must be permitted to disown his solemn admissions in open court that he committed the act with which he is charged simply because it later develops that the state would have had a weaker case than the defendant had thought or that the maximum penalty then assumed applicable has been held inapplicable in subsequent judicial decisions.
brady,d emphasis added.this phrasing substantially repeated three times within two paragraphs of the opinion clarifies the import of the more general proposition,also used on the same page,that absent misrepresentation or other impermissible conduct by state agents a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in the light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise.id.the brady court was not faced with a situation where the statute simply did not reach the defendant admitted conduct but the parties did not know this brady lack of knowledge regarded the possible sentence,not the fact that he was actually innocent of the charges against him.if the court had been faced with a situation where defendants would falsely condemn themselves because of an offer of leniency,the court admitted,a different decision might be required.id.at.unlike brady,mckeever did,in fact,falsely condemn himself not because of an offer of leniency,but because nobody knew any better.mckeever plea was unknowing in a far more basic sense than brady could have been 
our sister circuits decisions in lewis and bradley,concluding that a plea agreement such as the one here is voidable in its entirety,are based on the widely notion that plea agreements must be construed according to the general principles of contract law.see united states gebbie,cir rules of contract interpretation are applied to plea agreements dunn,at if the government breaches a plea agreement,the remedy is either specific performance or rescission of the agreement and withdrawal of the entire plea houmis united states,cir plea was invalid where the record revealed substantial confusion as to whether habeas petitioner had understood the agreement,and thus left doubt as to whether any meeting of the minds ever resulted from plea negotiations.under general principles of contract law,a contract based on a material mistake shared by the parties to the contract is voidable.see restatement second of contracts w here a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances,the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake.
of course,not all mistakes can lead to the voiding of a contract.the party wishing to void the contract must show that the resulting imbalance in the agreed exchange is so severe that he can not fairly be required to carry it out.ordinarily he will be able to do this by showing that the exchange is not only less desirable to him but is also more advantageous to the other party.restatement second of contracts,cmt.c.the majority holds that the mutual misapprehension as to the reach of the pacoa was not a mistake of the kind that would require rescission of the plea agreement because,first,it is a mistake of law rather than fact,and second,it is not material because the heart of the plea agreement was not the pacoa charges,but rather the drug trafficking charges and the primary purpose of the plea agreement could be preserved by reforming the contract to conform to the actual state of the law,by severing the pleas to the pacoa counts.i disagree.
first,whether the misapprehension as to mckeever innocence is characterized as a mistake of fact or law does not change its impact on the deal mckeever struck with the commonwealth.as several commentators have noted,modern contract law has abandoned the strict view that ignorance of the law is no excuse and therefore mutual mistakes of law do not affect the validity of contracts even in situations that would give rise to inequity see restatement second of contracts defining mistake as a belief that is not in accord with the facts and cmt.b t he rules stated in this chapter do not draw the distinction that is sometimes made between fact and law.they treat the law in existence at the time of the making of the contract as part of the total state of facts at that time richard lord,williston on contracts ed noting that in modern contract law,c ourts generally disallow any distinction between mistakes of fact and law,treating both alike for purposes of equitable relief.to justify rescission,a mistake of law must have related to a question,the answer to which was assumed as part of the fundamental basis of the transaction.joseph perillo,corbin on contracts revised ed t oday,the rule denying relief for mistake of law has little vitality.it has been eroded by so many qualifications and exceptions,varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.it is common to find cases where the issue is not even raised.allan farnsworth,contracts the modern view is that the existing law is part of the state of the facts at the time of agreement.therefore,most courts will grant relief for such a mistake,as they would for any other mistake of fact.
moreover,whatever value this distinction may have in an ordinary commercial context,it is important to remember that plea agreements are constitutional contracts and unlike contracts in other spheres must be construed in light of the rights and obligations created by the constitution.ricketts adamson,d.a mistake of law in this context has a constitutional dimension and can not be treated as tainting the validity of the bargain made by the parties any less than a mistake of fact 
second,to say that the plea to the two pacoa counts did not affect the sentence finally imposed and that therefore the pacoa counts could not constitute the heart of the plea agreement,is to beg the question.mckeever obtained from the prosecution a treatment for the two pacoa counts that amounted to no additional jail time in exchange for his pleas to the drug trafficking counts.that the drug trafficking counts constituted the heart of the sentence mckeever received does not necessarily mean that they also constituted the heart of the bargain.the mutual mistake as to the reach of the pacoa caused mckeever to accept something valueless the merger and concurrent sentence on the pacoa counts in partial exchange for something valuable his agreement not to contest the other counts.the two pacoa counts represented a potential additional prison term of fourteen years the mistake as to whether his conduct was criminal under the pacoa could not have been immaterial 
where a mistake regards a basic assumption on which the bargain is based,rescission of the contract is the preferred remedy reformation is appropriate only when the mistake is one as to expression.united states williams,cir quoting restatement second of contracts cmt.a see also united states sandles,cir w here there is a mutual misunderstanding as to the material terms of a plea agreement,the appropriate remedy is rescission,not unilateral modification.williston on contracts ed.reformation must yield to rescission where the error is in the substance of the bargain,not in its expression.spinetti serv.int l,cir,cited by the majority,is not controlling because,first,it involved the reformation of a contract containing a provision that was contrary to public policy,not a contract grounded on a mistake of law and second,the excised provision regarded a matter peripheral to the essence of the bargain the allocation of attorney fees in a binding arbitration agreement.where the parties have reached an agreement only part of which can not be enforced,despite the parties intent,because of the external constraints of public policy,it makes sense to allow the core of the contract to survive and invalidate only the sections that offend public policy.but where,as here,the parties are mistaken as to the nature of the bargain,the agreement should be set aside and the parties given the opportunity to renegotiate on the basis of the true value of the where mistake as to the nature of the bargain is of constitutional significance,if the activity covered by the plea is not a criminal offense,can the plea be a knowing and intelligent one.
iv.prejudice to the commonwealth 
i am mindful of the commonwealth argument that,if the plea were voided and mckeever chose to go to trial,the prosecution,through no fault of its own,would be significantly prejudiced by having to locate witnesses to drug transactions that were completed thirteen or fourteen years ago,even though mckeever has never contested his responsibility for them.however,even though a party delay in declaring his intention to rescind a contract may preclude rescission in an ordinary contract case,the delay has less significance when the reason for rescission has constitutional implications.
admittedly,mckeever did not act swiftly to put the commonwealth on notice of his intention to rescind the plea when he learned of the mutual mistake.the initial decision of the pennsylvania supreme court,holding the pacoa inapplicable to wholly illegitimate enterprises,was issued in.see commonwealth besch.even assuming that mckeever did not begin collateral review proceedings at that time because the pennsylvania legislature promptly amended the statute so that it would clearly apply to illegitimate enterprises,he must have known at the latest by when the pennsylvania supreme court issued commonwealth shaffer,that the amended statute did not apply retroactively to him yet,mckeever waited almost four june seek collateral review of his conviction.
in general,a delay of this kind would weaken a party right to rescission of the contract as an equitable remedy.see grymes sanders.holding,in the context of unilateral mistake,that the party desiring rescission must,upon the discovery of the facts,at once announce his purpose,and adhere to it.this conclusion would be strengthened by the prejudice inflicted on the commonwealth by each intervening year.see id.at a court of equity is always reluctant to rescind,unless the parties can be put back in statu quo.if this can not be done,it will give such relief only where the clearest and strongest equity imperatively demands it.
in the context of constitutional violations,however,both the supreme court and this court have declined the invitation to consider the prejudice to the prosecution of having to defendant on the basis of stale evidence.in vasquez hillery,d,the supreme court upheld the grant of a new trial to a black petitioner who had been indicted by a grand jury from which blacks were systematically excluded.in dissent,justice powell argued relief was inappropriate where the violation occurred in the distant past years,in that case and where the state could show it would be substantially prejudiced in its ability to retry the defendant.id.at.powell,dissenting.the majority,however,rejected the dissent theory,which would condition the grant of relief upon the passage of time between a conviction and the filing of a petition for habeas corpus,depending upon the ability of a state to obtain a second conviction.id.at.see also united states nahodil,cir noting,in section context,that although prejudice to the government ability to retry the case is a factor to be considered in ruling on a motion to withdraw a plea under.d b,prejudice to the government ability to bring a case to trial is not dispositive of a motion to withdraw the guilty plea if the original acceptance of the plea was improper or improvident 
therefore,i conclude that the district court should have granted the writ and ordered mckeever released unless his entire plea was rescinded.i respectfully dissent from the majority holding that vacating the pacoa convictions and resentencing was a sufficient remedy.

at the time of mckeever plea,the commonwealth withdrew count xi,possession of a controlled substance.
the details of the sentencing scheme as set forth in the plea agreement are as follows count i dealing in proceeds of unlawful activities years concurrent with count v count ii pacoa years merged with count iii and concurrent with count v count iii pacoa years merged with count ii and concurrent with count v count iv criminal conspiracy years concurrent with count v count v delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to mckeever then current sentence count vi delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to count v count vii delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to count vi count viii delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to count vii count ix delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to count viii count x delivery of a controlled substance years consecutive to count ix.
pursuant to,a pcra petition must be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final.under a proviso of the amendments to the pcra,if the judgment of sentence becomes final before january,the effective date of the amendments,a petitioner has one year from the effective date of the act to file a first pcra petition.mckeever qualified for this proviso,but failed to file his petition by january.
the third circuit has not yet decided whether a claim of actual innocence may equitably toll the filing period under d.because the commonwealth conceded this issue,it is not before the court at this time.
in an opinion written by the court of common pleas on june,the court noted that mckeever initial motion on january,to withdraw his plea was untimely,and that even if it were timely,it should not now be granted because the plea was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary,and thus mckeever did not suffer prejudice as a result of the initial denial of this motion.appellee app x.
the dissent attempts to distinguish brady strong holding by suggesting that it can be marginalized because it did not involve a situation where,due to a subsequent change in the law,defendant was actually innocent of a law to which he pleaded guilty.rather,it involved a subsequent determination that a law was invalid because it allowed defendant to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty.in brady,however,defendant decision to plead guilty was based,at least in part,on the opportunity to avoid the death penalty.his failure to anticipate the change in law clearly had a much greater impact than it did on mckeever,where the pacoa counts neither impacted the length of his sentence nor were a central component of the bargain.

we also note that many of the cases the dissent relies upon involve habeas petitions that arise out of federal prosecutions pursuant to.such petitions do not implicate the federalism and comity issues of habeas petitions under that,in this case,support a remand to the state judge for determination of remedy.
there may be a case in which events subsequent to a plea render the defendant innocent of a count which is so central to the bargain between the parties that vacating the plea is the only constitutionally permitted remedy.this is not such a case.
we are not determining the validity of the commonwealth resentencing on remand.rather,this ruling is limited to the validity of the district court order remanding the case to state court for a determination of the appropriate remedy.
this order identified as the remedy for the constitutional violation the vacatur of the two pacoa convictions and resentencing.this language is inconsistent with portions of the district court opinion,which suggest that the district court would leave the choice of vacatur of the pacoa convictions or rescission of the the pennsylvania state courts since they were in a better position to decide whether a mutual mistake denied petitioner of sic the benefit of his bargain with the prosecution,and the legal significance,if any,of such a denial.mckeever graterford,wl,at.we note that in its discussion about permitting the state court to choose the applicable remedy,the district court cited cases where the basis for habeas relief was breach of the plea agreement,not a plea to activities which did not constitute a criminal offense.in such a situation,there may be more than one constitutionally sufficient remedy.see santobello new york,d dunn colleran,cir.
mckeever had moved for other forms of relief none of the other motions was granted or is relevant here.
as mentioned above,where more than one remedy would be adequate to correct the conditional defect,it is appropriate for the federal court to offer the state a choice between releasing the petitioner and adopting one of the several remedies identified as sufficient.see dunn,where a plea agreement was breached by the prosecution,breach could be remedied either by ordering specific performance of the agreement or by voiding it dickerson vaughn,cir remanding with directions that petitioners be released unless the commonwealth of pennsylvania adopted one of two remedies either of which could cure the constitutional infirmity.however,as discussed below,i conclude that only one remedy is appropriate here.
the majority takes the somewhat puzzling position that nobody was,in fact,mistaken at mckeever plea because at that time pacoa did cover mckeever conduct the law did not change until after mckeever pled and was sentenced.but the pennsylvania supreme court announcement of the correct interpretation of the
