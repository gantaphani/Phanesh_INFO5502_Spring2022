plaintiff,the terrebonne parish school board school board,as royalties holder of a section tract,appeals the district court dismissal of its delictual and contractual action against the defendant,mobil oil corporation mobil,on statute of limitation grounds.the school board argues that its claims against mobil are imprescriptible under louisiana law,and thus the district court erroneously concluded that the expiration of louisiana and liberative prescription periods applicable to tort and contract claims,respectively,serve to bar the school board claims for damages and restoration of section land.concluding that the state of louisiana constitutional immunity from prescription does not enure to the benefit of the school board suing solely in its capacity as royalty owner and not in the name of the state,we affirm for the following reasons.
facts and proceedings 
this case involves a suit for restoration and money damages arising out of the erosion and diminishment of a section tract owned by the state of louisiana and managed by the school board.this dispute centers on an approximately acre tract,in western terrebonne parish,louisiana.it is one of many section tracts managed by the school board located in terrebonne parish coastal marsh.the state section lands are public lands consisting of the sixteenth sections of various townships that parish school boards are entitled to use to support education.the school board leased this particular property for various purposes,including oil and gas activities.
via lease dated december,the school board let the subject acre tract to southern natural gas company sng for an initial payment of.the lease specifically granted to sng and its assignees the right to dredge canals on the property and to perform other works conducive to oil and gas exploration.the lease did not require that sng refill any canals upon termination of the lease.
although the school board contract claim is labeled as one for breach of a servitude,s mineral lease s,the school board admits that it has no contract in the nature of a servitude,or mineral lease with mobil,or its predecessor magnolia petroleum company hereinafter referred to as mobil.rather,the basis of the school board contractual claim for erosion damage is a agreement,by and between sng and mobil the school board claims sng agreement with mobil somehow renders mobil liable under sng mineral lease with the school board.
mobil obtained a permit from the louisiana conservation office to drill the well.pursuant to the agreement with sng,mobil dredged a canal in the southeast corner of the tract to access the surface location of school board well.mobil drilling and all other activities associated with well ceased when the well was completed.on december,school board well dry hole on,plugged and abandoned.
drilling and operations associated with a abandoned over years ago form the basis of the school board claims against mobil.the school board maintains that the existence of the accessory canal,which was left intact,has contributed to the erosion of the land and the demise of the marshland habitat.
the summary judgment record demonstrates that since the early,the school board acquired actual knowledge of erosion damage caused by oil field canals,albeit erosion damage to section lands generally,and not necessarily to the particular tract at issue.in may,the school board reconsidered a request to dredge a canal on some of its marsh property,fearing that it would make the erosion problem worse.soon thereafter,the school board hired an engineering firm to prepare a survey and memorialize in report form the findings relative to the problematic erosion of section lands.indeed,the stated purpose of baker smith january,preliminary erosion study was to assist the terrebonne parish school board and residents of terrebonne parish to become aware of the rate of erosion occurring within terrebonne parish.the school board intended that the january,erosion study of section lands serve as a basis for approximating land loss rates throughout the parish.summarizing the causes of erosion affecting all of terrebonne parish section lands,baker smith,report concluded that direct,causes included the breakup of fresh marsh and flotant because of increased salinities introduced by navigation,drainage,and canals,and the replacement of land area by canals hence,on august,the school board passed a resolution that acknowledged the erosion problem 
in february,the environmental consulting firm coastal environments prepared a listing of section lands for the school board,specifically referring to a land loss map of terrebonne parish coastal environment february report identified title lands on the land loss map,one being the instant tract hackberry bayou on july,the school board section lands committee considered hiring coastal environments to address the mitigation issue but subsequently decided to hold the issue in abeyance,and did not hire the firm 
on april,coastal environments submitted a section lands management proposal suggesting a partial contingency fee arrangement in return for its assistance quantifying damages for restoration of areas affected by development of the section land.coastal environment plan for a study contemplated an evaluation and report on each section tract individually 
in,the school board received the plan from the usda soil conservation service to manage land that included seventeen section tracts in terrebonne parish,including the land at issue herein.this plan again acknowledged manmade changes which have altered the hydrology of the basin include the construction of extensive oilfield canal networks in the interior marsh 
the school board hired morris hebert,hebert to determine whether the plan would provide for closing any canals on its section lands,including the subject acre tract regarding the particular tract at issue,hebert reported to the school board that the property current mineral lessee,pennzoil,objected to closing any canal on the tract,including the canal at issue in this case in addition,hebert instructed the school board that 
although there is sic no active oil and gas operations on the property at this time,the existing well canal is an attractive feature for future operations.the existing canal,trenasses,and pond are being used for recreational and commercial hunting and fishing activities.closure of the location canal in the southeast quarter se of the section and the trenasses would significantly affect its usefulness to the present and future lessees.however,because access can be gained to the pond from the southerly trenasse off the location canal,closure of the northerly trenasses would not appear to cause significant impact to the section.closure of the northerly trenasse would curtail the large volume of water moving across the section through the pond and would eliminate the aforementioned scouring and channelization.approximately in revenues from the oil and gas lease is expected in fiscal year with the hunting and trapping lease earning the board annually until 
in conclusion,hebert advised the school board that a ny canal or waterway closure which affects leaseholder access to their lease could jeopardize the viability of the property and hence the income the board.despite notification of effects of scouring and channelization due to the existence of the location canal on the subject tract,the school board took no action to close the canal.
in august,the school board was again informed that it could file an action to recover damages allegedly caused by oilfield canals.despite the references to the possibility of a monstrous amount of damage,and an offer of assistance in any such litigation,the school board still did not respond.it was not until march,when the mineral lessee llog exploration company lease terminated,that the school board commissioned an inspection of the subject acre tract for environmental damage.via report dated march,malcolm poiencot issued his findings to the school board,replete with photographs of the subject canal and an opening at the end of the canal where erosion allegedly had occurred the school board took no action against llog or any other entity in response to the report.
over two years later and solely in its own name as owner of all mineral royalties on section,township south,range east,terrebonne parish,the school board filed a petition for damages against mobil in the judicial district court for the parish of terrebonne,louisiana,alleging both tort and contract claims with respect to the section tract.the state of louisiana was not named in any capacity and was never made a party to the proceedings.after removing the case to the eastern district of louisiana,mobil filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the affirmative defense of liberative prescription as to the plaintiff delictual claims,inter alia,and the absence of privity necessary for contractual liability vis a vis the school board.
the school board chief argument in opposition to the motion was that its they relate to section lands held in trust by the state of within the purview of the section of the louisiana state constitution which prevents prescription from running against the state additionally,the school board contended that sng farmout agreement recasts mobil as an assignee under the board mineral lease,rendering mobil liable for failure to restore the property pursuant to the terms of the lease,and prescription interrupted as long as the continuing obligation remained unsatisfied finally,the school board argued that the documents filed and made part of the summary judgment record were not sufficient to establish knowledge of erosion related damages with respect to the subject tract,and thus prescription had not commenced to run,and that in any event the louisiana doctrines of contra non valentem and continuing tort operate to suspend prescription in this case.however,the school board did not dispute the facts that there was no mineral lease by and between the school board and mobil identified there was no evidence of an assignment of any interest in the board mineral lease to mobil mobil activities on the tract were pursuant to a farmout agreement with the school board mineral lessee sng and mobil activities on the subject tract ceased on december,when it plugged and abandoned the dry hole,leaving the accessory canal intact additionally,the record is clear that at no time was the district court apprised of the issue that the school board only now presses for the first time on appeal,that the state immunity enures to the benefit of the school board in this case as a function of louisiana law of solidary obligations and its status as a solidary obligee with the state 
the district court granted mobil motion,dismissing all of the school board claims as.the district court specifically held that the school board tort and contract claims are prescribed,pursuant to.civil code provision of liberative prescription for delictual actions,and.civil code provision of liberative prescription for contractual actions and the school board can find no shelter under louisiana constitutional provision which suspends the running of prescription against the state in all civil matters.see.const.the district court did not address mobil alternative ground for dismissal of the school board breach of contract claims directly against is,the absence of contractual privity on account of the complete failure of proof with respect to the existence of a contract with mobil.
the school board now appeals the district court ruling granting summary judgment on the basis of prescription.

constitutional immunity from prescription 
the school board defense to the plea of prescription is based upon the maxim nullum tempus occurrit regi as embodied in the louisiana state constitution and its application to the school board claims in its own right against mobil with respect to section.see.const,prescription shall not run against the state in any civil matter,unless otherwise provided in this constitution or expressly by law.the school board invokes the mantra of the aforesaid constitutional immunity under the rationale that the subject section tract is owned by the state and administered by the school board to benefit public education.plaintiff contends that the district court judgment is inconsistent with controlling jurisprudence in state through department of highways city of pineville,so d,and thus prescription can not run notwithstanding the fact that the property is administered by the school board,a body politic capable of suing and being sued in its own right.noting at the outset that the school board appeal does not concern any claim that the state of louisiana may have in any capacity,much less as the owner of the section land at issue,and that the school board filed suit against mobil solely in its capacity as royalty owner and not in the name of the state,we affirm the judgment of the district court under the circumstances aforestated that the school board claims,claims in own right are not exempt from prescription.
here,we are faced with both a clear statutory framework applicable to the claims of the school board with respect to restoration of section land when title is in the name of the state and a number of louisiana supreme court decisions that refuse to apply the state constitutional immunity from prescription when the suit is not brought by or in the name of the state,but instead by separate state agency such as a school board or other body politic capable of bringing suit and being sued in its own name.
a determination as to the imprescriptibility of the school board claims for restoration of section lands must be mindful of the louisiana statutes pertaining to the actions involving school lands.more particularly title,public lands,chapter,part iv entitled actions involving school lands provides in pertinent part the following statutes 
subpart actions by the state 
action for recovery of title and damages for trespass 
the attorney general may contract with and employ attorneys at law to sue for and recover from any person,firm or corporation,claiming under title,sixteenth sections known as school lands,title to which belongs to the state of louisiana,and to sue for and recover damages for trespass upon sixteenth sections known as school lands except where the school boards have sold timber thereon,whether the trespasser claims under color of title or not.

disposition of proceeds 
the amount recovered by the state shall,after deducting and paying the attorneys fees and all other lawful costs and charges,be paid into the state treasury,to be kept on the books of the state auditor and state treasurer,to the credit of the township in which the land is situated,in the same manner as not provided by law for the proceeds of the sale of sixteenth sections.
stat.ann,west.
under this framework,the school boards administer the lands,but both the state and the school boards are able to bring suit with regard to section lands according to the school board,its suit is not on behalf of itself,but for the protection of section lands owned by the state and managed by the school board.nevertheless,the plaintiff did not file suit in the name of the state as required by louisiana statute under the circumstances.see id.at.
the school board reliance on state williams cypress,so.is misplaced.in williams,the louisiana supreme court held that prescription did not apply to a suit by the state to recover damages for timber that was improperly sold by a school board.see williams,so.at.the court recognized that the section land was owned by the state,to be managed for the benefit of the school board.id.at.furthermore,it determined that the action was not prescribed even though louisiana state law provided school boards with the right to sue regarding section lands.such suits,it noted,are required to be brought in the name of the state and paid into the state treasury.id.at.accordingly,such suits receive the benefit of the immunity from prescription.id.
it is critical to a determination of this issue to note that this is not a mineral rights case,nor is it a matter of acquisitive prescription.the only question herein involves a claim for damages for alleged destruction of property as a result of the continued existence of a canal on the tract.in the case of board of commissioners of caddo levee district pure oil company,so,a case concerned with prescription under article,the defendant oil company sought to recover certain royalties which had been previously paid by it to the levee district.the lands in question had been certified to the levee district from the state,but later by consent judgment,the certification was adjudged null and title reverted to the state.the louisiana supreme court held that the prescriptive period pled by the defendant ran against the levee board even though it was an agency of the state.the court held 
it appears,therefore,from the foregoing,that the plea of prescription presented is one pleaded against an agency of the state,created by the legislature,to accomplish certain public purposes,devolving primarily upon the state,in bar of a demand for royalties,under a mineral lease,granted by that agency,on land conveyed to it by the state,to aid in accomplishing those purposes.it also appears that the first question presented is whether prescription runs against an agency of the state on such a demand.if the question presented involved the loss by prescription of the mineral rights themselves,on land conveyed or certified to a levee district,under the constitution of,we should most likely hold,in view of the conclusion reached in state ex rel.board of commissioners of tensas basin levee district grace,so,that,as the levee district must retain such mineral rights,it could not lose them by prescription,for a state agency can not lose by prescription that which it must retain,and can not alienate.but no such question is presented here,but only the question as to whether the demand of a levee district for certain royalties,under a lease,granted in on land certified to it in is prescribed.
plaintiff has,and always has had,the right to sue and be sued in its corporate name.it is a separate entity from the state,created by the state,it is true,to accomplish certain public purposes,but is nevertheless distinct from it.we think that the foregoing excerpt from the case last cited is applicable here,and we therefore rule that the prescription pleaded runs against the plaintiff.
pure oil,so.at emphasis added.the louisiana supreme court further discussed the case of port of new orleans toyo kisen kaisha,so,which addressed the question of whether prescription liberandi causa ran against a state agency.the plaintiff in the port of new orleans,supra,was a state agency and the cause of action was one for damages caused to one of the wharves of the port by the defendant negligence.the port of orleans urged the court to find that because it was a state agency,prescription did not run against it,since prescription does not run against the state in civil matters.the court rejected the plaintiff suspension of prescription argument that the state constitutional immunity applied equally to the port as a state agency,the state.the court stated that it was not prepared to hold that constitutional suspension of prescription established in favor of the state applied to any or all other public corporations or agencies.in port of new orleans,the louisiana supreme court explained t his constitutional provision is only the reduction to statutory form of a principle of public law already established by universal jurisprudence,which principle has very generally been confined to actions brought by and in the name of the state itself.id.
the district court herein rejected the school board argument that it was immune to prescription under louisiana state constitution article.the court held that this provision is inapplicable when the suit is brought not by the state,but by a separate state agency such as a school board.in so holding,it relied on state through department of highways city of pineville,so d,in which the louisiana supreme court held that the department of highways could not claim constitutional immunity from prescription because it was not the state.in city of pineville,the louisiana department of highways sued the city to recover highway funds it had advanced to speed along a project.although the prescriptive period had expired,the department of highways argued that it should be able to take advantage of the state constitutional immunity from prescription.the louisiana supreme court rejected that argument,holding that 
the state,for the purposes of the constitutional immunity from prescription,does not include a state agency which is a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued and which,when vested with a cause of action,is the sole party capable of asserting it.regardless of its status as an instrumentality of the state,such an agency remains a distinct legal entity subject to claims of prescription except where the law provides otherwise.
id.at despite this holding,however,the louisiana supreme court did provide one apparent exception,stating that c onsistent with this view,it has also been held that,when the state holds title to property,prescription can not run,notwithstanding the fact that the property is administered by a state agency.id.citing williams,supra.
the instant case,however,does not fall within the holding of williams.the school board claim is allegedly,at least in part,a contract claim based on a mineral lease that it apparently entered into under its own name.moreover,unlike in williams,the case was not brought in the name of the state of louisiana as required by statute,but only in the name of the school board.moreover and as previously discussed,louisiana statutory provision addressing precisely the same kind of restoration claims that the school board now seeks to prosecute in its own right requires that such suit be brought in the name of the state.see.stat.ann.west.
the school board argues on appeal that it is exempt from prescription as a of solidarity because under the applicable law,any act that interrupts prescription for one of several solidary obligees benefits all other solidary obligees.see brief of terrebonne parish school board,at citing.this novel argument assumes without demonstrating an act by the state that interrupts prescription and privity vis a vis the board mineral lease.see id.mobil contends that the school board waived any claim that the law of solidarity confers immunity from prescription alternatively,mobil contends that state immunity from prescription is not an act that interrupts prescription,but rather a statutory exemption from the application of prescription altogether.in either case,the school board thus bears the burden of proving any exemption from the application of prescription.
we consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal only if it presents a purely legal question and failure to address it would result in a grave injustice we see no reason to excuse procedural default of the issue of whether some as yet unspecified act by the state interrupted prescription with respect to the school board claims in its own right as royalty holder.nothing in the summary judgment record or the district court opinion reflects either that the school board raised this argument for exemption from prescription or that the district judge was aware of it.moreover,dismissal of the school board claims will not result in a grave injustice indeed,the school board as the party asserting suspension,interruption,exemption from prescription had the burden of proof with regard to overcoming that prima facie defense as to solidarity,the school board pressed no argument and likewise offered no evidence.under.e,the moving party need not produce evidence showing the absence of an issue of material fact with respect to an issue on which the party bears the burden of proof 
accordingly and under the circumstances presented in this particular case,the district court correctly ruled that the school board is not entitled to invoke the state immunity from prescription.
tort damages delict 
the school board contends that summary judgment was not proper because prescription of its tort claims turned on notice,the evidence of notice about erosion on section lands generally and not specific to section is insufficient to commence the running of prescription,and either or both the doctrines of contra non valentem and continuing tort operate to suspend louisiana prescriptive period applicable to delictual claims.mobil contends that the summary judgment record clearly reflects actual notice of tract specific erosion damage and causation,and thus judgment of dismissal of the tort claims on the basis of prescription should be affirmed.mobil contends that neither the doctrine of continuing tort nor contra non valentem operate to suspend prescription considering the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record.mobile highlights two reports which evidence actual notice with respect to the subject tract,to wit surveyor morris hebert,report to the school board dated april,which is tract specific and malcolm poiencot march,tract specific inspection summary provided to the school board our review of the record supports mobil position.it is uncontroverted that two years prior to the commencement of the instant lawsuit the school board had actual notice of erosion damage with respect to section,and at the very least constructive knowledge of causation as well.
because the school board tort claims involve damage to immovable property it is subject to the liberative prescriptive period which commenced from the day the plaintiff acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the damage.ann.art.west the record in this case amply demonstrates that the board had actual notice of the damages complained of with respect to section in particular.this case is readily distinguished from columbia gulf transmission in which another panel of this court discerned no evidence in the record regarding erosion damage specific to the particular section tract at issue.
louisiana discovery rule as enunciated in article applicable in cases of damage to land is essentially congruent with the doctrine of contra non valentem and thus a discussion of article prescription necessarily entails a discussion of contra non valentem insofar as it pertains to this case.the doctrine has been parsed into four categories,only one of which is applicable in this case,that the cause was not reasonably knowable by the school board until it filed suit.the heart of the inquiry into the school board constructive knowledge of the cause of the damage to section is the reasonableness of its inaction as early as,the school board had actual knowledge of the erosion damage to the particular tract at issue and even then,constructive knowledge of the causation element as well.in march of,morris hebert advised the board both of the extant canal causing scouring and deterioration of the marshland habitat,and of the opposition to any closure of the canal on the subject tract by the school board then current lessee pennzoil.malcolm poiencot march,inspection summary addressed to the school board is also tract specific,replete with photographs of the canal on the subject property and the canal opening suffice it to say,the summary judgment record demonstrates that as early as march the school board had the requisite knowledge of the damage and causation with respect to the subject tract,but failed to act.we are satisfied by this evidence of actual notice resulting from overt knowledge of the damage to the specific property at issue in this case.constructive knowledge of the causation element as of that date with respect to the specific tract is also manifest in the summary judgment record.
moreover,the uncontroverted facts set forth in the documents of record witness an attitude on the part of the school board that is tantamount to willful neglect,which stands in strident contradistinction to any notion of reasonable inaction.the record documents uniformly demonstrate that despite coastal environments even earlier forecast of monstrous damage,followed by the board actual knowledge of the damage and causation with respect to the particular tract,the school board did not timely heed the call of responsible stewardship,but instead unreasonably delayed taking legal action seeking restoration of eroding section.
the louisiana supreme court has often noted that basic principle of the doctrine contra non valentem is equity the principles of equity and justice form the mainstay of the doctrine and demand suspension when the plaintiff is effectively prevented form enforcing his rights for reasons external to his own will,notwithstanding the general rule that prescription runs against all persons unless exception is established by legislation.contra non valentem does not suspend prescription when a litigant is perfectly able to bring its claim,but fails or refuses to do so the principles of equity,justice,and fairness that underpin the doctrine are absent in this case.
the doctrine of continuing tort presents an exception to the prescriptive period.however,it also is not applicable to this case.a continuing tort is occasioned by continuing unlawful acts,and there are no such continuing unlawful acts by mobil.without a continuing duty owed to the plaintiff and a continuing breach of that duty by a defendant,there is no continuing tort.see crump,so d at.
in crump,the louisiana supreme court rejected the contention that a continuing breach of duty could consist of a defendant failure to remedy the harm caused by the initial tortious conduct,stating that the breach of the duty to right the wrong and make the plaintiff whole simply can not be a continuing wrong which suspends the running of prescription,as that is the purpose of any lawsuit and the obligation of every tortfeasor.id.at.recently,the louisiana supreme court summarized the doctrine of continuing tort as it applies in louisiana property law cases as follows 
recently,we clarified the continuing tort doctrine in a property law case,crump sabine river authority,so d.we held that a continuing tort is occasioned by the continual unlawful acts,not the continuation of the ill effects of an original,wrongful act.at,so d at.addressing the requirement that there be continuous conduct by the defendant,we stated that t he continuous conduct contemplated in a continuing tort must be tortious and must be the operating cause of the injury.at,so d at.
when a defendant act is completed,the existence of continuing damages to the plaintiff,even progressively worsening damages,does not present successive causes of action accruing because of a continuing tort.derbofen james,so d.cir,writs denied,so d,cert.denied,d.
in re moses,so d at.the practical rule adopted by louisiana courts in property damage cases is that prescription begins to run when the continuous tortious conduct is abated.see in re moses,so d at applying the same principle in the medical malpractice setting when the case involves a single act of medical malpractice as opposed to a continuous course of treatment.
unlike the facts of the case considered by the panel in columbia gulf transmission there was no continuing unlawful conduct by defendant mobil.the completed well was abandoned with the canal left intact in,approximately forty years before suit was filed by the school board.as discussed in greater detail later in this opinion,this case does not concern either a servitude,mineral lease or any other contract by and between the school board and mobil.hence,there is no possibility that unlawful acts include omissions for any breach of a special duty owed,whether to a servient estate or otherwise.here,the defendant conduct ceased decades earlier obviating even the possibility of liability for continuing tort.
as stated at the outset,the school board had the burden of proof with respect to establishing an exception to prescription,whether by contra non valentem,continuing tort,or any other exemption from application of prescription.the plaintiff was required to adduce evidence sufficient to raise a material issue of fact regarding its claim of an exception from prescription,but failed to do so.mere allegation or innuendo is insufficient to establish an exception to prescription under louisiana law.given the summary judgment record which,when viewed in a light most favorable to the school board,evidences only certainty that it had knowledge of both erosion damage and its causation in section at least four years prior to the filing suit,we affirm the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiff tort claims as prescribed.
contractual damages ex contractu 
an action on a contract is governed by the prescriptive period of ten years for personal actions.ann.art.west roger dufrene,so d.the school board argument on appeal is essentially that mobil failure to maintain the banks of the canal constitute breach of contract making it liable for the erosion damages due to scouring and the influx of sea water into the marshland tract.the correct prescriptive period to be applied in any action depends on the nature of the action it is the duty breached that should determine whether an action is in tort or contract.roger,supra.the classical distinction between contractual and delictual damages is that the former flow from an obligation contractually assumed by the obligor,whereas the latter flow from a violation of general duty owed by all persons davis le blanc,so d.cir kelly city of leesville,cir.however,even when a tortfeasor and victim are bound by a contract,louisiana courts usually apply delictual prescription to actions that are really grounded in tort 
where a claim for breach of contract exists,plaintiff is entitled to plead his case for damages ex contractu and assert the statute of limitations applicable to actions for breach of contract.however,in order for the statute of limitations applicable to actions for breach of contract to apply,plaintiff has the burden to prove that the defendant breached some contractual duty above and beyond a general duty not to damage another property.certain underwriters at lloyd,so d.cir.
the school board contends that generalized knowledge of erosion damage regarding section lands was insufficient to trigger louisiana civil code article liberative prescription period applicable to its contractual claims.however,the summary judgment record is devoid of any evidence of a contract between the school board and mobil,or of any assignment of interest or lease of the subject tract to mobil.indeed,there is an utter absence of proof that the parties in this case are juridical acquaintances.
we are free to affirm the dismissal based on any rationale presented to the district court for consideration and supported by facts uncontroverted in the summary judgment record.see in re williams,cir grenier medical engineering,cir.mobil contends,as it did in its motion for summary judgment filed with the district court,that in the absence of contractual privity the school board breach of contract claims against it must fail.because of the complete failure of proof with respect to a contract or contract provision setting forth an obligation enforceable against mobil,we agree.
although mobil cut the accessory canal and conducted drilling operations on the subject tract solely pursuant to a farmout agreement with sng the school board original mineral lessee,the school board sued mobil directly.a farmout agreement is an executory contract,and until it is fully performed and an assignment of interest actually executed,there is no privity between the lessor and the.see chevron,aguillard,robinson north american royalties,so d.cir because a agreement is an executory contract with a suspensive condition,no privity exists even between the lessor and the assignee of the lessee under a agreement until the obligations are fully performed and the assignment actually executed.
to assert a cause of action for breach of contract,the school board must prove both the existence of a contract and privity.evidence of a agreement is proof of neither.the district court in chevron,aguillard explained that 
agreements are frequently utilized in the petroleum industry in instances where the owner of a mineral lease is unable or unwilling to drill on a lease which is nearing expiration but is willing to assign an interest to another who will assume the drilling
