opinion of the court 
this case involves principally the interpretation of a construction subcontract.a dispute arose when a general contractor,shoemaker construction company shoemaker,failed to pay a subcontractor,sloan company sloan,the remaining balance on its subcontract.the appellant in this case,liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual,is the surety on the subcontract and the party sloan has sued for payment on the surety bond.sloan with respect to one aspect of its claim.for the reasons that follow,we reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion as to liberty mutual appeal,and affirm the ruling on sloan.
background 
isla of capri associates lp ioc owned and developed waterfront condominiums in philadelphia.shoemaker contracted with ioc to build the project the prime contract.shoemaker then lined up various subcontractors that included sloan,who agreed to perform drywall and carpentry work on the project the subcontract.payment for the subcontractors work was insured by a surety bond issued by liberty mutual.at the project completion,ioc refused to pay shoemaker nearly million owed under the prime contract.of that amount,million was due the subcontractors.ioc claimed it was withholding money for several reasons,one of which was that some of the subcontractors work was untimely and deficient shoemaker then refused to pay sloan the full amount of the remaining balance sloan claimed was due under their subcontract.
in may,shoemaker sued ioc to recover the balance on the prime contract.sloan then made a claim against liberty mutual for payment on the surety bond.five weeks later,liberty mutual denied the claim in its entirety,reserving all rights and defenses.as a ground for denying any payment obligation to sloan,liberty mutual asserted that one of the subcontract terms,found in paragraph.f,conditioned sloan right to payment on shoemaker receipt of payment from ioc.relying on that interpretation of the subcontract,liberty mutual claimed that sloan was not entitled to payment from shoemaker because ioc had not paid shoemaker.
in december,sloan filed a complaint against liberty mutual in the district court.sloan moved for summary judgment in the amount of,plus interest and taxable costs.liberty mutual for summary judgment.it argued that even if sloan were entitled to payment,the amount at most was because of various offsets.sloan claim,and liberty mutual alleged offsets,broke down as follows 
meanwhile,shoemaker lawsuit against ioc hit a dead end.shoemaker learned that ioc financial situation made it unable to satisfy a judgment for the entire claim even if one were awarded to shoemaker.it entered into a settlement agreement with ioc for million,apparently all that ioc was able to pay shoemaker offered its subcontractors their pro rata share of amounts owed in exchange for a release of claims,but sloan did not agree to that arrangement and continued to press its suit against liberty mutual 
in august,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of sloan for the first judgment.it rejected liberty mutual interpretation of the subcontract as conditioning sloan right to payment on ioc payment to shoemaker.the court allowed the parties to conduct additional discovery as to whether sloan was entitled to any additional amounts.
after discovery,the parties again moved for summary judgment.the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of sloan on the issue of legal fees and deficiencies,and awarded prejudgment interest on that amount as well as on the previous sum awarded,for an additional sum aggregating the second judgment 
in lieu of trial on the remaining amounts,the parties stipulated to the entry of a third and final judgment in favor of sloan on february,the final judgment.included within the final judgment were sums set forth in the first judgment,the second judgment,and the additional amount of,plus prejudgment interest of the combined amounts in the final judgment excluding interest were less than sloan initial claim of.
the parties agreed to preserve their rights to appeal all three of the district court judgments,and liberty mutual does so,challenging the district court interpretation of the subcontract.it argues that shoemaker obligation to pay sloan was conditioned on its receipt of payment from ioc,or,put another way,sloan was entitled to be paid only whatever amount shoemaker received from ioc for sloan work.liberty mutual also contests the district court determination on litigation costs.it argues it is entitled to deduct sloan share of the legal fees stemming from shoemaker suit against ioc.in addition,sloan the shortfall from its initial claim.it argues that liberty mutual waived the right to claim offsets by failing to state their bases within days of sloan initial claim

a.the contract 
the crux of the dispute is paragraph.f of the subcontract,which deals with final payment.thus,to resolve the dispute,we begin by considering in detail the language and structure of that provision.
it contains two subparagraphs.the first provides in relevant part final payment shall be made within thirty days after the last of the following to occur,the occurrence of all of which shall be conditions precedent to such final payment that subparagraph then lists those conditions precedent seven in all,one of which condition three is that ioc shall have accepted the work and made final payment thereunder to shoemaker emphasis added.another condition six is that shoemaker shall have received final payment from ioc for sloan work emphasis added.
liberty mutual argues that these conditions constitute a clause.in construction contract parlance,this means that a subcontractor gets paid by the general contractor only if the owner pays the general contractor for that subcontractor work.pennsylvania courts follow suit,and construe clauses that condition payment to the subcontractor on the general contractor receipt of payment from the owner as clauses see,eichenlaub,fidelity deposit,cumberland bridge lastooka,washington.
sloan,on the other hand,argues that the first subparagraph of.f does not establish a condition precedent to sloan payment,but rather is a clause.on the surface,these terms seem much the same save,perhaps,that paying if paid does not tell us when that payment is due.but in industry jargon,they are different.in contrast to a clause,a clause does not establish a condition precedent,but merely creates a timing mechanism for the general contractor payment to the subcontractor.see,united plate glass.div.of chromalloy am.metal trims.
to support its interpretation,sloan points to the second subparagraph of.f,which describes a process by which it may sue shoemaker for final payment in the event that ioc fails to make final payment to shoemaker.the language of that subparagraph states 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph.f,if within six months of the date that final payment is due to shoemaker by ioc,sloan has not received final payment for its work,sloan may pursue its claim against shoemaker and its surety liberty mutual for final payment as follows 
if within six months of the date that final payment is due and payable to shoemaker,shoemaker commences a legal proceedings against ioc the contractor dispute resolution to resolve its own claim for final payment,sloan agrees not to pursue its claim against shoemaker or liberty mutual until the contractor dispute resolution and all appeals thereto are completed and become final 
upon completion of the contractor dispute resolution,sloan may pursue any remaining claim for final payment it may have against shoemaker or its surety.
notably,that subparagraph concludes by stating that 
n othing in paragraph.f is intended to modify the provisions of paragraph,which deals with dispute resolution,under the subcontract.
we consider each subparagraph in turn and their combined effect on the meaning of the contract.
pennsylvania follows the plain meaning rule of contract interpretation,such that w hen a written contract is clear and unequivocal,its meaning must be determined by its contents alone.it speaks for itself and a meaning can not be given to it other than that expressed.steuart mcchesney,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,the cases recognize that express language of condition is sufficient to establish a condition precedent.in eichenlaub,for example,the pennsylvania superior court viewed as a condition precedent to payment a clause that stated the builder shall be under no obligation to make any payments to contractor for materials delivered or for work performed by contractor unless and until builder is first paid for such materials and work by the owner.at see also cumberland bridge.at same.when certainty is lacking,however,pennsylvania courts tend to interpret payment provisions as clauses.see,united plate glass,at.
but that is not our case.the first subparagraph of.f states unequivocally that ioc payment to shoemaker is a condition precedent to shoemaker obligation to pay sloan.we do not imagine that the parties intended otherwise merely because they did not use additional language to underscore their intent to create a clause,as sloan argues.to mandate redundant provisions conjures the consequence that only repetition makes a provision.moreover,we agree that courts should not interpret contracts in a way that render s at least one clause superfluous or meaningless.garza marine transp.lines,inc,cir.thus,we are satisfied that the parties chosen language is sufficient to create a clause in the first subparagraph of.
the opposite conclusion would lead to bizarre results.if sloan failed to complete its work,per condition one,could it then argue that it was still entitled to final payment under the subcontract we can see no principled reason to treat differently conditions three and six no payment to sloan until shoemaker has received final payment from ioc.that seven conditions were enumerated in this provision,and expressly delineated conditions precedents,weigh in favor of a construction.in the face of this plain language,we shall not infer a contrary intent 
however,that is not the end of the story.the parties created an override provision in the second subparagraph of.f that modifies the clause of the first subparagraph.specifically,the language of the second subparagraph,noted above,demonstrates that the contracting parties intended sloan to have a claim against shoemaker for any remaining final payment in certain instancesspecifically,in the event that ioc failed to make final payment defined as the entire unpaid balance on the prime contract within six months.
a modification of a condition is a not uncommon practice in the construction industry.see the construction contracts book daniel brennan et,ed.there are several ways to modify clauses.particularly i n states that distinguish between the two,and provisions,an obvious way to modify a clause is to convert it to a clause.this is accomplished by eliminating the condition precedent after a contractually stated period of time.id.at.though we do not know for certain,we can imagine several reasons why the parties here both sophisticated players might have contracted for such a modification.for one,pragmatic contractor s understand subcontractors reluctance to agree to an absolute clause and are thus sometimes amenable to some form of modification or softening of the condition precedent.see id.at.alternatively,shoemaker may have anticipated that sloan would sue for payment if ioc defaulted,notwithstanding the clause.the second part of paragraph.f is a way to control the timing and extent of sloan legal action in that scenario.
in any event,the condition,as modified,yields after six months of ioc and is replaced with a timing mechanism that specifies when and for how much sloan may sue shoemaker.specifically,that timing mechanism allows sloan to pursue any remaining claim for final payment.it requires sloan to wait to pursue its claim until shoemaker has had an opportunity to recover what it can from ioc.accordingly,because ioc has failed to pay for over six months and shoemaker suit against ioc for payment has concluded,sloan is entitled to pursue any remaining claim for final payment.
that conclusion leads to another issue how to define any remaining claim for final payment.the structure of paragraph.f demonstrates that the parties did not intend for sloan remaining claim for final payment to equal the entire unpaid balance on the subcontract.such a construction would essentially nullify the first subparagraph whether ioc made,and shoemaker received,final payment on the prime contract would be irrelevant if,in cases of ioc,sloan was always entitled to the entire unpaid balance on the subcontract.
to understand what the parties intended by the phrase remaining claim for final payment,we must read paragraph.f in connection with paragraph,for,as noted,the former is subject to the latter.paragraph provisions on dispute resolution reads in relevant part 
in the event sloan asserts a claim for payment of the subcontract sum or a portion thereof and in the event that shoemaker in its sole,exclusive and arbitrary discretion submits said claim to ioc for a decision or determination,then all decisions and determinations made by ioc or its representative shall be binding upon sloan even though sloan may not be a party thereto.
the decision or determination of ioc or its representative making the first original decision shall be final and conclusive on sloan except to the extent that shoemaker may in its sole,exclusive and arbitrary discretion appeal to other representatives of ioc or commence a proceeding in court or arbitration or other dispute resolution forum 
then,in such event,sloan agrees to be bound to shoemaker to the same extent shoemaker is bound to ioc by any final decisions of said other representative of ioc or of a court of competent jurisdiction or by any final or interim award issued in arbitration or by any final decisions issued in any other dispute resolution forum 
this provision,also common in construction contracts,provides a procedural mechanism for claims a process by which a general contractor may assert the claims of its subcontractors against an owner.this mechanism is known as a liquidating agreement.see shoemaker const,d,acknowledging as a liquidating agreement language that mirrors that in our case,namely,that the subcontractor agrees to be bound to the contractor to the same extent the contractor is bound to the owner by any final decisions of owner representative or of a court of competent jurisdiction,whether or not subcontractor is a party to such proceedings alterations in original.one reason for including this mechanism in subcontracts is to give the subcontractor some means of redress against the owner in situations where it would otherwise have none because it lacks privity of contract with the owner.thomas kelleher,brian corgan william dorris,construction disputes practice guide with forms ed.
sloan argues that paragraph does not apply to this case because its only purpose is to resolve disputes between the subcontractor and the general contractor over whether a particular payment is owed and was not intended to resolve disputes over final payment.we disagree.
sloan narrow interpretation of paragraph is unlikely.it seems strange that sloan would have negotiated for a liquidating provision that is limited in the way it suggests,as it would be of little worth to sloan without the ability to press a claim for final payment through shoemaker against ioc,sloan would have no other remedy against ioc in situations of ioc default.moreover,the language of paragraph.f belies sloan limited interpretation of paragraph.the former provision is explicit that if shoemaker pursues its own claim for final payment,that claim may or may not include claims of the subcontractor.
