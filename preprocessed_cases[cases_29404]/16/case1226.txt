lord taylor,llc,operates a retail department store along rockville pike in montgomery county,maryland.from to,the store was part of the white flint shopping center,an enclosed shopping mall the mall.but in,the mall operator,white flint,closed the mall and began demolition in order to make way for a redevelopment.lord taylor sued white flint,claiming that white flint had breached the parties contract by closing the mall without lord taylor consent.
a jury found white flint in breach of contract and awarded lord taylor million in damages.both parties appeal,arguing primarily that the damages award is too high white flint or too low lord taylor.because we find no error in the district court capable management of a lengthy trial,we affirm.
this is the latest chapter in a dispute between the parties over the planned redevelopment of the mall site.the montgomery county council approved the redevelopment in,as part of a broader plan to revitalize the surrounding area,and litigation commenced soon thereafter.we have decided one appeal already in this case,see lord taylor,llc white flint,cir.white flint i,and the details of the parties original agreement and the county zoning process are set out in that opinion.
we recap only briefly here.in,white flint,then planning the development of what would become the mall,reached an agreement with lord taylor lord taylor would lease land on the mall site and serve as an anchor tenant for the mall,along with bloomingdale.and in exchange,white flint would construct an enclosed first class mall and then maintain it until at least.the parties agreement required white flint to secure lord taylor consent before building any additional structures or making alterations to the mall design or appearance.
the mall opened in and operated successfully for many years,before more recently experiencing a drop in business.the parties,not surprisingly,disagree about the cause of this decline.according to white flint,the mall struggles reflect the weakening of the mall business generally,as consumer preferences change and grows for lord taylor,the blame goes to white flint,for allowing the mall to fail and even hastening its demise by offering tenant,all to facilitate the redevelopment plan.whatever the cause,in,bloomingdale chose not to renew its lease,and by,the vast majority of tenants had left the mall.
the mall officially closed in january,leaving lord taylor the sole business operating on the premises.by then,white flint already had demolished the bloomingdale building,with further construction to come.ultimately,the redevelopment plan calls for transforming what once was an enclosed mall into a development,complete with residential,retail,recreational and office space.
lord taylor objected to the redevelopment,arguing that the clear terms of the parties agreement required white flint to maintain the mall,and that the proposed alternative would negatively affect its business by making customer access less convenient and denying the store the benefit of foot traffic from mall customers.negotiations between the parties proved fruitless,and lord taylor filed its first complaint against white flint in july.
in that original complaint,what lord taylor sought was not damages but an injunction,prohibiting white flint from carrying out the proposed redevelopment and requiring it instead to continue operation of the mall.the district court denied the requested relief.assuming that white flint had breached its contractual obligations,the district court reasoned,lord taylor would be entitled to monetary damages for any harm that resulted.but injunctive relief,the district court concluded,would be infeasible under the circumstances,requiring the kind of ongoing judicial supervision of a major and complex commercial undertaking that is outside court competence.in our previous encounter with this case,we affirmed the denial of injunctive relief as well within the discretion of the district court.see white flint i,at.
so lord taylor amended its complaint to bring the alternative claim hypothesized by the district court one for damages resulting from white flint alleged breach of contract.and for good measure,lord taylor added a claim for fraud,as well.according to lord taylor,white flint breach and fraud had cost it somewhere between and million.specifically,lord taylor sought damages for lost profits during the construction phase of the redevelopment for the costs of redesigning and reconstructing its store to conform to the new development and for the loss of property rights,in the form of use restrictions and easements violated by the planned redevelopment.
not all of lord taylor claims survived to trial.lord taylor fraud claim,for instance,alleged that the store had been misled about white flint plans by a letter in which white flint assured lord taylor that it did not inten d to take any action or undertake any changes at the m all in violation of the contract.the district court granted summary judgment to white flint,deeming the fraud claim utterly meritless,in part because white flint statement of intent was not false,and in part because there was no evidence that lord taylor,a large operation with the most sophisticated people running it,had relied on or been deceived by the statement.
the district court also rejected one of lord taylor three damages theories,under which lord taylor sought to recover for lost property rights as well as lost profits.specifically,the court granted white flint motion to exclude lord taylor proposed expert testimony on the value of its easements and use restrictions under the contract,explaining that the expert data was unreliable and,in any event,that the proper measure of damages for the deprivation of such property rights is lost profits alone.
the remainder of lord taylor case went to trial,where a jury heard evidence and argument for twelve days.on the merits of its breach claim,lord taylor argued that the proposed redevelopment was a clear violation of its contract with white flint,and that white flint had hastened the mall decline in order to reap the rewards of redevelopment.in response,white flint argued that any breach of contract should be excused by reason of impossibility.according to white flint,economic trends combined with the departure of bloomingdale made continued operation of the mall impossible,and its substitute redevelopment would be an overall economic boon to the area.
much of the trial,however,focused on the question of damages,with lord taylor presenting two distinct theories under which it sought recovery.first,lord taylor claimed damages for lost profits during the demolition and construction phase of the project,when customer access would be disrupted and the store would lose the benefit of foot traffic in the area.lord taylor expert calculated lost profits of up to million,on the assumption that the construction phase would last for between ten and thirteen years,starting with the alleged breach in.
white flint took issue with lord taylor calculations,and presented expert testimony of its own projecting a construction period of only three and a half years and estimating damages using a significantly lower profit margin than that employed by lord taylor expert.white flint also insisted that any damages award should reflect not only lower profits during construction,but also the greater profits that would accrue to lord taylor in subsequent years,once construction was complete and the store became part of a successful development.the district court disagreed,holding that any such future benefits were too speculative to be the basis of a damages award,and instructing the jury to that effect.
lord taylor second damages theory centered around the costs of reconfiguring its store to take account of the fact that it no longer would be part of an enclosed mall.lord taylor presented testimony from kerry mader,a store executive responsible for renovations,who explained the extensive redesign that would be required to accommodate the shift from a mall store to a store,and calculated construction costs of between and million.white flint did not present evidence of its own regarding construction costs or argue for a different cost estimate.but it did object to the admission of mader testimony,arguing that mader was offering expert opinion without having been qualified as an expert under rule of the federal rules of evidence.the district court rejected that argument,concluding that mader was offering lay rather than expert testimony,based on mader own previous experience and work with the company,and that any shortcomings in his cost estimate should be addressed by spirited of the witness.
after several days of jury deliberation and an agreement by the parties to accept a verdict,the jury found white flint in breach of contract,rejected white flint defenses,and awarded lord taylor million in damages.the million figure is consistent with both lord taylor estimate of lost profits up to million and its estimate of construction costs between and million,and the jury general verdict form did not specify the theory on which damages were awarded.
both parties timely appealed.
district courts have broad discretion to manage jury trials.accordingly,we review a district court jury instructions,evidentiary rulings,and discovery rulings for abuse of discretion only.see joiner,evidentiary rulings coll.loan slm,a delaware,cir.jury instructions lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of virginia,cir.discovery rulings.
we begin with white flint appeal.white flint does not challenge the jury finding that it breached its contract with lord taylor.instead,it challenges the million damages award,raising two arguments,each aimed at one of lord taylor theories of recovery.with respect to lost profits,white flint argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury not to consider,in calculating damages,the redevelopment potential positive impact on lord taylor profits.and with respect to renovation costs,white flint argues that mader construction cost estimate was improperly admitted as lay opinion testimony.for the reasons given below,we find neither argument persuasive.
in response to lord taylor expert testimony on lost profits,white flint presented its own expert,scott decain,to testify to the future benefits of the redevelopment project for lord taylor bottom line.decain acknowledged that lord taylor sales would decline during the construction period,which he estimated at three and a half years.but according to decain,once construction on the redevelopment was complete,lord taylor net profits would increase in the amount of million over five years as a result of the infinitely superior new site plan,replacing an outdated enclosed mall with a more desirable complex.and so,white flint argued,any damages award based on lost profits should include an offset or deduction to account for these future economic benefits.
the district court disagreed.under maryland law,the district court explained in an oral ruling,damages must be proved with reasonable certainty.and white flint evidence of future benefit to lord taylor,the court concluded,was entirely too speculative to meet that standard.neither the timing of the redevelopment nor its ultimate success,the court held,was established with the requisite level of certainty.see,we do know what delays the development is going to endure.id.at we do know whether this will be the rage of montgomery county or the beached whale of montgomery county.accordingly,while the court allowed white flint to argue the predicted economic upside of its redevelopment plan as a defense to lord taylor breach claim,it instructed the jury not to consider the potentially positive economic effects of the planned redevelopment in assessing damages for lost profits.
we find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination.as the parties agree,this case is governed by maryland law.see white flint i,at.and under maryland law,it is clear that damages related to lost profits may not be recovered unless they can be proved with reasonable certainty.atkinson warehousing distribution,ecolab,supp,citing impala platinum impala sales.complete certainty is not required,and reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence.see m r contractors builders michael.but anticipated profits must be shown with reasonable certainty so that the evidence rises above speculation or conjecture.john copanos sons mcdade rigging steel erection.spec.app.
the district court properly applied that standard and concluded that on the record before it,white flint could not establish to a reasonable certainty whether and to what extent lord taylor would benefit from the redevelopment we have no basis for disturbing that judgment.as the district court observed,the evidence made clear that the redevelopment remained a work in progress we have no idea exactly where the buildings are going to be,how many there are going to be.we do know what delays the development is going to endure i do know whether it going to lease up overnight.on,decain himself acknowledged that he did not know,for instance,when construction on various phases of the project would start or end,who might join the project as anchor tenants,or what other retail tenants might participate.
none of this,to be clear,is to fault decain or his work.a real estate development of the scale contemplated here is an inherently risky endeavor,extending years into the future and marked by significant uncertainty.any prediction of the degree of success,no matter how sophisticated,necessarily will rest on assumptions about a long list of contingencies.at bottom,deciding when anticipated future profits from such an enterprise have been established as reasonably certain is a judgment call,within the sound discretion of a trial court.the district court did not abuse that discretion here 
lord taylor separately claimed damages for the cost of reconfiguring and renovating its store to accommodate the new site plan and,in particular,the loss of several entrances that had connected it to the original mall.to support this second theory of damages,lord taylor offered the testimony of kerry mader,an executive of lord taylor parent company responsible for store design,store construction,and facilities,who opined that construction costs would fall between and million.white flint objected,arguing that mader proposed testimony was expert in nature and that mader had not been qualified as an expert under federal rule of evidence.
the district court rejected that claim and allowed mader to testify as a lay opinion witness under federal rule of evidence.the court recognized that rule reliability requirements may not be circumvented by allowing unqualified expert testimony in the guise of lay testimony.and the court understood that there may be a fine line between rule lay opinion and rule expert testimony.in this case,however,the district court concluded that because mader testimony was based on mader own experience his work as an officer of lord taylor it was admissible as lay testimony,without the necessity of qualifying mader as an expert.
again,we have no basis for disturbing the district court judgment.it is true,as white flint argues,that mader was not qualified as an expert under federal rule of evidence,which governs testimony by expert witnesses that is based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge.but federal rule of evidence permits a lay witness with no need for expert qualification to give opinion testimony that is rationally based on the witness perception and helpful to determining a fact in issue,so long as it is not based on the same scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge covered by rule.and while the line between the two,as the district court recognized,can be a fine one,see united states perkins,cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,the key to rule lay opinion testimony is that it must arise from the personal knowledge or firsthand perception of the witness.see id.at mci telecommunications wanzer,cir.allowing lay opinion testimony under rule where it is well founded on personal knowledge as distinguished from hypothetical facts and based on relevant historical or narrative facts that the witness has perceived internal quotation marks omitted.
