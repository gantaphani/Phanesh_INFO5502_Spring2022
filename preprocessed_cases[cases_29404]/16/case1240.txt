at the center of this lease and contract dispute is a skilled nursing facility located in weber city,virginia.elderberry leased the facility to living centers in november for a year term.initially,living centers was not permitted to assign the lease without prior written permission from elderberry.however,in,the lease was amended to allow living centers to assign the lease to fmsc or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates without prior approval from elderberry so long as living centers first obtained a guaranty from mariner in accordance with the amendment,the lease reset for a new year term commencing at the completion of certain construction and improvements to the facility,and thus a new lease expiration date was set for april.the required guaranty was attached as exhibit e to the lease amendment,and was signed by then executive vice president and chief financial officer of mariner,boyd gentry.
on january,living centers assigned the lease to fmsc.fmsc,in turn,reassigned it to continium in november in the midst of the assignments and amendments,the facility was subject to numerous problems,including being listed as a special focus facility,nonpayment of utility vendors,and interruptions of gas and phone service.
continium ceased making rent payments after march.although elderberry and continium thereafter attempted to negotiate rent reductions,continium indicated in may that it was no longer able to make rent payments.elderberry attempts to locate a new tenant were initially unsuccessful because of,among other problems,the facility placement on the special focus facility list.
eventually,elderberry hired med com,llc to locate a new tenant,conduct lease negotiations,and provide asset management services.the two entities signed an august,asset management agreement,under which elderberry agreed to pay a signing fee for securing a new tenant,a value fee on june,so long as the new tenant was not then in default under the new lease,and a monthly management fee of of the new tenant rent payable.
subsequent to signing the asset management agreement,on august,elderberry sent living centers,continium,mariner,and their attorneys at the bernstein law firm a letter demanding immediate payment of past due rent.the letter indicated that if the payments were not made,elderberry would be entitled to proceed with pursuit of its remedies under the lease,including,but not limited to,seeking damages in court,termination of the lease,taking possession of the property.the requested past due rent payments were not made.rather,on august,continium discharged the remaining residents and abandoned the facility.
on august,elderberry mailed the appellants a letter bearing the subject line,lease termination notice.the letter stated this letter shall serve as notice that the lease is hereby terminated,effective midnight est on august.elderberry reserves all rights and remedies related to tenant default whether under the lease,at law or in equity.
elderberry rehabilitated the nursing facility with help and eventually entered into a new lease with nova healthcare group,llc nova for a new year term beginning january.during the course of lease negotiations,nova secured from elderberry a renovation budget and working capital totaling million.
one week after elderberry sent the termination letter to the appellants,mariner filed suit against elderberry in the northern district of georgia,seeking a declaration that the guaranty was unenforceable.thereafter,elderberry filed a breach of lease and breach of contract action against the appellants in the western district of virginia.elderberry sought damages for accrued and future rent,as well as costs,fees and expenses incurred by elderberry to preserve and rehabilitate the property fees and expenses incurred by elderberry in hiring to locate a replacement tenant sums expended by elderberry to pay utilities,insurance premiums,and real property taxes and attorney fees and expenses.this consolidated civil action followed.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on elderberry breach of lease and breach of contract claims,and on mariner claim that the guaranty issued in connection with the lease assignments to fmsc and continium was void under the georgia statute of frauds.although the district court denied both summary judgment motions,it held that the guaranty was valid.after the subsequent bench trial,the district court ruled in favor of elderberry on all claims,and concluded that elderberry is entitled to damages in the amount of,plus pre and interest at the rate of.the damages award includes 
unpaid rent for the period from april through august unpaid rent from the period september though february a rent shortfall from march though april unpaid taxes,utilities,and insurance premiums for the period from august through february maintenance fees paid during that same period payments for architectural and construction services to bring the facility up to the fire code standards required by the fire marshal payments to nova for renovations and working capital the signing fee to and the value fee to.

the appellants make three arguments.first,they argue that the district court erred in awarding damages that accrued after elderberry terminated the lease second,they contend that virginia law precludes awards for speculative damages,and thus the district court inclusion of the value fee in the damage award was erroneous.finally,the appellants challenge the district court legal conclusion that the guaranty satisfies the georgia statute of frauds.
the lease states,and the parties agree,that it is governed by virginia law.we thus look to virginia law to construe the lease.in doing so,we consider two broad categories of damages flowing from the lease rent,and damages.
we first address what portion of accrued or future rent elderberry is entitled to receive as part of its damages award.this circuit has previously observed that 
when a tenant abandons leased property during the term,the supreme court of appeals of virginia has held that the landlord is permitted,at his option,either to refuse to accept the tenant surrender,do nothing and sue for accrued rents,or to the premises and accept the tenant surrender,thereby terminating the lease and releasing the tenant from further liability on the lease.
tenbraak waffle shops,cir footnote omitted citing crowder virginian bank of commerce.in other words,when a tenant abandons a lease,a landlord may sue for rent due on the balance of the lease term only if the landlord does not terminate the lease.see crowder,at.the choice belongs to the landlord.crowder,at the landlord is under no obligation to resume possession of the premises which ha ve been wrongfully abandoned,and ha s the right to refuse such possession and to hold the tenant liable under the contract.
although virginia law thus does not provide for recovery of future damages for the lessor losses arising from the abandonment of a contract of lease,the parties are not barred from providing for such a recovery through forfeiture provisions in the lease.tenbraak,at.any such provisions must be strictly construed.id.at.as the virginia supreme court has stated,t he prevailing rule is that parties to a contract may provide the remedy that will be available to them in case a breach occurs so long as the remedy provided is not contrary to the law or against public policy.bender miller thomwood farms.and the remedy provided will be exclusive of other possible remedies only where the language employed in the contract clearly shows an intent that the remedy be exclusive.id.additionally,the intent of the parties as expressed in their contract controls,and i t is the court responsibility to determine the intent of the parties from the language they employ.id.at.
here,the relevant provision of the lease,reads as follows 
rights in default.
the remedies of the lessor for any default by the lessee shall include the following 
a upon any default by the lessee and at any time thereafter,the lessor may give written notice to the lessee that the lessor elects to terminate this lease upon a specific date not less than thirty days after mailing of such notice.this lease shall then be terminated on the date so specified.
a upon an uncured default by the lessee,and notice from the lessor,the lessor may reenter the and resume possession of the property.the lessor,at the lessor option,may remove persons and property from the property and may store the property in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the expense or for the account of the lessee without liability for any damage on such removal.the lessor reentry shall not be deemed either an acceptance or a surrender of this lease or a termination thereof.it is expressly understood and agreed that in the event of the reentry by the lessor by reason of a default of the lessee,the lessee shall nevertheless remain liable for the rent and also for the taxes and insurance premiums payable by the lessee as provided in this lease,for the balance of the term herein originally demised.
d the rights given to the lessor herein are in addition to any rights which may be given to the lessor by statute or otherwise.
elderberry urges us to conclude that its rights under the above provision are cumulative and that it thus had the right to simultaneously reenter and relet the facility,and terminate the lease and seek from the appellants rent due for the balance of the term.to be sure,the above excerpt provides that elderberry rights in the event of a default shall include the following.id.there is no language suggesting that elderberry must choose either to terminate the lease as provided by a,or to reenter the premises and hold the tenant liable for future rent and other fees as provided by b.nor are the various subparagraphs under lease separated by the disjunctive word or.
that said,elderberry reading of the lease is not convincing.first,remedy provisions providing for future rent must be strictly construed.tenbraak,at.and in construing remedy provisions,courts must have due regard for the rule that the lease must be construed most strongly against the lessor.lumber extract mchenry lumber.here,of the lease does not affirmatively state that the remedial provisions are cumulative.rather,b explicitly provides the lessor reentry shall not be deemed a termination of the lease.j.emphasis supplied.and it is only under b,in the event of the reentry,that the lessee remains liable for future rent and fees.this language puts a and b in tension with one another.whereas a explicitly terminates the lease contract,b explicitly leaves the terms of the lease contract and the possibility of receiving future rent and fees in place.it does not make sense to allow simultaneously the termination of the lease and continued application of the lease.the better reading,and the one we adopt here,is that upon exercising its right to terminate the lease,elderberry extinguished any right that it had to future rent.
elderberry argues that we should follow the virginia rule that a remedy provided for breach of a contract will be exclusive of other possible remedies only where the language employed in the contract clearly shows an intent that the remedy be exclusive.bender miller,at.in advancing its argument,elderberry focuses on whether the remedies provided within the lease are exclusive of one another.bender miller,by contrast,focuses on whether the remedies provided in a contract are exclusive of remedies.in that case,the virginia supreme court addressed whether the parties intended by virtue of a certain contract provision that the remedy provided therein be exclusive of other remedies allowed by law.id.at emphasis added see also.dynamics payne,observing that even if a lessor could contract away a statutory right,the lessor statutorily created right would have to be expressly waived atlas mach.iron works,bethlehem steel,cir permitting bankruptcy as a remedy to a breach of contract where the contract did not explicitly state that the remedy stated therein was exclusive.our reading of virginia case law suggests that there is a presumption against excluding statutory or legal rights absent a clear waiver of such rights,and our construction of the lease here comports with that presumption.although our reading of the lease proscribes the collection of future rent and other fees in the event of termination,it does not proscribe the pursuit of any rights that elderberry might have outside of those provided in the lease itself.indeed,as quoted above,d provides that t he rights given to the lessor herein are in addition to any rights which may be given to the lessor by statute or otherwise.
in light of the foregoing,we hold that elderberry lost its right to rent that accrued after it terminated the lease on august.elderberry is,however,entitled to any rent that accrued prior to termination of the lease.
we turn next to damages.a landlord may,as elderberry does here,seek compensation for a tenant failure to return a leased facility in the required condition.see,sharlin neighborhood theatre.and the supreme court of virginia long ago stated that when an action for breach of lease covenant is brought after the end of the term,the measure of damages is still held to be such a sum as will put the premises in the condition in which the tenant is bound to leave them.vaughan mayo milling,quoting watriss first bank of cambridge.t his is true even if the repairs have not been made by the landlord.sharlin,at citing vaughan,at.virginia rule is in line with the general rule that 
where a lease contains a provision or option giving the right or privilege of cancellation and the agreement is canceled in pursuance of the right or privilege thus given,such cancellation does not extinguish liabilities that have already accrued under the lease,regardless of whether the liability is that of the party who exercised the option to cancel the agreement or is the liability of the party against whom cancellation was made.such cancellation of the lease does,however,terminate liabilities to accrue in the future,such as rent,except where by express provision in the lease termination is not to affect the accrual of such liabilities.
d landlord and tenant emphasis added footnote omitted.accordingly,upon termination of a lease,a landlord is entitled to recover liabilities accrued up to the point of termination.
aside from rent payments,the lease here includes covenants requirin
