appellants eriline company and edgardo bakchellian seek relief from the dismissal of their state law claims,arising out of an alleged fraud scheme,against various defendants who were in default.they contend on appeal that the district court erred in raising a statute of limitations defense sua sponte and dismissing their state law claims on that basis.see eriline.johnson,no.as explained below,in the circumstances of this case the district court erred,and we vacate and remand.
on november,eriline entered into an investment agreement the investment agreement with universal marketing group,the investment agreement was signed by eriline president,bakchellian,as well as universal president,james johnson.under the agreement,eriline was to provide universal with the sum of that universal was to combine with other funds in order to lease million from capital assets holding corporation.the million was then to be used to purchase a prime bank guarantee or letter of credit which would generate enormous profits for eriline and others.prior to the agreement execution,eriline,on september,deposited the sum of into an escrow account controlled by brothers raymond moore and lee allen moore.eriline was to direct the release of those funds to universal upon confirmation by capital bank that it held million of capital money in universal name.approximately fifteen banking days thereafter,universal was to facilitate the first payment of profits to eriline in the sum of,with additional payments of to follow once a month for the next nine months,for a total of million.unfortunately for eriline,it never saw a dime of its expected profits or its original investment.
on september,eriline and bakchellian together,the plaintiffs filed their complaint the complaint in the western district of north carolina against universal,johnson,prime source trading,llc,steven cloudtree,michael koucky michael loucky,and the moore brothers the complaint alleged violations of b of the securities exchange act of against each of the seven defendants the federal securities claim.it also alleged various state law claims of breach of contract,negligence,breach of trust,fraud,rescission,and conversion against the defendants in various configurations the state claims.the state claims included a claim against johnson for breach of an agreement by which he allegedly promised to pay bakchellian million in exchange for a release from any liability to bakchellian and eriline the release agreement 
of the seven defendants,only the moores answered the complaint.on april,the plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of default against defendants universal,johnson,prime source,and cloudtree,and the court clerk entered the default that same day.on june,the plaintiffs filed two motions for default judgment one against johnson in the sum of million on the claim that johnson had breached the release agreement,and the other against johnson,universal,prime source,and cloudtree in the sum of on the federal securities claim as well as several of the state claims.the clerk entered both of the default judgments later that day.thereafter,in august,the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against koucky and the moores 
by order of october,the district court vacated both the default judgments entered by the clerk on june,in part because the plaintiffs had failed to support their requests by filing the investment agreement and the release agreement with either the complaint or their motions for default judgment.see eriline.johnson,no.on march,the plaintiffs filed a second set of motions for default judgment,seeking the same relief they had sought on june.this time,however,the plaintiffs supported their motions with several documents,including copies of the investment agreement and the release agreement.
by order of april,the district court,which then had the investment agreement before it for the first time,raised the defense of the statute of limitations sua sponte.it concluded that the federal securities claim was barred by the statute of limitations in e,and that the state claims were barred by the statute of limitations in section of the north carolina general statutes.in so ruling,the court expressed its view that the running of a limitations period is jurisdictional in nature and thus must be raised and considered by the court sua sponte when not affirmatively asserted by one of the parties.the court therefore denied the plaintiffs second set of motions for default judgment and dismissed the complaint in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the plaintiffs have timely noted their appeal.because the defendants had defaulted and were not represented by counsel,we proceeded to appoint,on july,an amicus counsel to support them in this appeal the amicus.
as explained below,the district court erroneously determined that the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction.nevertheless,there is some question whether the district court otherwise possessed such jurisdiction over the state claims.the plaintiffs invoked the court diversity jurisdiction under.at oral argument on november,however,it was observed that the parties might not be completely diverse.accordingly,by order of even date,we directed the plaintiffs and the amicus to file supplemental briefs addressing the question of subject matter jurisdiction.
as the plaintiffs and the amicus now agree,complete diversity is lacking in this case because there are aliens on both sides of the dispute each of the plaintiffs is an alien and so is defendant cloudtree.see tech.applications,exro ltda,cir a lien citizenship on both sides of the controversy destroys diversity.in order to remedy this jurisdictional deficiency,the plaintiffs now urge that we dismiss cloudtree,the alien defendant without whom complete diversity would exist.see appellant supp.br.at.as the plaintiffs correctly point out,we have the authority,under the supreme court decision in,to dismiss dispensable defendants who spoil diversity jurisdiction.see,d ruling that,in interests of judicial economy,a court of appeals has authority to dismiss a dispensable nondiverse party.nevertheless,the supreme court has instructed us to exercise such authority sparingly.id.moreover,in order to dismiss cloudtree from this case,we must first be satisfied that he is not an indispensable party under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see casas office machines,mita copystar,cir observing that appellate courts may not,of course,dismiss indispensable parties from an action in order to preserve federal jurisdiction.and the determination of whether a party is indispensable,because of its nature,is a matter normally committed to the discretion of the district court.see coastal modular laminators,cir the inquiry contemplated by rule is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.
in light of these principles,and because there was little factual development below,if diversity of citizenship were the sole basis of the district court jurisdiction,we would be tempted to conditionally remand this matter for its determination of whether cloudtree should be dismissed on the basis of being a dispensable defendant who spoils jurisdiction.such a remand,however,is unnecessary because,as the amicus correctly observes,the district court also possessed supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims,which was derived from its federal question jurisdiction over the federal securities claim.see,a 
pursuant to a,when a plaintiff has alleged both federal and state claims,a district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims if they form part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim.in this case,the plaintiffs state claims plainly arise from the same case or controversy as the federal securities claim,for both the securities claim and the state claims arise from the same set of facts the fraud scheme allegedly orchestrated by the defendants.see white county of newberry,cir observing that district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that the plaintiff would ordinarily be expected to try in one judici
