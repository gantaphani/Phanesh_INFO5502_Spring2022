the sole issue in this appeal is whether the district court improperly charged the jury and gave it an unduly narrow special interrogatory,thereby making improper findings,at least impliedly,on material fact issues in dispute.we see no genuine issue of material fact that was not given to the jury and no abuse of discretion in the jury charges or interrogatory.we discern no error by the district court and affirm.
defendant national digital television center ndtc agreed to pay plaintiff broadcast satellite international bsi per month as an assignment fee in consideration for the assignment of a lease of transponder on the galaxy vii satellite.ndtc leased the transponder from a third party,panamsat,via a lease assignment brokered by bsi.to avoid confusion resulting from multiple contracts called by the parties the galaxy vii agreement,we refer to the contract between bsi and ndtc as the fee agreement and the lease that bsi brokered as the satellite lease.
the term of the fee agreement was through december or,if earlier,the termination of the satellite lease.ndtc stopped paying the assignment fee in april,and bsi sued for breach of contract.in defense ndtc contended that the assignment fee was no longer due because the underlying satellite lease had terminated in december,thereby terminating the fee agreement as well.as counter claimant,ndtc sought reimbursement of the monthly assignment fees paid by it after december.in defense bsi contended that ndtc was estopped by its conduct from claiming termination or waived its right to a refund.after a jury trial,judgments were entered on both the main demand and the counterclaim.only bsi appeals,seeking a new trial with more favorable jury charges and interrogatories on its claim for breach of contract.
bsi appeal concerns sections and of the fee agreement.the term of the fee agreement was tied to termination of the satellite lease in the following provision 
term.the term of this fee agreement the term shall commence on the date first set forth above and shall continue until the earlier to occur of i december,or ii termination of the galaxy vii satellite lease agreement the foregoing notwithstanding,the term shall not cease if wtci lessee waives any rights it may have to terminate its rights under the galaxy vii satellite lease agreement and continues to lease a transponder under the galaxy vii satellite lease agreement.
because the lessee terminating the satellite lease,to which bsi was not a party,would terminate the fee agreement,the fee agreement also provided bsi the following protection 
covenant of lessee.during the term,lessee agrees that it will not enter into a voluntary agreement with hcg the satellite owner to terminate the galaxy vii satellite lease agreement or voluntarily default in lessee obligations under the galaxy vii satellite lease agreement for the sole purpose of avoiding its obligations under this fee agreement.
bsi argues that the district court erred in submitting an overly narrow interrogatory to the jury.the special interrogatory was did ndtc terminate the satellite lease for the sole reason of avoiding its obligation under the fee agreement bsi also contends that,by asking the reason ndtc terminated the satellite lease,the interrogatory impliedly found that the satellite lease of transponder had been terminated,when termination is fraught with factual disputes.bsi argues that the verdict form further assumed that ndtc had not waived its right to claim that there was such a issue that bsi considers to be for a jury.
bsi preserved its objection and requested predicate jury interrogatories,one asking whether termination occurred at all,one asking whether ndtc waived the right to claim that the satellite lease terminated,and one on intent of the parties.finally bsi submitted a broader form interrogatory,asking generally about breach of the payment obligation under the fee agreement.

b.the alleged fact issues on termination 
we agree with bsi that,by asking the jury about the sole reason that ndtc terminated the satellite lease,the jury interrogatory assumed that the satellite lease was terminated.the district court decisions of what to ask the jury and what not to were consistent with the court earlier ruling on cross motions for summary judgment.there the court had declared,based on the summary judgment proof presented by the parties,the court finds that the underlying satellite lease was terminated by panamstat and in late.it denied summary judgment to both parties,however,because the purpose of termination was genuinely at issue the summary judgment evidence presents a material question of fact regarding whether sole reason for terminating the underlying satellite lease was a financial decision designed to avoid paying bsi the assignment fee due under the galaxy vii fee agreement.submitting the interrogatory on the sole purpose of the termination and refusing the predicate question on termination were consistent with this summary judgment ruling.
the questions for this court then become whether the trial court validly found termination of the satellite lease as a matter of law and if so,whether the court submitted an appropriate interrogatory to assess how that termination of the satellite lease affected the fee agreement.
termination of the satellite lease.
ndtc and panamstat terminated the satellite lease by an agreement on december which declares as of january,the satellite lease agreement is fully,effectively and finally terminated,along with all associated rights and obligations of lessee and panamsat under the satellite lease agreement ex.the termination contract.bsi argues that the evidence nevertheless revealed fact issues whether the satellite lease had actually terminated.
bsi recites the circumstances around the termination of the satellite lease,focusing on a switch of leases on transponders and with ndtc discontinued use of transponder and continued use of transponder after the switch and termination bsi contends that the with continued use of transponder left a fact issue whether the satellite lease was terminated so as to cause termination of the fee agreement.
to the extent bsi is arguing that unresolved fact issues bear on whether the satellite lease itself terminated,the contention is meritless.under the undisputed facts,a termination occurred,as unambiguously set forth in the termination contract between the parties to the satellite lease.the fact of ndtc continued use of transponder under a new arrangement with panamsat does not invalidate that termination.we will not disturb the district court finding as a matter of law on summary judgment that the satellite lease terminated nor its refusal to submit the issue to the jury as a matter of fact 
effect of termination of the satellite lease on the fee agreement.
bsi next argument is that fact issues bear on,not whether the satellite lease itself terminated,but whether that termination of the satellite lease terminated the fee agreement.bsi offered as evidence that the parties did not intend such events to terminate the fee agreement a testimony that a panamsat representative had never heard of a satellite lease termination with continued use of the transponder and b an admission by one of ndtc representatives that losing a customer on a transponder was not a valid reason to stop paying the assignment fee.bsi argues that the fee agreement fails to clearly and unambiguously define what constitutes a termination,and that the question of contractual intent was a necessary predicate question for the jury.the district court denied bsi requested jury interrogatory asking whether the
