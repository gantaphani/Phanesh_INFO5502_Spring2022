opinion of the court 
as a result of the damage caused by hurricane marilyn,the virgin islands telephone company vitelco hired an independent contractor,raco,to repair phone lines in the virgin islands.chad gass,a raco employee,was repairing a phone cable and was seriously injured when a car drove over the cable he was holding.gass filed this negligence action against raco,vitelco,and the driver of the car.the primary issue in this appeal is whether an employee of an independent contractor may sue the hirer of the contractor under the direct liability theories set forth in sections and of chapter of the restatement second of torts app restatement.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendant vitelco because it found that an injured employee of an independent contractor has no cause of action in tort against the employer of the contractor under restatement sections and.the district court granted summary judgment to defendant raco because it held that raco was shielded from liability by the exclusivity provision of the virgin islands workmen compensation act wca.the district court denied summary judgment to defendant ann marie estes we will reverse the district court judgment with respect to vitelco and affirm with respect to raco.
in september of,hurricane marilyn struck the virgin islands,bringing down many vitelco telephone lines on the islands of thomas and john.in the following months,vitelco hired contractors to assist in repairing the damaged telephone lines.these contractors included raco,a construction firm based in north carolina.raco employed chad gass.vitelco also hired carnes,burkett,wiltsee associates,the engineering firm whose employee,phillip day,developed the blueprints and plans for the repair sites in the virgin islands.
on february,a raco supervisor directed a raco foreman,jack bryson,to take two linemen,lee fowler and gass,from thomas to john the next morning to repair telephone lines.bryson complained to the raco supervisor that three men were not sufficient to perform the job safely and that raco trucks lacked certain safety equipment,including road signs.the raco supervisor instructed bryson to proceed to john with the safety equipment to follow.bryson had been assured that safety equipment,additional workers,and a cellular phone which he had requested would be available in a few days.
the following morning,bryson,fowler,and gass traveled to john.bryson reported to day,who provided the work blueprint for the job of stringing an aerial slack span cable between telephone poles on opposite sides of a road.day also showed the men where to get most of the materials for the job and led them to the job site.after day left,the crew first framed a pole on the left side of the road,then parked the bucket truck in the right lane.the crew placed at least one of the bucket truck two traffic cones at one end of the truck,and turned on the truck flashing lights.they did not block traffic in the left lane,thus allowing vehicles from either direction to drive along one side of the truck.when the road was clear of traffic,bryson laid a cable in front of the bucket truck across the road surface from one telephone pole to another.bryson left some slack in the cable so that he could reach it from the bucket and motorists could drive over it safely.at approximately the same time,bryson sent fowler away from the work site to obtain the additional wire needed to complete the assignment.
bryson then got in the bucket and instructed gass to hand him the end of the cable when there were no vehicles approaching.after gass handed the cable to bryson,estes drove her car over the cable.the cable wrapped around the rear axle of her car.as she continued driving forward,not realizing what had just occurred,the cable jerked out of bryson hands,coiled around gass,and flung gass into the air and across the bucket truck.gass suffered serious injuries.
the workmen compensation insurance provided by raco covered gass medical expenses.in total,he recovered over in workmen compensation from raco insurer.on december,gass filed the complaint in this case,alleging that the negligent acts of estes,vitelco,and raco caused his substantial injuries.each of the defendants moved for summary judgment.on april,the district court entered an order denying estes motion and granting the motions of vitelco and raco.on may,after gass and estes reached a settlement,the district court ordered the case closed.gass filed a timely appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of vitelco and raco.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction over the district court final order granting summary judgment to vitelco and raco pursuant to.
the standard of review applicable to an order granting summary judgment is plenary.see curley klem,cir.we apply the same test employed by a district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.see kelley tyk refractories,cir.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of vitelco and raco was proper only if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in evaluating the evidence,we are required to view the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.bartnicki vopper,cir citation omitted.
the district court granted summary judgment to vitelco because it found that an injured employee of an independent contractor does not have a cause of action against the employer of the contractor under sections or of chapter of the restatement.see gass virgin islands telephone et,d.the district court based its conclusion on monk virgin islands water power,cir.in a subsequent opinion by the district court of the virgin islands sitting as a appellate panel reviewing a territorial court decision,the panel explicitly rejected the district court interpretation of monk in this case and held that an injured employee of an independent contractor does have a cause of action against the employer of the contractor under section.figueroa hovic,d we must decide here whether the district court view of section and hirer liability is correct chapter of the restatement,comprised of sections through,covers the liability of an employer of an independent contractor.restatement div,ch,at.the first provision recites the general rule of of the employer of an independent contractor.restatement the restatement divides the exceptions to that general rule into those based on an employer direct negligence,see,and those involving vicarious liability imposed on the employer due to the negligence of the independent contractor,see.see restatement ch,topic,introductory note,at monk,at.
gass argues that vitelco is directly liable for its negligent acts under the sections and gass theory is that vitelco is liable under section,the negligent instruction section,because phillip day,acting as a representative of vitelco,negligently gave the orders that caused raco,through its supervisor,to commit the acts and omissions resulting in gass injuries alternatively,gass argues that vitelco retained sufficient control over the performance of the job to render vitelco liable under section,the negligent exercise of retained control section.
rather than discussing the merits of gass claims,the district court determined as a matter of law that gass could not state a claim under either section or against vitelco as the employer of the independent contractor.gass,d at.the district court interpreted this court decision in monk as dictating this result.id.at.the district court interpretation of monk,however,is incorrect.
to begin,the district court interpretation of monk conflicts with a prior decision of this court.in williams martin marietta alumina,cir,we determined that an employee of an independent contractor may bring a claim against the contractor employer for harm caused by the employer own negligence under restatement sections or.we did not indicate in monk,nor have we indicated in any other case,that we intended to overrule williams.the williams decision,therefore,remains binding in this circuit.see third circuit internal operation procedure vii c it is the tradition of this court that reported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel.court en banc consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of this court.thus,it is clear that the monk decision must be read in keeping with the ruling in williams the district court did not interpretmonk accordingly.
in monk,the plaintiff,an employee of an independent contractor who brought suit against the employer of the contractor,asserted a claim under restatement section,which involves an employer duty to provide for taking of precautions against dangers involved in work entrusted to contractor.at.we began our discussion in monk by pointing out that section deals with the peculiar risk doctrine,which developed in the latter half of the nineteenth century out of recognition that a landowner who chose to undertake inherently dangerous activity on his land should not escape liability for injuries to others simply by hiring an independent contractor to do the work.id.at quoting privette superior court,cal th,d.the american law institute incorporated the doctrine in sections,and of chapter of the restatement of torts the defendant in monk,the employer of the independent contractor,urged this court to consider whether the others protected under sections,and includes an independent contractor employees.id.at.in resolving this issue,we set forth approvingly several reasons cited by other courts for denying employer liability to a contractor employees under the peculiar risk sections.id.at.based on these reasons,we concluded that an employee of an independent contractor is not one of the others allowed to bring suit against an employer of an independent contractor under the peculiar risk sections.id.at.
it is clear that we intended to limit the holding in monk to sections,and given that we expressly limited the holding to the peculiar risk provisions of chapter of the restatement,and further clarified that the holding extends to actions under the direct liability provision of section,as well as the vicarious liability provisions of sections and.id.we declined to rule that an employee of an independent contractor could never sue the employer of an independent contractor under any section of chapter.instead,we carefully limited the reach of the monk decision to the peculiar risk sections of chapter.therefore,the district court interpretation of monk as prohibiting hirer liability under sections and can not be upheld on the basis of the plain language of the stated holding.
the district court conceded as much,but interpreted monk to have extended implicitly the reach of the holding to include sections and.gass,d at.the district court based its interpretation in part on its assertion that the monk court rejected the distinction between direct and vicarious liability,and in the process implicitly rejected any limitation of its ruling to only those provisions involving a peculiar risk to others.id.at.
we disagree with the district court assertion.the monk court did not reject the overall division of direct and vicarious liability provisions in chapter.rather,themonk court underscored the importance of the commonality of the peculiar risk doctrine in sections,and,and thus concluded that the same policy considerations preclude hirer liability under those sections.stated differently,the monk court determined only that the peculiar risk doctrine differentiates sections,and from other sections in chapter for the purpose of determining the availability of hirer liability.the court did not make a broader determination to eliminate the distinction between direct and vicarious liability set forth in chapter of the restatement.
in fact,we find that there is good reason to distinguish between direct liability under sections and and peculiar risk liability under sections,and of the restatement.most importantly,the policy considerations underlying the peculiar risk sections of the restatement differ from those underlying the other direct liability sections.the district court of the virgin islands provided an excellent explanation of that difference in figueroa 
peculiar risk analysis is conceptually distinct from traditional negligence analysis while negligence and section involve a failure to act with reasonable care,peculiar risk liability functions more as a strict liability principle resulting from a variety of policy considerations.peculiar risk doctrine provides for liability even when a defendant is not personally negligent and does not cause an injury.rather,the defendant liability is derivative or vicarious of the acts of another,and is not related to any duty of his own.thus,the doctrine allows courts to impose liability on landowners even when they utilized independent contractors to perform dangerous work and does not allow that they limit their own liability by shifting the duty of care to another.in this way,the peculiar risk doctrine has helped to ensure that persons who were injured by dangerous activities have recourse,in the event that the independent contractor is insolvent.see monk,at.thus,in a sense,the courts have determined that landowners should be liable,even if the person who was actually negligent was beyond their control,an independent contractor and,this is why the peculiar risk provisions,set forth in the restatement,are utterly distinguishable from section.
in contrast,section provides for liability for an employer own negligence where he retains sufficient control over the operative details of his work.
figueroa,d at emphasis supplied because the holding in monk stems from the unique policy considerations regarding the peculiar risk sections and because liability arises under section as a result of different policy considerations,we see no reason to extend the prohibition in monk to section.
moreover,the peculiar risk sections interact differently with the workmen compensation exclusivity provisions than do sections and.the peculiar risk sections address vicarious liability for the contractor acts and omissions.therefore,imposing liability against the independent contractor employer for acts omitted or committed by the contractor,who is shielded from liability by the exclusivity provision of the wca,conflicts with a major purpose of the wca.sections and,on the other hand,address the direct liability of the contractor employer for his own actions,and therefore do not conflict with the purpose of the exclusivity provision of the wca.the rule of workers compensation exclusivity does not preclude the employee from suing anyone else whose conduct was a proximate cause of the injury,and when affirmative conduct by the hirer of a contractor is a proximate cause contributing to the injuries of an employee of a contractor,the employee should not be precluded from suing the hirer.hooker dep t of,cal th,d,internal citation and quotations omitted.
presenting a slightly different justification for extending monk to include sections and,the district court opined that it would make no sense whatsoever to preclude,under monk,the injured employee from suing the negligent employer who has contracted out peculiarly dangerous work and failed to ensure that special precautions were taken section,and yet to allow the employee to sue the negligent employer who has contracted out work that poses only ordinary risks of harm sections and.accordingly,that sections and are premised on the employer own negligence and involve no underlying peculiar risk of harm to others is no basis for imposing liability on the independent contractor employer.gass,d at.
even if the district court analysis were compelling,it can not be reconciled with the law in the virgin islands in the virgin islands,the various restatements of law provide the rules of decision in the absence of local laws to the contrary.ann.williams,at.regarding this issue,the legislature of the virgin islands has decided that a contractor employer can be liable to a subcontractor employees.figueroa,d at see,b
