saltire industrial,formerly known as scovill,and its parent company alper holdings,collectively,saltire,sued the nashville law firm of waller,lansden,dortch davis,pllc waller lansden for common law fraud.the claim arose out of an earlier action in which waller lansden represented a group of tennessee plaintiffs against saltire in state court.saltire alleged that waller lansden secret agreement with an codefendant wrongfully prevented saltire from removing the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.the district court granted waller lansden motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,waller lansden filed suit in the circuit court of tennessee against saltire on behalf of several residents living near saltire manufacturing facility in dickson,tennessee.the lawsuit,captioned norman scovill,the norman case,involved claims for trespass,nuisance,and battery based upon saltire alleged improper handling of trichloroethylene tce that contaminated the surrounding soil and groundwater.as a result of this contamination,the plaintiffs alleged that the amount of tce in the wells used for drinking water was toxic and caused them a number of health problems.waller lansden named the industrial development board of dickson county,tennessee the idb as a codefendant in this earlier action.the idb had taken over the facility abandoned by saltire.according to saltire,the idb was entitled to immunity from suit under tennessee state law,but the idb never moved to dismiss on this ground.
saltire,joined by the idb,removed the norman case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.waller lansden responded by moving to remand the case back to the state court,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because both the plaintiffs and the idb were citizens of tennessee.the case was ultimately remanded to state court by agreement of the parties.in the agreement,waller lansden averred that the idb was a necessary party to the action,that the norman plaintiffs had genuine claims against the idb for which they sought relief,and that there was no basis for a fraudulent joinder claim.
the norman case was litigated for years.saltire parent company,alper,which was added as a codefendant in february of,filed its own notice of removal to the district court in january of.in response,waller lansden again filed a motion to remand,arguing that the idb was a necessary party and that complete diversity of citizenship was lacking.waller lansden supported its motion by proffering a letter that it had written to the idb attorney in january of.the letter stated in pertinent part as follows 
this letter is intended to outline our clients intentions with regard to the idb.as you know,we believe that the idb is liable to our clients.we are seeking both money damages and,just as important,injunctive relief in the form of court ordered cooperation with the process of long term remediation of the site of the former scovill facility.
that said,we believe that it is not in anyone interest to force the idb to engage in expensive preparation for a trial that will focus on the activities of scovill.in all likelihood,the completion of that trial will place the plaintiffs and the idb in a position to independently settle their dispute.
therefore,the plaintiffs agree that they will,prior to the trial of this matter,file a voluntary dismissal of their action against the idb.this commitment is intended to permit the idb to avoid further trial preparation relating to this case.
while the motion to remand was pending in federal court,saltire and the norman plaintiffs reached a settlement in may of.the idb was not a party to this settlement agreement.after the settlement agreement was approved by the state court,all claims against the idb were dismissed.
saltire filed for chapter bankruptcy in august of.one month later,saltire brought the present action against waller lansden in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging one count of common law fraud and one count of damages pursuant to.section provides that a ny attorney admitted to conduct cases who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.id.the count was dropped when saltire filed its first amended complaint in february of and is therefore not involved in this appeal.
in its complaint,saltire alleges that waller lansden made a secret agreement with the idb to voluntarily dismiss the idb from the norman case once the action was remanded back to state court.according to saltire,waller lansden added the idb as a sham defendant solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction and thus force the case back to state court because waller lansden believed the state court action to be much more valuable in the state it would be tried before an elected local than in the federal court,where it would be tried before a judge appointed by the president for a lifetime term.
saltire argues that the letter sent by waller lansden to the idb counsel is proof of this secret agreement,and that the exposure of this letter induced waller lansden to settle the case.as additional proof of the alleged secret agreement,saltire contends that the idb never participated in any meaningful way in the action 
for example,idb never sought to dismiss the action against it even though it believed it was immune from liability under tennessee law under tennessee governmental tort liability act ann.a.additionally,idb never served any significant discovery requests and only attended one of the myriad of depositions held in the state court deposition held in vail,colorado.finally,waller lansden never sought any significant discovery from or pursed sic its purported claims against idb in any meaningful way.
waller lansden moved to dismiss saltire action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and for failure to plead fraud with the particularity required by rule b thereof.alternatively,waller lansden sought summary judgment.it also moved the district court in new york to transfer the action to the middle district of tennessee.the district court in new york granted the motion to transfer and reserved waller lansden motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment for consideration by the transferee court.after the transfer,waller lansden filed an amended motion to dismiss.in response,saltire moved to convert waller lansden motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.
the district court granted waller lansden motion to dismiss,concluding that,as a matter of law,saltire had failed to allege a set of facts sufficient to show that waller lansden committed fraud.it reasoned that all of the statements allegedly relied on by saltire in the norman case were either not material or were nothing more than legal arguments made to the district court.moreover,even if a secret agreement with the idb did in fact exist,reasoned the district court,waller lansden had no duty to disclose it to saltire.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to dismiss a suit pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.bloch ribar,cir.the court must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,and accept all of the factual allegations as true.id.when an allegation is capable of more than one inference,it must be construed in the plaintiff favor.id.that being said,more than bare assertions of legal conclusions is ordinarily required to satisfy federal notice pleading requirements.scheid fanny farmer candy shops,cir.the complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.id.citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
plaintiffs who allege a claim of fraud must satisfy an additional requirement in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b.when deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b,however,a court must also consider the policy favoring simplicity in pleading,codified in the short and plain statement of the claim requirement of federal rule of civil procedure.sanderson healthcare,cir.rule b particularity requirement does not mute the general principles set out in rule rather,the two rules must be read in harmony.id.
common law fraud 
under tennessee law,a plaintiff must allege with particularity all of the elements of a fraud claim in order to survive a motion to dismiss.these elements are an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact,knowledge of the representation falsity,an injury caused by reasonable reliance on the representation,and the requirement that the misrepresentation involve a past or existing fact.kincaid southtrust bank.for the purpose of considering a plaintiff claim,the terms intentional misrepresentation,fraudulent misrepresentation,and fraud are synonymous.concrete spaces,sender.
the district court began its analysis by evaluating the five statements that saltire alleged were false and misleading misrepresentations made by waller lansden in the latter motion to remand the norman case back to the tennessee state court 
because idb is a citizen of tennessee,this court has no jurisdiction over this matter,there being incomplete diversity of citizenship among the parties.
idb is maintaining the nuisance originally established by scovill.therefore plaintiff complaint properly joins idb as a necessary party for complete relief.
the complaint in the state court action seeks specific relief from the defendants both scovill and dickson idb.
idb is a proper party to this action and therefore its citizenship must be considered.
t hat idb was an indispensable party.
saltire also alleged that waller lansden failed to disclose four material facts that waller lansden never intended to actually obtain a judgment against the idb,that waller lansden entered into a secret agreement with the idb not to seek a judgment against it,that the idb was named as a codefendant in the norman case solely to deprive saltire of its right to a federal forum,and that there was no valid claim against the idb.according to saltire,the only reason that it consented to a remand of the norman case to state court was because it relied on waller lansden representation that the plaintiffs claim against the idb would be pursued.
the district court concluded that all five of the statements made by waller lansden were either factually true or were legal arguments of counsel presented in an effort to achieve remand of the case to state court,none of which are a proper basis for a fraud claim.it further concluded that because waller lansden had no duty to disclose to saltire any agreement that it may have had with the idb,saltire could not establish the elements of a cause of action for fraud by concealment.
saltire argues on appeal that the district court erred by considering each of the allegedly fraudulent statements and omissions in isolation,and by ignoring saltire core allegation that waller lansden conspired with the idb as a sham defendant for the sole purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction.as phrased by saltire viewed against the backdrop of waller lansden secret agreement with the sham defendant,each of these statements is a material misrepresentation because it was those very statements that defeated saltire right to a federal forum.for the purpose of considering the motion to dismiss,we must assume that there was in fact a secret agreement between waller lansden and the idb.see.b.saltire claim,then,turns on whether waller lansden failure to disclose the alleged secret agreement constitutes fraud.
under tennessee law,saltire must prove five elements to recover for fraud based upon a claim of intentional failure to disclose a material fact that waller lansden concealed or suppressed a material fact,that waller lansden had a duty to disclose that fact to saltire,that waller lansden intentionally concealed or suppressed that fact with the intent to deceive saltire,that saltire was unaware of the fact and would have acted differently if it had known about the concealed fact,and that saltire was damaged as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact.see justice anderson county.a statement is material or involves a material fact if it will likely affect the conduct of a reasonable person.patel bayliff.the district court concluded that waller lansden had no duty to disclose the alleged secret agreement to saltire,so that saltire claim failed as a matter of law.
saltire,in our view,satisfied the first element of the justice test.we must assume under rule b that a secret agreement existed,waller lansden had no intention of keeping the idb as a defendant once diversity jurisdiction was defeated,and saltire relied on the lack of complete diversity when it consented to the remand of the norman case to state court.because this purported lack of diversity induced saltire to change its behavior,agree to change forums,the concealment of the alleged secret agreement was material.see patel,at.
waller lansden counters that it had no duty under the second element of the justice test to disclose its agreement with the idb.the tennessee supreme court has explained there can be no tort of fraudulent concealment absent a duty to disclose 
the equitable doctrine of fraudulent concealment is based upon the principle of fair dealing.where there is no dealing between the parties,there can be no concealment.and,even where the parties have had business transactions,it is universally held that mere silence does not constitute fraudulent concealment.
there must be a concealment,and the silence must amount to fraud.concealment in this sense may consist in withholding information asked for,or in making use of some device to mislead,thus involving act and intention.the term generally infers also that the person is in some way called upon to make a disclosure.it may be said,therefore,that,in addition to a failure to disclose known facts,there must be some trick or contrivance intended to exclude suspicion and prevent inquiry,or else that there must be a legal or equitable duty resting on the party knowing such facts to disclose them.
patten standard oil of,quoting ruling case law,emphasis added see also justice,at courts of this state have ruled that liability for can arise only in cases where the person sought to be held responsible had a duty to disclose the facts at issue.
under tennessee law,the duty to disclose arises in only three scenarios 
where there is a previous definite fiduciary relation between the parties.
where it appears one or each of the parties to the contract expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other.
where the contract or transaction is intrinsically fiduciary and calls for perfect good faith.the contract of insurance is an example of this class.
id.the district court concluded that none of the three scenarios was present in the norman case.clearly the first and second categories listed above do not apply because no fiduciary or contractual relationship existed between the two parties.for waller lansden to have had a duty to disclose under the third category,saltire must show that the transaction at issue here between the two parties is intrinsically fiduciary and calls for perfect good faith.
our review of tennessee caselaw indicates that its courts have not elaborated on what factual scenarios fall into this third category beyond justice mention of the contract of insurance.we do not believe,however,that the tennessee supreme court would find that a duty to disclose arises under the circumstances of the present case.to be sure,parties in an adversary proceeding have a duty of good faith,but that duty is a general one to the court.see.b by presenting to the court a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best
