duval wiedmann,llc duval wiedmann,appeals a summary judgment on its claim.we affirm the summary judgment but remand for consideration of whether duval wiedmann is owed royalties for one particular period of time.
the facts,though intricate,are not in material dispute.stephen duval duval is the inventor of a patent the patent,issued in october,that includes a method to establish a voice telephone call after clicking a button on a website.duval filed his patent application in august.while the application was pending,he filed for bankruptcy but did not list the patent application in his schedule of assets.the bankruptcy was discharged and closed in.
duval entered into a patent license agreement license agreement with,inforocket,in june,granting inforocket an exclusive license to the patent.under the agreement,inforocket agreed to pay duval quarterly royalties based on inforocket net sales of licensed services.in addition,it agreed to pay duval a minimum annual royalty if the quarterly royalties did not exceed a specified annual minimum.the license agreement termination provision stated inforocket will have the right to terminate the agreement on sixty days prior written notice to duval.the notice provision provided that a ll notices to be given by each party to the other shall be made in writing by facsimile and confirmed by mail addressed,respectively,to the parties any notice shall be effective as of its date of receipt.
pursuant to the license agreement,duval agreed to reopen his bankruptcy proceeding to amend the schedule of assets to include the patent.the proceeding was reopened in august,and frances gecker was appointed as the chapter trustee.in march,inforocket and the trustee executed an amendment the amendment to the license agreement.the bankruptcy court granted the trustee ratification motion,and the amendment took effect in april.
the amendment provided that the license agreement shall continue in full force and effect but that the terms of the amendment shall control t o the extent that any provision of the amendment is inconsistent with the license agreement.the amendment and license agreement were to be read together as the amended license agreement.as already noted,the license agreement termination provision gave inforocket the right to terminate on sixty days prior written notice to duval.the amended license agreement notice provision added that copies of any notices to duval shall be sent to frances gecker,esquire.
meanwhile,inforocket had set about asserting its exclusive license.shortly after entering into the license agreement,inforocket sued keen,keen,for infringement of the patent.in early,keen acquired inforocket as its wholly owned subsidiary,including inforocket rights under the amended license agreement.inforocket dismissed its action against keen,and keen and the trustee entered into a release agreement.later in,keen changed its name to ingenio,ingenio.
ingenio filed a request for reexamination of the patent with the patent and trademark office pto on april.the pto canceled of the original patent claims and rejected the remaining claims as unpatentable in light of prior art.duval amended the original claims,and,in december,the pto issued a reexamination certificate that included only the amended claims.
on august,duval sent a letter to ingenio ceo stating that the bankruptcy case was closed and asking that all future notices,as well as an upcoming royalty payment,be sent directly to duval.an ingenio executive forwarded the letter to ingenio counsel at fenwick west on august.that same day,a different ingenio executive replied to duval that ingenio would send the royalty payment to the trustee because it had not received official notice that the bankruptcy proceeding had ended.the bankruptcy case did not end,in fact,until september.
on august,ingenio executive vice president,paul manca,sent a letter the manca letter to the trustee giving notice of ingenio termination of the amended license agreement.on september,the trustee informed duval of the termination notice and sent him a copy of ingenio letter,which duval received on september.duval states that he did not realize then that ingenio notice was fatally defective because it had been sent to the trustee instead of him.duval did not come to that realization,in fact,until december,when he filed an amended complaint in this case,repudiating the termination.
in the interim,duval gave every indication that he understood ingenio termination to have been effective.in march,for instance,he sent a letter to ingenio ceo that stated,in relevant part on august,ingenio sent gecker,the bankruptcy trustee,notice of cancellation on inforocket license.section of the license provides that the license can be terminated on days prior written notice.thus the license terminated on october.
ingenio seized on duval statement that the license terminated on october.it sent duval a letter in april,affirming duval statement that the amended license agreement had been terminated.duval did not respond.
in july,in response to another letter from duval,ingenio again acknowledged that it had terminated the amended license agreement effective october.in anticipation of this suit,duval formed duval wiedmann,llc duval wiedmann,and assigned all his rights under the amended license agreement to that entity.
in january,duval wiedmann sued inforocket and ingenio,alleging breach of the amended license agreement and failure to pay in minimum annual royalties for.the complaint stated that ingenio exercised its termination right by sending duval notice of termination on august.accordingly,the contract was terminated days later,on october.
duval wiedmann repudiated that admission,however,in its amended complaint,stating that the amended license agreement has not been terminated and minimum royalties continue to accrue.under the amended complaint,duval wiedmann seeks declaratory judgment that inforocket and ingenio did not terminate the amended license by sending the august,letter to the trustee,unpaid,due and owing minimum royalties for the years under the terms of the amended license agreement,and unpaid royalties that are to become due and owing for the years and.
at his deposition,duval testified that as of september,he believed that ingenio had successfully terminated the amended license agreement and that he never represented otherwise to the defendants until duval wiedmann filed the amended complaint.specifically,duval stated that ingenio had no reason to think i did consider the license terminated.
inforocket and ingenio moved for summary judgment.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge mj for a report and recommendation.the mj,applying new york law,recommended that summary judgment be granted,reasoning that duval received actual notice of termination on september,when he received ingenio termination letter by way of the trustee and that he was not prejudiced by the lack of strict compliance with the termination provision.the mj interpreted the language of the termination provision to create a conditional limitation rather than a condition subsequent.accordingly,the mj interpreted the agreement to have terminated automatically on november,sixty days after when duval received actual notice of termination.
turning to the question of royalties,the mj recommended that,based on the doctrine of lear,adkins,defendants were released from any obligation to pay royalties due under the amended license agreement for the period between april,and november,because they had filed a successful request for reexamination of the patent.
the district court adopted the mj recommendation and granted summary judgment.the court held that the amended license agreement had terminated on november,and that under the lear doctrine,defendants did not accrue any royalty obligations after april.
we review a summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as did the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.bolton city of dallas,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the record demonstrates that there is no issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to
