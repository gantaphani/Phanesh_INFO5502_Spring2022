this appeal involves the application of two separate contracts.under one contract,the district court found that era aviation,era was required to indemnify halliburton energy services hes for liability arising out of era provision of aviation services.under the second contract,the district court found that hes was required to indemnify rowan companies,rowan and its subsidiary era,for liability relating to the death of hes employees while they were on era equipment.applying both indemnity provisions,the district court held that the reciprocal obligations created a circular indemnity resulting in no party being entitled to indemnity from the other,and likewise,no party was entitled to additional insured status.the parties filed.the issues raised on both appeals center on the applicability of the indemnity and insurance provisions under the contracts.both parties raise as issues whether the district court rulings were proper,and the separately presents alternative bases to support the judgment.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and remand in part for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
i.the factual background 
this case arises out of a helicopter crash in march that resulted in the death of ten occupants,including some of hes employees.hes is in the business of providing goods and services to customers with onshore and offshore operations in support of oil and gas exploration and production.rowan likewise provides goods and services to customers in the oil and gas business who utilize rowan equipment and property.era,a subsidiary of rowan at the time of the helicopter accident,was a provider of specialized helicopter services.a helicopter operated by era departed galveston,texas with two crew members and eight passengers.four of the eight passengers aboard the helicopter,tyler breaux,thomas wayne jackson,andre lake,and jeffrey willis langley,were employed by hes.the purpose of the flight was to transport the oil field workers to an offshore drilling vessel,the discover spirit,operated by transocean offshore deepwater drilling,transocean.union oil company of california unocal,the operator of wells in the gulf of mexico,had previously contracted with transocean for the services of the discover spirit in connection with the operation of unocal offshore wells.era and hes were providing services to the same customer,unocal.the aircraft crashed during the flight,and all ten occupants were killed as a result of the accident.
ii.the procedural background 
in may,plaintiff shannon breaux,individually,and as administratrix of the succession of tyler breaux,filed suit against era and rowan,among others,for damages arising out of the death of her husband,hes employee tyler breaux breaux action.in june,the breaux action was removed to federal court and consolidated with two other actions arising out of the same accident.
era and rowan filed a third party complaint against hes seeking contractual defense,indemnity,and additional insured status relating to the claims of the four hes employees killed in the accident under a mutual hold harmless and indemnity agreement between rowan and hes agreement.hes filed a counterclaim against era and rowan seeking defense,indemnity,and additional insured status relating to all claims made against hes under a commercial agreement for helicopter transportation services agreement.the agreement and agreement are central to this appeal.
the agreement was executed by era and unocal on july.the agreement incorporated the indemnity provisions contained in the services and drilling master contract sdm the two parties executed on june.while rowan was not a signatory to the agreement,it was a subsidiary of era.contractor is defined as era aviation,and any and all of its parent companies,subsidiaries and affiliates.the agreement also expressly applies to helicopter services and the transport of personnel and equipment.
the agreement provides in pertinent part as follows 
contractor indemnity.contractor era hereby agrees to release,defend,and indemnify company unocal and its contractors and subcontractor s of any tier to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law,in each and every case,irrespective of whether any indemnitee hereunder may be alleged or proven to have been negligent including but not limited to active,passive,sole,joint,concurrent,comparative,contractual and gross negligence,or otherwise legally liable with or without fault or whether strictly liable or in breach of any warranty,from and against any and all liability arising out of the following 
all claims,liabilities,demands,actions,damages,losses,and expenses,including but not limited to court costs,reasonable attorney fees,and other litigation expenses,for personal or bodily injury,illness,disease,or death resulting from era ownership,operation,maintenance or use of aircraft under the contract,regardless of when,or where such injury,illness,disease or death occurs 
the agreement was executed by rowan and hes on august.era was not a signatory to the agreement,but the provisions of the agreement inure to the benefit of rowan subsidiary and affiliated companies.the four introductory paragraphs of the agreement establish the intent of the agreement.
whereas,contractor hes is engaged in the business of supplying goods or services to customers having onshore and offshore operations relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas 
whereas,company rowan is engaged in the business of supplying goods or services to such customers utilizing equipment and property owned by or under the management of company rowan or its subsidiary or affiliated companies the company property 
whereas,contractor hes personnel or property are from time to time located near or placed on company property under circumstances in which company rowan has not hired contractor hes but contractor hes and company rowan are providing goods or services to the same customer in connection with a project and 
whereas,contractor hes and company rowan hereby wish to apportion their respective liabilities and responsibilities under such circumstances.
the agreement then defines the scope of the indemnity obligation as follows 
a the parties rowan and hes expressly intend and agree that the phrase be responsible for and hold harmless and indemnify,as used in this agreement,shall mean that the indemnifying party shall release,indemnify,hold harmless and defend the indemnified party from and against any and all claims,demands,fines,penalties,causes of action,damages,attorney fees,cost of litigation,court costs,judgments and awards of any kind or character collectively referred to hereinafter as the claims,without limit and without regard to the cause or causes thereof,including conditions,defect or ruin of premises,the unseaworthiness of any vessel or vessels,the ownership,possession,management,maintenance,supply,operation including but not limited to ingress,egress,loading and unloading operations or navigation of any vessel,breach of representation or warranty,breach of duty whether statutory,contractual or otherwise,strict liability,tort,breach of contract including any claims which arise by reason of indemnification or assumption of liability contained in other contracts entered into between an indemnified party and a third party,fault,regulatory or statutory liability,the negligence of any person or persons,including that of an indemnified party,whether such negligence be sole,joint or concurrent,active,passive or gross,or any other theory of legal liability.
the agreement then details each party respective indemnity obligation.regarding hes obligation,the agreement provides as follows 
contractor hes shall at all times be responsible for and hold harmless and indemnify company rowan from and against all claims arising in connection herewith in favor of contractor,its parents,subsidiary and affiliated companies,each of their respective officers,directors and employees,each of their respective officers,directors and employees,and any legal representative,heir or survivor of any of the forgoing collectively referred to as the contractor group on account of illness,injury,or death of contractor group or damage to or loss of property owned,rented or provided by contractor group 
the agreement also required rowan and hes to maintain four types of insurance comprehensive general liability including contractual coverage,comprehensive automobile liability,workers compensation and employer liability,and excess insurance.regarding the interplay between the indemnity provisions and the insurance provisions,the agreement provides that 
n otwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement to the contrary,the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the indemnity obligations and the insurance obligations set forth herein are separate and distinct duties under this agreement.the parties further acknowledge and agree that the indemnity provisions of this agreement shall not limit,restrict or alter the obligations of this agreement,even if one or more of the indemnity provisions are held by a court to be unenforceable.
summary judgment rulings 
in july,era and rowan filed a motion for partial summary judgment against hes with respect to the claims asserted in the breaux action era and rowan argued that they were entitled to defense,indemnity,and additional insured status from hes under the agreement.in august,hes filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration that it was not required to defend and indemnify era and rowan or name them as additional insureds on its insurance policies.hes also sought a declaration that it was entitled to a defense,indemnity,and additional insured status from era with respect to the claims asserted by era and rowan in their claim against hes pursuant to the agreement.
in december,the district court issued an order and reasons on the motions.regarding the agreement,the district court held 
t he rowan hes agreement applies under these facts and requires hes to indemnify era for the breaux claims moreover,the agreement expressly entitles era additional insured status on whichever policies hes obtained to insure its indemnity obligations under the rowan hes agreement.unfortunately,the agreement functions to preclude era from obtaining the benefits of the rowan hes agreement.
as to era entitlement to additional insured status under the agreement,the district court nonetheless held that i t would be unfair to permit era to receive indemnification under the additional insured status.
the district court further held that the agreement applied to the facts of this case.as to era argument that the agreement was superseded by the later executed agreement,the court stated that era executed indemnity agreements with two distinct parties hes and unocal.era can not escape the promises it made in its agreement with unocal by invoking provisions contained in a separate agreement that it later executed with a third party.the district court held that the agreement did not entitle hes to additional insured status because the terms of the agreement did not indicate that hes was part of the unocal group which was entitled to additional insured status under the agreement.
the district court issued a final judgment on september,disposing of all the remaining claims of all parties in the case.era,rowan,and hes timely filed their notices of appeal.

ii.indemnity under agreement 
the agreement provides that era agrees to release,defend,and indemnify unocal and its contractors and subcontractors from and against any and all liability arising out of all claims,liabilities,demands,actions,damages,losses,and expenses for personal or bodily injury,illness,disease,or death resulting from era ownership,operation,maintenance or use of aircraft under the agreement.era and rowan concede that the term contractors as relates to unocal contractors and subcontractor s in the agreement would include hes.
era and rowan argue that because era and rowan claims against hes are contractual in nature and are not claims for personal or bodily injury,illness,disease,or death,era is not obligated to indemnify hes under the agreement.the agreement does not limit indemnity to only tort claims for personal or bodily injury,illness,disease,or death,but the agreement unambiguously encompasses indemnity for unocal and its contractors,in this case hes,against all liability arising out of those claims.the claims arose out of liability for death resulting from era operation use of the aircraft.nothing in the agreement indicates an intent on the parties to exclude contractual liability.from the plain language of the agreement,era and rowan claims in the third party complaint against hes are covered by the agreement.
era and rowan rely on the fifth circuit decision in corbitt diamond drilling,cir,to argue that more specific language must be included to indicate an intention to include contractual liability.in corbitt,shell entered into a contract with diamond m.the contract contained an indemnity provision whereby shell agreed to indemnify diamond m against all claims brought by shell employees,agents,invitees,or subcontractors for personal injuries arising out of work performed by them.corbitt,at.diamond m assumed reciprocal liability to indemnify shell for claims brought by its own employees,agents,and invitees.id.
shell also hired sladco as an independent contractor to provide personnel,equipment,and supplies for casing services.shell and sladco executed a purchase order which contained a provision that sladco shall indemnify and defend shell oil company and its employees and agents against all claims,suits,liabilities and expenses on account of injury or death arising out of or in connection with this order.id.the litigation in corbitt arose from the injury of a sladco employee,corbitt,who was working on diamond m drilling rig.corbitt sued diamond m,diamond m filed a action against shell seeking indemnity,and shell brought a action against sladco seeking indemnity.the relevant issue on appeal was whether sladco was required to indemnify shell for shell contractual liability to diamond m.the court held that sladco was not.the court in corbitt stated as follows 
since the purchase order does not specifically provide that sladco assumes claims arising from shell own separate contractual obligations,such indemnification is not required.
nor can it be said that shell contractual duty to indemnify diamond is the kind of liability which the parties to the purchase order intended to include within the scope of sladco duty to indemnify.apart from any contractual undertaking to the contrary,sladco exposure to liability for injuries sustained by its own employees would be limited by the relevant workers compensation scheme in the absence of such explicit language,it is unreasonable to assume that sladco intended to undertake such an unusual and surprising obligation.
the contract need not contain
