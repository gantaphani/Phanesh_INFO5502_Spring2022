worldwide security services corporation worldwide appeals from a grant of summary judgment on each of two it asserted against southern financial bank southern for tortious interference with contractual relations and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage in an interpleader action to determine the entitlement to the proceeds of certain government contracts.as for the contractual relations claim,the district court ruled that southern interference was justified or privileged because southern acted for the purpose of protecting its own financial interest.regarding the prospective economic advantage claim,the court ruled that southern had not engaged in the type of improper conduct that is actionable under virginia law.we agree with respect to the prospective economic advantage claim and disagree where the contractual relations claim is concerned.we therefore affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
in september,the united states department of labor awarded a contract to denmark security,denmark under which denmark was to provide security guard services.the federal bureau of investigation fbi awarded denmark two similar contracts in september.in late and early,however,denmark was in need of capital.southern loaned denmark a total of and denmark,in turn,granted southern a security interest in,inter alia,accounts receivable of denmark.southern properly perfected its security interests.
denmark continued to experience financial problems.as a result,worldwide commenced discussions with denmark in early regarding a potential purchase.although worldwide and denmark first discussed a stock purchase agreement,worldwide contends that denmark misrepresented information regarding its debts,causing worldwide to explore the possibility of an asset purchase agreement instead.
in late april,denmark,still in search of additional operating funds,entered into a factor agreement with commerce funding corporation commerce in which denmark assigned to commerce,inter alia,its accounts receivable,including amounts due under the two denmark fbi contracts.after commerce properly perfected its security interests,commerce,southern,and denmark entered into an agreement under which southern security interests in denmark receivables were subordinated to those of commerce.
on or about may,worldwide entered into a loan agreement with the bank of asheville as a part of that transaction,worldwide granted the bank of asheville a security interest in,inter alia,its contract rights.the bank of asheville then filed a financing statement to perfect its security interests.
worldwide contends that on or about june,the fbi assigned the two denmark fbi contracts to worldwide in a phone conversation.on that same day,according to worldwide,the department of labor assigned the denmark department of labor contract to worldwide in a separate phone conversation.the evidence shows that southern never consented to these transactions.
by june,worldwide had decided to purchase denmark assets.the parties entered into an asset purchase agreement,and denmark ceased operations that day.worldwide began performing the fbi and department of labor contracts collectively,the government contracts the very next day.two days later,denmark,worldwide,and the department of labor entered into a novation agreement which purported to recognize worldwide as the successor party to denmark contract with the department of labor.the asset purchase agreement closed on june,and denmark went out of business on that date.
on june,worldwide,also in search of operating capital,entered into a factor agreement with commerce in that agreement,worldwide assigned to commerce the proceeds from its performance under any and all of its contracts commerce thereafter collected receivables from those contracts to satisfy worldwide debts under the factor agreement.under the terms of the agreement,if commerce collected receivables in excess of worldwide debt to commerce,then commerce turned the excess funds over to worldwide or its other creditors.
worldwide contends that by approximately,commerce had collected receivables sufficient to satisfy worldwide debt to commerce.accordingly,worldwide expected to receive payments from commerce.on july,however,southern learned of the worldwide denmark asset purchase agreement.on july,southern sent a letter notifying denmark that it had not complied with the terms of its loan agreements with southern,and that full payment in the amount of was due.on the next day,southern sent a letter to commerce demanding that commerce send to southern,as a secured creditor of denmark and the secondary lienholder against the two denmark fbi contracts,any excess paid funds from the receivables worldwide had assigned to commerce.
southern reiterated its claim to commerce in a letter dated july.southern asserted that under the terms of its loan and security agreements with denmark and its agreement with commerce,it was the secondary lienholder on accounts receivable from the denmark fbi contracts,and it was the primary lienholder on any proceeds commerce collected from contracts that were not subject to the commerce southern agreement.southern also claimed that its liens were valid because it had neither been given notice of nor consented to the sale of denmark contracts.
on august,counsel for worldwide demanded by way of letter that southern immediately withdraw its demand that commerce pay to southern funds commerce held on behalf of worldwide the receivables.in that letter,worldwide contended that southern claims had no legal basis.chief among worldwide stated reasons were that a southern possessed liens on the receivables of denmark rather than those of worldwide,and b southern security agreements were improperly marked and filed.worldwide also put southern on notice that it needed the receivables to meet its payroll the next day,and that it would sue southern for damages incurred if the receivables were not released.
on august,worldwide and southern negotiated an agreement that permitted commerce to release some of the receivables by dividing them evenly between worldwide and southern.on august,worldwide failed to meet its payroll,and its employees refused to report to work.on august,worldwide and southern negotiated another agreement that permitted commerce to release additional funds to southern and worldwide.however,on august and september,respectively,the fbi and department of labor each terminated its contract with worldwide.
in a september,letter,worldwide again attempted to persuade southern to release its claims to the receivables.in that letter,worldwide demanded that southern immediately contact commerce and authorize it to release any funds held in excess of the sums southern claimed it was owed.southern apparently refused to comply with that demand.worldwide financial problems then escalated and it eventually filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.
on february,commerce filed an interpleader action under with the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,alexandria division,naming worldwide,southern,and the bank of asheville as defendants and claimants to the stake.on july,worldwide answered the complaint and asserted,inter alia,for tortious interference with contractual relations and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against southern.worldwide,southern,and the bank of asheville each moved for summary judgment claiming ownership of the receivables.southern also moved for summary judgment with respect to worldwide.
on november,the district court granted the bank of asheville motion regarding entitlement to the receivables and denied those of worldwide and southern.the court also granted southern motion for summary judgment on worldwide.as to the tortious interference with contractual relations claim,the court ruled that southern was privileged or justified to assert claims on the disputed funds in which it had a legitimate financial interest.at.regarding the prospective economic advantage claim,the court ruled that worldwide did not set forth facts which establish that southern engaged in any intentional misconduct.id.at.worldwide now appeals the district court rulings.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.kubicko ogden logistics,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only in those cases where the pleadings,affidavits,and responses to discovery show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.a material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.a disputed fact presents a genuine issue if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.id.
in this diversity action,it is undisputed that worldwide claims arise under virginia law.although under virginia law the elements of a prima facie case for tortious interference with contractual relations and for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage are generally very similar,they differ in respects material to this case.we will therefore discuss each claim separately.we turn,first,to worldwide claim for tortious interference with contractual relations.
to make a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations in virginia a plaintiff must prove the following elements the existence of a valid contractual relationship knowledge of the relationship on the part of the interferor intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship and resultant damage to the party whose relationship has been disrupted.chaves johnson.an interferor may escape liability,however,by proving that the interference was justified or privileged because the interferor acted for the purpose of protecting its own financial interest.id.at the burden rests on the interferor to prove that the interference is justified or privileged.id.
to survive summary judgment,worldwide must demonstrate that a reasonable jury could find that both a worldwide presented a prima facie case,and b southern failed to prove that the interference was justified or privileged on the basis of southern financial interest.we will discuss the prima facie elements and the financial interest defense separately.since the district court based its ruling on southern ability to use the financial interest defense,we shall begin our discussion there.
the district court ruled that southern was privileged to assert claims on the disputed funds in which it had a legitimate financial interest.the court ruling seems to be grounded in the theory that southern was legally entitled to assert its financial interest in the receivables.worldwide contends,however,that the court ruling was inconsistent insofar as the court held that while southern had no legal claim to the receivables,it was nevertheless privileged or justified in asserting its claims.
we have found no virginia cases that clearly define the parameters of the financial interest defense.the virginia courts do,however,refer us to the discussion in the restatement second of torts regarding the affirmative defenses applicable to tortious interference claims.chaves,at.it is clear that to invoke the defense one must act for the purpose of protecting a financial interest that one actually possesses.see restatement second of torts applying the financial interest defense to o ne who,having a financial interest,intentionally interferes with another and a third party contractual relations emphasis added see also zoby american fidelity,cir applying the financial interest defense w here the alleged interferer is a financially interested party and such interest motivates his conduct emphasis added.in general,the defense is based upon the relationships between the parties and the balance to be struck between the social desirability of protecting the business relationship,on one hand,and the interferor freedom of action on the other.chaves,at.
worldwide argues that southern could not have been privileged or justified to assert claims to the receivables because it in fact had no financial interest in them.southern contends that denmark transferred to worldwide the contracts in which southern had a security interest,and that its liens were still valid following the transfers because it had not consented to them.federal law clearly prohibits any party to a contract with the united states government from transferring that contract,or any interest therein,to any other party.west supp if any such transfer is consummated,then the transferred contract is annulled so far as the united states is concerned.id.
here,it is immaterial whether or not the fbi and the department of labor assigned the government contracts to worldwide in transactions distinct from the worldwide denmark asset purchase agreement.if this occurred,then denmark never transferred the government contracts to worldwide,in which case southern had no reason to assert claims with commerce,because denmark debts to southern remained with denmark.if,on the other hand,denmark transferred some or all of the government contracts to worldwide,as southern contends,then the obligations to make payments under the government contracts were annulled,in which event the receivables were extinguished entirely.in either event,it was legally impossible for denmark to transfer the government contracts to worldwide in a manner that preserved southern financial interests in the receivables.for this reason,southern can not invoke the financial interest defense 
southern nevertheless argues that its good faith,albeit mistaken,belief that it possessed an interest in the receivables is sufficient to prove the financial interest defense.however,this argument misconstrues the requirements of the defense.as is noted above,one must actually possess a financial interest in the business of a third person to justify interference with the business relationship of another and the third person.see restatement second of torts.in this regard,whether or not one acted on the basis of a good faith belief is simply irrelevant when it is determined that he or she does not in fact possess a legally protected financial interest.
it is beyond dispute that southern had absolutely no legal interest whatsoever to protect.under these circumstances,the balance should be struck in favor of protecting the valid business relationship between worldwide and commerce.we therefore conclude that a reasonable jury could find that southern failed to prove that its actions were justified or privileged on the basis of the financial interest defense 
it is unclear whether the district court found that worldwide presented a prima facie case for tortious interference with contractual relations in granting summary judgment for southern.in any event,to survive summary judgment worldwide must demonstrate that a reasonable jury could conclude that it did.there is no genuine dispute that worldwide presented evidence sufficient to find that a a valid contract existed b southern knew both of the contract existence and of the fact that it was interfering with commerce performance of the contract and c worldwide suffered damages as a result.we will therefore focus on the third element of the tortious interference with contractual relations claim intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship.this third element speaks to both intent and causation.we first discuss the matter of southern intent.
southern argues that it asserted its claims to the receivables not for the purpose of interfering with the worldwide commerce relationship,but rather to protect what it in good faith believed were its own legal interests.according to southern,the intent to protect one own interests falls short of that required to subject one to liability.here again,southern argument misconstrues the law.liability certainly attaches where an interferor acts with the purpose of,or a partial desire to,interfere with the performance of another contract.tortious interference claims are not,however,restricted to these circumstances.the requisite level of intent also exists if the interferor knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his or her action
