petitioner medtronic,designs,makes,and sells medical devices.respondent mirowski family ventures,llc,owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators.they have a licensing agreement that permits medtronic to practice certain mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments,and that specifies procedures to identify products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the parties.pursuant to those procedures,mirowski notified medtronic of its belief that several of medtronic products infringed the licensed patents,and medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringement in a declaratory judgment action,while accumulating disputed royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party.the district court concluded that mirowski,as the party asserting infringement,had the burden of proving infringement and that mirowski had not met that burden.the federal circuit disagreed.it acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof,but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant and,like mirowski,is foreclosed from asserting an infringement counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agreement,the party seeking the declaratory judgment,namely medtronic,bears the burden of persuasion.
the federal circuit did not lack jurisdiction in this case.title a gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,and a gives the federal circuit appellate jurisdiction over any case where jurisdiction in the district court was based,in whole or in part,on section.the declaratory judgment act does not extend the federal courts jurisdiction,skelly oil phillips petroleum,and federal courts determining declaratory judgment jurisdiction often look to the character of the declaratory judgment defendant threatened action,public serv.comm of utah wycoff,whether the defendant hypothetical coercive action would necessarily present a federal question,franchise tax bd.of cal.construction laborers vacation trust for southern.here,if medtronic had acted consistent with the understanding of its rights that it seeks to establish through the declaratory judgment suit by ceasing to pay royalties,mirowski could terminate the license and bring a suit for infringement.that suit would arise under federal patent law because patent law creates the cause of action.christianson colt industries operating.thus,this declaratory judgment action,which avoids that hypothetical threatened action,also arises under federal patent law.see,nat.bank of los angeles franchise tax bd.of.
when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee that its products do not infringe the licensed patent,the patentee bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of infringement.
a this conclusion is strongly supported by three settled legal propositions first,a patentee ordinarily bears the burden of proving infringement,see,agawam jordan,wall,second,the operation of the declaratory judgment act is only procedural,aetna life ins.haworth,leaving substantive rights unchanged,beacon theatres,westover,and third,the burden of proof is a substantive aspect of a claim,raleigh illinois of revenue.practical considerations lead to the same conclusion.shifting the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about a patent scope.it may also create unnecessary complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative.finally,burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the declaratory judgment act purpose of ameliorating the dilemma posed by putting one challenging a patent scope to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking suit,medimmune,genentech.to the extent that the federal circuit burden shifting rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous,that rule recreates the dilemma that the declaratory judgment act sought to avoid.
b several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.first,schaffer weast,which noted the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs have the risk of failing to prove their claims,does not support the federal circuit conclusion.schaffer was not a declaratory judgment case,and it described exceptions to its basic burden of proof rule.for reasons explained in this case,declaratory judgment suits like this one are an exception to schaffer default rule.second,the fact that the federal circuit limited its holding to the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counterclaim by a patentee can not,by itself,show that the holding is legally justified.third,contrary to one amicus concern that this court holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into infringement litigation,such litigation can occur only when there is a genuine and sufficiently immedia te dispute about a patent validity or application,medimmune,supra,at.here,mirowski set this dispute in motion by accusing medtronic of infringement,and there is no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor the patentee.general considerations relating to the public interest in maintaining a patent system are,at most,in balance,and do not favor changing the ordinary burden of proof rule.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
a patentee ordinarily bears the burden of proving infringement.agawam jordan,wall.this case asks us to decide whether the burden of proof shifts when the patentee is a defendant in a declaratory judgment action,and the plaintiff the potential infringer seeks a judgment that he does not infringe the patent.we hold that,when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee to establish that there is no infringement,the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee.we reverse the federal circuit determination to the contrary.
we set forth a simplified version of the facts.the parties are medtronic,a firm that among other things designs,makes,and sells medical devices,and mirowski family ventures,llc,a firm that owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators.in medtronic and mirowski entered into an agreement permitting medtronic to practice certain mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments.
in less simplified form mirowski entered into a license agreement with eli lilly,which then sublicensed the mirowski patents to medtronic.guidant is eli lilly successor in interest.for present purposes we shall ignore eli lilly,guidant,and other parties on mirowski side,using mirowski to refer to any and all of them.
the agreement also provided that,if mirowski gave notice to medtronic that a new medtronic product infringe d a mirowski patent,medtronic had a choice.app.medtronic could simply cure the nonpayment of royalties.ibid.or it could pay royalties and,at the same time,challenge the assertion of infringement of any of the mirowski patents through a declaratory judgment action.ibid.medtronic,of course,might just ignore the agreement and decide not to pay royalties at all,in which case mirowski would have the right to terminate the l icense,and,if it wished,bring an infringement action.
in the parties entered into a further agreement that slightly modified the procedure for resolving disputes.if medtronic,having received timely written notice of infringement,chose to pursue a declaratory judgment action challenging infringement,it could accumulate disputed royalties in an escrow account,at.the prevailing party in the declaratory judgment action would receive the royalties,at.
in the parties found themselves in the midst of an infringement dispute.mirowski gave medtronic
