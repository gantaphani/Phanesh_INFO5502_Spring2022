opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we must decide whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate a labor dispute,thereby rendering it arbitrable under the parties collective bargaining agreement.the district court concluded that they had not,and we will affirm.
rite aid of pennsylvania,rite aid operates a chain of drugstores in pennsylvania.united food and commercial workers,local the union represents nonmanagerial employees in rite aid eastern pennsylvania stores.rite aid and the union are parties to three separate collective bargaining agreements cbas covering rite aid stores in pennsylvania counties 
in,rite aid acquired a chain of drugstores formerly operated by brooks eckerd.the employees of the stores were not yet represented by the union.when union representatives attempted to enter six of the new stores in september,rite aid denied them entry.
on november,the union filed three identical grievances one under each cba,asserting that the cbas conferred upon the union a right to access or stores within each cba geographic jurisdiction.rite aid denied the grievances,citing a policy against solicitation.the union referred the three grievances to arbitration,where they were consolidated into a single proceeding,and a hearing date was set.
prior to the arbitration hearing,rite aid filed an action in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,seeking a declaratory judgment of the grievances.on july,the parties filed for summary judgment.
rite aid argued that the grievances were not arbitrable in light of section of the cba,which provides no grievance shall be filed by the associate or the union,nor need the employer entertain any grievance that does not involve the interpretation of any provision of this agreement.emphasis added.the union responded by citing three cba provisions under which it purported to assert its grievances.the union argued that because its grievances arose under at least one of those provisions,arbitration was required,regardless of the grievances merits.
on march,the district court granted rite aid motion and denied the union motion.the court found that the grievances did not involve the interpretation of any cba provisions,and that they therefore fell outside the scope of the cba arbitration clause.the union filed a timely notice of appeal we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the district court decision regarding the applicability and scope of the parties arbitration agreement is subject to our plenary review.united steelworkers of am.rohm and haas,cir harris green tree financial,cir in reviewing a district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,we apply the same test district courts are to apply under fed.rule.civ.c.brown kaz,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if and only if,after the evidence taken as a whole is construed in the light most favorable to the party,there remains no genuine issue of material fact.prowel wise business forms,cir.
the venerable legal principles guiding the construction and enforcement of arbitration clauses in collective bargaining agreements are well established.we have often recognized the strong federal policy in favor of resolving labor disputes through arbitration.see,united parcel service,int l brotherhood of teamsters,local union,cir laborers int l union of am.foster wheeler,cir exxon shipping exxon seamen union,cir.more specifically,the inclusion of a broad arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement gives rise to a presumption of arbitrability which may be rebutted only by the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration.at t,comm workers of,quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav.the parties agree that the arbitration provisions in the cba at issue are broad,and that the presumption of arbitrability therefore applies in this case.
notwithstanding that presumption,arbitration is still a creature of contract and a court can not call for arbitration of matters outside of the scope of the arbitration clause.rohm and haas,at.unless the parties clearly provide otherwise,the courts,not the arbitrators,are tasked with interpreting agreements in order to determine whether the parties have indeed agreed to arbitrate disputes whose arbitrability is contested.see at t,at,local verizon new jersey,cir.in making that determination,a court is not to examine the potential merits of the claim sought to be arbitrated,except as we point out in part iv,where the claim merits and its arbitrability are inextricably intertwined.see lukens,at.rather,the court is limited to the construction of the arbitration clause and any contractual provisions relevant to its scope,as well as any other forceful evidence suggesting that the parties intended to exclude the disputes at issue from arbitration.see diagnostic,local,cir.
where an arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement limits arbitration to those disputes which require interpretation of the agreement,as it does here,a grievance is excluded from arbitration unless it arises from a specific provision in the agreement.see rohm and haas,at although we hold that the bristol cba arbitration clause is broad,the underlying basis for the grievance submitted through the bristol cba grievance procedure must still arise from some specific article of the bristol cba.we may not accept an arbitration proponent citation to a particular provision of the cba and its claim that the grievance arises thereunder without critical examination.unquestioning acceptance of the union characterization of its claims is inconsistent with our duty to determine arbitrability because it leaves the scope of the arbitration clause subject to the unilateral and unfettered discretion of the union.diagnostic,at.we must determine whether indeed the subject matter of the grievance is one that is within the zone of interests that have received protection in the collective bargaining agreement and one that the parties have agreed to arbitrate.id.
having outlined the controlling principles,we turn now to their application to the grievances and arbitration clause in the present case.
article of the cba creates a procedure under which the union or one of its members may file grievances with rite aid.the cba provides for review of the grievance by progressively higher levels of rite aid management and,if the dispute is not amicably resolved,ultimately for resolution of the dispute by an arbitrator 
as noted supra,the scope of the arbitration provision in the cba is broad but not unbounded.section of the cba provides no grievance shall be filed by the associate or the union,nor need the employer entertain any grievance that does not involve the interpretation of any provision of this agreement.emphasis added.thus,the plain language of the cba indicates that the parties have agreed to arbitrate only those disputes which genuinely implicate one or more provisions of the cba.our task is therefore to decide whether the union grievance falls within the scope of the arbitration clause by raising a legitimate question of the cba interpretation.
the union points to three provisions of the cba,contending that each provides a basis for its claim that union representatives are entitled to access rite aid stores and their employees.we examine each in turn.
recognition clause 
section of the cba reads 
the employer recognizes the union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of bargaining in the bargaining unit in respect to rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,and other conditions pertaining to employment 
the union argues that its interpretation of this clause gives rise to its access grievance.
we are not persuaded by the argument the union advances based on the decision of the national labor relations board nlrb in houston div.of the kroger.in kroger the nlrb held that a recognition clause similar to the one at issue in this case waives an employer right to demand an election in a new or store,but that the union is nevertheless required to demonstrate majority support among employees of those stores before it can be recognized.id.at.however,the nlrb did not specify the means by which unions are to demonstrate majority support in this situation.the union here argues that the cba at least arguably grants it a right of store access,and it is therefore entitled to present that claim to an arbitrator.
this strikes us as a non sequitur.the nlrb failure to specify the means of establishing majority support in cases where the employer has waived its right to an election simply does not suggest that the union must be allowed access to stores.the union has not explained why any of the methods that might meet the nlrb approval would require its organizers to enter the store.if there is ambiguity in kroger,it does not translate to ambiguity in the instant cba.
the union points to several arbitration decisions recognizing a right of access to stores,and contends that its present grievance must indeed involve interpretation of the recognition clause,since that interpretation has in fact been accepted by several arbitrators 
even were we to consider them,the merits decisions relied upon by the union would not persuade us that the grievance is arbitrable.the union calls our attention to a decision from the district of oregon confirming an arbitration award under a cba that included a provision specifically providing for the applicability of the cba to new stores.the cba in that case included the following provision the employer agrees then if the employer should establish a new retail food store or stores located in clark county,washington,and in the jurisdiction of local,that as of the time such store is established this agreement shall apply to all employees in job classifications set forth herein.albertson,local,civil,slip op.at emphasis added.
the cba in the instant case contains no such provision to the extent that decisions of other arbitrators have found in favor of unions relying on the analysis of kroger and the theory referred to above,we simply do not find them persuasive.
in our view,a right of union access to newly acquired stores simply can not be plausibly derived from the recognition clause.the recognition clause merely establishes the union position as rite aid employees exclusive bargaining agent and defines the range of matters subject to bargaining.it does not describe or purport to include anything resembling the union claimed right to access stores.the district court correctly concluded that the recognition clause is not susceptible of an interpretation which would yield such a right.
observation clause 
the union next relies on section of the cba,which provides in relevant part 
it is agreed that the union duties and activities will not be carried on during work.this shall not prevent the union officials from entering the employer establishments to satisfy that this agreement is being observed,provided that same shall not interfere with the normal operations or business of the store.
the union argues that its grievance is arbitrable because it alleges that the union exclusion from the eckerd stores violated this provision of the cba.
we question the union reading of this provision,and its argument.the cba can not apply to the stores or to their employees because the union does not presently represent those stores employees.this is,of course,the very reason the union seeks access to the stores.we agree with the district court that it is not possible for the union to ensure compliance with the instant cba at stores to which the cba does not apply.accordingly,the union grievance does not require interpretation of section,the observation clause,and arbitration is not properly invoked by reliance on this provision.
privileges clause 
finally,the union relies on section,which provides 
only privileges which have been granted by the present employer since its acquisition of the establishments covered by this agreement shall be continued.
the union alleges that before the acquisition of the brooks eckerd stores,rite aid had permitted it to enter other new stores.thus,according to the union,the right of access is a privilege that shall be continued under the,at the least,this interpretation is sufficiently plausible to conclude that the union grievances indeed arise from an interpretation of the cba.
a right of access can not be considered one of the privileges referenced in section unless the clause context and provisions are entirely ignored.article is titled miscellaneous working conditions,and all of its provisions deal with the rights and responsibilities of employees covered by the cba.the privileges to which the cba refers are not privileges of the union.for example,section establishes the rules under which worked time is recorded section requires rite aid to furnish employees uniforms section sets out the circumstances under which employees are to be held liable for cash shortfalls section permits associates to transfer between the front end and pharmacy departments in accordance with seniority and ability,and so forth.
the union argues that this contextual analysis intrudes into territory reserved for the arbitrator.however,our recent precedent confirms our ability to consider the context of a cba provision in order to determine whether it is sufficiently implicated by a grievance that one party seeks to arbitrate.
in rohm haas,supra,the parties contested the arbitrability of a denial of disability benefits.management and the employee union had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause,but disability benefits were provided only under a separate erisa plan lacking any arbitration provisions.the employee argued,inter alia,that his grievance arose under the agreement because one provision of the agreement made reference to the erisa benefits plan in describing the procedures to be followed in case of a disagreement over whether an employee should be considered physically incapable of working.at.
we rejected this argument after examining the context,which revealed that the provision contemplates a situation where an employee seeks to continue working in spite of a potential disability.id.at.because the employee did not propose to continue working,we found that the agreement did not apply to the employee grievance,and the claim was therefore not arbitrable.we concluded we do not find any ambiguity in the cba that would permit it to be reasonably interpreted to provide for disability benefits or to provide for arbitrating a plan administrator denial of such benefits arising from a separate erisa plan.id.
similarly here,the entire context of section makes clear that the privileges discussed in article pertain to rite aid employees working conditions.article has nothing to do with the union right to organize or to be recognized in stores.the union grievances as to store access simply do not involve an interpretation of section,and thus do not come within the scope of the cba arbitration clause.
in sum,section of the cba,which provides that n o grievance shall be filed by the associate or the union,nor need the employer entertain any grievance that does not involve the interpretation of any provision of this agreement,constitutes forceful evidence,particularly in light of the context that we have analyzed,that the parties intended to exclude from arbitration claims which arise wholly outside the scope of the cba.the union grievance does not fall within the scope of the cba arbitration clause because it does not require the interpretation of any of the cba provisions 
the union additionally argues that the district court impermissibly considered the merits of its grievance in making its arbitrability determination.we can not agree.decisions of the supreme court and courts of appeals have made clear that where the merits and arbitrability questions are inextricably intertwined,a court arbitrability decision may,of necessity,touch incidentally on the merits.
in litton financial printing div.nlrb,the union representing litton employees sought to arbitrate a dispute over layoffs of ten workers,including litton six most senior employees.like the cba in this case,the agreement contained an arbitration provision whose scope was limited to disputes regarding the agreement and any alleged violations of the agreement,and the construction to be placed on any clause or clauses of the agreement.id.at.the litton cba provided that,in case of layoffs,lengths of continuous service will be the determining factor if other things such as aptitude and ability are equal.id.however,because the agreement had expired nearly a year before the layoffs occurred,litton contested the grievance arbitrability.the union argued that the seniority provision created a vested right which survived the expiration of the agreement,and thus the layoffs constituted violations of the agreement notwithstanding that they had occurred after expiration.
the supreme court ruled for litton and held the grievance.it noted that o nly where factors such as aptitude and ability were equal was the employer required to look to seniority.id.at.the court reasoned the important point is that factors such as aptitude and ability do not remain constant,but change over time.they can not be said to vest or accrue or be understood as a form of deferred compensation we can not infer an intent on the part of the contracting parties to freeze any particular order of layoff or vest any contractual right as of the agreement expiration.id.only after it construed the disputed provision and determined that no rights were vested was the court able to conclude that the grievance did not arise under the agreement,and was thus.
the union in this case characterizes litton as inapplicable because this case does not involve an expired cba,but litton is not so easily distinguished.because the agreement limited the scope of arbitration to matters regarding the agreement or its construction,the supreme court in litton found it necessary to interpret the agreement in order to properly determine the question of arbitrability.the union here would argue that the supreme court had accordingly reached the merits,but because the merits and arbitrability issues were inextricably intertwined in litton,the supreme court found it necessary to refer to the merits in order to determine what the parties had agreed to arbitrate.
we are presented with a similar situation in this case.in the words of the supreme court,we must determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate this dispute,and we can not avoid that duty because it requires us to interpret a provision of a bargaining agreement,even if we trench to some extent upon the merits.id.at.
we are not the first court of appeals to read litton this way,or to employ an analysis recognizing the entwining of the merits and arbitrability questions.int l brotherhood of workers gkn aerospace,cir,involved a dispute over whether an employee who had been promoted to a supervisory position had a right to return to the bargaining unit.because the arbitration provision was limited to matters related to the collective bargaining agreement,the eighth circuit held that the arbitrability determination required it to interpret various clauses of the agreement.see id.at.the court understood litton to mean that the judicial responsibility to determine arbitrability takes precedence over the general rule to avoid consideration of the merits of a grievance.id.at.
in independent lift truck builders union hyster,cir,another case limiting arbitration to disputes arising out of a collective bargaining agreement,the seventh circuit observed that a court can not address the arbitrability question without at the same time addressing the underlying merits of the dispute.id.at.after discussing litton,the court concluded if the court must,to decide the arbitrability issue,rule on the merits,so be it.id.indeed,both this court and our sister courts had conducted a similar analysis even before litton.see diagnostic,at united steelworkers local fireproofing,cir in order to determine then whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate the matter at issue,we must examine the collective bargaining agreement to see if,under any reasonable interpretation,agreement to arbitrate can be found.peerless pressed metal int l union of electrical,radio and machine workers,cir holding a dispute arbitrable because it arose under a construction of an agreement that,while weak,was not impossible or inconceivable.
we will affirm the district court judgment dated march,that the parties had not agreed to arbitrate the issue of access to the eckerd stores and their employees.
the majority concludes that the union grievances are not arbitrable based on its assessment of the merits of the union claims.because i do not believe that analysis is authorized by either supreme court precedent or our own precedent,i respectfully dissent.
background 
to review,united food and commercial workers union,local the union or local,has represented rite aid employees in pennsylvania counties for several decades.in june,rite aid acquired a drugstore chain formerly operated by brooks eckerd.several of these stores are located in counties covered by a collective bargaining agreement the cba between ride aid and local.during september and october,representatives of local attempted to enter six of these stores to solicit employee interest in joining the union.rite aid barred these representatives from entering the stores.
in november,local executive vice president nicholas farina filed three identical grievances with niels aid director of labor that rite aid had interfered with the union exercise of its visitation rights as prescribed under the cba.hansen denied the grievances,relying on rite aid no solicitation policy.that which the effective date is the s olicitation for any cause or distribution of material if one or more of the rite aid associates engaged in the interaction is on working time.the policy does not reference union activities,but purports to apply to associate and activity on behalf of any cause or organization,with the exception of charity events.
when local advised rite aid of its intent to submit the grievances to arbitration,rite aid filed a complaint in the federal district court for the middle district of pennsylvania seeking a declaratory judgment that the union grievances were not arbitrable the parties filed for summary judgment with supporting declarations in march,the district court granted rite aid motion and denied the union motion.this appeal followed.
ii.the steelworkers principles 
fifty years ago,the supreme court decided three cases,collectively known as the steelworkers trilogy,which establish the principles that guide our determination of whether a grievance is arbitrable.see united steelworkers of am.am,united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car.as the supreme court has observed,t hese precepts have served the industrial relations community well,and have led to continued reliance on arbitration as the preferred method of resolving disputes arising during the term of a agreement.at t,commc ns workers of.those precepts are as follows.
a rbitration is a matter of contract,and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.warrior gulf,at.
unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.at t techs,at citing warrior gulf,at.
in deciding whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular grievance,courts may not rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.id.the supreme court has stated this prohibition in forceful terms 
whether arguable or not,indeed even if it appears to the court to be frivolous,the union claim that the employer has violated the agreement is to be decided,not by the court asked to order arbitration,but as the parties have agreed,by the arbitrator.the courts,therefore,have no business weighing the merits of the grievance,considering whether there is equity in a particular claim,or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.the agreement is to submit all grievances to arbitration,not merely those which the court will deem meritorious.
id.at quoting am,at emphasis added.
thus,where the parties have agreed to submit all questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator,the court function is very limited i t is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.am,at.this principle implements the federal policy of settling labor disputes by arbitration,which would be undermined if courts had the final say on the merits of a grievance.enter.wheel car,at.accordingly,a court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it to become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement,even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause,when the alternative is to utilize the services of an arbitrator.warrior gulf,at.
a presumption of arbitrability applies where a collective bargaining agreement contains an arbitration provision.this presumption is particularly applicable where,as here,the arbitration provision is broad.at t,at arbitration provision that provided for arbitration of any differences arising with respect to the interpretation of this contract or the performance of any obligation hereunder was broad see also warrior gulf,at arbitration provision that provided for arbitration of differences as to the meaning and application of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement was broad.in such cases,i n the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration,only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail.at t,at quoting warrior gulf,at emphasis added alteration in original.
iii.discussion 
we have identified three questions to guide our application of the steelworkers principles where the bargaining agreement arbitration provision is broad and the presumption of arbitrability applies 
does the present dispute come within the scope of the arbitration clause does any other provision of the contract expressly exclude this kind of dispute from arbitration and is there any other forceful evidence indicating that the parties intended such an exclusion 
diagnostic,local,int l of teamsters,cir accord united steelworkers of am.rohm and haas,cir.i address these questions in turn.
a.the union grievances come within the scope of the arbitration provision 
the parties cba contains a provision governing the procedure for the filing and arbitration of grievances,which states that n o grievance shall be filed by the union,nor need rite aid entertain any grievance that does not involve the interpretation of any provision of this agreement.this provision thus limits the grievances that the union may,if rejected by rite aid,refer to those that involve the interpretation of any provision of the cba.
the union asserted right to enter rite aid stores for the purpose of soliciting membership is founded on its interpretation of three provisions of the recognition,observation,and privileges provisions.accordingly,the union argues that its grievances fall within the scope of the cba arbitration mandate because it has made a claim which on its face is governed by the cba,am,at is,on its face local asserted right of store access involve s the interpretation of provisions of the cba.
the distinction between the subject matter and the merits of a grievance 
the union characterization of its grievances is not the end of the matter.as the majority points out,u nquestioning acceptance of the union characterization of its claims would leave the scope of the arbitration clause subject to the unilateral and unfettered discretion of the union.op.at quoting diagnostic,at.the concern is that an arbitration proponent could achieve arbitration of a subject matter of which is wholly outside the scope of the collective bargaining by cit ing to a particular provision of the cba,claiming that its grievance arises thereunder,and contending that a court would be impermissibly reviewing the merits if it were to reject the union characterization.id.
we addressed this concern in diagnostic,where we considered the arbitrability of a grievance challenging a company decision to subcontract work to an agency that did not employ members of the union.at.because the arbitration provision was broad we applied the presumption of arbitrability and concluded that the grievance was arbitrable,even though the collective bargaining agreement there explicitly granted the company the right to subcontract,and the grievance simply alleged that the employer decision to subcontract was unfair and a clear case of violating the contract.id.
despite our concluding that the grievance was arbitrable,we rejected the union argument that its bare claim of a violation of the collective bargaining agreement was alone sufficient to make the dispute arbitrable,as s uch an interpretation leaves the scope of the arbitration clause subject to the unilateral and unfettered discretion of the union.id.at.instead,we adopted the following test for determining whether a grievance comes within the scope of an arbitration provision 
it will suffice for present purposes to hold that a claimed contract violation comes within the scope of an arbitration clause of this character when the subject matter of the grievance is one that is within the zone of interests that have received protection in the collective bargaining agreement.to require more,we believe,would infringe upon territory reserved for arbitrators in at t technologies.
id.emphasis added.applying this test,we had no difficulty concluding that the union subcontracting grievance fell within the zone of interests protected by the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.we reasoned that though the agreement granted the company the right to subcontract,there must be implicit limits on that right otherwise,the company could subcontract all work in the bargaining unit,which would be inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement recognition of the union as the bargaining agent for the company employees.id.
underlying our decision in diagnostic is the crucial distinction between two inquiries whether a grievance comes within the scope of the arbitration provision,whether its subject matter falls within the zone of interests that have received protection in the collective bargaining agreement and whether the grievance itself has merit.in my view,distinguishing between these questions is critical to ensuring that we do not overstep our very limited role in determining whether a grievance must be arbitrated.am,at.
to demonstrate,imagine a collective bargaining agreement that requires the employer to pay employees overtime wages for work in excess of hours a week.imagine further that the union files a grievance challenging the employer refusal to pay overtime wages for work in excess of hours a week.in such a circumstance,we could rightfully characterize the union grievance as frivolous,given the agreement express language to the contrary.we could not,however,say that the subject matter of the,the circumstances in which the employer is required to pay overtime wages to its outside the zone of interests that have received protection in the agreement.rather,we are compelled to call for arbitration of the dispute because,although the grievance appears to be frivolous,the union claim that the employer has violated the collective bargaining agreement is to be decided,not by the court asked to order arbitration,but as the parties have agreed,by the arbitrator.at t,at.indeed,a contrary position would reduce to an assertion that the obligation to pay overtime wages only for work in excess of hours a week is so clear on the face of the agreement that there is no need for arbitration,which is but another way of saying that the union grievance is frivolous.diagnostic,at.
contrast that situation with a grievance that,in addition to appearing frivolous,involves a subject matter wholly outside the scope of the collective bargaining agreement.for example,a grievance challenging an employer decision to terminate the distribution of christmas turkeys to its employees,in the context of an arbitration provision that applies only to grievances involving the interpretation and application of specific provisions of the collective bargaining agreement which do not include a provision even remotely applicable to the employer prior practice of distributing christmas turkeys,is rightly regarded as being outside the scope of arbitrable matter s,in addition to being frivolous.boeing int l union,uaw,cir see also diagnostic,f d at describing boeing as a case where the subject matter of the union grievance was whol ly unrelated to any interest protected by the collective bargaining agreement.
the subject matter of the union grievances comes within the zone of interests protected by the cba 
rather than explaining why the union grievances do not satisfy the zone of interests test,op.at,the majority asks whether the union grievances genuinely or sufficiently implicate any provision of the cba,id.at,the grievances rais e a legitimate question of the cba interpretation,id.at the recognition,observation,and privileges provisions are susceptible of the interpretation the union advances,id.at the right of store access the union seeks to enforce can be plausibly derived from these provisions,id.in so doing,i believe the majority strays from permissibly determining whether the union grievances come within the scope of the arbitration provision,diagnostic,at,to impermissibly determining whether there is particular language in the cba which will support the union claim.am,at.
i express no view on the ultimate merits of the union grievances or its interpretations of the observation,recognition,or privileges provisions.i conclude,however,that at least one of these recognition demonstrates that the union asserted right of store access falls within the zone of interests that have received protection in the cba and the union interpretation of the recognition provision is not nearly as implausible as the majority suggests.
the cba recognition provision provides,in pertinent part and with emphasis added 
rite aid recognizes the union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of bargaining in the bargaining unit in respect to rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,and other conditions pertaining to employment for a ll full time and part time selling and associates employed at rite aid stores within the counties identified in the cba.
this provision does not distinguish between existing and newly acquired stores rather,it applies to all employees employed at rite aid stores within the counties covered by the cba.accordingly,under a literal reading,it requires rite aid to recognize the union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees in rite aid stores,whether existing at the time the cba was entered or acquired thereafter.
in,the national labor relations board nlrb ruled that provisions of this referred to as additional stores unlawful because,when read literally,they purport to make the union automatically the exclusive bargaining agent for employees in newly acquired or opened stores,without a election or other demonstration of majority support.see houston div.of the kroger kroger i,we will not permit parties to include employees in a newly created presumptively appropriate unit into a larger unit without a proper assessment of employee sentiment as to representation.a year after kroger i,the court of appeals for the circuit disagreed with the board conclusion regarding the invalidity of such provisions,and concluded that they must be interpreted to mean that the employer waives its right to a board ordered election.retail clerks int l ass local nlrb,see also nlrb retail clerks local,cir agreeing that such provisions waive the employer absolute right to demand an election instead the employer must accept alternative methods of proving majority support.the court noted,however,that t he specific recognition procedures which the clauses permit is a matter for the parties to consider in the first instance,and express ed no opinion whether authorization cards,cards that designate the union as the employee bargaining agent or other procedures may be utilized or objected to consistent with the se clauses.retail clerks,at.on remand,the nlrb adopted the circuit court interpretation,agreeing that such provisions are valid to the extent they operate as contractual commitments by the employer to forgo its right to resort to the use of the board election process in determining the unions representation status in new stores.houston div.of the kroger kroger ii.
the union argues that,in light of kroger i and kroger ii,the recognition provision is ambiguous because it can not mean what it literally,it purports to make the union automatically the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for employees in stores,despite the requirement of some showing of majority support as a prerequisite for such status.moreover,the argument continues,although the recognition provision operates as a waiver of rite aid right to demand a election,neither the recognition provision nor any other provision of the cba sets out the specific recognition procedures by which the union may show majority support in newly acquired stores,retail clerks,at,including whether union representatives may enter newly acquired stores for the purpose of obtaining such majority support.
accordingly,the union seeks the opportunity through arbitration to demonstrate,based on the parties past practices custom,that they understood the recognition provision to grant the union the right to enter newly acquired stores for the purpose of soliciting membership see,consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,explaining that agreements may include implied,as well as express,terms,and that it is well established that the parties practice,usage and custom are of significance in interpreting their agreement internal quotation marks omitted see also warrior gulf,at the labor arbitrator source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract,as the industrial common practices of the industry and the equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it.
is the union position hardly.for though the majority dismisses that position as unpersuasive,op.at,the union has submitted an arbitration decision reaching in a similar case the very result it asks for,see aaa lexis shaw,arb.as well as a decision by the federal district court for the district of oregon enforcing a similar arbitration decision.see albertson local,slip op.both of these arbitrations concerned a grievance challenging an employer refusal,purportedly pursuant to a policy,to permit union representatives to enter new stores to solicit membership.see aaa lexis,at albertson,slip op.at.and in both the on the ambiguity in the parties recognition provisions resulting from the kroger that the parties past practices demonstrated that they understood the bargaining agreement to grant the union the right to enter new stores to solicit membership.see aaa lexis,at albertson,slip op.at.these decisions serve only to underscore that the union asserted right of store access is,at the least,not so plainly unreasonable that it must be regarded as nonarbitrable because it can be seen in advance that no award to the union could receive judicial sanction.john wiley sons,livingston,citing warrior gulf,at.
moreover,the union grievances present at least as strong a case for arbitrability as the grievance in diagnostic,where we relied on implicit limits on the company explicit right to subcontract to conclude that the grievance was arbitrable.at.just as the company subcontracting all work in the bargaining unit would have been inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement recognition of the union as the bargaining agent for the company employees,rite aid refusal to allow union representatives to enter newly acquired stores to solicit union membership and distribute authorization obvious alternative to initiating an election the right to which rite aid has waived by virtue of kroger i is inconsistent with the recognition provision.indeed,it would be anomalous if rite aid could avoid the apparent intent of the recognition,recognizing the union as the bargaining agent for employees in newly acquired stores without requiring the parties to go through an preventing the union from showing majority support through this alternative procedure.
in sum,i believe the recognition provision sufficiently demonstrates that the subject matter of the union grievances falls within the zone of interests that have received protection in the cba and thus falls within the scope of the cba broad arbitration clause.in seeking to compel arbitration,the union is not attempting to enforce a right that is wholly outside the scope of the cba,op.at,such as forcing rite aid to distribute christmas turkeys to its employees,boeing,at.rather,the union seeks to enforce,by arbitrating the meaning of an ambiguous provision of the cba,an asserted right that implicates a fundamental aspect of the parties ongoing relationship under that agreement.with scant evidence of the parties past practices,understandings,prior agreements,or bargaining history,we are to decide whose interpretation of the recognition provision is correct.rather,that function is properly fulfilled by an arbitrator,as the parties have agreed united steel workers int l union trimas,cir if the parties have in fact agreed to arbitrate their dispute,then they have bargained for the arbitrator interpretation of their ours if we were to weigh in on the merits of their case,we would be denying them the benefit of that bargain.emphasis in original internal citation omitted.
the merits and the issue of arbitrability are not inextricably intertwined 
the majority,like the district court,also relies on litton financial printing division national labor relations board,to justify its consideration of the merits of the union grievances.the majority concludes that litton authorizes courts to consider the merits of grievances whenever the merits and arbitrability questions are inextricably intertwined,op.at and these questions are necessarily intertwined where a collective bargaining agreement limit s the scope of arbitration to matters regarding the agreement or its construction,id.at.litton does not support either of these conclusions.
in litton,the supreme court considered the arbitrability of grievances filed on behalf of employees who were laid off almost one year after the parties collective bargaining agreement had expired.to determine whether the grievances were arbitrable,the court first sought to interpret its decision in nolde brothers,local,bakery confectionary workers union,which announced a presumption in favor of arbitration unless negated expressly or by clear implication,and held that,in determining whether a grievance is arbitrable,courts should determine whether the grievance arises under the expired agreement.id.at.the litton court explained that,to arise under an expired collective bargaining agreement,the grievance must involve facts and occurrences that arose before expiration,where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement,or,under normal principles of contract interpretation,involves a disputed contractual right that survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.litton,at.applying this rule,the court determined that the seniority rights the employees sought to enforce did not arise out of the expired collective bargaining agreement because factors such as aptitude and ability on which application of the seniority provision was dependent do not remain constant,but change over time.id.at we can not infer an intent on the part of the contracting parties to freeze any particular order of layoff or vest any contractual right as of the agreement expiration.
the litton court acknowledged that,in determining that seniority rights did not arise under the expired agreement,it had interpreted a substantive provision of the collective bargaining agreement the seniority provision,and necessarily reached the merits of the grievances.see id.at.the court explained,however,that the presumption of arbitrability should not apply with its usual force in the context of grievances 
we acknowledge that where an effective bargaining agreement exists between the parties,and the agreement contains a broad arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.but we refuse to apply that presumption wholesale in the context of an expired bargaining agreement,for to do so would make limitless the contractual obligation to arbitrate.although d oubts should be resolved in favor of coverage,we must determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate this dispute,and we can not avoid that duty because it requires us to interpret a provision of a bargaining agreement.
id.at quoting at t,at emphasis added.
the majority interprets litton as follows because the agreement limited the scope of arbitration to matters regarding the agreement or its construction the supreme court in litton found it necessary to interpret the agreement in order to properly determine the question of arbitrability.op.at.i believe this is incorrect.the litton court did not justify its consideration of the merits based on the language of the parties arbitration provision,but rather on its concern that applying the presumption of arbitrability in the context of an expired bargaining agreement would make limitless the contractual obligation to arbitrate.litton,at emphasis added.indeed,in refusing to apply the presumption of arbitrability wholesale in this context,the court seems to have assumed that applying the presumption with its normal force would have required arbitration in light of the collective bargaining agreement broad arbitration provision.
to support its reading of litton,the majority relies on two decisions from our sister circuits applying litton outside the context of grievances.however,these cases involved a similarly narrow issue whether grievances brought on behalf of individuals who had either been elevated to supervisory positions,or had retired,were covered under bargaining agreements that applied only to employees.see int l of workers,local gkn aerospace,cir where arbitration provision applied only to grievances submitted by employees,supervisor grievance was not arbitrable because a plain reading of the collective bargaining agreement did not permit the possible inference that the supervisor ha d a right to return to the bargaining unit indep.lift truck builders union hyster,cir district court erred in compelling arbitration of retired employee grievance without deciding whether the collective bargaining agreement covers retired employees,because,in so doing,the court had order ed the dispute to arbitration without first determining that it was arbitrable see also united steelworkers of,local fireproofing,cir holding,that supervisor grievance was not arbitrable because the plain meaning of the collective bargaining agreement arbitration provision was that the company has agreed to process any and all disputes involving its employees through the grievance procedures including arbitration,but that disputes concerning supervisory personnel are not included 
in this context,these courts reasoned that the merits of the grievances and the question of arbitrability were intertwined,gkn aerospace,at,or collaps ed into the same inquiry,hyster,at,because,in determining that the grieving employee was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement,the court was necessarily determining that the employee was not entitled to relief under that agreement.for example,in hyster the seventh circuit court reasoned that three questions whether the union has standing to file a grievance on behalf of retired employees,whether the grievance is arbitrable,and whether the grievance has collapse d into the same inquiry whether the collective bargaining agreement covers retired employees.at.
the gkn aerospace and hyster courts were thus presented with the threshold issue of whether the individuals attempting to arbitrate a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement grievance procedure were authorized to do,using the language of diagnostic,whether the interests these individuals sought to enforce came within the zone of interests protected under the agreement.this issue went directly to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to hear the grievance in the first place.terre haute newspaper guild,local thomson newspapers,inc,d,discussing litton and hyster,and reasoning that it is the court responsibility to determine whether the employees may be covered under the collective bargaining agreement before it can send the question to the arbitrator.stated another way,these courts believed they were required to determine,as a threshold matter,whether the employees were authorized to bring grievances under the respective collective bargaining agreement regardless of whether,had they been so authorized,those grievances would have been meritorious.
in our case,the merits of the union grievances and the issue of arbitrability are not intertwined in a similar sense it is undisputed that the cba remains in force and that the union is authorized to bring grievances under it.at bottom,the majority conclusion that the merits and the issue of arbitrability are inextricably intertwined reduces to the conclusion that the union grievances do not actually involve the interpretation of the cba because they are not meritorious.as i have explained,the steelworkers principles prohibit this line of inquiry,and i can not discern from litton any intention on the part of the supreme court to jettison those principles in all contexts 
b.the union dispute is not expressly excluded from arbitration,and there is no forceful evidence of an intention to the contrary 
because the union grievances come within the scope of the cba arbitration provision,i conclude that we are required to compel arbitration.it is undisputed that the cba arbitration provision is broad,and that the presumption of arbitrability applies.accordingly,the union dispute is arbitrable unless the cba contains an express provision excluding it from arbitration,or rite aid the party opposing arbitration produces the most forceful evidence to this effect from the bargaining history.at t,at quoting warrior gulf,at.
neither is true here the cba contains no arbitration exclusion for disputes over the circumstances in which union representatives may enter rite aid stores and rite aid has submitted no forceful evidence from the parties bargaining history suggesting an intention to exclude such disputes from arbitration thus,we must order the parties to arbitrate the grievances even if the union interpretations of the recognition,observation,privileges provisions are frivolous,as engaging in a substantive interpretation of these provisions would involve an impermissible review of the merits 
decisions on the merits,whether easy or difficult,must be left to the arbitrator.diagnostic,at.the majority essentially concludes that the merits question of whether the union has a right of store access to solicit membership is so easy to answer that arbitration is not called for.although the majority reaches this conclusion under the guise of enforcing the parties agreement to arbitrate only those disputes that involve the interpretation of the cba,it conflates that question with whether the union interpretation of the cba is correct.in my view,such analysis veers impermissibly into the merits of the underlying grievances,and fails to heed the supreme court warning that courts not become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement,even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause.warrior gulf,at.
i fear the majority holding will significantly undercut the force of the presumption of arbitrability in cases involving similar arbitration provisions.in such cases,courts in our circuit will presumably conclude that they may examine the merits of every grievance and,upon determining that the arbitration proponent interpretation of the bargaining agreement is not sufficiently plausible,refuse to compel arbitration.i do not believe the steelworkers courts envisioned such a screening role for courts,nor do i believe the litton court intended to announce an exception to the presumption of arbitrability that would effectively swallow the presumption itself.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
one cba covers the northeast division,which comprises lehigh,northampton,northumberland,montour erroneously given as monture in the cba,carbon,wayne,monroe,wyoming,susquehanna,luzerne,columbia,sullivan,lycoming,lackawanna,and pike counties.the philadelphia division agreement covers rite aid stores in philadelphia,delaware,bucks,montgomery,and chester counties.the reading division cba extends to stores in schuylkill,lancaster,berks and lebanon parties agree that the three cbas are identical in all respects relevant to this appeal.for the sake of convenience,we will therefore refer to the cba as though there were a single agreement between rite aid and the union.
the consolidated grievances remain in arbitration pending the outcome of this appeal.
in earlier cases,we had treated a district court arbitrability decision as a finding of fact with respect to the parties intent to arbitrate a particular dispute,and reviewed only for clear error.see lukens steel united steelworkers of am,cir john harkins,waldinger,cir.in rohm and haas,however,we clarified that this more deferential standard applies only where the relevant documents are ambiguous.see at.
under sections and of the cba,grievances are first to be filed with the store manager,and if not resolved within two days,next submitted to a rite aid human resources manager.if the dispute is not resolved in the following three days,it is presented to rite aid director of labor relations.if the matter is still unresolved three days after that,the grievance is referred to arbitration.under section labeled section in the philadelphia division cba,the arbitrator is selected jointly by the parties or,in the event the parties can not agree,selected pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association.
we find it rather curious that the union charges the district court with reaching the merits of the instant dispute in the course of declaring it see infra part iv,while simultaneously urging us to consider favorable to the union merits decisions as evidence of the dispute arbitrability.the merits and arbitrability questions are distinct,and a court must limit itself to addressing the latter,regardless of whether the merits appear favorable or unfavorable to an arbitration proponent.
another recent case submitted by the union pursuant to fed.j,ppg indus.int l chemical workers union council,cir,is inapposite.in ppg,the employer sought to vacate an arbitration award involving the interpretation of a term in a bonus plan that had been expressly incorporated into a cba with a mandatory arbitration clause.both parties agreed in ppg that the bonus plan was subject to the cba arbitration provisions the employer merely disagreed with the arbitrator interpretation of what the employer termed the plain language of the district court vacated the arbitration award,but the fourth circuit reversed,writing that t he company argument simply constitute an attack on the correctness of the arbitrator decision.a court has no warrant to determine the correctness of the arbitrator award.id.at.by contrast,in the instant case rite aid challenges only whether the union grievance is arbitrable inasmuch as neither rite aid nor the union ever agreed to arbitrate the access issue.
rohm haas is a recent opinion of this court.as my dissenting colleague concedes,this court was required to consider substantive provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to determine whether,as the union argued,disability benefits are considered working conditions under the collective bargaining agreement.dissent at emphasis added.this being so,it is obvious that the merits may be considered when necessary to determine arbitrability.the dissent does not take issue with rohm haas,as it can not,because rohm haas is a precedential opinion of this court.inde
