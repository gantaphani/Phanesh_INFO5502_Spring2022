opinion of the court 
in,nova chemicals,and sekisui plastics,entered into a license agreement under which nova was permitted to use a new process to produce a product called piocelan.under the agreement,nova was permitted to sell piocelan products anywhere in the world,except in certain asian countries.nearly twenty years later,nova began selling piocelan products in the asian countries excluded from the license agreement.after sekisui objected that nova was in violation of the license agreement,nova filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief.in granting summary judgment in favor of nova,the district court determined that,based on the plain language of the license agreement,all of its terms expired in.although we find certain portions of the license agreement are ambiguous,we agree with the district court that there is no reasonable interpretation of the agreement under which nova has any continuing obligations to sekisui.accordingly,we will affirm.
in,arco chemical company arco or acc a predecessor to nova entered into an agreement to license technology from sekisui,a japanese company.that agreement included an option to license an earlier version of sekisui piocelan technology.however,arco determined that the process was impractical and permitted the option to expire.by,sekisui had developed a better piocelan and began to negotiate an agreement for arco to market the improved piocelan products in the united states.
in october,representatives from arco and sekisui met in japan.sekisui prepared the first draft of the license agreement and sent a translation to arco.the companies exchanged a number of drafts and proposed modifications.the final draft of the license agreement was prepared by an arco attorney.the license agreement was signed in december and went into effect in january.
at the time the contract was negotiated,sekisui was selling expanded piocelan products that were difficult to ship long distances.while arco was interested in developing products that could be shipped,it was not interested in selling in the asian market,where sekisui was based.
like the earlier agreement between the parties,the license agreement gave arco an option to acquire a license to use sekisui piocelan process.during the three year option period,the license agreement also granted arco an exclusive license to use sekisui secret technical information and patent rights to produce piocelan products and develop a market for them in the united states and canada in particular,this initial license gave arco access to all technical information and,including formulations and equipment designs,useful to produce various piocelan products.the license also included 
any united states or canadian patents or patent applications in the united states or canada now or hereafter owned or controlled by sekisui or wherein sekisui has licensing rights,which are based on inventions made on or before january,to the extent that any of the claims thereof cover piocelan products or technology.
license agreement.in exchange for the option and initial license,arco agreed to pay sekisui in two installments at the beginning of the option period and within eighteen months.
sekisui agreed that it would disclose within the first three months of the option period,all technical information and data related to the piocelan process.sekisui also agreed to provide any technical assistance arco needed to implement the piocelan process.
arco agreed to keep information provided under the license agreement secret and confidential from any third party for a five year period from the date of termination if arco elected to terminate the contract without exercising its option and for a period of ten years from the date of exercise if arco did exercise its option to acquire a license.id.art.iv.
if arco exercised the option,paragraph of the license agreement provided that sekisui would automatically grant arco a exclusive license under all of sekisui intellectual property to produce,sell and use piocelan products in the united states and canada and a nonexclusive license to sell piocelan products in all countries of the world except in the following countries japan,korea,china,hong kong,philippines,vietnam,thailand,malaysia,singapore,indonesia,india,and pakistan.id.in exchange for these rights,arco agreed to make a lump sum payment and to pay royalties on the total volume of piocelan products sold during the life of the license.
the parties dispute in this case is centered around article xi of the license agreement.article xi is titled term and termination.it provides that 
this agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of ten years from the date of exercise by arco of the option in paragraphs and,unless this agreement is terminated earlier as provided in paragraph or article ix.upon payment of the lump sum payment and running royalties due under paragraph,arco shall have a fully right and license to use and sublicense the piocelan process and piocelan products in any of its united states canadian plants and to sell piocelan products produced anywhere in the world subject to paragraph.
in,arco exercised its option to acquire a license as provided in paragraph of the license agreement.in,nova acquired arco and became a party to the license agreement by assignment.
in,nova began selling piocelan products in the asian market.it now sells these products,under the trade name arcel,in china,hong kong,the philippines,singapore,vietnam,and malaysia.when sekisui objected,nova sought a declaratory judgment that the license agreement did not prohibit these sales.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nova,finding that the license agreement had no continuing force after,that the agreement never prohibited nova from selling piocelan products in asia,and that sekisui proposed interpretation raised serious questions about the legality of the contract.

the pennsylvania supreme court has set forth the following definition of ambiguity 
contractual language is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.this is not a question to be resolved in a vacuum.rather,contractual terms are ambiguous if they are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation when applied to a particular set of facts.we will not,however,distort the meaning of the language or resort to a strained contrivance in order to find an ambiguity.

somewhat paradoxically,sekisui,the licensor,argues that it granted nova a permanent license to sell and use its technology.nova,the licensee,argues that the license had a defined term of ten years and expired thereafter.
sekisui maintains that the license agreement provided nova an opportunity to obtain two separate licenses to use its piocelan process.the first is the license set forth in paragraph.the second is the fully license described in article xi.according to sekisui,the fully license only came into being upon payment of the running royalties due under paragraph.thus,the fully license must refer to a license granted only after ten years of royalty payments.
because the contract does not specify a termination date for the fully license described in article xi,sekisui contends that it lasts indefinitely.sekisui also maintains that by incorporating paragraph,the fully license prohibits nova from selling piocelan products in the listed asian countries.thus,sekisui insists that nova is indefinitely barred from selling piocelan products in the listed countries.
conversely,nova argues that the license agreement grants one license lasting only ten years.although the fully license exists upon payment of the running royalties,nova maintains that this simply means the license was contingent on payment of any royalties that had accrued to date.thus,the license agreement has no terms that extend beyond the license period.
further,nova asserts that while the license agreement did not affirmatively grant nova rights to sell in asian countries,it also does not bar nova from selling in those countries.according to nova,a license is a grant of rights that the licensee would not otherwise have,and therefore the exclusion of asian countries from the scope of the license is not an affirmative bar on selling in these countries.thus,if nova would otherwise have a legal right to sell piocelan products in asia absent the license agreement,then the license can not deprive it of that right.accordingly,the agreement does not impede nova from selling piocelan products in asia.
first,we turn to whether the article xi fully license refers to the paragraph license,or a separate license.we find that there are two reasonable interpretations of article xi.first,as sekisui contends,article xi could mean that the parties intended to grant nova a continuing license to manufacture and sell piocelan products at the end of the period of running royalties,in other words when the payments required by article vi were fully.on the other hand,as nova contends and the district court found,the second sentence of article xi could be intended simply to signify what was necessary to maintain the paragraph license during its term.
there is considerable linguistic and structural support for each interpretation.as to the first interpretation,the language of the second sentence of article xi is not identical to the language of paragraph.paragraph provides that 
following the payment by arco to sekisui of the lump sum payment under paragraph a,an exclusive license with the right to sublicense is automatically granted to arco during the term of this agreement under all sekisui po technology,sekisui px technology,sekisui colored bead technology,patent rights,colored bead patent rights to produce,sell and use all products and other resinous materials in the licensed territory.moreover,arco and its sublicensee shall have the right to sell products and other resinous materials in all countries of the world except in the following countries japan,korea,china,hong kong,philippines,vietnam,thailand,malaysia,singapore,indonesia,india and pakistan.
in contrast,the second sentence of article xi,provides that nova shall have a license upon payment of the lump sum payment and running royalties due under paragraph.thus,the paragraph license begins with a lump sum payment.the article xi license on the other hand requires the payment of both the lump sum payment and running royalties.further,the paragraph license is exclusive in the united states and canada,and elsewhere.the article xi license is not exclusive.
in addition,sekisui argument that article xi creates rights and obligations beyond the license is consistent with the license agreement overall structure the license agreement conveys a shifting array of licensing arrangements rather than a single discrete license.first,the license agreement provides a exclusive domestic license during the option period.then,it provides the paragraph exclusive domestic license,and foreign license.in addition,the license agreement conveys an exclusive license to use the trademark piocelan in the united states and canada for the sale of products.license agreement.since the license agreement has at least three separate licensing provisions,it becomes more reasonable to read article xi as doing more than reiterating an earlier license.
on the other hand,the first sentence of article xi provides that this agreement shall have a term from the date arco exercised its option the second sentence of article xi could be read to clarify what was meant by this agreement and to explain that,to maintain its license,arco was required to stay on any accrued royalty is to stay fully.
because there are two linguistically possible,reasonable interpretations of article xi,it is ambiguous.however,as set forth below,we find that it is not necessary to resolve this ambiguity 
we need not resolve any ambiguity in article xi,if the fully license is indeed a separate license enduring past the ten year term of the license conclude that the fully license clearly expired along with sekisui intellectual property rights in the piocelan process.because sekisui does not have continuing intellectual property rights in piocelan,the license agreement has no continuing force.
the license agreement does not explicitly fix a definite duration for the fully license.relying on rossmassler spielberger,sekisui argues that the fully license must therefore be permanent.however,pennsylvania courts hold that where there is no express provision in the contract as to its duration or termination the intention of the parties in that regard is determined from the surrounding circumstances and by an application of a reasonable construction to the agreement as a whole.inst.for sci,gordon and breach,sci.publishers,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted applying pennsylvania law see also rosenfeld rosenfeld,when a contract is silent on its duration,parol evidence is always admissible to show the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract,the situation of the parties,the objects they apparently had in view,and the nature of the subject matter of the agreement,to show whether the agreement was to endure for a reasonable time or for some particular period.price confair,c ontracts which do not fix a definite time for the duration of the relationship which they create are sometimes construed as providing for a reasonable time or some particular period inferred from the nature and circumstances of the undertaking.for example,in thomas thomas flexible coupling,the pennsylvania supreme court applied this rule to determine that a patent license agreement terminated with the expiration of the life of the patents which constituted their subject matter.
indeed,even rossmassler stands for the proposition that,absent an explicit term,the duration of a contract is to be determined based on its subject matter.the pennsylvania supreme court noted in rossmassler that the intention of the parties to an agreement that it should be perpetual and without limit as to duration could not be more properly expressed than by silence as to any time limit or power of revocation.at.however,the ultimate holding of that case was that the courts will always deduce the term from the nature of the if it is at all possible so to do.id.
in evaluating the duration of the claimed fully license,we start with the subject matter of the license agreement.the subject matter of the contract is sekisui patent rights and valuable technical information of a confidential nature relating to the expandable piocelan resins.license agreement,preface app.at.thus,we must consider the duration of the patent rights and trad
