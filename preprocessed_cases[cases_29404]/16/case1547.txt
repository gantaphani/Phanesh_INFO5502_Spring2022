the parties eventually agreed on the terms and conditions of the sale of southeastern to sts and the employment of shoemaker by sts,including a arrangement.the details of the purchase of southeastern and the employment of shoemaker by sts were memorialized in three agreements that the parties executed contemporaneously on march,effective march,sometimes referred to as the date of closing and sometimes as the effective date,to wit the members interest purchase agreement purchase agreement,agreement,and employment agreement.the latter two agreements were first shown to shoemaker and his lawyer at the closing on march.

ii.district court proceedings 
in considering shoemaker motion for summary judgment,the district court established the framework for its analysis by noting that this diversity case turns on the substantive law in mississippi,specifically,that state law applicable to interpreting contracts by determining the intent of the parties in more narrowly framing its task,the district court quoted the mississippi supreme court pronouncement that restrictive covenants are in restraint of trade and individual freedom and are not favorites of the law.it emphasized that the enforceability of such agreements is largely predicated upon the reasonableness and specificity of its terms.
turning to the pertinent provisions of the contracts entered into simultaneously by the parties,the court focused on the contentions of sts that the clauses of the agreements are ambiguous or at least in conflict,and the covenant not to compete in section of the purchase agreement is dominant.the district court examined the wording of the clauses in pari materia and concluded that the intent of the parties was 
for shoemaker to work for sts for a period of five years and that if he quits sic or was terminated during that period,he would be subject to the clause for two years thereafter.however,the court finds that the parties clearly intended that once shoemaker concluded his term of employment,he would no longer be prohibited from competing with sts.
in reaching this determination,the district court focused on the meaning of terminate,termination,and terminated,as used in the agreements and concluded that they were 
defined in the employment documents to include termination for cause but also allow for termination by either party for any reason upon fourteen days written notice.there is no dispute that shoemaker was not terminated for cause nor was he terminated under the fourteen day notice provision.
the court reinforced its determination that,in using variations of the word terminate in the agreements,the parties contemplated that shoemaker employment at sts would be deemed to have been terminated only if it ended prior to the completion of five years as the result of an act taken by one of the parties to the agreements.in underscoring its conclusion that the parties intention was for the word terminate to cover only a cessation of shoemaker employment as the result of an affirmative act of either sts or shoemaker,the court observed that sts 
was very careful in its wording of the
