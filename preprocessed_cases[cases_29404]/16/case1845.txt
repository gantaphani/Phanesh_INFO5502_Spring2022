louisiana bayou furs,bayou furs and william berry berry appeal from the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,motion for a new trial.they also appeal the court grant of judgment as a matter of law for industrias magromer cueros y pieles industrias on its force majeure defense.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
this dispute arises from a contract for the sale of unprocessed nutria skins.on november,industrias entered into an agreement with bayou furs to purchase nutria skins the nutria agreement.industrias is an argentinian company which is a dominant force in the world market for nutria coats and products.during the relevant time period,bayou furs was a louisiana corporation in the business of buying nutria pelts and other furs from louisiana trappers and reselling them in national and international markets 
prior to,industrias routinely purchased pelts directly from louisiana trappers.in june of,industrias representatives were introduced to bayou furs as a potential bulk supplier of fur pelts.in september of,irving camlot camlot,president of bayou furs,informed industrias that bayou furs was prepared to provide a substantial amount of nutrias skins.leonardo grozovsky leonardo,president of industrias,and his son frederico grozovsky frederico,managing director of industrias,invited camlot to visit industrias facilities in argentina and to discuss a possible future business relationship.camlot accepted the invitation and traveled to argentina with jimmy goode,a buyer and grader employed by bayou furs,and berry,chairman of bayou furs board of directors and the director of wetland management for louisiana land exploration company 
while in argentina,camlot and berry negotiated the nutria agreement with leonardo and frederico.nestor molczadzki molczadzki,an industrias employee with years of experience in grading pelts,also attended the negotiations.berry introduced himself as the chairman of bayou furs board of directors and director of office of wetland management.berry described as one of the largest landowners in louisiana.according to industrias,berry was the dominant figure in the negotiations,and repeatedly emphasized connection with bayou furs and its support for the nutria agreement.bayou furs and berry contend that he was merely a bystander to the contract negotiations and that camlot negotiated the agreement for bayou furs.
during the negotiation of the nutria agreement,industrias informed camlot and berry that it required nutria pelts for its winter and spring production requirements.camlot and berry represented that bayou furs could timely deliver the required pelts.industrias alleges that it expressed concerns about dealing with the newly formed bayou furs,and that berry represented that there was no need for concern because stood behind bayou furs agreement.the parties prepared a written agreement in industrias office,and the nutria agreement was executed on november.the nutria agreement was signed by camlot for bayou furs,leonardo for industrias,and also by berry,frederico,molczadzki,and maximilian forman.
the nutria agreement provided that bayou furs would supply nutria skins by february.industrias was obligated to pay per pelt for the highest grade pelts,and lesser amounts for lower grade pelts.under the terms of the nutria agreement,industrias provided a letter of credit in favor of bayou furs as consideration for the first pelts.the agreement provided for industrias right to inspect and grade the skins prior to acceptance.upon acceptance of the skins,industrias was obligated to provide a certificate of inspection,which entitled bayou furs to draw from the letter of credit.the agreement also provided for the sale of another skins at a later date.
in december of,molczadzki traveled to bayou furs warehouse at sicily island,louisiana to inspect and grade of the first nutria skins.bayou furs contends that molczadzki spent two weeks improperly downgrading the skins.camlot informed molczadzki that bayou furs would not sell the skins to industrias on the basis of the improper downgrading,and told molczadzki to return to argentina.after learning of the dispute,frederico joined molczadzki in louisiana in an attempt to secure delivery.frederico and molczadzki contacted berry to urge bayou furs compliance with the terms of the nutria agreement.berry refused to intervene with camlot decision.subsequently,bayou furs sold the pelts one week later to another buyer for forty percent more than the price agreed on in the nutria agreement.
on july,industrias filed suit in federal court against bayou furs,camlot,berry and several of bayou furs shareholders alleging breach of contract,violations of the louisiana unfair trade practices act lutpa,detrimental reliance,intentional misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.industrias dismissed all claims against camlot and bayou furs shareholders prior to trial.
in proceedings,industrias moved to add berry employer,as a.the parties reached an agreement whereby would not be added as a defendant on the basis of agreement to provide a letter of undertaking indemnifying berry for any judgment rendered against him on industrias claims up to.the letter of undertaking also provided that industrias was prohibited from bringing the indemnity agreement to the jury attention unless berry placed his ability to pay a judgment at issue.
the case was tried before a jury in five days.bayou furs and berry moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of industrias case arguing that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a violation of lutpa,a breach of contract for failure to sell the second skins,bad faith,and intentional misrepresentation.the court denied the motion.industrias also moved for judgment as a matter of law asserting that there was undisputed evidence that bayou furs failure to perform under the contract had nothing to do with force majeure.based on camlot judicial admission that the supply of nutrias had nothing to do with poor weather conditions in louisiana,the court granted the motion.the jury found that a breach of contract occurred,berry was not personally obligated to perform the contract,bayou furs and berry violated lutpa,industrias detrimentally relied on representations made by bayou furs and berry,bayou furs and berry intentionally misrepresented material facts when negotiating and executing the contract,but they did not do so with an intent to obtain an unjust advantage or to cause a loss or inconvenience to industrias,bayou furs and berry did not make any negligent misrepresentations to industrias,and bayou furs and berry acted in bad faith.on the basis of the jury factual findings,the district court entered judgment against bayou furs for breach of the nutria agreement,and against bayou furs and berry for violations of lutpa and detrimental reliance.the court entered judgment against bayou furs and berry,jointly and severally,in the amount of.
bayou furs and berry renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial.the motion was denied.bayou furs and berry now appeal,arguing that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,a new trial.they assert that there was insufficient evidence adduced to support industrias claim of a lutpa violation,detrimental reliance,bad faith,and breach of contract on the second skins.they also assert that the court erred in holding that force majeure was inapplicable.further,they contend that the damages awarded were excessive and that berry should not be required to pay more than twenty six percent of the percentage of fault that they assert the jury assigned to him.lastly,they maintain that the district court erred by allowing industrias to refer to the indemnity agreement.
standard of review for judgment as a matter of law and for granting a new trial 
we review de novo a district court grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.stokes emerson,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for a party on an issue.a.reviewing all of the evidence in the record,a court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.in so doing,the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.id.at.
at the outset,we note that the instant action was tried by a jury and that it is the function of the jury to weigh evidence.treadaway societe anonyme,cir.attributing weight to conflicting evidence,and drawing inferences from such evidence,are within the province of the jury and its decision should be given deference if the record contains any competent evidence to support its findings.gibraltar sav.ldbrinkman,cir.we have found that the evidence in the record can support a jury verdict if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable and individuals in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.transoil jersey belcher oil,cir.
with respect to bayou furs and berry request for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure,a trial judge ruling on a motion for new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.bailey daniel,cir.this standard of review is somewhat narrower when a new trial is denied and somewhat broader when a new trial is granted.jones stores,cir.with these principles guiding us,we address the majority of the issues involved in this appeal.
berry argues that he can not be liable,as a matter of law,for a lutpa violation or for industrias detrimental reliance claim.he avers that he is protected by his capacity as a disclosed agent.industrias asserts that berry waived this defense because it was not raised prior to berry rule motion.industrias further argues that berry conceded that he could be found liable for these claims in pleadings.berry counters that he did raise the defense in his answer and summary judgment motion.berry further explains that he did not pursue the defense at trial because industrias conceded in pleadings that its claims against him were in the nature of principal liability thus,berry argues,until the jury found that he was not personally liable as a on the contract,his agency defense did not become relevant.
the district court found that berry waived any capacity defense because he failed to raise the issue prior to the rule motion.however,berry did raise the issue at several junctures prior to the rule motion.in berry answer,he asserted the defense that he was working as an agent for louisiana bayou,and that he is not personally liable for any debts incurred.moreover,in his motion for summary judgment,he raised a capacity defense to all claims.he argued that any fault on the part of an agent for failing to fulfill a contract is chargeable to his principal and not to himself,as an agent.not only did berry raise the defense in his answer and motion for summary judgment,the original order filed in june of,and the modified order filed in december of,both state that,during the contract negotiation,berry act ed at all times as a representative of bayou furs.
a order normally governs the issues to be litigated at trial.mcgehee certainteed,cir it is a rule that a joint pretrial order signed by both parties supersedes all pleadings and governs the issues and evidence to be presented at trial.citation omitted.however,in a memorandum filed the same day as the modified order,berry concede d that he could be personally liable under theories of detrimental reliance.while the order governs the issues to be litigated at trial,and supersedes any prior filings,it does not trump berry very specific concession in the memorandum regarding the possibility of personal liability on the detrimental reliance claim.
on the other hand,berry did not similarly concede that he could be liable for a lutpa violation.instead,he stated in the same memorandum that the defendants concede that were berry found to have obligated himself personally on the contract,he could be liable under all causes of action alleged,but also contend,on the other hand,that if no predicate breach is found,berry can not be found liable for any contract based causes of action,including lutpa.
based on the fact that berry raised a capacity defense to the lutpa claim in his answer and summary judgment motion,the defense was preserved in the order,and the defense was not waived in the memorandum in a similar vein to the waiver regarding detrimental reliance,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that he was not entitled to this defense.
turning to the merits of the defense,we first note that berry statement in the memorandum regarding his liability for a lutpa claim is consistent with his theory that capacity did not become relevant until the jury found he was not personally liable on the contract.when the interrogatories were presented to the jury,two separate questions were asked.first,whether berry personally obligated himself on the contract the personal obligation interrogatory,a question to which the jury answered no.second,whether berry engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce the lutpa interrogatory,a question to which the jury answered yes.because the jury answered no to the personal obligation interrogatory,we agree with berry assertion that he was acting as an agent when the contract negotiations took place.
generally,unless directors or officers of a corporation purport to bind themselves individually,they do not incur personal liability for the debts of a corporation.riggins dixie shoring,so d,citation omitted.the exception to this rule is when there is a justification for piercing the corporate veil.id.at.under louisiana law,there are two situations where the corporate veil may be pierced.one is where the formalities of corporate existence are disregarded to the point where the affairs of the corporation are indistinguishable from the affairs of the officer.egudin carriage court condominium,dehrvill group,so d.the other,which applies in this case,is where an officer commits fraud,malfeasance,or criminal wrongdoing in the name of the corporation.id.at riggins,so d at.industrias has not alleged any criminal wrongdoing.therefore,berry can only be liable if he committed fraud or malfeasance.fraud is defined as a misrepresentation or a suppression of the truth made with the intention either to obtain an unjust advantage for one party or to cause a loss or inconvenience to the other.ann.west.the louisiana courts have not defined malfeasance in the context of piercing the corporate veil.however,black law dictionary defines it as a wrongful or unlawful act.black law dictionary ed.in the instant action,the jury specifically found that although berry misrepresented material facts,he did not do so with the intention either to obtain an unjust advantage over industrias or to cause a loss or inconvenience to industrias.thus,berry did not commit fraud in the eyes of the jury.the jury did,however,find that berry acted in bad faith.nevertheless,under louisiana law,only exceptional circumstances warrant the radical remedy of piercing the corporate veil.korson indep.mall i,so d,cir citing landry charles inn,so d.as such,berry actions,as a matter of law,do not warrant piercing the corporate veil.in sum,because the jury found that berry was not acting in his personal capacity,and because he is protected from lutpa liability by his status as an agent,the district court improperly denied judgment as a matter of law on this issue.
iii.detrimental reliance 
bayou furs and berry contend that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of detrimental reliance by industrias.they also argue that the court erred by submitting the following question to the jury did any of the following defendants represent to industrias that bayou furs would fully perform the terms of the november,contract they assert that this question seeks to transform a binding contractual promise into a representation upon which the detrimental reliance claim is based.they further argue that detrimental reliance applies only when a party makes a representation contrary to,instead of consistent with,prior contractual promises.
sufficiency of the evidence on the detrimental reliance claim 
bayou furs and berry did not raise the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence on the detrimental reliance claim in their rule motion.thus,the issue is being raised for the first time on appeal.issues raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed only for plain error.shipman central gulf lines,cir.under this standard,we will reverse only if the judgment complained of results in a manifest miscarriage of justice.coughlin capitol cement,cir.thus,the question becomes not whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict,but whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict.id.after reviewing the record,we conclude that there was evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that bayou furs and berry made various misrepresentations inducing industrias into the contractual relationship and inducing industrias reliance on bayou furs for all of its nutria needs.
jury question on detrimental reliance 
our standard of review for challenged jury instructions is.first,the challenger must demonstrate that the charge creates substantial doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.hartsell pepper bottling,cir.second,even if the jury instructions were erroneous,we will not reverse if we determine that the challenged instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case.id.we find that the jury was instructed properly.
bayou furs and berry cite no authority for the proposition that detrimental reliance could not be based on statements also made in a binding contract.the district court determined that industrias had proven the facts required by article of the louisiana civil code for imposition of detrimental reliance liability that bayou furs and berry made promises,that industrias reliance on the representation was reasonable,and that industrias reliance caused a change in position to its detriment.see la ann.west.we agree with the district court and conclude that judgment as a matter of law was properly denied as to this claim.
bayou furs and berry contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the lutpa claim because there is insufficient evidence that bayou furs and berry are industrias competitors as required to find a party liable under lutpa.they also contend that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that bayou furs and berry engaged in the type of egregious conduct that forms the basis of a lutpa violation.they argue that the finding of lutpa liability is inconsistent with the jury later finding that they did not act with the intention to obtain an unjust advantage over industrias.because we have already found that berry is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the lutpa claim due to his agency status,we will only address bayou furs arguments.
the district court rejected both arguments asserted by bayou furs.with regard to the argument that bayou furs is not a competitor,the court correctly pointed out that camlot testified that industrias was not only a customer,but a competitor with bayou furs in the international market.
turning to the argument that bayou furs actions were not sufficiently egregious to justify the imposition of lutpa liability,the district court found that lutpa does not require a misrepresentation or unethical conduct to be engaged in with the intent to obtain an unjust advantage or to cause a loss or inconvenience.we agree.lutpa prohibits u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.ann.a west.the statute merely requires a showing of some element of fraud,misrepresentation,deception or other unethical conduct on a defendant part.marshall citicorp mortgage,so d,citation omitted.because lutpa does not require an intent to obtain an advantage or to cause a loss,there is no inconsistency in the jury verdict.see willard v.the john hayward,cir explaining that a jury answers should only be considered inconsistent when there is no way to reconcile them.the jury could have found berry representations,on behalf of bayou furs,that the contract was backed by,and the refusal of bayou furs to perform under the contract due to changed market conditions,unethical.accordingly,the district court correctly denied bayou furs motion for judgment as a matter of law on the lutpa claim.
bayou furs and berry challenge the jury finding that they acted in bad faith by arguing that bad faith requires a finding of intentional and malicious conduct.they assert that the district court confused the jury by substituting the word or for and in three of its five references to the elements of bad faith when reading the charge to the jury.they also argue that the jury finding of bad faith is inconsistent with its earlier finding that the misrepresentations of bayou furs and berry were not made with an intent to obtain an unjust advantage or to cause a loss or inconvenience to industrias.
the district court rejected the challenge to the bad faith finding.the court determined that the evidence regarding bayou furs improper downgrading excuse could rationally support a finding that it acted in bad faith.the instruction requested by bayou furs and berry asked that the jury be charged that bad faith requires an intentional or malicious failure to perform.they can not now complain about this language in the charge.further,since neither bayou furs or berry objected to the charge,we apply the plain error standard of review.russell plano bank trust,cir.we find no plain error in the charge.
in louisiana,an obligor who acts in bad faith is liable for all damages,foreseeable or not,that are a direct consequence of his failure to perform.bond broadway,so d,citing.ann.west.bond defined bad faith as follows 
the opposite of good faith,generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud,or a design to mislead or deceive another,or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation,not prompted by an honest mistake as to one rights or duties but by some interested or sinister motive.
the term bad faith means more than mere bad judgment or negligence,it implies the conscious doing of a wrong for dishonest or morally questionable motives.
id.citations omitted.based on this definition,there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that bayou furs and berry acted in bad faith.a reasonable jury could have rejected the testimony regarding molczadzki unreasonable downgrading and found that bayou furs and berry acted with dishonest or morally questionable motives.we therefore conclude that the district court was correct in denying judgment as a matter of law on the jury finding of bad faith.
vi.breach of contract 
bayou furs next argues that it did not breach the nutria agreement because industrias unreasonably downgraded the nutria skins.industrias counters that extensive evidence regarding the alleged improper downgrading was presented and the jury rejected the testimony,finding that bayou furs did not have any justifiable reason to excuse performance under the nutria agreement.
bayou furs argument was not presented in its rule motion.when a party has not moved for judgment as a matter of law,we review its challenge to evidentiary sufficiency only for plain error.mccann.city refining,cir citation omitted.in other words,this court will reverse only if the judgment complained of results in a manifest miscarriage of justice.united states ex rel.wallace flintco,cir quoting mccann,at internal quotation marks omitted.under review,the inquiry is whether the plaintiff has presented any evidence in support of its claim.bayou furs has not demonstrated that the jury findings in this regard constitute plain error as there is evidence to support the jury determination.
vii.force majeure 
bayou furs and berry assert that the district court erred in granting industrias rule motion on bayou furs force majeure defense.they assert that weather conditions prevented them from performing under the contract and the dis
