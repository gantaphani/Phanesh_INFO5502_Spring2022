larry mann is the owner of roger edwards,llc,a maine limited liability company.edwards had been distributing a furniture wax called briwax since.in june,mann entered negotiations with fiddes,a british wax manufacturer based in cardiff,wales,about becoming a distributor for fiddes.in exchanged from june to august,mann and fiddes principal,robert fiddes gooding,worked out a trial distributorship agreement.the terms were never memorialized in one contract document,but must be gleaned from the exchange of lengthy.mann asked for certain states as protected territory.gooding responded,we would grant territorial rights to the states as requested,with a periodic review rather based on both quantity sold and efforts extended.i would like to discuss this in greater detail with you mann urged gooding to finalize the agreement,and gooding responded,i am pleased to grant territorial rights to those states requested.on august,mann sounds have a deal.the parties stipulated that the agreement did not have a specified termination date and was not for a fixed duration.
edwards began buying fiddes products in september.by november,the relationship was beginning to fray,with mann complaining about inadequate promotional literature and fiddes complaining about unpaid invoices.mann and gooding met in new york in november,but relations did not improve.mann wrote fiddes that he suspected that fiddes was not turning over to him all fiddes supreme business of serious consequence,and fiddes voiced its suspicions that mann was selling his biggest customers briwax instead of fiddes supreme.
on november,mann wrote to gooding asking for gooding to give mann a letter agreement to present to a banker in connection with edwards application for inventory financing.mann later testified that the banker was mann himself,and that he had walked back and forth between two chairs during the conversation reported in the.mann wrote to gooding that the banker had advised him that it could be worth a lot more taking you to court than following through with fiddes wood care.gooding did not send the requested letter agreement,and on november,at,mann wrote gooding 
i have to assume that by your refusal to provide a letter of our agreement,you do realize it is over.period.t oday for that matter,we are done.we will be in a mode of recover our costs through all means we have including offset,clear out inventory we have and pursue litigation.
that same day at,gooding responded 
your clear decision to revoke all official distribution rights for our range of wood finishing materials in the agreed states is indeed disappointing,however not surprising.it has become evident from your recent correspondence that you had neither the financial means nor the intention to develop our business any further.
two days later,after further from mann requesting the letter for the banker,gooding sent mann an that reproduced the two november excerpted above and concluded we will not respond to any further requests concerning the above whilst the balance of your account remains unpaid.
edwards brought suit in the state court of maine for breach of contract and specific performance.the breach alleged was stated in one simple paragraph 
the defendant has breached its agreement with the plaintiff by bypassing the defendant distributorship in order to sell directly to end users within the exclusive territorial states provided to plaintiff,by permitting other distributors to market and distribute fiddes products within the plaintiff exclusive territory.
fiddes removed the case to federal court and counterclaimed for amounts edwards owed on unpaid invoices for fiddes products.
fiddes moved for summary judgment on the ground that if there was a contract,edwards terminated it on november,and was not entitled to specific performance or to damages accruing after that date.the magistrate judge granted partial summary judgment based on edwards admissions of key facts stated in fiddes summary of undisputed facts.roger edwards,llc fiddes son,d.fiddes stated 
robert fiddes gooding wrote to larry mann on november,outlining the two that reflected mann termination of the parties relationship and robert fiddes acceptance of that termination.plaintiff admissions,exhibit aa,attached hereto at tab,authenticated in plaintiff admissions,at.
emphasis added.the statement thus references a november that in turn reproduced the two november that fiddes said terminated the contract.the exhibit aa referred to in the statement actually reproduces three,rather than two,but exhibit aa does include two november communications.in the first of these,at,mann stated,i t is over.period.today sic for that matter,we done.goodings response at on the same day stated,your clear decision to revoke all official distribution rights is indeed disappointing,however not surprising.edwards admitted paragraph of fiddes statement,which characterized the november as mann termination and fiddes acceptance of that termination.

at trial the jury answered special interrogatories.the jury found that a contract existed between the plaintiff and the defendant granting the plaintiff the protected right to sell the defendant products in states and that the defendant did not breach the contract.the magistrate judge entered judgment for fiddes on the jury verdict and also entered judgment for fiddes in the amount of plus costs and interest on its counterclaim.
edwards contends that the magistrate judge erred in entering partial summary judgment against it and in denying its requested anticipatory repudiation instruction.fiddes,but its appeal is limited to an argument about what should happen on remand if we were to reverse.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,giving the nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences.nicolo philip morris,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions and affidavits on file show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.conjectural allegations,conclusory assertions,and inconsequential evidence do not suffice to establish a genuine issue of fact.nicolo,at.
edwards contends that the magistrate judge erred in holding that edwards had admitted that mann terminated the contract on november and that fiddes accepted that termination.edwards states plaintiff made no such admission.the record shows edwards did indeed make such an admission.
