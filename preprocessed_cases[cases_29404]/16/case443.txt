this appeal is a sequel to events that have already been litigated before this court.see pan am.grain,ports,cir.in that case we ruled that the loss of the integrated tug and barge zorra itb zorra came about because of the negligence of its crew in straying from the charted navigation channel,and claimed by the itb zorra owner,the pan american grain company pan american because of underwater obstructions in the docking area 
the starting point to the present appeal,however,is the issuance of a marine hull insurance policy the policy by the home insurance company home to pan american that provided coverage up to in the event the itb zorra was lost as a result of any of a variety of casualties.pan american filed a claim on this policy for losses sustained when the itb zorra caught fire on april.home denied the claim,alleging that the casualty was the result of the vessel unseaworthiness a condition which is excepted under the terms of the policy.thereafter,home filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment of,to which pan american responded with a counterclaim seeking recovery under the policy for the full amount of,in addition to various other damages.the home ins.pan am.grain,no,answer and.three years of litigation followed,at the end of which home and pan american entered into a settlement agreement,the home ins.pan am.grain,no,settlement agreement,the interpretation of which is the central issue of this appeal 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,home paid pan american in exchange for which pan american agreed that home would receive one third of any future recovery from third parties by pan american until home had recovered,and one third of all additional pan american recoveries over a total of until home recouped its full.settlement agreement at para.at that time,pan american was immersed in several attempts to recover damages for this casualty,including an arbitration proceeding in new york,five additional lawsuits in the district court for puerto rico against various private parties,and an action against the coast guard in miami.
the settlement agreement further provided that until such time as home recouped an initial sum of,pan american was required to notify home of any proposed third party settlement of itb zorra claims,and to receive home written approval before effectuating any such settlement.id.at para.however,once the first were recovered by home,although home was entitled to share in additional settlements over,up to the total paid to pan american,prior notice to home and its approval were not required.
one further provision of the settlement agreement is of relevance indeed,it is at the crux of the present dispute although home was to share in all recoveries of third party itb zorra claims up to the total paid by home to pan american,home was not entitled to share in any verdict or award in favor of pan american that specifically and separately award s pan american a recovery for punitive damages loss of use.id.at para.emphasis supplied.
approximately one year after the parties entered into the settlement agreement,home learned that pan american had settled one of its outstanding itb zorra suits,with ochoa fertilizer,for the ochoa settlement.pan american gave no prior notice of this settlement to home,nor did home give approval for pan american to enter into the ochoa settlement.pan american claimed that the ochoa settlement was for damages for loss of use of the itb zorra,and thus specifically excluded from the settlement agreement.home,however,was not so easily put off.it contended that,irrespective of the label given to the amounts recovered under the ochoa agreement,these sums could not constitute a recovery for loss of use of the itb zorra,since under maritime law a shipowner is barred from recovering for loss of use where the insured vessel was a total loss,as was the case of the itb zorra.see thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.only in a partial loss situation is there liability for loss of use damages.home further alleged that the ochoa settlement was not the result of a verdict or award,and thus was also not excluded from coverage of the settlement agreement.home therefore insisted on entitlement to one third of the ochoa settlement pursuant to the settlement agreement,to be credited towards the amounts home had paid to pan american.pan american rejected this demand and home responded by filing this action,seeking to recover one third of the ochoa settlement,plus interest and attorneys fees.
in the course of the proceedings,home filed for summary judgment alleging breach of the settlement agreement,and fraudulent inducement of the settlement agreement.pan american on home claim of breach of the settlement agreement,and opposed the claim of fraudulent inducement,moving for summary judgment on both issues.
the motions were initially argued before a magistrate judge who ruled that there existed no genuine issues of material fact because the settlement agreement was clear on its face as excluding home from recovering for damages for loss of use of the itb zorra.home ins.pan am.grain,report and recommendation.thus,the magistrate judge concluded that,as a matter of law,pan american did not breach the terms of the settlement agreement when it failed to notify home,or seek home approval,of the ochoa settlement.the magistrate judge further found that the ochoa settlement constituted an award because it was an agreement granted by a formal mutually agreed upon resolution to negotiation bound by voluntary signatures of the involved parties.report and recommendation at.in so ruling,the magistrate judge relied on black law dictionary,pocket edition bryan garner et,ed,which defines award as to grant by formal process or by judicial decree.see report and recommendation at.the magistrate judge,in effect,considered that if the term award referred only to the result of a formal judicial process,it would be redundant to the alternative term,verdict,contained in the settlement agreement,which also encompasses a judicial decision.id.at.he thus found that the ochoa settlement was an award,and that therefore home was not entitled to share in that settlement under the terms of the settlement agreement.additionally,the magistrate judge decided that because the ochoa settlement plainly states that the payment of is to settle claims or future claims for loss of use of property,id.at,the recovery of such damages was excluded by the specific terms of the settlement agreement.
the magistrate judge reasoning and recommendation that summary judgment be granted in favor of pan american was adopted in essence by the district court,see home ins.pan am.grain,d,and this appeal was taken from that decision.
the standard of review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.tum barber foods,cir.the same standard of review is applicable to a district court interpretation of a settlement agreement,because it essentially involves the revisiting of a question of law.see alternative energy,paul fire marine ins,cir.
we disagree with the district court interpretation of the term award.under puerto rican law,i f the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties,the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.laws ann.this court has endorsed the puerto rico supreme court conclusion that clear terms are those that in themselves are lucid enough to be understood in one sense alone,without leaving any room for doubt,controversies or difference of interpretation heirs of ramírez superior court,internal citation omitted,quoted in catullo metzner,cir see also borschow hosp.med.supplies,césar castillo,cir espousing same standard.our disagreement with the district court about the meaning of award does not suggest that the term itself admits of ambiguity.it is our view that the interpretation below went beyond the clear meaning of the term as used in legal writing in general,and in the settlement agreement in particular,by misconstruing the voluntary settlement negotiation between parties as the kind of formal process referred to in the black pocket edition definition.
black law dictionary ed defines award in keeping with our understanding of what that term means in everyday legal parlance 
award,vb.to grant,concede or adjudge to.to give or assign by sentence or judicial determination or after careful weighing of evidence.thus,a jury awards damages the court awards an injunction one awards a contract to a bidder.to confer as being deserved or merited.
award,n.the decision or determination rendered by arbitrators or commissioners,or other private or extrajudicial deciders,upon a controversy submitted to them also the writing or document embodying such decision.
clearly,the ochoa settlement does not come within the definition of award when used as a noun,as it is not a extrajudicial determination by third party decision makers such as would be the case of an award by an arbitrator.furthermore,the ochoa settlement certainly is not a document embodying such a decision.rather,the ochoa settlement is the product of a private negotiation between parties to a lawsuit.neither does the ochoa settlement come within the principal definition of award when used as verb,which connotes judicial or action after careful weighing of evidence.even the secondary meaning of its use as a verb,as t o confer as being deserved or merited,which refers to events such as the granting of an honor,title,or medal,implies unilateral action by the grantor,rather than a negotiation of the sort which takes place in the settlement of a dispute.such a definition does not encompass the ochoa settlement.
most important to our view,and a factor apparently not considered by the district court,is that it is difficult to countenance that sophisticated parties such as those involved in the settlement agreement,represented by counsel,would not have used the term settlement rather than award had they intended to also exclude negotiated settlements,as the term is normally used,from the settlement agreement.the term settlement is well known to attorneys,and its meaning is distinctly different from what is normally understood to be meant by the term award.see id.at defining settlement.
indeed,the text of paragraph of the settlement agreement,when read as a whole,further supports the interpretation that an award is distinct from a settlement.it indicates that home will obtain the lesser of or of any recovery made,whether obtained by way of suit,arbitration,claim,verdict,award,settlement,or otherwise,but excludes from such recoverable amounts only any verdict or award in favor of pan american that specifically and separately award s pan american a recovery for punitive damages loss of use.settlement agreement at para.emphasis supplied.it then goes on to allow home to also share in additional recoveries whether obtained by way of suit,arbitration,claim,verdict,award,settlement,or otherwise,in excess of excluding any recovery for punitive damages loss of use as described above.id.emphasis supplied.the omission of settlement from the description of those recoveries of punitive damages and loss of use that are not subject to sharing,in the same paragraph where the term was twice explicitly included elsewhere,strongly suggests a recognition that the types of recoveries that were described award and verdict do not themselves incorporate a settlement.
we have no doubt that the ochoa settlement was not an award from which home was excluded in participating under the settlement agreement.
the district court also erred in concluding that the ochoa settlement was excluded from the terms of the settlement agreement as a recovery for loss of use of the itb zorra.we are inevitably led to this conclusion by the text of the ochoa settlement itself.
as a result of a complaint filed against ochoa and others in which pan american claimed extensive fire damage to the tug and sought compensation for damages,losses,and expenses to the tug in the amount of,pan am.grain continental grain,filed,ochoa entered into a settlement agreement with pan american.that agreement states,in relevant part 
settlement.the undersigned,pan american,for and in consideration of the payment of,as more particularly described in paragraph below,does hereby remise,release and discharge ochoa of and from all actions,causes of action,suits,claims,damages,covenants,contracts,agreements,judgments,costs and demands,whatsoever in law or in equity,foreseen or unforeseen,matured or unmatured,known or unknown,accrued or not accrued,in connection with the incident that occurred on the day of april,which allegedly caused loss of use of property and damage to property of pan american 
payment to releasing party.by express agreement of the parties hereto,the payment made by the pan american is allocated in settlement of ochoa claims or future claims for loss of use of property 
full and complete settlement.pan american acknowledges that this settlement is expressly intended to be a full and complete settlement of all disputed claim s made or which could be made between pan american and ochoa arising out of the april,incident described above 
ochoa settlement at emphasis supplied.
the district court determined that a reading of pan american claims against ochoa,combined with the ochoa settlement,did not provide sufficient evidence to determine that said agreement was not for loss of use.on the contrary the settlement agreement specifically states that it is in settlement of claims or future claims for loss of use of property.home ins.pan am.grain,d at.this analysis leaves aside the contents of paragraphs and of the ochoa settlement,which make explicit that the was paid in consideration not only for ochoa release from any claims of loss of use,but for its release from all possible claims,on the basis of any cause of action,which arose from the fire on the itb zorra thus,even were negotiated settlements for loss of opposed to verdicts or awards for loss of from the notice,approval,and sharing provisions of the settlement agreement,the ochoa settlement,insofar as it also settled other claims,was not so excluded.
from the record before us it is clear that the ochoa settlement is neither an award nor a verdict.furthermore,irrespective of how the proceeds of that settlement may have been labeled by pan american,they can not properly be construed as exclusively for loss of use of the itb zorra 
we thus must conclude that the district court erred in not finding that pan american breached the settlement agreement when it failed to notify home of the ochoa settlement prior to entering into the same,and when it refused to share in the recovered proceeds in the manner specified by the settlement agreement.
we have considered all other arguments of the parties,and determined that they are without substance.
the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instruction that judgment be entered on behalf of home,in the manner consistent with this opinion.
considering that this is an action brought pursuant to our diversity jurisdiction,home shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs.
reversed and remanded.
