this case presents the question of whether ubs financial services,ubs and citigroup global markets,citi are required,as members of the financial industry regulatory authority,finra,to arbitrate disputes arising out of the services they provided to carilion corporation in connection with its dollar bond issues.carilion claimed that during the course of providing those services,ubs and citi made numerous misrepresentations to it and breached numerous duties.to resolve its claims,carilion initiated an arbitration proceeding against ubs and citi under finra rule which requires finra members to arbitrate disputes with a customer at the customer request.
ubs and citi commenced this action to enjoin the arbitration proceedings,contending that carilion was not a customer as that term is used in finra rule and that,in any event,carilion waived any right to arbitrate by agreeing to the forum selection clause contained in written agreements with ubs and citi.the district court rejected these arguments and denied ubs and citi motion for injunctive relief.
we affirm.as explained herein,we conclude that carilion,by purchasing ubs and citi services,was indeed a customer entitled to arbitration under finra rule and that the forum selection clause relied on by ubs and citi did not have the effect of superseding or waiving carilion right to arbitrate.
carilion is a healthcare organization that operates hospitals and clinics in virginia.in,it decided to issue municipal bonds to finance the renovation and expansion of one of its hospitals and to refinance existing debt.carilion retained ubs and citi to advise it on the structure of the bond issues and to assist it in implementing the financing plan.
as carilion alleges in its statement of claim filed with finra,ubs and citi recommended that carilion issue a large percentage of its bonds as bonds and purchase interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on those bonds.bonds are,instruments for which the interest rates are reset periodically through an auction process.during the process,bidders place purchase and sell orders for the bonds through who have contracted with the issuer.the bonds are then sold at the lowest rate at which they can be sold at par.if there are insufficient orders to purchase all of the bonds being sold at auction,the auction fails,and the interest rate jumps to a contractual maximum rate until the next auction.
carilion followed ubs and citi advice and accordingly,in december,issued in face value of bonds and in face value of bonds which are not at issue in this case.
in addition to providing carilion with advice on the structure of the bond issues,carilion claims that ubs and citi also served as underwriters for the bonds,purchasing the bonds from carilion and reselling them to investors served as lead for carilion bond auctions sold to carilion,through their affiliates,interest rate swaps that they had recommended to protect carilion from fluctuations in the bonds interest rates acted as carilion agents in dealing with the rating agencies conducted discussions with bond insurers on carilion behalf and provided monitoring and advisory services on the bonds and the swaps.for their services,ubs and citi earned an underwriter discount,part of which constituted a management fee for their assistance in structuring and managing the transaction,and annual fees of basis points in exchange for managing the bond auctions.
the parties documented their business arrangements in two types of contracts agreements and underwriting agreements.the agreements,executed on december,two with ubs and two with citi provided that ubs and citi would run the periodic auctions.the underwriting agreements,executed on december,one with ubs and one with citi provided that ub s and citi would purchase the bonds from carilion and resell them to the public.
as carilion alleges in its arbitration claim,in february,the bond market for carilion bonds collapsed when ubs and citi stopped submitting support bids for the bonds at the auctions.carilion interest payments skyrocketed,and the swaps did not provide the designed protection.consequently,carilion was forced to refinance,losing millions of dollars in the process.carilion claimed that ubs and citi misled it on the true nature of the bond market by failing to disclose that they had a practice of placing support bids to prevent failure at every auction for which they were the lead.carilion claimed that ubs and citi conduct violated their fiduciary duty,amounted to fraud and negligent misrepresentation,violated the securities exchange act of,violated the virginia securities act,and violated municipal securities rulemaking board msrb and finra duties.to resolve these claims,carilion initiated the arbitration proceedings with finra on february,naming ubs and citi as respondents.
finra is a private organization,formed in,that has the authority to exercise comprehensive oversight over all securities firms that do business with the public.ubs fin,cir quoting.both ubs and citi are finra members and,when becoming finra members,agreed to comply with its rules.see finra bylaws,art.iv,a.finra rule provides that when customers so request,finra members must participate in arbitration under the finra code of arbitration procedures,so long as t he dispute is between a customer and a member or associated person of a member and t he dispute arises in connection with the business activities of the member or the associated person.
after carilion initiated arbitration proceedings,ubs and citi commenced this action,seeking a declaratory judgment that finra lacks jurisdiction over the arbitration and an injunction against the arbitration proceedings.in a motion for a preliminary injunction,ubs and citi contended that carilion was not a customer entitled to arbitration under the finra rules and that carilion,in any event,agreed,in the forum selection clause of the agreements,to litigate,rather than arbitrate,all disputes in a federal court in new york county.
the district court denied ubs and citi motion for a preliminary injunction,focusing primarily on why ubs and citi were unlikely to succeed on the merits.ubs fin,carilion clinic,jag,wl.july.the court concluded that carilion was a customer under the finra rules because there is a federal policy favoring arbitration carilion was within the plain meaning of the term customer other courts have consistently held that an issuer of municipal securities who purchased financial services from a finra member is a customer under finra rules and finra itself seems to have rejected the plaintiffs argument.id.at.the court also concluded that the forum selection clause in the agreements did not displace ub s and citi arbitration obligation,concluding that there is a federal policy favoring arbitration the language of the forum selection clause is susceptible to an interpretation favoring arbitration because it only requires actions and proceedings to be brought in federal court and does not mention arbitration and ubs and citi interpretation conflicts with finra practices with respect to scheduling arbitration.id.at.
when,following the district court ruling,the parties agreed that there was nothing further to litigate,the court entered final judgment on august,dismissing the action.this appeal followed.
ubs and citi,as finra members,are generally required by the finra rules to arbitrate disputes with customers when arbitration is requested by the customer and the dispute arises in connection with the business activities of the member.finra rule carilion,claiming to be a customer of ubs and citi,requested arbitration of its claims that ubs and citi breached duties in connection with services they provided to carilion on its bond issues.the parties agree that if carilion was indeed a customer of ubs and citi,ubs and citi became contractually obligated to proceed with arbitration on carilion request unless,of course,carilion waived its right to arbitration,as claimed by ubs and citi and as is addressed in part iii,below.but ubs and citi claim that carilion was not a customer,as that term is used in the finra rules,and that therefore they have no contractual obligation to arbitrate.they maintain that carilion claims did not relate to a brokerage account or investment relationship with ubs or citi and that the term customer under the finra rules is limited to persons who received investment or brokerage services,citing fleet boston robertson stephens,innovex,cir holding that a party receiving banking and financial advice was not a customer under the national association of securities dealers nasd rules and therefore could not invoke members arbitration obligations.
carilion argues that customer,as used in the finra rules,is a broad term that is not limited to only investors.it contends that the scope of finra regulation is broader than just protecting investors and that courts have not so limited the term customer in construing the finra rules.relying on a dictionary definition,carilion claims that a customer is anyone who purchases some commodity or service.
in becoming members of finra,ubs and citi agreed to mandatory arbitration of specified disputes with customers when the customer requests such arbitration.thus,when carilion initiated arbitration proceedings,it invoked ubs and citi obligation under the finra rules,giving rise to a contractual obligation to arbitrate if in fact carilion qualified as a customer,as that term is used in the finra rules.see.square,aune,cir.thus,what constitutes a customer lies at the heart of whether ubs and citi have an obligation to arbitrate.
the finra rules do not define customer.they do limit the term to exclude from its scope any broker or dealer.finra rule i but as to and,the term is left undefined.nonetheless,the finra rules do give an informing context by providing that arbitrable disputes must arise in connection with the business activities of the finra member,thus suggesting that for a person to obtain arbitration,the person must be a customer with respect to a finra member business activities.see finra rule.the finra rules give further context by suggesting that the business activities of a finra member involve investment banking or securities business.see finra rule r finally,the scope of finra regulatory interest similarly indicates the scope of relevant business activities.finra mission,among other things,is t o promote through cooperative effort the investment banking and securities business,to standardize its principles and practices,to promote therein high standards of commercial honor,and to encourage and promote among members observance of federal and state securities laws t o adopt,administer,and enforce rules of fair practice and rules to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts in practices and t o promote among members,and to investigate and adjust grievances between the public and members and between members.restated certificate of incorporation of financial industry regulatory authority,july,emphasis added see also,at using finra restated certificate of incorporation to reject ubs contention that finra has a narrow mandate.
but subject to the scope indicated by its context in the finra rules,the term customer in rule still retains its generally accepted meaning one that purchases a commodity or service.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.
coupling the contextual indicators from finra and the dictionary definition of customer,we thus conclude that when finra uses customer in rule,it refers to one,not a broker or dealer,who purchases commodities or services from a finra member in the course of the member business activities insofar as those activities are covered by finra regulation,namely the activities of investment banking and the securities business.to construe customer in a manner that is consistent with the context of the finra rules serves not only to provide customers of finra members the opportunity to arbitrate disputes arising in connection with finra members business activities,but also to fulfill finra charter to investigate and adjust grievances between the public and members.
our definition is also fully supported by the decisions of other courts that have faced analogous questions of who is a customer within the meaning of finra rule.see,at ubs fin.servs.city of pasadena,no.cv rgk jcx,wl,at.july,morgan sec.citizens prop.ins,d.
in west virginia university hospitals,ubs sought to enjoin arbitration under the finra rules,as it did here,contending that west virginia university hospitals was not a customer.at.just as here,ubs had provided services to west virginia university hospitals in connection with the hospitals issuance of bonds.the court observed that ubs served west virginia university hospitals as both the lead underwriter and the main responsible for facilitating the dutch auctions in which the hospitals bonds were resold and their interest rates set.id.at.in concluding that west virginia university hospitals was a customer of ubs entitled to finra arbitration,the second circuit held that the term customer in finra rule includes at least a or who purchases,or undertakes to purchase,a good or service from a finra member.id.at.thus,because west virginia university hospitals purchased a service,specifically auction services,from ubs,it was ubs customer.id.
in reaching its conclusion,the court rejected the same arguments that ubs and citi make here that the term customer is restricted by finra mandate to those persons receiving investment or brokerage services.the court explained that while finra mission does indeed include investor protection,its role and scope of authority is clearly broader 
finra purposes are not limited to investor protection.rather,as previously noted,finra serves as the sole organization chartered under the exchange act and exercises comprehensive oversight of the securities industry.among its stated purposes are to encourage and promote among members observance of federal and state securities laws t o investigate and adjust grievances between the public and members and between members and t o adopt,administer,and enforce rules of fair practice.ubs does not explain why customer should be limited to investors in light of finra purposes,its other broad definitions of customer applicable to other provisions,and the ordinary usage of the term.
at citations omitted.we find the court reasoning persuasive and equally applicable to the circumstances here.
ubs and citi rely heavily on the eighth circuit decision in fleet boston to support their more limited definition of customer as referring to investors.in fleet boston,the court construed language in the nasd rules,a predecessor to the finra rules,and rejected a claim that customer means broadly everyone who is not a broker or dealer.at.the court explained,we do not believe that the nasd rules were meant to apply to every sort of financial service an nasd member might provide,regardless of how remote that service might be from the investing or brokerage activities,which the nasd oversees.id.it then found that the nasd rules support a general definition of customer as one who receives investment and brokerage services or otherwise deals more directly with securities than what occurred here.id.emphasis added.the court,however,did not explain its definition further by describing what relationship might deal more directly with securities than what occurred here.for this reason and because the court was faced with a purported customer who had merely received financial advice,we can not take its holding to limit the scope of customer to one who receives investment and brokerage services,as ubs and citi argue.
ubs and citi also contend that finding carilion to be a customer creates an unnecessary conflict between finra and msrb rules because carilion,as a new issuer of securities,would be a customer under the finra rules but not under the msrb rules.the msrb municipal securities rulemaking board is a organization that,similar to finra,regulates the municipal securities market.
msrb rule d defines a customer as any person other than a broker,dealer,or municipal securities dealer acting in its capacity as such or an issuer in transactions involving the sale by the issuer of a new issue of its securities.thus,while carilion is a cus
