the district court confirmed an arbitration award and later entered summary judgment against the assertion of certain compensation claims on the theory that they had been disposed of in the arbitration proceeding.although the arbitral plaintiffs achieved a large measure of success in the arbitration,they appeal,arguing they should be free to further litigate their compensation claims in court.we disagree and affirm.
the underlying dispute involved the employment claims of a group of former employees of robertson stephens,rsi,and was the subject of the longest arbitration ever held before the new york stock exchange.because the lead plaintiff in arbitration was eric alt,we refer to the appellants collectively as alt,as do the parties.alt asserted claims in arbitration under various theories of liability for over million in damages.the arbitral panel heard many witnesses over two years and awarded over million plus interest to of the alt claimants.fifteen claimants received nothing.
a subset of alt employment claims were stayed in federal court during the arbitration.after it had confirmed the arbitration award,the united states district court for the district of massachusetts was asked to enter summary judgment against alt on these stayed claims.the essential question was whether the confirmed arbitral award precluded the alt claimants from pursuing in court claims against robertson stephens group,rsgi,the owner of rsi,and fleetboston financial corporation fleet itself the owner of rsgi,for deferred compensation under two agreements a cash equivalent plan cep of deferred cash compensation awarded to five alt claimants in and to in,and a restricted stock unit plan rsu awarded to all claimants in the form of restricted stock units that could be converted to an equal number of rsgi shares.
these deferred compensation claims had clearly been before the arbitrators as to rsi,and alt had named fleet and rsgi themselves as parties to the arbitration proceedings,although both denied the panel had authority over them.alt also advanced a variety of alternative theories as to why the arbitral panel could hear the deferred compensation claims regardless of whether fleet and rsgi were parties to the arbitration proceedings,including that rsi was an of rsgi and that rsi was itself liable for payment under the compensation plans.
the district court,construing the arbitral award,concluded that judgment should enter against alt on its deferred compensation claims because it read the arbitral award as saying both that the essence of those claims had been litigated during the arbitration proceedings,and that rsgi and fleet were parties in the arbitration proceedings.alt now appeals.
we affirm.it is clear that the arbitral award did decide the essence of alt two deferred compensation claims against rsi,rsgi,and fleet.alt belated attempt to seek remand to the arbitration panel for clarification of the award after the district court had confirmed that award was simply too little too late.this conclusion is consistent with traditional res judicata principles.
we truncate our description of events to the minimum needed to explain our reasoning.
alt is a group of former employees of rsi,an investment banking firm and wholly owned subsidiary of rsgi,which was itself a wholly owned subsidiary of fleet.fleet began winding down rsi operations in july.
in december,alt filed nyse arbitration claims against respondents fleet,rsi,rsgi,and fleet securities,fsi,another fleet subsidiary,for breach of promises to pay bonuses in and violation of the worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act,severance pay violation of state wage statutes and fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.alt statement of claims aggregated the four respondents together and did not differentiate its claims between them.fsi was dismissed as a party in january.
as a nyse member firm,rsi was required to arbitrate,and it filed an answer to alt initial statement of claims in march.subsequently,rsgi informed alt that the employees had triggered the forfeiture provisions of the cep and rsu deferred compensation plans they had been issued and that it did not intend to pay alt under either plan.this led alt to file an amended statement of claims,which included claims for breach of the cep and rsu contracts against all respondents.like alt original claims,these claims did not differentiate among the respondents.
rsi responded to alt amended statement of claims in july.while rsgi did not itself answer alt claims,counsel also represented on several occasions to dismiss rsgi and fleet from arbitration on the grounds that neither were members,allied members,or member organizations of the nyse and that neither had agreed to arbitrate.alt opposed each of rsi attempts to dismiss rsgi and fleet.the arbitration panel never acted upon rsi motions that rsgi be dismissed.
concurrent with these early stages of the nyse arbitration,fleet,rsi,rsgi,and fsi filed an action against alt in suffolk superior court in march,seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment and a stay of the arbitration as to rsgi and fleet,again on the basis that neither rsgi nor fleet were nyse members and that neither had agreed to arbitrate.
alt removed the action to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.the district court declined the request of the litigation plaintiffs the arbitration respondents to stay the arbitration as to rsgi and fleet,and instead stayed its own proceedings pending final resolution of the nyse arbitration 
although the federal proceedings were stayed as of april,in june alt successfully sought leave to file counterclaims,including claims pertaining to the cep and rsu plans.alt sought leave on the basis that if the nyse arbitration panel ultimately determined that it lacked jurisdiction over one of the arbitration respondents,alt claims against them could be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.the entry of judgment against alt on those counterclaims is the subject of this appeal.
after the district court declined rsi,rsgi,fsi,and fleet request for a stay of the arbitration but before taking evidence itself,the arbitration panel,at the request of both sides,sought clarification from the district court as to whether its order required rsgi and fleet to arbitrate.the district court issued a responsive subsequent order stating that its initial order had not required rsgi or fleet to arbitrate and that,in its view,whether the two were required to arbitrate was an issue properly left for the federal district court for the southern district of new york.alt never sought an order from the southern district clarifying whether rsgi was required to arbitrate.
the hearings in the arbitration began in january.rsgi and fleet continued to maintain they could not be forced to arbitrate.alt,by contrast,argued that the arbitrators had jurisdiction over rsgi and fleet.alt also argued that even if rsgi and fleet were not parties,each of alt claims could be levied against rsi,which was unquestionably a party,and therefore could be resolved by the panel.first,alt argued that rsi,rsgi and fleet were so interconnected that the actions of fleet and rsgi can be imputed to rsi under a number of principles,including agency,alter ego,and single employer doctrines.second,alt argued that because the cep and rsu plans were compensation promised to alt by rsi in exchange for services performed for rsi,rsi could be held in breach of contract for rsgi alleged failure to honor the plans.finally,alt argued that rsi could be held liable for the cep and rsu claims because rsi arbitration agreement with its employees extended to all employment claims against rsi or its current or former agents,affiliates or employees,thus rendering rsi liable for those claims.significantly,alt asserted no claim against rsgi or fleet that they were liable independent of any liability of rsi.
the arbitration proceedings lasted more than two years and included testimony from witnesses and the submission of over four thousand exhibits.each of the alt claimants presented evidence regarding the cep and rsu claims to the arbitration panel.fleet representatives also testified extensively on the subject of those plans.alt cause of action in arbitration relating to the deferred compensation plans was the same cause of action alt later asserted against rsgi in federal court,and these issues clearly fell within the scope of the issues to be arbitrated under the contract.
on september,the arbitration panel issued a decision that constituted a full and final settlement of all claims between the parties,and that awarded of the alt claimants in damages,plus interest.the award caption listed fleet,rsi,and fsi it did not name rsgi while the award identified the amount of damages awarded to each claimant,it did not specify which of alt claims were successful,and which were not 
following the issuance of the award,alt made three requests to the panel that it clarify that it had rendered the award against rsi alone,not rsgi,and had not decided either the cep or rsu claims.a majority of the panel decided not to modify the award.
returning to federal court,the parties jointly moved to lift the federal stay in december.alt amended its counterclaims related to the cep and rsu claims so that they were targeted against rsgi and fleet,alleging that those claims remained unresolved by the arbitration panel.rsgi and fleet moved for summary judgment as to those claims,arguing that in light of the arbitral award,they were barred as a matter of law by reason of claim preclusion,judicial estoppel,invited error,and payment.
before addressing alt cep and rsu claims and fleet and rsgi corresponding summary judgment motion,the district court confirmed the arbitral award.neither alt nor rsgi challenged the award,nor did either request remand to the arbitral panel for clarification as to whether the award extended to rsgi on the cep and rsu claims.
after the award was confirmed,the district court entered judgment against alt on its cep and rsu claims against rsgi,reasoning both that rsgi was a party to the arbitration and that the panel had resolved the claims.alt then filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order,arguing that the district court should reverse its decision regarding the cep and rsu claims,or,in the alternative,remand to the arbitration panel so that the panel could clarify the arbitral award.this was the first time alt raised the issue of remanding to the arbitration panel.the district court denied alt motion in all respects.
alt appeal from the order granting summary judgment timely followed.
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo.zayas bacardi,cir.
we are not asked to review the enforceability of the arbitral award,salem hosp.nurses ass n,cir,nor are we faced with a challenge to the district court confirmation of an award,kashner davidson sec.mscisz,cir.rather,the question before us requires interpretation of the arbitral award to determine whether it resolved the cep and rsu claims alt now seeks to raise against rsgi in federal court.
in considering the scope of the arbitral award we look,inter alia,at the claims made before the arbitration panel and the arbitral award itself,comparing those claims to those later stated to the court how the issues reached arbitration and the testimony and evidence that was presented to the arbitrators.see witkowski welch,cir.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the award resolved all claims by alt,including the cep and rsu deferred compensation claims.whatever ambiguity there may have been about whether rsgi was considered to be a formal party,we see no ambiguity as to whether the arbitrators considered and resolved the compensation claims.the same underlying conduct was the basis for alt claims in arbitration as its claims in court,and the matter was fully resolved.numerous factors lead us to this conclusion.
first,the arbitrators stated they were resolving all of the claims between the parties.before the panel,alt clearly raised the claims that they were owed compensation under the rsu and cep plans,and it raised those claims against all respondents,not rsgi in particular.the arbitrators also considered evidence as to the merits of those deferred compensation claims,including from each of the claimants and from executives of fleet,rsgi parent.witkowski,at interpreting scope of arbitral award on the basis of the nature of the evidence and testimony submitted.
in addition,alt had argued to the arbitrators that rsgi did not need to formally be a party to the arbitration for the cep and rsu claims to be resolved.that was so because alt could prevail on those claims against rsi on an alter ego theory,on the theory that rsi was liable under the terms of the arbitration contract,or on the basis that the cep and rsu plans actually constituted compensation promised to alt by rsi in exchange for services performed for rsi,thus rendering rsi liable for breach of contract.
it is also significant that the arbitrators case summary,set forth in the award,unambiguously demonstrates that alt compensation claims were before the panel claimants,former employees,allege violation of the warn act,rico,fraud,breach of contract,negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.claimants seek unpaid compensation,severance,bonuses and attorneys fees.
in light of the manner in which alt presented the rsu and cep claims in its amended statement of claims,the evidence alt presented to the panel,and the arbitral award itself,it is most reasonable to interpret the award scope all of the claims between the parties to include all of alt cep and rsu claims.see pujol.express,cir relying on arbitration award statement that it constituted a full and final settlement of all claims to determine panel had resolved all claims before it and that res judicata barred claimant attempt to relitigate certain previously raised claims.
our conclusion as to the award scope is supported by the fact that,even though rsi on three occasions requested the arbitrators to modify the award to make clear that rsgi was not a party and that alt cep and rsu claims remained unresolved,a majority of the arbitrators declined alt requests.had the panel wished to so clarify its award,it had full authority to do so.instead,faced with rsi requests,the panel chose to let the original award stand.
the arbitrators did not specify the basis for the dollars awarded.it may be that the award included sums to the alt claimants on the deferred compensation theory,or that it included no award,or that the award represents a compromise on those claims.on the evidence,the arbitrators could reasonably have determined that the defenses asserted by the respondents were valid and no award to any alt claimant for the cep and rsu deferred compensation was warranted.alternatively,on the evidence the arbitrators could have adopted alt theory that rsi was rsgi alter ego and from this concluded any award or denial of award as to alt disposed of any issue as to rsgi and fleet.we think the latter is a likely reading given how the issue was framed.
in any event,an arbitrator has no duty to set forth the reasons underlying his award.teamsters local union supervalu,cir see also pujol,at the failure of an arbitrator to make detailed supporting findings does not render such a final settlement ambiguous as to the resolution of the matters in controversy.whether liability was found and relief was awarded on the cep and rsu claims or not,or in what amount,is less important than the conclusion that the claims were determined.that conclusion is plainly supported by the particular circumstances of alt position at arbitration,the arbitral award,and the panel refusal to modify the award as alt requested.
alt argues that the arbitration panel could not possibly have decided the cep and rsu claims because it had no jurisdiction over fleet or rsgi.wolf gruntal,cir discussing the nature and limits of arbitral tribunal authority.this is not and could not be an assertion that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction over the deferred compensation claims.at most it is an assertion made to us that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction over certain parties.
