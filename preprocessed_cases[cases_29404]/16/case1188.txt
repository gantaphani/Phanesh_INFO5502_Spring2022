these appeals come to us from the district court order enforcing the language of an employment contract,rejecting thompson printing company tpc entreaties that doing so would violate implied covenants and public policy.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the employee,gerald fields fields.both defendants,tpc and its ceo,gilbert thompson thompson,appeal.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part,and reverse and remand in part.
i.the factual situation 
tpc is a closely held corporation.thompson owned of the outstanding shares,and fields owned the remaining.fields started working for tpc in at age.on may,he entered into a employment contract with tpc.it provided that fields was to have the designated titles of vice president and chief operations officer,and that he was to perform the duties attendant thereto.the agreement defined the term of employment as continuing until june,and detailed compensation and other benefits to which fields would be entitled in exchange for his services it also provided for annual raises of ten percent each year during the term,and,further,that in the event of thompson death,fields salary would be doubled within days.the contract gave tpc the right to discontinue the contractual benefits in the event of fields voluntary termination 
if during the term of this contract,jerry fields voluntarily terminates his employment with thompson printing company,then it is understood by and between the parties hereto that the salary compensation,employment benefits,and all retirement benefits shall cease as of the date of the termination.
it also contained a broad clause in favor of fields 
this contract shall be by thompson printing company.in the event thompson printing company shall terminate the employment of jerry fields,all of the benefits as contained herein shall continue in accordance with the terms and provisions of this agreement.
the contract did not differentiate between termination with or without cause,providing for continuation of the benefits simply if tpc shall terminate fields.
on august,three female employees made allegations to thompson,then ceo,that fields,by now titled tpc president,had sexually harassed them by creating a hostile work environment.on august,thompson telephoned fields,who was vacationing with his family,and fired him.tpc refused to pay fields any further compensation under the employment contract after that date.
the three female employees filed a lawsuit,zarillo thompson printing,in the superior court of new jersey against tpc,fields,thompson and another supervisor.no findings were made since the claims were settled without any admission of wrongdoing by any of the defendants.
while the zarillo lawsuit was still pending,fields commenced a civil action against tpc and thompson in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.he asserted a federal claim under the employment retirement income security act erisa,et,contending that the retirement benefits specified in the employment contract were protected by erisa,and that tpc failure to pay those benefits violated the statute.in addition,he sought reinstatement of his salary and benefits,including some that had accrued prior to his termination and had never been paid,under a variety of state law theories,including the new jersey wage law,stat.ann,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,conversion,quantum meruit,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he also asserted a minority shareholder oppression claim under stat.ann.c,arguing that his rights as a minority shareholder had been violated by thompson actions.
thompson and tpc replied,denying fields allegations and claiming that fields erisa claim was barred by b,and that his state law claims were barred by new jersey entire controversy doctrine.furthermore,they claimed that fields had breached the employment contract by engaging in acts of sexual harassment,terminating fields rights,as well as their obligations,under the contract.
the parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment.defendants statement of uncontested material facts detailed the allegations of the zarillo plaintiffs defendants argued that by his actions fields had breached the employment contract,forfeiting his rights under the agreement and warranting the entry of summary judgment in their favor.however,fields claimed that not only were the facts in dispute,but they were not material to the resolution of his claims because the employment contract guaranteed that if he was terminated by tpc,his benefits were to continue.
the district court granted fields summary judgment motion with regards to his erisa,new jersey wage law,breach of contract,unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims,but denied the motion with respect to the oppression claim.the court held that the entire controversy doctrine was inapplicable as the validity of the sexual harassment claims was entirely immaterial to the adjudication of the parties rights and obligations under the employment agreement.it then determined that,under the plain language of the contract clause,fields was entitled to both retirement and benefits,rejecting defendants arguments that enforcing the agreement would violate public policy or that fields had breached the agreement.it also held thompson jointly and severally liable based on its view that thompson had not drawn any distinction between himself and tpc,so both were liable.subsequently,fields dismissed the oppression claim,and the parties agreed upon the amount of compensation due under the contract,but reserved the right to appeal the district court ruling.
the district court had jurisdiction over fields erisa claim pursuant to,and over the state law claims pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
ii.discussion 
tpc and thompson now appeal the district court order granting partial summary judgment.they essentially raise three issues,namely,whether the court erred in determining that fields suit was not barred by the entire controversy doctrine that tpc was obligated to pay fields the compensation and,that thompson should be held personally liable.fields the district court determination that he was not entitled to attorneys fees under erisa,contending that its analysis was flawed,based on existing case precedent.
our review of an order granting summary judgment is plenary.morton int l,staley,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.in determining whether a dispute regarding a material fact exists,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.morton,at.
a.the entire controversy doctrine 
we first address defendants argument that the new jersey entire controversy doctrine required fields to bring his claims against tpc and thompson as in the zarillo sexual harassment action,and that because he did not do so,application of the doctrine results in the preclusion of those claims.
the entire controversy doctrine is currently codified in rule a of the new jersey rules of civil procedure,which provides that n of claims or parties required to be joined by the entire controversy doctrine shall result in the preclusion of the omitted claims to the extent required by the entire controversy doctrine.the doctrine seeks to assure that all aspects of a legal dispute occur in a single lawsuit.olds donnelly.its purposes are threefold to encourage the comprehensive and conclusive determination of a legal controversy to achieve party fairness,including both parties before the court as well as prospective parties and to promote judicial economy and efficiency by avoiding fragmented,multiple and duplicative litigation.mystic isle dev.perskie nehmad.the doctrine is essentially a rule of mandatory joinder of claims and parties,which precludes claims from being brought at a later date.we have characterized it as new jersey specific,and idiosyncratic,application of traditional res judicata principles.rycoline,c w unlimited,cir.over the years,new jersey courts have extended the doctrine to related claims,defenses,counterclaims and.see massari einsiedler,defenses ajamian schlanger,cert.denied.related claims vacca stika,counterclaims.thus,the doctrine applies to virtually all causes,claims,and defenses relating to a controversy between the parties engaged in litigation.cogdell hospital center.
the new jersey supreme court has stated that i n determining whether successive claims constitute one controversy for purposes of the doctrine,the central consideration is whether the claims arise from related facts or the same transaction or series of transactions.ditrolio antiles.thus,we must determine whether the facts giving rise to fields claims against tpc and thompson also gave rise to the zarillo plaintiffs claims against tpc,thompson and fields in the earlier action.tpc urges that absent the alleged behavior at the center of the sexual harassment claims,fields would not have been terminated and he would not have brought suit against tpc and thompson.while this is no doubt true,the causal relationship between the two sets of claims is not conclusive under new jersey law.rather,t he issue is,basically,whether a sufficient commonality of facts undergirds each set of claims to constitute essentially a single controversy that should be the subject of only one litigation.ditrolio,at.
here,no such commonality of facts exists,as the facts requiring determination in fields erisa and breach of contract action are quite separate from the facts that would have been determined in the zarillo action.there,the plaintiffs blamed tpc for the discriminatory and hostile work conditions,and the superior court was interested in the nature of the work environment and what tpc did to address the female employees complaints,while,in the instant case,we are interested in the language of the employment contract and the parties rights and obligations under that contract and erisa cases in which the new jersey courts have applied the entire controversy doctrine to bar a second suit have been characterized by some duplication of proof.for instance,in ditrolio,the second action was found to require the production of substantially the same evidence that would be adduced in the first action.id.at.and,in mystic isle,forcing the two claims to be brought at the same time would have resulted in a more comprehensive determination of the underlying legal controversy.at.new jersey application of the entire controversy doctrine emphasize s the essential unfairness of forcing parties and courts to rerun a course previously run.joel morrocco.here,given that two different sets of facts are relevant to the two different types of claims,there is no reason to believe that the new jersey courts would bar the suit to enforce the employment contract on the theory that a comprehensive determination should have been sought in the zarillo litigation.
our decision in fornarotto american waterworks,cir is also instructive.there,fornarotto,an employee of a subsidiary of american waterworks company awc,was struck by an automobile driven by chiapetta,also an employee of the awc subsidiary.id.at.in,fornarotto filed a personal injury suit against the awc subsidiary and chiapetta,who he claimed had been acting in the course of his employment.id.fornarotto attempted to return to work,but complications from his injuries eventually forced him from the job.in,he filed a complaint against awc under the civil enforcement provisions of erisa,seeking disability benefits.id.at.in,fornarotto settled the personal injury suit.id.shortly thereafter,the defendants in the erisa suit moved for,and the district court granted,summary judgment on the ground that the erisa claim arose from the same set of facts as the personal injury claim and was therefore barred by the new jersey entire controversy doctrine.id.
we reversed,holding that the personal injury suit and the disability suit did not turn on the same transactional facts.id.at.while the injuries suffered were relevant to both suits,the issue of chiapetta negligence and the issue of the employer obligation to pay disability benefits under a pension plan did not rise to the level of commonality of facts necessary to trigger the entire controversy doctrine.id.citing joel.thus,we held that,t he two claims are separate and distinct,and failure to join them does not require a rerun of the preceding litigation nor does this allow fornarotto to seek two bites at the apple.id.
similarly,the zarillo plaintiffs sexual harassment claims against tpc,thompson and fields,and fields contract claims against tpc and thompson do not constitute one controversy under the doctrine.there is no rerun here,as the question of tpc obligation to fields under the employment contract is a matter of contract law and turns on contractual language and principles,while the zarillo litigation involved claims of harassment and hostile work environment that implicated certain duties and potential liability on the part of the defendants.because the two sets of claims involve vastly different legal issues,and the resolution of those legal issues turns upon different sets of facts,the relationship between the two suits is too attenuated to hold that both actions arise from a commonality of facts.id.
furthermore,even in the event that fields claims against tpc and thompson could be said to be part of the same controversy giving rise to the zarillo claims,basic notions of fairness would prevent us from applying the doctrine here.despite the doctrine apparent rigidity,new jersey courts have clearly stated that it is not to be applied in a rigid manner divorced from concepts of equity and fairness.fornarotto,at see also ditrolio,at the polestar of the application of the rule is judicial fairness.cogdell,at party fairness is critical in the application of the doctrine.
specifically,in applying the entire controversy doctrine,f airness is a protective concept that focuses primarily on whether defendants would be in a better position to defend themselves if the claims had been raised and asserted in the first litigation.ditrolio,at.a key determination is whether the defendants are now disadvantaged because they were not parties to the first litigation.fornarotto,at quoting ditrolio,at.here,tpc was a party to the first litigation,and is not disadvantaged now on that basis.furthermore,nothing occurred during the zarillo lawsuit or since its settlement that would affect tpc or thompson ability to defend themselves in the instant case.the main elements upon which the instant controversy contractual language and tpc constant and unexplored.as a result,we can fathom no reason why tpc and thompson would have been better able to defend themselves from fields erisa and breach of contract claims had he raised them in the earlier action.
in addition to examining the effect upon the defendants,f airness to the plaintiff must also be considered.joel,at.the new jersey courts have stated that c hief among the equitable considerations determining the doctrine applicability is the full and fair opportunity of the party sought to be precluded in the second action to have raised the claim there asserted in the original action.illiano seaview orthopedics,citation omitted.the issue is whether,considering what was at stake in the zarillo action,it is reasonable as a matter of practical jurisprudence to require fields to have sued his in the same case.id.we do not think such a requirement would be reasonable here.forcing fields to bring his claim as a against tpc in the zarillo action would not have aided the zarillo plaintiffs case in any way.in fact,it would have complicated the matter,and perhaps even jeopardized settlement.this not a situation where fields withheld his claims relevant to the zarillo action for strategic reasons,seeking two bites at the apple.id.at.thus,the entire controversy doctrine does not apply,and fields claims are not precluded by his failure to bring them in the earlier action 
tpc obligation to fields 
second,we examine defendants contention that the district court erred in determining that tpc violated its obligations under erisa and the terms of the employment contract when it refused to pay fields compensation or benefits after august.they argue that,in light of fields alleged acts of sexual harassment,it would violate public policy to enforce the agreement.in the alternative,they argue that fields alleged acts breached the agreement,terminating tpc obligation to continue to pay him both of these arguments essentially urge us to look past the plain language of a relatively straightforward contract.given the fact pattern before us,we will decline to do so.
it is axiomatic that a court may refuse to enforce a contract that violates public policy.see grace local,d citing hurd hodge.a promise is unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement.town of newton rumery,d.such a public policy,however,must be and dominant,and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.grace,at.in new jersey,for example,courts have declined to enforce contracts that violate statutes,promote crime,interfere with the administration of justice,encourage divorce,violate public morality or restrain trade.saxon constr.mgmt.masterclean of north carolina.
here,the defendants argue that enforcement of the employment contract and compensation of fields notwithstanding his alleged behavior violates the clear public policy against sexual harassment of both the united states,as embodied in title vii of the civil rights act of,a,and the state of new jersey,as embodied in the new jersey law against discrimination,stat.ann.the defendants cite stroehmann bakeries,local,cir,in which this court held that an arbitrator order to reinstate an employee accused of sexual harassment,without a determination that the harassment did not occur,violated public policy.there is a and dominant public policy concerning sexual harassment in the workplace which can be ascertained by reference to law and legal precedent.id.at.
however,stroehmann is clearly distinguishable from the case at hand.unlike the arbitrator order there,the employment contract does not undermine the employer ability to fulfill its obligation to prevent and sanction sexual harassment in the workplace.id.at.enforcement of the contract does not require tpc to hire or reinstate someone who may have engaged in acts of sexual harassment,which may violate the policy against perpetuating a hostile and offensive work environment.id.at.nor does the contract impinge on tpc ability to police the work environment and to prevent sexual discrimination.rather,it requires tpc to pay certain sums if they terminated fields,ostensibly for any reason,including improper and offensive conduct.had tpc intended to avoid this result,they could have bargained for a limiting provision in the contract.but the absence of such a provision,owing to tpc failure,does not perpetuate a hostile and offensive work environment.id.the principles of public policy simply do not reach that far 
fields relies on aramony united way replacement benefit plan,cir,and we find it to be more persuasive considering the fact pattern before us.united way terminated aramony,its ceo,after discovering that he had engaged in fraud.id.at.after his conviction,united way chose to deny him the pension benefits he was due under the organization retirement plan.id.aramony filed suit to regain them.id.on appeal,we affirmed the trial court ruling that aramony was entitled to the benefits because the retirement benefit plan contained no felony forfeiture provision.id.at.the signed plan simply does not include a felony forfeiture exception to its otherwise sweeping clause.there is no basis upon which to read one into the contract.id.
here,fields employment contract,like the documentation in aramony,does not include any exception to its clause.tpc asks us to save it from its own failure to include such a forfeiture clause.doing so would essentially force us to read clauses thought desirable from a policy standpoint into every employment contract.this we can not do.employers may legitimately offer compensation and benefits that can be taken away only for specific reasons,or that can not be taken away at all,in order to lure or reward employees.the absence of a forfeiture clause here suggests that this may well have been what was intended.as long as the enforcement of the promise itself is not violative of public policy,we will not deny the parties the relief.the fact that it could be said to have public policy implications is not enough.we find the payment of the compensation does not violate public policy.
it should also be noted at this juncture that even were we inclined to look with disfavor on the rights of a harassing executive to continue to receive compensation in this situation,there has been no finding that fields was in fact guilty of harassment.clearly,any consideration of tpc claim that it was entitled not to compensate fields because of his conduct would have to be based on a finding that his behavior did rise to a level that had policy and contract implications.and,defendants have made no claim that they need an opportunity to prove that fields did behave in such a manner,apparently resting on the principle that the allegations to that effect supported a denial of compensation.
defendants other argument is that,based on the allegations,fields breached the employment contract,giving tpc the right to discontinue payment of the contractual benefits.the district court dismissed this line of reasoning out of hand,concluding that tpc was not deprived of the fruits of the employment agreement,and that the implied duty defendants posit is trumped by the language of the parties agreement.however,while we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion,a more careful look at defendants argument is necessary.
every contract in new jersey does contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see gaydos ins.agency,consumer ins,wilson amerada hess,sons of thunder,borden,pickett lloyd,onderdonk presbyterian homes,alcoa,association group life,catholic war veterans,palisades properties,brunetti.we have previously noted the new jersey courts adherence to this view.see emerson radio orion sales,cir stating that new jersey courts recognize an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.gaydos ins.agency,at williston on contracts ed.
in addition,every employee owes a duty of loyalty to their employer.cameco,gedicke.the duty of loyalty consists of certain very basic and common sense obligations.lamorte burns walters.this duty usually arises in situations where an employee has assisted a competitor of the employer or engaged in.see cameco,at.however,it is also phrased more generally.an employee must not while employed act contrary to the employer interest.lamorte burns,at.
defendants argue that fields breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the employment contract and the duty of loyalty inherent in his relationship with tpc,based on the employees allegations of sexual harassment.these allegations,they contend,destroyed tpc ability to reap to the benefits to which it was entitled under the employment,fields services for ten making it impossible for them to continue to employ him.in light of his breach and failure of performance,they maintain that they have the right to not perform their part 
fields argues that the only affirmative obligation that he had under the agreement was to perform the duties of the vice president of tpc,and that he did so until the day that he was terminated,by which time he had been named president of the company.he cites authority for the proposition that courts are obligated to enforce contracts as they are made by the parties and not to create additional terms out of thin air.see,marchak claridge commons.however,i mplied covenants are as effective components of an agreement as those covenants that are express,and a party performance under a contract may breach an implied covenant even though that performance does not violate a pertinent express term.wilson,at.see also emerson,at stating that new jersey law holds that a party to a contract can breach the implied duty of good faith even if that party abides by the express and unambiguous terms of that contract sons of thunder,at noting favorably that other courts have stated that a party can violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing without violating an express term of the contract.
further,an employee may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing even while performing his or her listed job duties to perfection.and we can imagine circumstances in which an employee who has committed acts of sexual harassment could be deemed to have breached this implied covenant.however,while the principle of fair dealing pervades all of new jersey contract law t hat principle will not alter the terms of a written agreement.rudbart north jersey district water supply comm n.the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing does not operate to alter the clear terms of an agreement and may not be invoked to preclude a party from exercising its express rights under such an agreement.fleming,thriftway medford lakes,citing glenfed fin.penick.so,where the terms of a contract are not specific,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may fill in the gaps where necessary to give efficacy to the contract as written.but where the terms of the parties contract are clear,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing will not override the contract express language.
here,the employment contract specifically provides 
this contract shall be by thompson printing company.in the event thompson printing company shall terminate the employment of jerry fields,all of the benefits as contained herein shall continue in accordance with the terms and provisions of this agreement.
this provision not only prohibits tpc from terminating the contract but it provides further that if it should terminate fields employment,fields benefits will continue.in other words,if tpc should fire him,it must still pay him.there is no differentiation between termination with cause and termination without cause fields benefits are to continue in any event.thus,under the express terms of the agreement,fields has a right to benefits even in the event that he is terminated for cause.
defendants argument urges us to treat fields alleged that could give rise to termination for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.however,whether he breached this covenant,giving rise to a clear right to terminate him,is not the issue.the fact remains that even if he committed the alleged acts and the termination was justified,the express terms state that if he is terminated,benefits will continue.we can not read the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to essentially alter the terms of the contract,enabling tpc to discontinue fields benefits in the event that he was terminated for cause.because tpc did not include a proviso that it would not have to continue fields benefits in the event he was terminated even for cause,we will not read that language into the contract.
defendants argue that the new jersey courts have relieved an employer of the duty of strict performance of an employment contract when the employee has engaged in misconduct,relying on mcgarry anthony of padua roman catholic church.there,mcgarry had entered into an employment contract with anthony.id.at.the contract required the church to give mcgarry notice of termination at least days in advance of termination and to continue to pay him during the period if it did not wish him to work during that period.id.at.three months after starting work,mcgarry was arrested in the parking lot of the church for receiving shipments of illegal steroids and he admitted that he had been using the church property to receive other shipments.id.upon learning of the arrest,the church terminated mcgarry,instructed him to stay off church grounds and refused to pay him,even under the notice requirement.id.mcgarry filed suit,contending that he had been wrongfully terminated and argued that he was entitled to days pay because the church had failed to follow the notice requirement.id.at.
the new jersey superior court found that even where the employee performs the duties contracted for satisfactorily,criminal activity by the employee can justify his discharge for breach of an employment contract.id.at.as a result,anthony had good cause to terminate the employment contract by virtue of mcgarry breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.furthermore,mcgarry was not allowed to recover termination pay under the termination clause of the breached contract.id.at.however,mcgarry is distinguishable from the instant situation.for one thing,the court clearly viewed the criminal nature of mcgarry acts to be critical to its analysis.furthermore,the issue in mcgarry was whether the termination was justified based on breach of an implied covenant.id.the court held that is was.id.here,the issue is not whether termination was appropriate or called for,but rather,if termination occurs,what happens to fields benefits.unlike mcgarry,here the contract speaks specifically to that issue.thus,we will affirm the district court conclusion that tpc failure to pay the required compensation constituted a breach of the employment agreement and its obligations under erisa,and that fields is entitled to all of the compensation and benefits that he was due under the plain meaning of the contract 
thompson personal liability 
finally,we consider defendants argument that the district court erred when it imposed personal joint and several liability on thompson.the court order stated 
finally,because defendants have not argued what if any distinction should be drawn between defendant thompson printing and defendant gilbert thompson with respect to their liability to fields,the order shall not differentiate between them and they shall be jointly and severally liable for the relief granted by this court order of partial summary judgment.
as a preliminary matter,fields contends that thompson has waived this issue through his failure to raise it at the trial level.however,while thompson clearly could have raised a genuine issue of material fact to avoid personal liability,the threshold burden was on fields,who brought the claim against thompson,to plead and prove undisputed facts that warranted an imposition of liability against thompson personally as a matter of law.a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion,and identifying those portions of the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.celotex,at.in order to be entitled to judgment against thompson,fields had to aver,and demonstrate he could prove,sufficient facts to support liability against thompson under erisa and under state law.
so,while the district court placed the onus on the defendants to distinguish the liability of tpc from thompson,it was really fields burden to not only plead,but also to prove,that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law against thompson.thompson was the ceo of tpc,and the corporate officer responsible for terminating fields and discontinuing his benefits.the pleadings allege generally that he violated fiduciary duties owed to fields under erisa,and that he and tpc breached the contract by refusing to pay fields salary and benefits after fields termination.but,these pleadings fall short of alleging,let alone establishing,a basis for personal liability against a corporate officer,on any of the claims at issue.
with regards to the erisa claim,the parties have stipulated that fields benefits plan is a top hat plan.top hat plans are unique animal s under erisa provisions.goldstein johnson johnson,cir.because these plans are intended to compensate only executives,and such employees
