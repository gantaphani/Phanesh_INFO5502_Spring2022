amended opinion 
john hancock life insurance company and two of its subsidiaries collectively hancock contracted with abbott laboratories abbott to join in financing the development of some pharmaceutical compounds.in exchange,abbott promised to share with hancock any profits the compounds would generate.it soon became apparent that a number of the compounds had no good prospect of commercial success.abbott scaled back and delayed its planned investment in the joint project.arguing that abbott had failed to uphold its part of the bargain,hancock stopped contributing funds altogether.hancock then sued for a declaratory judgment,asking the district court to rule that,under the contract between the parties,abbott delayed investment allowed hancock to terminate its payments but retain its share of any future profits.abbott countersued,arguing that the contract explicitly allowed it to delay its contributions to the project.the parties consented to have the district court decide the case on the papers submitted,and,on cross motions,the district court entered judgment for hancock.abbott appeals,essentially arguing that the district court incorrectly construed the contract.we affirm.
we discuss the contract between hancock and abbott and then their course of dealings.we leave some details for discussion in connection with abbott appellate arguments.
a.the contract 
in,hancock and abbott began negotiating the joint venture at issue.while the specifics evolved through contract drafts,the basics of the final agreement are relatively simple.abbott and hancock would select a basket of research compounds that abbott had identified as possible pharmaceutical products and that hancock thought were promising.hancock would contribute multiple millions each year for four consecutive years towards the development of these compounds.abbott would spend at least times as much as hancock over this initial period of development.the parties would share any profits from the compounds for roughly fifteen years from the contract inception,and abbott would pay hancock set amounts when the joint project accomplished certain development or regulatory goals.in short,hancock agreed to provide substantial investment for the project,and abbott agreed to match that investment.because hancock would share profits only for a set number of years,it stood to gain if the compounds were developed quickly and if they turned out to be useful and stood to lose if development were delayed or if the compounds were unsuccessful.
for our purposes,the final contract between the parties,which was signed on march,can be summarized.
the parties agreed to partner in the development of a basket of compounds,with each compound thought to have a potential pharmaceutical use.
hancock agreed to reimburse multiple millions of abbott spending on the joint project in four multiple million dollar for each year through.
abbott agreed to provide an additional annual minimum contribution of funds to the project in each of the four years.
abbott also agreed that its and hancock combined spending on the project would be at least the aggregate spending target over the program term,which the contract defined as a period of four consecutive program years.in other words,by december,abbott would provide approximately of the aggregate spending target to the project above and beyond the of the aggregate spending target that hancock promised to contribute.
abbott was permitted to change its funding obligations only as follows 
a if abbott expended hancock yearly contribution during a program year but did not contribute its annual minimum contribution of its own funds,abbott could carryover its obligation to the following year.the balance of abbott yearly obligation,termed the annual carryover amount,would be added to abbott minimum contribution for the subsequent program year.if abbott carried over its contribution,hancock obligations for the subsequent program year would be suspended until abbott spent the annual carryover amount.
b if abbott did not spend the entire aggregate spending target during the program term,it could carryover the balance to the subsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the program term.if there was such a carryover,the difference between the aggregate spending target and the amount actually spent by the end of the program term would be called the aggregate carryover amount.
abbott would update hancock at least yearly about the project,providing an annual research plan with a budget for future spending.abbott would also provide yearly status reports stating the company spending on the joint project so far.hancock payments were due days after receiving these documents.
in certain enumerated circumstances,including if abbott does not demonstrate in its annual research plan its intent and reasonable expectation to spend at least the aggregate spending target in joint funds on the project during the program term,hancock funding obligations would terminate but the rest of the contract detailing how the parties would share profits would remain in effect.
even if one of the enumerated terminable events came to pass and hancock payment obligations were cancelled,hancock would still have to pay its contributions for the year in which the terminable event took place.
b.the parties dealings 
abbott first annual research plan was appended to the final contract,which was executed on march.it called for total project spending almost double the aggregate spending target by the end of.under this plan,abbott would spend many millions of dollars of its own funds,or roughly five times as much as hancock,through the end of.during,abbott decided to halt development of some compounds.in november,abbott sent hancock a document titled preliminary annual research plan,which called for total spending of less than abbott first annual research plan but more than the aggregate spending target through.in december,abbott sent the status report on the year spending,revealing that spending on the project would total multiple millions less by year end compared to the amount that had been planned.abbott cover letter for the status report stated that hancock payment was due in days,an indication that abbott believed its contractual obligations for the year had been satisfied.this was so even though the only annual research plan abbott had given hancock was marked preliminary.abbott did not manifest any intention to send an update to the preliminary annual research plan.apparently agreeing that the preliminary plan satisfied abbott reporting obligation for,and that abbott obligations for that year were complete,hancock timely provided its contribution of multiple millions.
in,abbott decided to terminate development of an additional compound because the scientific results did not warrant further development.abbott also dramatically reduced efforts on some other compounds.as a result,less than two years into the joint project,abbott was pursuing a significantly smaller number of the original basket of compounds with full effort.abbott submitted its status report and the preliminary annual research plan together on december.the status report revealed that spending on the project would be far less than the preliminary annual research plan had promised.the plan stated that spending for would also be significantly less than abbott had estimated the year before.the plan,however,was silent as to.unlike the previous year version,the plan divulged the company planned spending only for the next year.abbott later explained that the numbers had not been listed in the preliminary annual research plan because of a computer error.as it had the previous year,abbott stated in a cover letter,also sent on december,that hancock contribution was due in days.again,abbott manifested no intention to update its preliminary report and gave no indication that the document was not the planning statement required by the contract.hancock timely provided its reimbursement of multiple millions 
during further review of the preliminary annual research plan,hancock noticed the document failure to make any prediction of spending in,a lapse that the company appears to have overlooked on its initial review.during a september,conference call,hancock asked abbott to supplement the plan with the missing information.abbott controller then sent hancock a letter,dated september,stating the following 
i went back to review the data and spend estimates made about year ago for.on,the estimated program spend for was at more than indicated in the preliminary annual research plan.by october,after the executive committee portfolio review,the estimated spend for had dropped to approximately the same amount as in the preliminary annual research plan and for,it was at an amount that when added to the spending for,and was less than the aggregate spending target.
this was an important admission.abbott confirmed that if there had been no computer error and the preliminary annual research report had included planned spending for,it would have shown that abbott planned to spend only an amount less than previously projected,which would mean that spending through the end of would the amount less than the aggregate spending target.the earlier status reports had indicated that abbott spending for and would be higher.in its october reviews,abbott had projected higher spending for and for.
to the same september,letter,abbott attached a document it called the final plan.this version of the plan indicated that abbott spending during the program term would be even lower than it had projected in october.abbott forecasted total spending of less than the aggregate spending target through and an additional amount in.under this projection,total spending through would fall many millions short of the aggregate spending target.however,abbott would exceed the threshold if spending were included.
after reviewing the updated plan,hancock sent abbott a letter,dated october,stating that its obligation to make any remaining program payments to abbott for and is terminated because the final plan,in conjunction with the more limited information contained in the preliminary annual research plan did not,and does not,reasonably demonstrate abbott intent and reasonable expectation to spend the aggregate spending target on the joint project during the program term.
shortly thereafter,abbott sent hancock a preliminary annual research plan,which projected total project spending for and.cumulative spending on the project would be less than the aggregate spending target through and more than the aggregate spending target through.the same document indicated that abbott would spend well below the annual minimum in provided for under the contract.
hancock never made a contribution for.rather,the company sued abbott in the district court for a declaratory judgment that its payment obligations had terminated.after pretrial proceedings,the parties consented to have the district court resolve their dispute on the papers as a case stated,meaning that the district court could make findings of fact instead of granting inferences to each in turn.digregorio hartford comp.employee ben.serv,cir.in due course,the district court issued a thorough opinion,finding in hancock favor both on the question of whether abbott was required to plan on spending at least the aggregate spending target through,and on whether abbott failure to do so allowed hancock to cancel its payment,as well as its payment for.
the district court determined that,for the most part,the contract between the parties was unambiguous and that the interpretation proffered by hancock is the only reasonable one.the district court did identify two ambiguities in the contract that were relevant to the dispute between the parties.as to one of these ambiguities,which we explain later in this opinion,the district court considered extrinsic evidence and made findings of fact on the intent of the contracting parties.as we also explain,the other ambiguity identified by the district court was really an issue of contract interpretation,and was resolved as such.on both issues,the district court concluded that hancock had the stronger case.
on appeal,abbott challenges the district court findings and conclusions with three arguments.first,abbott says that the contract allowed it to plan to spend the aggregate spending target over five years instead of four.anticipating the possible rejection of this claim,abbott also makes two alternative arguments that,if accepted,would entitle it to hancock payment of multiple millions.abbott says that the event allowing hancock to stop paying happened in,not,and so hancock had to make its payment for that year even if the relevant event happened in,meaning that hancock was potentially freed of its obligation to make a payment,abbott contends that hancock waived that right by failing to recognize the event promptly.we address these arguments in turn.
jurisdiction and standard of review

abbott planning obligations 
hancock position is easily summarized.the contract allowed hancock to stop paying if abbott did not reasonably demonstrate in its annual research plan,its intent and reasonable expectation to expend on program related costs during the program term an amount in excess of the aggregate spending target emphasis added.the contract defines program term as a period of four consecutive program years emphasis added.the contract defines program year as a period of twelve consecutive calendar months commencing on january of each year,except that the first program year shall commence on the execution date and end on december.this means,according to hancock,that the program term ended on december,and that abbott was required to budget in its annual research plans to spend the aggregate spending target by that date.since abbott planned to spend less than the aggregate spending target by the end of,hancock could stop paying.
abbott more complicated position relies on the fact that the carryover provisions in the contract allowed the company to postpone actual attainment of the aggregate spending target threshold until the end of.according to abbott,the carryover provisions,by implication,also freed the company of any obligation to plan to spend all of the aggregate spending target by the end of.hancock counters that the carryover provisions do not by their terms apply to abbott planned spending,but only to its actual spending.the sense of this distinction,hancock and the district court agreed,is that unforeseen circumstances during the fourth year might reasonably have been thought by the contract drafters to excuse strict compliance with the contractually agreed spending,even if a mere change in plans on abbott part would not.
hancock has by far the stronger argument.as the district court recognized,abbott approach is belied by the contract definition of program term.
in illinois,as elsewhere,i t is a basic and fundamental tenet of contract law that even if a contract offers only a limited definition of a term,it must be applied as written.specialty ins.loop paper recycling,d.put another way a court may not interpret a contract in a way contrary to the plain and obvious meaning of its terms.krilich american nat.bank trust of chicago,d.see also in re blinds to go share purchase litigation,cir where the parties to a contract take pains to define a key term specially,their dealings under the contract are governed by that definition.alexian.health providers ass humana health plan,d,p arties to a contract may serve as their own lexicographers and may assign a particular meaning to any word they choose.
in light of these precedents,we need look no further than the contract own definition of program term as a period of four consecutive program years.when the contract said that hancock obligation to make any remaining program payments shall terminate if abbott did not reasonably demonstrate in its annual research plan,its intent and reasonable expectation to expend on program related costs during the program term an amount in excess of the aggregate spending target emphasis added,the contract meant that hancock could stop paying if abbott did not demonstrate its intent and reasonable expectation to spend the money by the end of.abbott insists that n owhere does the contract provide that abbott must forfeit hancock payments if abbott forecasts that it will need a fifth year to spend the aggregate spending target.but the contract provides exactly that.
as the district court stated,reading the contract as it was written does not somehow make the contract illogical,irrational,or commercially unreasonable.beanstalk group,am,cir a contract will not be interpreted literally if doing so would produce absurd results that the parties,presumed to be rational persons pursuing rational ends,are unlikely to have agreed to seek.abbott and hancock reasonably could agree that abbott would be bound by the contract to make all reasonable efforts to spend the aggregate spending target on the joint project by the end of.hancock had obvious reasons to prefer such an obligation the more abbott spent on the project during its first four years,the greater hancock returns were likely to be.abbott had good reasons to accede to hancock demands hancock provided an enormous infusion of funds on favorable terms.and abbott and hancock reasonably could agree that,despite abbott obligation to make all reasonable attempts to spend the aggregate spending target through,the company should have the ability to stretch its actual expenditure of funds into a fifth year,if unexpected events during made it impossible to spend the money as soon as planned.the parties shared an interest in avoiding unnecessary or inefficient spending on the project.in light of these plausible goals,it made sense for the contract to provide that abbott was required to plan to spend the aggregate spending target by december,but that it was not required to actually spend the money by that time.whether this was the best,fairest,or most efficient way to structure the contract is not our concern 
referring to the rule that a contract must be read as a whole,abbott places great reliance on the appearance of the phrase any extension period of the program term in the contractual definition of program related costs.program related costs,not otherwise relevant here,were costs that abbott could count as expenditures on the joint program.the definition provided 
program related costs shall mean i all direct and indirect costs and expenses that are incurred by abbott during a given program year and ii the milestone and license fees paid during a given program year or during any extension period of the program term 
according to abbott,the phrase extension period in the paragraph frees the company from any obligation to plan for spending the aggregate spending target by the end of.
the district court found abbott extension period argument unpersuasive.we agree,though for different reasons the language abbott relies on does not purport to alter the meaning of program term,which is the definition that matters in the section allowing hancock to terminate its payments.as the district court stated,the agreement defines program term specifically and without exception as a period of four consecutive program years thus,the program term,as defined by the agreement,ran from march,through december.the contractual relationship between abbott and hancock would continue beyond the end of,the district court recognized,because abbott would remain responsible for making payments to hancock.but that continuation did not free abbott from its obligation to plan to spend the aggregate spending target during the program term itself.additionally,there are contextual clues far more relevant to this controversy that eliminate any chance that the parties to the contract intended the program term to be five years rather than four.for instance,the very carryover provisions abbott relies on refer to the program term and the subsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the program term.the only plausible reading of the contract is that the subsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the program term is the year.the program term itself ended on december.
in short,the contract required that abbott plan to spend the aggregate spending target during the program term.the contract defined the program term as the period beginning on the day the contract was signed and ending on december.abbott unambiguously revealed in its plan that it did not plan to spend the aggregate spending target by the end of.therefore,under the terms of the contract,hancock could terminate its payments.
c.the year of the terminable or 
abbott argues in the alternative that,even if hancock could withhold its payment in light of abbott failure to forecast spending the aggregate spending target through,hancock could not cancel its payment.abbott rests this argument on wording in the same section of the contract that allowed hancock to stop paying if abbott did not reasonably demonstrate in its annual research plan,its intent and reasonable expectation to expend on program related costs during the program term an amount in excess of the aggregate spending target.the wording states for the avoidance of doubt,hancock payments for the program year in which an event that allows the termination of payments occurs shall still be due and payable.abbott says that hancock stopped paying on the basis of events that happened in and that the payment was therefore still due.in response,hancock says that the event allowing it to terminate its payments was abbott december preliminary annual research plan,which failed to manifest any intention by abbott to spend the aggregate spending target on the joint project by the end of.we agree with the district court that hancock was not required to make a payment.
abbott argues that the december,document can not be considered a ground for termination for two reasons because it was marked preliminary and because it did not include any statement of planned spending for.neither of these rationales is convincing.hancock was not obligated to wait for an annual research plan labeled final.when abbott sent hancock the preliminary annual research plan in december,it also said that the period for hancock payment was running,a sure indication that abbott considered its yearly reporting obligations to be complete this demand for payment conformed to abbott practice from the previous year of treating a preliminary annual plan as the annual plan required by the contract.additionally,abbott gave no indication that another plan,which might indicate satisfactory planned spending for,was coming.
abbott also says that the december document was not a terminable event because it did not contain any projections for.this argument fails in light of the contractual language and abbott later admissions.as we discussed above,the contract allowed hancock to terminate its payments if abbott did not demonstrate in its annual research plan its intent and reasonable expectation to spend at least the aggregate spending target in joint funds on the project during the program term.the preliminary annual research plan,submitted in,plainly did n
