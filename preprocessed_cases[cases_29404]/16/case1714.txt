nesco and nesco acceptance corporation collectively,nesco appeal the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court order voiding a warranty deed between nesco and james and ann jay the jays over a acre tract of land.nesco avers that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that the property in question was a business homestead.
the jays acquired title to an acre tract sometime in and have since used the land to operate a service station and convenience store.the jays also acquired title to a neighboring acre plot,which was used only intermittently for business.the jays have never resided on either parcel of land.in november the jays entered into negotiations with nesco to finance improvements on the acre property.nesco told the jays that it would provide financing only if the jays agreed to convey the property to nesco.the jays testified before the bankruptcy court that nesco agreed to build a new facility that it would then lease back to them.the resulting retail store lease lease was signed by the parties on december.the lease provided,inter alia,that the term would begin on april,and run twenty years.the lease also gave the jays,as tenants,an option to repurchase both tracts at any time during the lease or upon its termination.the existing facilities were demolished in early january,and on the of that month,the jays conveyed to nesco title to the property by warranty deed.at the same time,the jays conveyed by quitclaim deed the acre tract to saul pullman,who then executed a warranty deed and conveyed the land to nesco 
the new facilities were eventually completed,and the jays opened the new service station.the jays,however,never made any lease payments to nesco as required under the terms of the lease.nesco filed a forcible entry and detainer suit in state court to eject the jays from the property.the jays sought bankruptcy protection and removed the case to bankruptcy court.
the bankruptcy court held that the jays owned a business homestead as defined under the texas constitution on the acre tract.the court further held that the arrangement was a pretended sale in violation of the texas constitution that the deed to nesco was void that nesco mortgage lien on the property was void and that nesco possessed an unsecured claim for money nesco had paid the jays as an investment in inventory and working capital,which the court considered to be a simple loan the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in all respects.
nesco raises three issues on appeal.first,nesco contends that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in applying the business homestead requirements provided in the texas constitution prior to the amendment.second,nesco argues that the courts wrongly concluded that this was a pretended sale prohibited by the texas constitution.finally,nesco contests the courts determination that linc was not an innocent lienholder with rights to enforce the lien against the property.
we review the decision of a district court,sitting as an appellate court,by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.carrieri,cir.a bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.
prior to november,a property owner could establish a business homestead under the texas constitution if the property in question was used as a place to exercise the calling of business.const.of,art.xvi.property designated a homestead is granted certain protections,including exemption from forced sale for the payments of debts.this protection also voids all pretended sales of the homestead to avoid these constitutional restrictions.const.art.xvi,a,c.in november,an amendment to the constitution,approved by texas voters,provided homestead protection only if the property shall be used for the purposes of a home,or as both an urban home and a place to exercise a calling or business.const.art.xvi.on january,a provision of the texas property code went into effect that expressly applied the newly amended definition to all homesteads in this state whenever created.ann.d vernon emphasis added.
because the business dealings between the jays and nesco cross the operative dates for the amendment and the statute,the relevant question for purposes of this appeal is which homestead definition applies.the district court determined that the amendment to the texas constitution was passed after the creation of the jays homestead and thus did not affect their rights.furthermore,under the district court reasoning,the retroactivity of the amendment triggered by the texas property code on january,did not matter in this case because the rights had vested on december,when the parties signed the lease agreement.nesco offers several reasons that the amended definition of a business homestead should apply,thus stripping the acre tract of its homestead protection.nesco argues that the amendment is expressly retroactive,that the relevant transaction took place after the amendment to the constitution,and that it was improper for the bankruptcy court to find that the execution of the warranty deed in related back to the lease date in december.
there is no need to consider the retroactivity of the constitutional amendment or the application of the statute because we determine that it was improper for the district court to relate back the execution of the warranty deed in january,to the signing of the lease agreement in december.it is a principle of texas law that a deed takes effect from the date of its delivery.james tuttle turner,wilson.the presumption that a grantee will accept a deed because it is beneficial to him will never,it is said,be carried so far as to consider him as having actually accepted it.id.where there has been a contract for sale,however,the deed can be said to relate back to the date of the contract,when the rights of the parties were fixed.alexander anderson.see also steed crossland,writ ref if there be no question concerning relation back,it is held that a deed takes effect between the parties when it is delivered to the grantee.
those cases concerning deeds which allow relation back,however,refer only to a contract of sale between the parties.see,wilkerson wilkerson,no pet.when real property is acquired under a contract for deed or installment contract,the inception of title relates back to the time the contract was executed.jenkins chambers,wl at a deed executed in pursuance of a previous contract relates back to the time of the contract and covers all intermediate acts.see deeds discussing the doctrine and its application in limited circumstances,including antedating a deed,correcting a deed,and executing a deed pursuant to a contract for sale.cases that do not deal with deeds similarly use the language of contract when parties enter into a contract the law presumes they intend the consequences of its performance.it follows that performance or implementation of the contractual provisions relate back to and are authorized at the time of execution of the contract.cain state,no writ quoting curry auto leasing byrd,no writ.
a lease does not constitute a contract of sale.the lease between the jays and nesco did not trigger any duties for either party until april.the demolition of the buildings on the acre tract did not begin until january,and was not undertaken pursuant to any language in the lease.the jays deeded the land to nesco on january,and it is improper to relate the date of the vesting of the rights back to december.to expand the doctrine to include not only a contract for sale,but also all written instruments that allude to or reference a future transfer of property,would expand the principle so far as to undermine the clear rule regarding the execution of deeds 
because the deed was executed in january of,the amended definition of a business homestead is controlling.since the jays have never lived on the acre tract,the land does not meet the requirement of a business homestead and is thus not due the special protection granted homesteads by the texas constitution.there is no need to reach the additional arguments made by nesco,as they are premised on a determination that the acre tract was a homestead under the texas constitution.because we do not so find,these other arguments need not be addressed.
accordingly,the district court decision is reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
i am not persuaded by the majority opinion.with respect,i dissent.
the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,found that the effective date of the deed related back to december,by which time there was a contract for sale.the majority holds that the january,delivery of the deed did not relate back to december,persuaded that there was no such contract to sell the property.
the courts below held that a contract for sale existed by december,the date the parties signed the lease.nesco demolished the existing building and began construction on january or and received the deed on january.they concluded,and i agree,that it makes little sense for nesco to demolish a building on property it had no right to purchase,or for the jays to deliver a deed to land for which there was no contract for sale,oral or otherwise.and nesco could not lease property to the jays that it did not own.
there is more than the strangeness of the events as portrayed by the majority.by the lease terms,nesco was the owner and lessor and the jays were the lessees that is,there was to be a purchase of the land by nesco and its lease back to the jays.no surprise here,since the claim in this case is that the transaction was a pretended sale in which the parties structured what was a lien as a sale and leaseback,with the lease which set the rent and the terms on which the jays could buy back their property embodying the pretended sale.it was not a normal lease.more to the point,to say simply that a lease does not constitute a contract for sale begs the question of whether this was a lease or a is the issue in the case.
it is difficult to quarrel with the conclusion of the bankruptcy court that no doubt an oral or implied contract for sale was formed if so,the lower courts did not expand the doctrine to reach a lease.they rather found that there was an agreement for sale.we should affirm the bankruptcy court conclusion that the jays satisfied the widely accepted,if exacting,requirements for showing the existence of an oral or implied contract,giving it discretion to apply the equitable relation back doctrine 
and i would affirm its application of that discretion.finding there to be little doubt that nesco structured its transaction to circumvent texas homestead laws,the court applied the doctrine for two reasons to give effect to the parties intentions,because the parties believed that the acre tract constituted the jays business homestead,and to preserve rights that would otherwise be lost,because the jays lost rights by january,a loss not contemplated in the december lease.the exercise of discretion in light of either rationale was proper.
having agreed with the lower courts that the operative date for the transaction was december,i must reach the question of which definition of homestead controlled on that date.we review the lowers courts ruling on this legal question de novo 
the texas constitution protects homesteads from forced sales for the payment of debts.prior to,the constitution defined homestead to include a home or place of business the latter is called a business homestead.in november,an amendment to the constitution redefined a business homestead as property that is both a home and place of business the texas legislature enacted a statutory provision reflecting this change on january,leaving alone the nearby statutory section stating that the statutory definition applied to all homesteads whenever created.here,both parties agree on appeal that if the new definition applies,the jays can not recover because they never lived on either of the two tracts.the jays,of course,argued that the old definition should apply,and the lower courts agreed.
the lower courts found that the amendment was when passed in november,meaning that no legislative or other action was needed to change the definition of homestead.they also found that the constitution new definition of homestead prevailed over the old,contrary statutory definition,which was not updated to reflect the constitutional change until january.the result is that,as of december,the change in texas law was urban homestead could not be created without the maintenance of a home thereon.
however,the courts also found that the amendment applied prospectively by default,meaning that property which previously had attained the status of homestead retained that status absent a constitutional or statutory provision stating that the constitutional amendment applied retroactively.because there was no such constitutional or statutory provision providing for retroactivity of the new definition on december,the jays property was protected on that date.
it was not until january,when the statutory provision updating the definition was enacted,that the amendment became retroactive and the jays acre tract lost its status as a homestead.the courts then held that the tract lost its status as a homestead only with respect to transactions entered into after january,because any retroactive application for transactions occurring before january,would alter the substantive rights and obligations of the parties in violation of the texas constitution prohibition against ex post facto or retroactive laws.
in short,the lower courts held that the amendment was silent regarding retroactivity when passed and became retroactive by virtue of the january,statute,retroactive only for transactions entered into after january.in other words,the retroactivity enacted by the statute removed the homestead shield from property like the jays in texas,property which had gained that shield in the past,but not for past transactions.
i agree with the bankruptcy court that amendments to the homestead provision of the texas constitution are not retroactive when silent about the retroactive reach.the texas supreme court has so held other federal and state courts,in holding that the amendment or a can overcome the default and provide retroactivity,concur.as the bankruptcy court held,some positive action,either by constitutional or legislative provision,is required to divest property of its homestead character consequently,we also agree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the january,statute validly made the amendment retroactive.
i also agree with the bankruptcy court that,as a result of the statute,the acre tract lost its character as a business homestead only with respect to transactions entered into after january.it held that this was so because t he laws existing at the time a contract is made become a part of the contract and govern the transaction,and because the new definition could not be applied to old transactions without violating the texas constitution prohibition against retroactive laws 
while agreeing with the bankruptcy court conclusion,i do not decide whether providing statutory for transactions occurring before the change in definition would violate the prohibition on retroactive laws.rather,i construe the statute to avoid that constitutional question.the statutory language t he definition of a homestead as provided in this section applies to all homesteads in this state whenever created does not answer the question of whether the new definition applies to transactions occurring before the statute was enacted,as distinguished from the redefinition of all homesteads whenever created from that date foreword.i have found no case where the court applied that or similar retroactivity provisions to such transactions all of the retroactivity cases involve application of the new wording to land that was designated a homestead before the change,either maintaining or removing its homestead status for future transactions.moreover,in one of those cases the court,after holding that the amendment applies to all homesteads in this state,including homesteads acquired before the adoption of this amendment,held that its framers and adopters intended it to be retroac
