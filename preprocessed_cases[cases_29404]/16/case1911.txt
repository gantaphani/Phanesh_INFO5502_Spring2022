in this diversity action brought in the eastern district of michigan,plaintiff cmaco automotive systems,cma,a california corporation that supplies parts to automobile manufacturers,alleges that defendant wanxiang america corporation wac,a kentucky corporation with its principal place of business in illinois,breached an exclusive partnership agreement to manufacture automotive parts for cma.cma complaint against wac avers breach of contract,unjust enrichment,unfair competition,tortious interference with contract,and promissory estoppel.
wac moved for summary judgment,arguing in pertinent part that cma claims accrued in california and,by application of michigan borrowing statute.comp.laws,were by the relevant california statutes of limitation.the district court agreed and dismissed cma action in its entirety.the court later denied cma motion for reconsideration.
cma now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its breach of contract and related equitable claims for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel.we conclude,however,that the district court did not err when it invoked michigan borrowing statute and held that cma causes of action were untimely filed under california law.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
cma is a california corporation that supplies automotive parts to american automakers and their tier i and tier ii suppliers.michael chi is cma president and founder.in may,cma approached visteon corporation visteon,a automotive supplier that was seeking new overseas sources of axle and drive shaft parts.in july,visteon issued several requests for quotations rfqs to cma for various automotive components,including three different stud yoke drive shaft parts the disputed parts.cma responded with price quotes for each of the parts.shortly thereafter,cma solicited price quotes from one of its strategic partners,wanxiang group company,an automotive parts manufacturer based in xiaoshan,china,for the parts that were the subject of visteon rfq.visteon ultimately determined that cma prices were competitive and began working with cma to source the disputed parts for production at manufacturing plants in china.
on september,cma entered into an exclusive partnership agreement the agreement with wanxiang group company,to manufacture and sell automotive parts in the united states market pursuant to the agreement,which expired on july,wanxiang china agreed,inter alia,to keep drawings and specifications supplied by cma in absolute confidentiality,to sell to only cma all quantity of the products manufactured according to the drawings and specifications provided by cma,and to go exclusively through cma for the increased volume of the oversea s orders for parts identified by cma.
for its part,cma agreed to use its business connections in the united states to develop the overseas market,contract its domestic orders to wanxiang china,provided that other companies prices and products were comparable,not disclose wanxiang china trade secrets or confidential technology,and provide wanxiang china with technical support and training.
on november,wanxiang china notified cma by faxed letter that it was assigning its responsibilities with respect to business in the united states to defendant wac,its subsidiary.wac is incorporated in kentucky,with its principal place of business in elgin,illinois.cma and wac both accepted the assignment.
following execution of the agreement,cma,wac,and wanxiang china worked collaboratively over an period to ready wanxiang china manufacturing processes for production of the stud yoke parts and to meet the quality assurance standards of certain north american automobile manufacturers.in september,in response to the earlier request from cma for a bid,wanxiang china furnished quotes for seven different automotive parts,including the disputed parts that were the subject of visteon july rfq.
during this time period,visteon awarded a supply contract to cma for certain parts unrelated to the rfq.this supply contract led to the first purchase order between cma and wac under the agreement.the purchase order,dated august,called for wac to manufacture five different parts beginning in september.
cma alleges that,sometime in late,wac approached visteon regarding wac desire to establish a business relationship with visteon and circumvent cma.on january,visteon issued an rfq directly to wac for price quotes for four drive train components.cma claims that three of these components were the disputed parts that wanxiang china quoted to cma in the fourth component was a spider part.visteon simultaneously sent an identical rfq to cma.according to cma,visteon requested that it confirm previously quoted prices and production volumes for the disputed parts.on january,and again on january,cma,in turn,asked wac to revalidate the price quotes for the disputed parts originally provided by wanxiang china in september.after consulting with wanxiang china,wac purportedly refused to do so,claiming that the parts were not the same.
cma alleges that,as a result of wac refusal to revalidate the price quotes for the disputed parts,it was unable to respond to visteon january rfq by the february,deadline,causing visteon to purchase the parts elsewhere.in fact,wac was this other source.on january,wac provided visteon with price quotes for the rfq,and,on march,visteon awarded wac the contract to produce the disputed parts and ship them directly to visteon the first shipment of the disputed parts by wac to visteon occurred in december.an invoice reflects a shipping date of december,with a destination of sterling heights,michigan.
in january,visteon cancelled cma program to supply it with parts.
on april,cma filed suit against wac in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,alleging breach of contract,unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,tortious interference with contract,and unfair competition.in its second amended complaint,cma alleged in pertinent part that in january,wac refused to revalidate the parts,falsely claiming that they were not the same parts wanxiang china had previously quoted,and that a t the same time wac refused to revalidate the parts for cma,wac began negotiating directly with visteon for the sale of the same parts.wac then breached the partnership agreement by selling parts directly to visteon and other third parties.
upon the completion of discovery,wac filed a renewed motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for forum non conveniens and a motion for summary judgment.in the latter motion,which is the subject of this appeal,wac complained that cma,a california corporation,was forum shopping and sued wac,a kentucky corporation based in illinois,in michigan in an effort to avoid california shorter limitations periods.wac asserted three grounds for summary judgment cma causes of action accrued in california and,under michigan borrowing statute,were by california statutes of limitation wac was not bound by the agreement and the disputed parts were not encompassed by the agreement.
cma responded by filing its own motion for partial summary judgment.on september,the district court granted wac motion for summary judgment,but denied wac motion to dismiss and cma motion for partial summary judgment.cmaco auto,wanxiang am,wl.the district court held that michigan borrowing statute was triggered because cma causes of action accrued in another jurisdiction,california,and,therefore,california shorter statutes of limitation applied and barred cma claims specifically,with regard to cma breach of contract claim,the court reasoned

plaintiff cma contends that the michigan court of appeals has explained that the borrowing statute applies only if an action accrued without any essential facts giving rise to the cause of action occurring in michigan.scherer hellstrom.relying on scherer,plaintiff claims,all of the conduct by wa c forming the basis of cma claims both in contract and in tort took place in michigan and in this district.it was in michigan where wa c approached visteon,cma customer,and persuaded it to bypass cma.it was in michigan where wa c sold the disputed stud yokes to visteon in late.plaintiff resp.br.at emphasis in original.
as pointed out by defendant wac,however,the court in scherer based its holding on the fact that the defendant was a michigan resident.because defendant was residing in michigan when she failed to fulfill her promise,the plaintiff cause of action can not be said to have accrued without this state as contemplated by the borrowing statute.scherer.at,emphasis added.
in this case,plaintiff cma is a california corporation suing wac,a kentucky corporation located in illinois.the only michigan connection is that the alleged breach involved sales of parts to visteon in michigan.the michigan borrowing statute cited above references the place where the cause of action accrued.likewise,the michigan supreme court has held that a claim accrues when and where the injury and damage are suffered.parish goodrich.in this case any injury alleged by cma would have been felt in california,the state in which it is incorporated and has its only place of business,not michigan.therefore,michigan borrowing statute applies and the court will apply california statute of limitations for written contract cases.cal.civ,code.
for purposes of michigan borrowing statute,the time a claim accrued is determined under the law of the same state as the statute of limitations that is applied.szlinis moulded fiber glass.california law provides that a breach of contract claim accrues at the time of the breach.doheny park terrace homeowners ass n,truck ins,th,d.
the district court then accepted cma argument that california law allows for the application of the discovery rule to breach of contract actions but rejected cma claim that it was not aware of the specific facts necessary to establish a claim until.id.at.the court found that the claim accrued in january or february,when visteon sent the rfq directly to wac 
at that time chi had attempted to get wac to revalidate the quote for the disputed parts,but wac failed to respond.it was at that point that if chi had investigated,he would have known that wac was not responding because it was giving its own quote to visteon.thus,under california statute of limitations,plaintiff breach of contract claim is.
cma unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel claims,asserted in the alternative to its breach of contract claim,are also barred under the borrowing statute analysis.the doctrine of laches presumes that,equitable claims are barred by the corresponding statute of limitations for the analogous action at law.jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir.

a borrowing statute is a legislative exception from the general rule that the forum always applies its statute of limitation.combs int l ins,cir.although borrowing statutes vary from state to state,all provide that the forum state will apply the statute of limitations from the foreign jurisdiction in which the cause of action accrued.id.i f a cause of action arises in a foreign jurisdiction which has a shorter statute of limitations than the forum for the same cause of action,the forum courts must borrow the foreign jurisdiction statute of limitations.id

in michigan,a breach of contract action must be brought within six years of the time the claim first accrues.comp.laws.california similar limitations period for breach of a written contract is four years.doheny park terrace homeowners ass n,d at.michigan borrowing statute provides 
an action based upon a cause of action accruing without this state shall not be commenced after the expiration of the statute of limitations of either this state or the place without this state where the cause of action accrued,except that where the cause of action accrued in favor of a resident of this state the statute of limitations of this state shall apply.
comp.laws emphasis added.
under this statute,a cause of action accruing in another state or jurisdiction commenced in michigan by a nonresident of this state is barred upon expiration of either the applicable michigan limitation period or the applicable limitation period of the other state or jurisdiction.in other words,if the statute of limitations of either state or jurisdiction bars the plaintiff claim,the action should be dismissed.hover,at citation omitted see also bechtol mayes.thus,michigan borrowing statute necessarily requires a determination of where and when the action accrued.parish,at scherer,at 
there is scant authority from the michigan courts interpreting the borrowing statute in the context of a breach of contract action.indeed,the michigan court of appeals decision in scherer provides the only guidance on this precise issue.
in scherer,the plaintiff brought a breach of contract action against his,stemming from a loan made to her in.scherer,at.at the time the loan was made,the plaintiff resided in georgia and the defendant lived in florida.id.pursuant to the written loan agreement,the plaintiff was not obligated to pay off the loan until the first of three specified events occurred the sale of the defendant house in florida,the refinancing of the florida house,or on december.id.the defendant subsequently left florida and,on november,while residing in michigan,sold the florida house but failed to pay off the loan or contact the plaintiff.id.on january,the plaintiff commenced a breach of contract action in michigan.the defendant argued that the claim accrued in florida and,therefore,under michigan borrowing statute,florida shorter statute of limitations applied and barred the action.the michigan court of appeals disagreed and explained 
the phrase without this state is not defined in the borrowing statute.we observe,however,that the word without is commonly defined as.with the absence,omission,or avoidance of not with with no or none of lacking.free from excluding.not accompanied by random house webster college dictionary.giving these words used in michigan borrowing statute their plain meaning,it is clear that the borrowing statute applies only if an action accrued without any essential facts giving rise to the cause of action occurring in michigan.
consistent with this interpretation,our supreme court observed in parish b f goodrich,
most states have enacted borrowing statutes to resolve the possible conflicts of laws that may arise when a plaintiff claim accrues outside of the forum.borrowing statutes,including michigan,typically confine a plaintiff whose claim accrues outside the forum to the limitational the forum or the state where the claim the least time to commence the action.
we therefore must determine both when and where plaintiff cause of action accrued.in michigan,a breach of contract claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when damage results.mcl.to determine what constituted the wrong upon which the claim is based,we look first to the parties agreement on the basis of the parties agreement,defendant did not have to pay off the loan until the first of the three specified events occurred.here,the first event occurred on november,when defendant sold the florida house.upon the sale of the house,defendant was immediately obligated to pay plaintiff the money he had loaned to her.thus,plaintiff breach of contract claim accrued on november.
id.at emphasis added footnote omitted 
the scherer court then rejected the defendant argument that the claim accrued in florida because her house was located there 
w hen the florida house was sold,defendant was residing in michigan.the parties agreement did not require defendant to satisfy her obligation to plaintiff with the proceeds from the sale of the florida house.in fact,the latest payment date contemplated by the parties required the loan to be paid regardless of whether the florida house was sold or refinanced.generally,if performance is dependent on a condition precedent,the cause of action does not accrue until the condition is fulfilled and the promise is not performed.here,the condition was fulfilled when the florida house was sold,but defendant was residing in michigan when her obligation to perform on the contract arose.because defendant was residing in michigan when she failed to fulfill her promise,the plaintiff cause of action can not be said to have accrued without this state as contemplated by the borrowing statute.therefore,the borrowing statute does not apply and plaintiff claim was timely filed under michigan statute of limitations for breach of contract.
id.at citations omitted.
cma argues that,like scherer,essential facts giving rise to its contract claim occurred in michigan,and therefore the borrowing statute does not apply.cma cites wac first shipment of the disputed parts to visteon sterling heights facility in december as the crucial accrual event.it further points out that it was in michigan where wac contacted visteon and persuaded it to bypass cma,and it was cma business with visteon in michigan that was harmed by wac breach.accordingly,cma maintains that michigan statute of limitations controls,and that the april complaint was timely filed.we disagree,however,that these michigan connections constitute essential or operative facts giving rise to the cause of action in this case.
the agreement between the parties does not prohibit wac direct sale of the disputed parts to an entity in michigan it prohibits the direct sale of such parts to a third party,regardless of the location of the client or the destination of the shipment.thus,as wac argues,the fact that nonparty visteon has offices in michigan has no substantive impact on cma would be the same if visteon offices were in any of the states.this valid point is underscored by cma allegation in its second amended complaint that wac breached the partnership agreement by selling the parts directly to visteon and other third parties,presumably worthington precision metals in ohio.emphasis added.thus,visteon involvement and the shipment of parts to michigan are of only peripheral importance to the accrual of this breach of contract action involving nonresident corporations.
our conclusion that cma contract claim accrued without this state requires that we view michigan borrowing statute jurisprudence from a broad perspective.michigan generally looks to the state of injury under its borrowing statute to determine where the claim accrued.mun.high income fund,wl,at citing parish,at.in parish,the michigan supreme court considered whether a product liability claim of a consumer against a manufacturer accrues under the borrowing statute in the state where the product is sold or the state where the alleged defect in the product becomes apparent,causing injury and damage.parish,at.the parish court held that the claim accrues when and where injury and damage are suffered.id otherwise stated,the product liability claim of a consumer for personal injury against a manufacturer does not accrue for purposes of the borrowing statute until all elements of the cause of action are present.id.at.see also hover,at products liability action accrued in canada,where automobile accident took place and injuries were sustained szlinis,at wrongful death action accrued on the date of death,and,following parish,it accrued where injury death and damage were suffered.
in mun.high income fund,the michigan court of appeals extended parish accrual analysis to circumstances involving economic,rather than physical,injury.wl,at.the plaintiffs,various municipal bond funds with their principal place of business in new york,brought suit in michigan,where the bonds were issued by a nonparty,alleging that the nonresident corporate defendants were liable for losses to their bond funds on theories of innocent and negligent misrepresentation.id.at.noting that in accordance with parish,michigan generally looks to the state of injury under its borrowing statute to determine where the claim accrued,id.at,the michigan court of appeals held that the plaintiffs injury occurred without this state,in new york,because the economic impact on a plaintiff from a misrepresentation of mutual funds is felt at the plaintiff principal place of business.id.citing maiden biehl.
in light of the michigan courts adherence to the general rule that a cause of action accrues at the place of injury,we find the economic impact analysis of mun.high income to be particularly useful in the present action which,albeit not a tort claim,involves economic injury.although this rationale is not without its pitfalls we note that it has been utilized by the new york courts to determine where a cause of action accrues for purposes of new york similarly worded borrowing statute.see global fin.triarc,holding that where the alleged injury was purely economic,the nonresident corporate plaintiff breach of contract claims accrued in the jurisdiction in which it sustained the economic impact of the alleged the state of incorporation or its principal place of than new york,thus requiring application of the borrowing statute see also bank brussels lambert credit lyonnais suisse,civ.lmm,wl,at may,unpublished following global financial and holding that under new york borrowing statute,the conversion claims of the banking corporation plaintiffs accrued at their principal places of business in europe where they suffered economic injury maiden.at applying new york borrowing statute to a fraudulent misrepresentation claim and holding that w here a cause of action accrues still depends on the facts of each case,but the question is always where the plaintiff felt the economic impact of the fraud and,therefore,the place of injury for a mutual fund is the principal p
