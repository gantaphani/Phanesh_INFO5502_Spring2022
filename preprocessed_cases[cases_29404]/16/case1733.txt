appellee lyrick studios,lyrick contends that appellant big idea productions,big idea breached their agreement under which big idea provided lyrick with an exclusive license to distribute children cartoon programs.lyrick sued over this breach,and the jury found in its favor.big idea appeals,arguing that lyrick can not satisfy the requirement that all transfers of copyright such as exclusive licenses must be in writing and signed by the transferor.because there is no sufficient writing here,we reverse the judgment.
phil vischer founded appellant big idea productions,to finance and market veggietales,a children cartoon he created,featuring the characters bob the tomato and larry the cucumber.originally,big idea independently distributed veggietales to members of an organization called the christian bookstores association cba.the programs were successful,and big idea eventually entered into a contract with a third party to distribute to the cba.veggietales sales continued to grow.
with this success,big idea wanted to sell its products to a larger audience.to do this,big idea began negotiating with lyrick studios,which had experience with its own successful children programs.in february,tim clott,lyrick ceo,sent big idea the first of three documents that are critical to this case.this document was a proposal for distribution of veggietales to the general marketplace.it ended with the caveat that for both of our protection,no contract will exist until both parties have executed a formal agreement.big idea vice president of licensing and development,bill haljun,sent the second critical fax that listed several issues still to be decided.the next day,the parties discussed the issues in a phone call and agreed to resolve them.haljun faxed clott a few days later,noting that phil is ecstatic.
shortly afterwards,lyrick prepared a contract.this draft agreement was never signed.in fact,several draft contracts and suggested revisions to the drafts were sent back and forth over the years.there were several sticking points,including dvd distribution rights,rights to stuffed animals,the possibility of a key man provision,and even the term of the contract.the parties agree that no formal contract was ever signed.
despite lacking a formal signed contract,in march,lyrick began distributing veggietales videocassettes.the cassettes were immediately successful both parties made a significant profit from the relationship.
the negotiations over a written contract continued until june,when the fourth and final draft was prepared by lyrick.like the other drafts,this one was never signed.at some point around this time,the parties relationship became strained.one point of contention involved the rights to stuffed animals,or as the parties referred to them,plush.the parties eventually signed an agreement the plush letter transferring plush rights in veggietales from lyrick to big idea.
in march,lyrick was acquired by hit entertainment,a children entertainment company,but it continued to distribute veggietales.in december,big idea informed lyrick that it was going to use a new distributor.in response,lyrick sued big idea.
this lawsuit is primarily based on lyrick claims that big idea breached its exclusive agreement by entering into an agreement with the new distributor.during discovery,big idea produced a document that lyrick now contends is the third crucial november internal memorandum by bill haljun.haljun wrote this memo in response to a big idea employee question about the term with lyrick.in his memo,haljun replied that w e agreed over the phone to his contract i would say that we have an agreement in force.lyrick had not seen this internal memorandum before litigation.
the case proceeded to trial.after the close of lyrick evidence,big idea moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that any contract for an exclusive license of a copyrighted work,such as veggietales,had to be in writing.the district court denied this motion,and the case went to the jury.the jury found that there had been a contract and that big idea had breached it.as a result,the jury awarded lyrick damages of for lost profits on videocassettes and dvds.the district court entered judgment for this amount,along with in attorney fees.the judgment amount also included in damages for breach of the plush letter big idea agreed to this award before trial and does not appeal it.the court also permitted lyrick to collect on a bond big idea posted when it obtained a preliminary injunction preventing lyrick from distributing veggietales products.big idea now appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law.we review this ruling de novo.arsement spinnaker exploration,llc,cir.judgment as a matter of law is proper when there is no legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find for a party on an issue.fed.civ.a.

here the parties dispute whether big idea and lyrick have a writing that meets a requirement.lyrick contends that a is satisfied with a series of letters between haljun and clott and the internal haljun memorandum.big idea responds that the letters were just proposals and never showed a final agreement.big idea also argues that haljun internal memo is not the kind of writing that can satisfy a.
resolving this issue requires us to examine the documents.in the first february letter from tim clott of lyrick to bill haljun of big opening paragraph describes the letters contents as our proposal.the rest of the letter sets out provisions such as territory,term,rights products,and the distribution of proceeds.the final paragraph contains some critical language if the above terms are acceptable to you we will begin drafting a formal agreement.of course,for both of our protection,no contract will exist until both parties have executed a formal agreement.
the second document that lyrick relies on is bill haljun faxed response.the cover sheet for this fax states,here is our agreement to proceed and the remaining issues and understandings which we need
