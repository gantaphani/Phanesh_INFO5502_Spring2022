archstone multifamily series i trust and archstone collectively referred to as archstone appeal an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of niles bolton associates,niles bolton.archstone also appeals the district court denial of its motion to amend its complaint to include a claim for contribution.in granting summary judgment,the court concluded that archstone claims are preempted by the fair housing act fha,et,and the americans with disabilities act ada,et in denying the motion to amend,the court concluded that allowing archstone to amend its complaint would be prejudicial to niles bolton and,in any event,futile.for the following reasons,we affirm.
archstone develops and owns housing projects throughout the united states.archstone hired niles bolton as its architect to design a number of apartment buildings on the east coast in the.in,the equal rights center and several other disability advocacy groups equal rights plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against archstone,niles bolton,various contractors,and other architects used by archstone,alleging that these entities failed to design and construct apartment buildings so that they would be accessible to persons with disabilities in compliance with the fha and ada.
archstone and the equal rights plaintiffs entered into a consent decree to settle the lawsuit covering the apartment communities,of which were designed by niles bolton.under the settlement,archstone was required,inter alia,to retrofit the properties to make them compliant with the fha and ada and pay the plaintiffs million to cover damages,attorneys fees,and expenses.archstone has retrofitted a majority of the properties and is in the process of retrofitting the remainder.according to archstone,the costs of the retrofits at the sites designed by niles bolton exceed million.niles bolton was not a party to the settlement between archstone and the equal rights plaintiffs.however,niles bolton later entered into a separate consent decree with the equal rights plaintiffs that did not include any admission of liability.
following settlement with the equal rights plaintiffs,archstone filed a against niles bolton asserting four causes of action express indemnity implied indemnity breach of contract and professional negligence.the express indemnity claim focuses on clauses in the contracts between niles bolton and archstone in which niles bolton promised to make good any defects in its services resulting from the failure of the architect or any of its consultants to perform their respective services in a manner that is commensurate with the professional standard of care and to indemnify archstone from and against all losses,claims,liabilities,injuries,damages and expenses,including attorneys fees and litigation costs arising out of or resulting from or in connection with,the performance,or failure to perform,by the architect or its employees.niles bolton and archstone also agreed that designs or specifications furnished by the architect found to be negligent will be promptly corrected by the architect at no cost to the owner,and the architect will be responsible to the owner for all damages,if any,resulting from such defective designs or specifications.they further agreed that a ny designs or specifications furnished by the architect which contain errors in coordination of details or dimensional errors will be promptly corrected by the architect at no cost to the owner.id.
archstone implied indemnity claim rests on the principle that niles bolton bears a substantially greater share of responsibility for any failure of the properties to be designed according to the requirements of the fha and the ada,given niles bolton superior knowledge,skill and involvement in the design of the properties.the breach of contract claim,as alleged by archstone,arises because niles bolton breached the warranties under its contracts with archstone by failing to design properties that are in compliance with the fha and ada.finally,archstone professional negligence claim results from niles bolton alleged failure to exercise the level of professional skill and care required of an architect to design the properties in question in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the fha and ada.for these causes of action,archstone sought to recover damages,attorney fees and costs paid by archstone to the equal rights plaintiffs,to recover costs it incurred retrofitting those portions of the properties improperly designed by niles bolton,and to be indemnified for costs that archstone will incur to modify the remainder of the properties designed by niles bolton that have yet to be retrofitted.
after archstone filed its,the parties conducted discovery for approximately three years.during the course of discovery,niles bolton sought to compel archstone to disclose evidence regarding archstone allocation of damages among itself,niles bolton,and any other party.archstone resisted these discovery requests by arguing that it was seeking damages for the of properties that niles bolton designed and all related settlement amounts,attorneys fees,and costs paid to the equal rights plaintiffs,as well as the costs of retrofitting the properties designed by niles bolton.the district court affirmed the magistrate judge grant of a protective order to archstone because the allocation of damages was irrelevant to a claim for indemnity.the district court further noted that there is no suggestion in the magistrate discovery rulings that the court perceived there to be a contribution claim presented by archstone.equal rights center archstone smith trust,et,d.
three weeks after the close of discovery and on the eve of the deadline for dispositive motions,archstone filed a motion for leave to amend its to include a claim for contribution.under the amended complaint,archstone sought to recover contribution on the same grounds as its original claims.in a memorandum order,the district court denied the motion for leave to amend on the ground that it would result in prejudice to niles bolton.according to the court,because a claim for contribution requires an analysis of the relative fault of the parties while a claim for indemnification does not,amending the complaint to add this claim would require additional discovery of the type previously rejected by the court because of its view that archstone was seeking only indemnification rather than contribution.because archstone did not move for leave to amend the complaint until after three years of discovery and on the eve of dispositive motions,the court held that the amendment would prejudice niles bolton.further,the court held that even if there were no prejudice,a claim for contribution would be futile because it would be preempted under federal law.
the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of niles bolton.the court reasoned that although styled as claims for relief,archstone causes of action were indemnity and de facto indemnity claims for violations of the fha and ada.because no right to indemnification exists under these laws,and because allowing indemnification on the claims asserted by archstone would be antithetical to the purposes of the fha and ada,the court held that federal law preempted these claims under the doctrine of conflict,or obstacle,preemption.
archstone timely appealed the grant of summary judgment and the denial of its motion for leave to amend.we address each issue in turn.

archstone argues that the district court erred because its claims are not antithetical to congress purpose in enacting the fha and ada.archstone claims that no conflict or obstacle exists because its does not impose requirements that make compliance with federal law impossible.furthe
