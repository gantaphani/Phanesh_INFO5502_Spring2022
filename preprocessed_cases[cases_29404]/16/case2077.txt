aerel,an italian company that served as the exclusive sales agent for pcc airfoils,in italy,sued pcc for the breach of a contract that the parties executed in.pcc is an company that provides castings for parts used in jet engines and power generating equipment.aerel maintains that the contract required pcc to pay aerel commissions for all orders that aerel obtained for pcc in italy during the term of the contract,even if those orders were not finalized until after the contract had expired.the district court concluded that the contract unambiguously permitted pcc to cease paying commissions upon the termination of the contract on december,and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of pcc.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
aerel entered into its first contract with pcc in july of.under that contract,pcc agreed to pay aerel commissions at a rate of on the sale of certain pcc products in italy,with the understanding that higher or lower commissions on other products or services could be established by mutual agreement.commission payments were to extend for months following the expiration date of the contract.aerel would thus receive commissions during this extended period on orders placed,but not completed or paid for,during the contract term.article v of the contract provided in relevant part as follows 
upon the termination of this agreement,pcc airfoils,obligation to pay commission on sales of products promoted by aerel hereunder shall cease except aerel shall be paid commission on purchase orders then in force for castings to be delivered up to months after the termination of the contract where the products covered thereby have not been delivered or paid for.
after the initial contract expired in december of,the parties renewed their arrangement with similar of which contained,and.aerel continued to serve as pcc exclusive sales agent in italy following the expiration of the agreement,but operated without a written contract.
in july of,the parties signed a new sales agreement that modified their previous arrangement.three provisions of the contract are at issue in the present case 
pcc airfoils,agrees to pay aerel in full under terms of net thirty days from the date of receipt of payment to pcc airfoils,from the customer.
on all sales originating from the territory,pcc airfoils,shall pay aerel as follows 
upon the termination of this agreement,pcc airfoils,obligation to pay commission on sales of products promoted by aerel hereunder shall cease.
just three months after signing the new contract,the parties further modified the terms of the agreement by amending subparagraph of to include other pcc products at the rate.absent from the contract,however,was any language confirming aerel right to commission payments for timely placed orders delivered and paid for during the months after the contract terminated.all of the prior contracts between the parties had included that language in.
luciano cosentini,aerel principal,testified in his deposition that he knew of the change in the language and was not pleased with it.but he acknowledged that he had signed the contract voluntarily.notwithstanding this testimony,cosentini filed an affidavit accompanying aerel motion for partial summary judgment in which he offered a detailed reason for the deletion of.cosentini claimed that the language previously in article v was eliminated because aerel had requested a commission tail that would have permitted aerel to collect commissions on orders that were negotiated directly by pcc,without aerel help,after the contract had expired.aerel insisted that it was entitled to these extra commissions because it had developed a market in italy for pcc products.but pcc rebuffed aerel efforts and,according to cosentini,employed language in the new that expressly rejected the idea of commission tails.cosentini maintained,however,that this did not alter his ongoing oral understanding with pcc sales director alan peterson that aerel would continue to receive commissions on all orders placed during the contract term,even if those orders were not completed and paid for until after the contract expired.
during the term of the contract,aerel negotiated blanket purchase orders of pcc products with two italian companies,fiatavio and nuovo pignone.as the parties explained at oral argument,the blanket purchase orders in question,although submitted during the period of the agreement,did not become binding contracts until both the purchaser and pcc confirmed a specific against the blanket purchase order.these specific purchase orders led to continued sales in,and.in,for example,sales under the specific purchase orders totaled.the fiatavio purchase orders expired at the end of,but the nuovo pignone orders still led to significant sales in and.at the rates in the contract,aerel estimated that it would have earned over in commissions on the fiatavio and nuovo pignone purchase orders between and.but in october of,two months before the contract was set to expire,pcc informed aerel that the sales arrangement would not be renewed.pcc sent a check and an accompanying explanatory letter in march of,purporting to pay aerel for all of the commissions owed under the expired contract.
procedural background 
aerel filed its complaint in the district court in april of.the complaint sought recovery under the theories of breach of contract,and unjust enrichment.after attempts at mediation failed,pcc filed a motion for summary judgment.aerel responded with a for partial summary judgment.the district court denied aerel and granted pcc motion.aerel,pcc airfoils,d.aerel argued that the language of the contract clearly requires pcc to pay commissions on all orders initiated during the contract period or,in the alternative,that the contract was ambiguous.rejecting both of these arguments,the district court held that,under of the contract,aerel is not entitled to commissions after the termination of the contract.id.at.
the district court also rejected aerel contention that an alleged oral modification of the terms of after the contract was executed precluded summary judgment.this contention,the district court observed,was supported only by cosentini affidavit.id.at.in paragraphs and of the affidavit,cosentini averred that pcc sales director peterson had told him during and after the negotiation of the contract that aerel would receive the contested commissions,and that peterson representations either confirmed his interpretation of the written contract,or modified the written contract to match his previous interpretation.but the district court determined that these statements should have been revealed in cosentini deposition testimony.it therefore struck the two paragraphs in the affidavit that related to the alleged oral modification.id.at.finally,the district court granted summary judgment to pcc on the and claims,neither of which aerel has pursued on appeal.id.at.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the district court did not err in determining that no commissions were due after the contract expired 
aerel first argues,as it did before the district court,that of the contract clearly entitles aerel to all of the commissions that it seeks.this argument fails for two reasons.the first is that aerel itself recognizes that the operative phrase in sales originating from the territory is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.see schachner blue cross blue shield of ohio,cir contract language is ambiguous if it is subject to two reasonable interpretations.those varied interpretations center on the word originating,which could mean simply ordered,or,alternatively,could include the entire transactional process,from placement of the order through manufacturing,shipping,and receipt of payment.in other words,standing alone,does not answer the question of whether the contract required pcc to pay aerel commissions for products ordered,but not yet shipped,accepted,or paid for,during the term of the contract.
the second reason that aerel argument fails is that specifically covers the topic of commissions and therefore supersedes the more general terms of.under ohio law,a specific provision controls over a general one.monsler cincinnati cas,ohio app d,ohio see also bp chemicals,first state ins,cir explaining the principle that more specific provisions control over general ones.unlike,which governs commission rates generally for all sales during the contract period,focuses on the precise time when pcc duty to pay commissions ended.
the latter paragraph fixes the cessation of that duty at the termination of the contract,and does so in plain terms.aerel refers only to products that had previously been promoted by aerel is unpersuasive both because it adds a nonexistent term to an otherwise clear contractual provision and because,as soon as the contract period ended,any pcc product promoted by aerel would be one that aerel previously promoted.because the plain language of controls and displaces the general terms of,and because does not address the payment of commissions,we reject aerel first argument.
aerel alternative argument is that and,when juxtaposed with,create an ambiguity that must be construed against pcc as the drafter.see graham drydock coal,ohio,ohio reciting the rule that a contract is to be construed against the party who drew it.rejecting this contention,the district court concluded that the unambiguous language of controls the issue of commissions.aerel,d at.the district court further reasoned that the structure of the contract favored the interpretation advocated by pcc,since article ii discusses the various aspects of the parties dealings during the contract term,whereas the two provisions in article v specifically refer to when the contract expires and what happens upon termination.id.at.
we agree with the district court interpretation of the contract and reject aerel argument that the contract is ambiguous.aerel insists that the phrase sales of products promoted by aerel hereunder in is susceptible to at least two reasonable interpretations,one of which is that the phrase refers only to those products previously promoted and marketed by aerel.these latter products would be distinguished from products sold by pcc to existing customers during the requested tail period that would follow the termination of the contract.aerel reading of this otherwise straightforward language is an obvious attempt to create ambiguity where none exists,an attempt that contravenes ohio law in two ways.
the first way is that aerel,in support of its reading,relies on the extrinsic evidence of its request for commission tails to prove that addressed only that request.ohio courts,however,will not use extrinsic evidence to create an ambiguity rather,the ambiguity must be patent,apparent on the face of the contract.covington lucia,ohio app d,ohio citations and quotation marks omitted see also shifrin forest city enterprises,ohio,ohio explaining that extrinsic evidence will be considered in an effort to give effect to the parties intentions only if the language of a contract is unclear or ambiguous.no such patent ambiguity exists in the contract.
second,aerel appears to believe that the existence of competing readings of contractual language is sufficient in and of itself to render the provision ambiguous.this argument has been consistently rejected by various ohio courts.see,ohio water dev.auth.res.water,ohio app d,ohio explaining that the fact that parties may adopt conflicting interpretations of a contract between them,while involved in litigation,will not create ambiguity or a basis for unreasonable interpretation of the language.the ohio supreme court has recently reaffirmed that a contract susceptibility to more than one reading does not necessarily render the writing ambiguous.see state porterfield,ohio,ohio discussing the level of lucidity necessary for a writing to be unambiguous in the context of statutory interpretation see also united.of ohio williams excavating,ohio app d,ohio observing that contract language is ambiguous only if it is susceptible of two conflicting but reasonable interpretations emphasis added.aerel proposed construction of strikes us as unreasonable because such a construction would require pcc to pay aerel sales commissions for an indefinite period of time following that not even former required pcc to do under the previous agreements between the parties.
the structure of the contract also supports the district court conclusion.article ii contains nine provisions that,among other things,established aerel as pcc exclusive sales representative in italy,bound aerel via a noncompete clause for one year after the contract period,and dictated the time of payment and the commission rates.in contrast,article v contains only two provisions,the first of which set forth the beginning and the end of the contract period and the second of which,eliminated pcc obligation to pay commissions upon the termination of the contract.as explained above,nothing in article ii covers the payment of commissions,leaving the clear language of as the only section of the contract to address that issue directly.paragraphs and are therefore logically read as governing particular aspects of the parties ongoing relationship during the contract period,whereas resolves a question left unanswered by the former provisions.
the argument emphasized by aerel in its reply the district court attempt to harmonize articles ii and v leads to an absurd likewise unpersuasive.aerel contends that,under the district court interpretation of and,pcc could have refused to pay aerel commission on a completed contract if pcc payment obligation did not mature until less than days remained before the contract expired.this is possible,aerel says,because required that pcc pay aerel within days of receiving payment from the customer,thereby permitting pcc to deprive aerel of commissions otherwise due simply by withholding payment until after the contract expired.
we do not believe that the interpretation adopted by the district court leads to the absurd consequences that aerel postulates.first and foremost,the scenario envisioned by aerel is not the one at issue in the present case,which concerns blanket purchase orders that potentially generated commissions well after the termination date of the contract.these blanket purchase orders,as we explained above,did not become binding thus did not generate sales the customer confirmed a specific against its blanket purchase order.
secondly,aerel counsel confirmed at oral argument that no commissions on these specific became due in the last days of the contract term.in any event,principles of equity,which regard as done that which ought to be done,syring sartorious,ohio app d,ohio citations and quotation marks omitted,would likely have barred pcc from withholding commissions fully payable within days of the contract expiration.
aerel therefore confuses a hypothetical attempt by pcc to deprive aerel of commissions with pcc right under the contract to decline to pay commissions on orders that were initially negotiated during the contract term but were not finalized until after termination.in other words,of the contract would not likely have permitted pcc to deny aerel the commission payments otherwise due at the time of termination,but did permit pcc to refuse to pay commissions for orders that did not even become final until after the contract had expired.we acknowledge that,read in this manner,the contract might have decreased aerel incentive to seek out contracts on pcc behalf,and might also have affected aerel desire to work for pcc during the
