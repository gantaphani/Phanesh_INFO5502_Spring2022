plaintiff hannahville indian community plaintiff hannahville appeals the district court grant of a motion to enforce stipulation and consent judgment in favor of the governor of the state of michigan defendant pursuant to.and.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court decision and remand to the district court to resolve ambiguous terms in the stipulation and consent judgment with the aid of extrinsic evidence.
background 
factual history 
on october,the indian gaming regulatory act igra,et,was signed into law.the purpose of the igra was to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.almost immediately after the passage of the act,plaintiffs hannahville,sault marie tribe of chippewa indians,the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians,the keweena bay indian community,the bay mills indian community,the lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians,and the saginaw chippewa tribe of indians collectively the tribes began engaging in negotiations with defendant to enter into an agreement that would govern the operation of class iii games slot machines on the tribes native lands.disagreements about the scope of the igra led to a breakdown in these negotiations and subsequently to a suit filed in the district court by the tribes alleging that defendant refused to negotiate gaming compacts as was required by the igra.on august,the parties reached an agreement with respect to that claim,which was memorialized in a stipulation and incorporated into a consent judgment.
the stipulation and consent judgment set forth guidelines as to how the tribes would operate their michigan casinos.the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent judgment.one of the terms of the consent judgment was that the tribes agreed to make semiannual payments to any local unit of state government in the immediate vicinity of each tribal casino in the aggregate amount equal to two percent of the net win at each casino derived from all class iii electronic games of chance.at.the term net win was defined in the stipulation.specifically it stated n et win is defined as the total amount wagered on each electronic game of chance,minus the total amount paid to players for winning wagers at said machines.at.
plaintiff hannahville owns and operates the island resort and casino the island casino in harris,michigan.around,the island casino began producing and distributing promotional tokens to customers,which were good for a free play on the promotional slot machines.the tokens,called quicksilver tokens,were given out to customers completely free of charge.such comps are standard at casinos and are often used for marketing and promotional purposes.the quicksilver tokens could only be used while playing the quicksilver slot machines.the quicksilver machines accepted only those tokens,and the tokens themselves could not be redeemed for real money.the quicksilver machines did,however,pay out in real money one credit on a quicksilver machine was denoted as a quarter,and the machines paid quarters to patrons when they won.
while the tokens were not redeemable for cash,there was some discrepancy with respect to how they were valued.in its daily revenue report,which was an internal record kept to keep track of the casinos profits and losses,plaintiff hannahville valued quicksilver tokens at cents.further,the island casino advertised their distribution of comps,and afforded them a dollar value in those ads,though there is some discrepancy as to whether those ads were referring to quicksilver tokens or some other promotional wager program at the casino.
at the time plaintiffs and defendant entered into the consent judgment,the island casino had no promotional wagering programs in place,and accordingly,the consent judgment made no mention of how the casino should calculate net win with respect to promotional wagers.according to the stipulation and consent judgment,the island casino is required to pay of its net win to defendant.a dispute arose over how to value the promotional tokens when calculating net win.defendant argued that they should be valued at cents,but plaintiff hannahville decided that the tokens should be valued as a zero cent wager.however,because the quicksilver machines paid out in quarters,the money won by patrons on these machines was reflected in the net win calculus.the effect was that the quicksilver machines consistently showed no money being wagered,but money being paid out.thus,plaintiff hannahville practice of assigning the tokens a zero cent value resulted in these machines necessarily producing a net loss.because net wins are calculated across the entire floor of a casino and not on a machine by machine basis,this method of calculation lowered the island casino overall profits and,accordingly,it lowered the amount plaintiff hannahville was required to pay defendant.
ii.procedural history 
defendant filed a motion to enforce the stipulation and consent judgment on january.there were originally three issues defendant raised in the motion the calculation of net win from promotional wagers which is the issue currently before this court the inclusion of expenses from wide area progressive slot machines in the net win calculation and the process by which plaintiff hannahville distributes of the net win to local units of state government.at.the parties subsequently reached an agreement on the issue of the wide area progressive machines,and the district court dismissed the distribution issue without prejudice because plaintiff hannahville did not contest it.therefore,the first issue concerning calculation of net win was the only one before the district court,and accordingly,is the only issue before this court.
importantly,in the briefs submitted to this court and to the district court,both plaintiff hannahville and defendant attribute the alleged ambiguity to the entire phrase total amount wagered.however,the arguments put forward in those briefs focus specifically on the ambiguity of the term wager.additionally,during oral argument,the question of ambiguity was discussed only with respect to the term wager.we therefore conclude that the issue before this court is whether the term wager is ambiguous.
the district court noted that it was undisputed that the quicksilver tokens were considered wagers.because a wager,definitionally,must incorporate some type of value,the court reasoned that the dispute was over what value to assign the tokens.plaintiff hannahville argued that the tokens need not correspond to a monetary amount to have value.according to plaintiff hannahville,the value of the quicksilver tokens was that they were worth one chance to win a quarter.in support for its position,plaintiff hannahville attempted to introduce extrinsic evidence which showed that within the gaming industry,there is a way of understanding wagers which have no monetary value.therefore,plaintiff hannahville argued,the concept of wager is latently ambiguous when applied within the context of this industry.defendant countered that wager is unambiguous,and that the common sense definition of a wager contemplates a monetary value.thus,defendant urged the court to assign a monetary value of cents to the tokens.defendant based this figure on evidence it submitted that plaintiff hannahville assigned a cent value to the tokens in advertisements and internal records.
the district court held that the term wager was unambiguous and refused to consider plaintiff hannahville extrinsic evidence.instead,the court concluded that the tokens must be assigned a monetary value.the district court determined that,based on the advertisements and internal records introduced by defendant,it was clear that plaintiff hannahville valued the tokens at cents each.accordingly,the court granted defendant motion and ordered plaintiff hannahville to pay defendant plus interest,which is what defendant would have received if plaintiff hannahville had valued the tokens at cents each.the future value of the quicksilver tokens was not in dispute,as plaintiff hannahville no longer uses quicksilver tokens,but now gives away promotional free games on the regular slot machines using a card system.plaintiff hannahville calculates net win with respect to the promotional cards with the new system the same way it did with the quicksilver tokens.
the district court issued an order on july,granting the motion.on july,plaintiff hannahville timely filed a notice of appeal of the order because it had the effect of an injunction and was therefore appealable.a.the district court then entered a final judgment on november.plaintiff hannahville timely filed a second notice of appeal on november,as required by fed.a.plaintiff hannahville filed a motion to hold briefing schedule in abeyance so that the district court had time to consolidate the appeal from july,and the appeal from november.the district court granted that motion,so the two appeals have now been consolidated and are before this court as a single appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
a district court interpretation of a consent decree or judgment is a matter of law subject to de novo review,and the underlying findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.sault marie tribe of chippewa indians engler,cir.see also city of covington covington landing.partnership,cir.consent judgments are analyzed as contracts.engler,at.we have held that t he determination of whether a contract is ambiguous,thereby making extrinsic evidence admissible for interpretive purposes,is a question of law and therefore subject to de novo review.id.at.further,because the district court that interpreted this consent judgment is not the same one that wrote it,there is no need to apply the heightened deferential de novo review contemplated by this court in engler.id.at.finally,in deciding the questions of law presented,michigan law properly guided the district court and will guide this court as well.sawyer arum,cir 
ii.jurisdiction 
the united states constitution limits this court jurisdiction to actual,ongoing cases and controversies.const.art.iii.when the parties no longer have a presently existing legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation,a case is moot.murphy hunt,d.while neither party raises mootness,this court has an obligation to address jurisdiction in every case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d on every writ of error or appeal,the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,first,of this court,and then of the court from which the record comes.this question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself,even when not otherwise suggested,and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.internal citation and quotations marks omitted.
plaintiff hannahville admits that it no longer uses quicksilver tokens.that fact alone does not render this case moot.generally,a party lacks a sufficient present interest in the outcome of a case when a court is unable to effectuate any relief in the event of a favorable decision.murphy,at.in the instant case,though plaintiff hannahville is not presently using the quicksilver tokens,the dispute centers around back pay that defendant argues it is owed from plaintiff hannahville past accounting practices.furthermore,a n exception to the mootness doctrine exists for wrongs that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.libertarian party of ohio blackwell,cir.this exception applies when the challenged action ceases before it is able to be fully litigated,but there is a reasonable expectation or a demonstrated probability that the controversy will recur.id.because plaintiff hannahville still offers promotional wagers to patrons,which work the same way as the quicksilver tokens used to work,the controversy at issue here satisfies the libertarian party criteria of being capable of repetition,yet evading review.id.thus,although the tokens are not currently in use,this case is properly before us.
iii.analysis 
a.the district court committed reversible error by concluding that no latent ambiguity existed without first considering extrinsic evidence 
consent decrees and judgments are binding contracts.engler,at.according to michigan law,t he cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties.to this rule all others are subordinate.mcintosh groomes.our obligation in construing this consent judgment is to effectuate the intent of the parties,and extrinsic evidence is admissible only to the extent that it is necessary in order for us to do so.where a contract is unambiguous on its face,extrinsic evidence is inadmissible because no outside evidence can better evince the intent of the parties than the writing itself.city of grosse pointe park.mun.liab.prop.pool.only where a contract contains ambiguous terms will consideration of outside evidence be necessary.thus,the admissibility of extrinsic evidence is contingent upon some finding of contractual ambiguity.id.
ambiguity can come in two forms patent ambiguities and latent ambiguities.patent ambiguities are those that clearly appear on the face of a document,arising from the language itself.black law dictionary ed.therefore,a patent ambiguity will be readily apparent without the aid of extrinsic evidence to detect it.city of grosse pointe park,at.a latent ambiguity,on the other hand,is one that does not readily appear in the language of a document,but instead arises from a collateral matter when the document terms are applied or executed.black law dictionary ed.a latent ambiguity will often arise when a term is being used within a technical or specialized field.in wyckoff,standard fire ins,we noted that technical terms and words of art are given their technical meaning when used in transaction within their technical field,cir quoting restatement second of contracts b.thus,a word may have a meaning that is different from its ordinary meaning within a particular field and the ambiguity will only be revealed when that word is applied in context.id.where both parties define a term according to its technical definition,extrinsic evidence is necessary to ascertain the actual intent of the parties.see id.
according to michigan law,the burden is on the party alleging the ambiguity to present an interpretation of the contract that is equally as plausible as the common sense interpretation.smith abs,cir.the party alleging the ambiguity must carry this burden because a court can not create an ambiguity where none exists.upjohn new hampshire ins.if the alleging party presents evidence to prove a latent ambiguity it must be considered by the court.t he detection of a latent ambiguity requires a consideration of factors outside the instrument itself and therefore extrinsic evidence is obviously admissible to prove the existence of the ambiguity,as well as to resolve any ambiguity proven to exist.mccarty mercury metalcraft.in other words,the allegation of a latent ambiguity gives a court cause to consider extrinsic evidence at least once the court must consider the extrinsic evidence to determine if there exists an ambiguity and then,if an ambiguity does exist,the court must consider extrinsic evidence to resolve that ambiguity.
despite this tenet of michigan contract law,this court has had occasion to hold that no error occurred even though a district court failed to consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether a latent ambiguity existed.dailey john madden,wl,n.lexis,cir unpublished.in dailey,this court concluded that while the district court should have considered extrinsic evidence before concluding that no latent ambiguity existed,upon de novo review,it was clear that consideration of such evidence would have shown that no ambiguity existed.id.because we were convinced that the only reasonable conclusion after a review of the record was that no ambiguity existed,we held that there was no reversible error.id.thus,in spite of the failure to properly consider extrinsic evidence,we declined to reverse the district court decision.therefore,the mere fact that a district court improperly refuses to consider extrinsic evidence in its determination that there is no ambiguity does not ipso facto result in a reversible error.in our de novo revie
