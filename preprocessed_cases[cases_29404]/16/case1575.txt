brian audler audler appeals from the district court dismissal of his class action lawsuit predicated on the defendants allegedly erroneous determinations that property owned by audler and the other class members was located outside of a special flood hazard area sfha when,in fact,the property was located in a sfha.we first find that audler lacks standing to bring claims against any defendant other than cbc innovis cbc,and therefore dismiss these claims for lack of standing.the primary remaining issue on appeal is whether under louisiana law,cbc,a company which provides flood zone determinations to lenders,owed a duty to audler,the owner of a property allegedly erroneously determined to be located outside of a sfha.because we agree with the district court holding that there was no duty owed by cbc to audler,we affirm the district court dismissal of audler claims for negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and failure to warn.in addition,finding no reversible error,we affirm the district court dismissal of audler claims for detrimental reliance and breach of warranty.
the national flood insurance act of nfia,et,established the national flood insurance program nfip because private insurers were unable to offer reasonably priced flood insurance to the increasing number of people living in areas.the nfip made federally subsidized flood insurance available in areas and encouraged states and localities to adopt land use policies and regulations that reduce the risk of flood damage.a e till unifirst fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.in,congress enacted the flood disaster protection act,which amended the nfia to require flood insurance for loans secured by improved real estate situated within a sfha and to mandate that banks and similar lending institutions determine whether a property is located in a sfha and,if so,ensure that flood insurance is obtained.see and b.
after widespread floods in the midwest in,congress enacted the national flood insurance reform act reform act,which imposed new obligations on mortgage originators and services.the reform act amended the nfia to require that if a lender determines that a purchaser property is located in a sfha,the lender must notify the purchaser of the flood hazard in a written notice within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction.a.in addition,the reform act also strengthened the mandatory purchase requirements by requiring lenders to flood insurance if it is determined that flood insurance is inadequate or.b.the reform act also amended the nfia to permit lenders to delegate to third parties the task of determining whether a particular piece of property falls within a sfha,but only to the extent that such person guarantees the accuracy of the information.d.
a determination under the nfia that a property is not located within a sfha does not prevent a borrower from purchasing private flood insurance.
in march,audler refinanced his home located at juno drive,chalmette,louisiana with gulf coast bank and trust company gulf coast.gulf coast is a regulated lender,and in compliance with the nfia,gulf coast requested and obtained a standard flood hazard determination from cbc.cbc provides flood zone determinations to lenders subject to the nfia.on march,at the request of gulf coast,cbc executed a flood zone determination regarding audler chalmette,louisiana property utilizing the standard flood hazard determination form.the form provides the following certification is building mobile home in special flood hazard area.on the form executed by cbc in relation to audler property,this question was answered in the negative.audler alleges that the certification was incorrect,and that his property is actually located within a sfha.
on august,audler property was damaged by floodwaters from hurricane katrina.at the time,audler property was not insured by flood insurance.he alleges that his failure to obtain flood insurance was due to cbc certification that the property was not located in a sfha.
audler filed suit against cbc innovis cbc and nineteen other defendants alleged to be in the flood determination business,on his own behalf and as a representative of a class consisting of all homeowners and business owners who sustained flood damage from hurricanes katrina and rita in the state of louisiana who had no flood insurance at the time of their flood losses and regarding whose property a flood zone determination was performed prior to the hurricanes which incorrectly determined their property to be outside of a special flood hazard area.audler asserts a number of causes of action,all arising under louisiana law negligence and negligent misrepresentation pursuant to louisiana civil code articles and failure to warn detrimental reliance breach of guaranty or warranty and stipulation pour autrui.audler petition states that all claims are separate and apart from the federal flood insurance legislation governing lenders and that none of his claims arise under that legislation.
this case was originally filed in louisiana state court in the judicial district court for the parish of bernard,and was removed to federal court by defendant fnis flood services,based on jurisdiction under the class action fairness act,d cafa,and diversity jurisdiction under a.shortly thereafter,cbc timely filed another notice of removal which provided additional explanation for the cafa and diversity jurisdictional grounds and also asserted other grounds for federal jurisdiction federal question jurisdiction under and the nfia,and supplemental jurisdiction under.audler did not contest removal 
two motions to dismiss were then filed.first,cbc filed a motion to dismiss under rule b asserting that audler complaint does not state any grounds for relief under state law,either in tort or in contract with respect to the tort claims,cbc argued that when a flood zone determination company is hired by a lender to perform a flood zone determination,the flood zone determination company does not owe a duty to the borrower in the loan transaction.second,the remaining defendants class defendants none of whom were involved in the preparation of audler flood zone determination,filed a motion to dismiss adopting the arguments of cbc,but also setting forth additional grounds for dismissing the claims against them lack of standing,failure to allege causation,and improper joinder.after oral argument on the motion,the district court concluded that audler petition failed to state a claim for relief under louisiana law.consequently,the district court granted cbc motion and dismissed all defendants from the lawsuit.the district court then denied the other pending motions as moot.audler timely appealed.two of the class defendants,first american real estate solutions of texas,first american and wells fargo insurance,wells fargo have filed a motion to dismiss audler appeal for lack of standing.

before turning to the district court dismissal on the merits of audler claims,we first consider whether audler has standing to assert claims on behalf of the potential class members against the class defendants,which have caused audler no cognizable injury.in the motion to dismiss of first american and wells fargo,as well as the class defendants opposition brief,the class defendants argue that audler lacks standing to assert claims against the class defendants because none of these defendants ever issued a flood determination for his property.because standing is a jurisdictional requirement,we must address it before considering the merits of an appellant claim.doe tangipahoa parish sch,cir.
ordinarily,under the general principles of standing,a litigant may not merely champion the rights of another.scottsdale ins.knox park,cir citing rohm hass,ortiz.insulation,cir.instead,a plaintiff complaint must establish that he has a personal stake in the alleged dispute,and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.raines byrd,d.audler argues that these requirements do not prevent him from asserting claims against the defendant class on behalf of the potential class members because of the juridical link doctrine.
the fifth circuit has not yet addressed the juridical link doctrine,which arose out of the ninth circuit decision in la mar h b novelty loan,cir.lamar held that a plaintiff without a cause of action against a specific defendant can not fairly and adequately protect the interests of those who do have such causes of action for purposes of rule a.id.at citations omitted.nevertheless,the court went on to hold that if the plaintiffs as a and suffered an identical injury at the hands of several parties related by way of a conspiracy or concerted scheme,or otherwise juridically related in a manner that suggests a single resolution of the dispute would be expeditious,the claim could go forward.id.this doctrine is premised on the notion that the class,not the class representative,is the relevant legal entity for the purpose of article iii justiciability concerns.see payton county of kane,cir.because no class has been certified and because,for the reasons discussed below,audler direct claims must be dismissed,he can not serve as the representative of any properly certified class.a,faircloth fin.asset secs.mego mortg.homeowner loan trust,cir dismissing potential class members claims where lead plaintiff direct claims were dismissed.therefore,even were we to recognize the juridical link doctrine as a basis for standing,audler could not invoke it successfully.without the prospect of class certification,audler claims against the class defendants are nothing more than attempts to assert the injuries of others and therefore must be dismissed for lack of standing.see faircloth.at warth seldin,d.therefore,audler claims against the class defendants are dismissed and the motion to dismiss of first american and wells fargo is granted.
we now turn to the dismissal of audler claims against cbc.because cafa is based on diversity jurisdiction,state substantive law governs the determination of whether audler petition states a claim for relief.see braud transp.serv,cir cafa broadens diversity jurisdiction for certain qualifying class actions.ashland chem.barco,cir under the doctrine of erie railroad tompkins,in a diversity case a federal court must apply the substantive law of the state while following federal procedural rules.there are,however,no definitive answers in louisiana law to the questions presented.accordingly,this court,applying state substantive law,must make an educated erie guess as to how the louisiana supreme court would resolve the issues before us.leonard nationwide mut.ins,cir.in doing so,we may consult a variety of sources,including the general rule on the issue,decisions from other jurisdictions,and general policy concerns.stanley trinchard,cir.
negligence and negligent misrepresentation 
the first cause of action under louisiana law alleged by audler is for negligence and negligent misrepresentation under louisiana civil code articles and under louisiana law,t he analysis is the standard negligence analysis employed in determining whether to impose liability.lemann essen lane daiquiris,so d,see also barrie exterminators,so d,holding that case by case employment of the analysis is the appropriate standard in this state for determining legal responsibilities for negligent misrepresentations.under this approach,plaintiff must prove the following five elements 
the defendant had a duty to conform his conduct to a specific standard the duty element the defendant conduct failed to conform to the appropriate standard the breach element the defendant substandard conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff injuries the element the defendant substandard conduct was a legal cause of the plaintiff injuries the scope of liability or scope of protection element and the actual damages the damages element.
lemann,so d at citing fowler roberts,so d.a negative answer to any of the inquiries of the analysis results in a determination of no liability.mathieu imperial toy,so d.
a threshold issue in any negligence action is whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty.meany meany,so d.the relevant inquiry under louisiana law in a negligent misrepresentation case is whether,as a matter of law,a duty is owed to this particular plaintiff to protect him from this particular harm.barrie,so d at.in deciding whether to impose a duty in a particular case,louisiana courts examine whether the plaintiff has any law statutory,jurisprudential,or arising from general principles of fault to support the claim that the defendant owed him a duty.faucheaux terrebonne consol.gov t,so d.
audler argues that,under louisiana law,cbc owed a duty to him to provide accurate information with regards to the flood zone determination because cbc knew that the determination would be provided to audler and that audler would reasonably rely upon the determination.although audler disclaims that his arguments arise under federal law,he relies heavily on the portions of the nfia and implementing regulations which require that a borrower be notified of the results of the flood determination.in response,cbc argues that audler was not a member of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance the flood zone determination was supplied,and thus,under louisiana law,no duty was owed to audler.in support,cbc also points to the nfia for the proposition that the flood zone determination was undertaken solely for the benefit of the lender.
in support of his argument that cbc owed him a duty,audler relies on barrie exterminators,so d at.in barrie,the seller of a home obtained a termite inspection report that negligently concluded that the home had no evidence of termite infestation.the purchaser of the home sued,alleging negligent misrepresentation.the louisiana supreme court reversed the lower courts and held that the termite inspector owed the buyer a duty to provide accurate information.the court first noted that louisiana is a jurisdiction which allows recovery in tort for purely economic loss caused by negligent misrepresentation when privity of contract is absent.id.at.the court held that articles and are sufficiently broad to encompass a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.id.at.the court explained that 
the duty was owed to the barries even though they were a third party to,without privity of contract or direct or indirect contact,because they were known to as the intended users of the report.the barries were members of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance the report was contracted and supplied.owed the duty to the barries because of its knowledge that the ultimate purpose for the report,and its employment,was to facilitate the sale of the dwelling it inspected.the barries expected use of the report made the magnitude of their loss a foreseeable probability.the obligation for the liability is imposed by law based upon policy considerations due to the tortfeasor knowledge of the prospective use of the information which expands the bounds of his duty of reasonable care to encompass the intended user.
id.at.the court also found relevant the fact that did not perform its services gratuitously.id.rather,gathered and conveyed the information in the context of a business transaction for which received compensation.id.finally,the court noted that t ort liability extending to third persons for whose benefit and guidance the wood destroying insect report is supplied,promotes the maintenance of a high quality of services by the licensed structural pest control operator and imparts confidence in those services to the contracting party and to those persons who,due to current business practices,are expected to receive and rely upon the contents of the report.id.at.
thus,the barrie court identified a number of factors to consider when determining whether a duty is owed where the plaintiff alleges negligent misrepresentation and there is absence of privity of contract or fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the alleged tortfeasor.first,is whether the tortfeasor could expect that the plaintiffs would receive and rely upon the information.second,is whether the plaintiffs are members of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance the report was contracted and supplied.third,is whether the report is prepared in the context of a business transaction for which the alleged tortfeasor received compensation.fourth,is whether extending tort liability would serve public policy.
audler argues that the application of the barrie factors to the present case compels a finding that cbc owed audler a duty to provide an accurate flood zone determination.we disagree and hold that a flood determination company retained by the lender to perform a flood zone determination on a borrower property does not owe a duty to the borrower.
audler argument focuses primarily on the first barrie knowledge that the special flood zone report would be provided to him.we agree that given the requirements of the nfia,cbc knew that audler would be notified of the result of cbc determination that audler property was located outside of a sfha.however,standing alone,cbc knowledge that audler would receive the flood zone determination is not sufficient to impose a duty on cbc to provide accurate information to audler.see thomas livingston parish sheriff office,so d.
further,and this is the key distinction between barrie and the present case,audler is not a member of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance the special flood hazard determination was prepared.courts applying louisiana law in similar circumstances have found dispositive whether the plaintiff was an intended user and beneficiary of the disseminated information.for example,in thomas,so d at,plaintiff property was seized and sold by the sheriff department the sale was later set aside due allegedly to improper appraisals.the court held that plaintiff had no valid claim of negligence against the appraiser for the faulty appraisal because the appraiser,who was hired by the sheriff office,was hired on behalf of the seizing creditor.id.at.the only persons to whom a duty could be owed by the appraiser were the livingston parish sheriff office and the seizing creditor.id.similarly,in mclachlan new york life ins,cir,we considered whether an insurer owed a duty to disclose to the insured the results of medical tests undertaken by the insurer for the purposes of ascertaining whether the insurer would extend coverage.as part of his application for increased life insurance benefits,mclachlan submitted blood and urine samples to his insurer,new york life.although the results indicated elevated levels of two chemicals,phosphatase and creatinine,new york life mentioned only the former in its letter to mclachlan,explaining that it would issue a policy,but with a higher premium given the elevated phosphatase.after mclachlan was diagnosed with kidney failure,he sued new york life under general louisiana negligence law,complaining of the failure to advise him of the elevated creatinine.we held that mclachlan negligence claims must fail because new york life owed no duty to disclose the information to mclachlan.distinguishing barrie,we found that new york life purchased the medical tests for its own purposes and that mclachlan was not an intended recipient of the report.id.at.conversely,courts have permitted a negligent misrepresentation claim where the plaintiff was the intended user of the information.see,ducote jax holdings,bradley,wl,dist.lexis defendant liable to plaintiffs for misrepresentations regarding legality of tax strategies because the plaintiffs were the intended users of the information lifecare,b w quality growers,so d,finding insurance company liable for negligently misrepresenting insurance coverage information to hospital because lifecare the hospital was a member of the limited group for whose benefit accurate information regarding coverage must be supplied.
here,in contrast to the barrie plaintiffs,and like the plaintiffs in thomas and mclachlan,audler was not the intended beneficiary of the flood zone certification.gulf coast,the lender in the present case,purchased the flood zone determination from cbc pursuant to the requirements of the nfia.the nfia provides for and regulates flood zone determinations to ensure that lenders comply with the flood insurance provisions for the ultimate purpose of reducing flood relief costs to the federal treasury.wentwood woodside i lp gmac commer.mortg,cir stating that the class protected by the nfip is the federal treasury,not individual mortgagors.although congress intended to help borrowers damaged by flooding,the principal purpose in enacting the nfip was to reduce,by implementation of adequate land use controls and flood insurance,the massive burden on the federal fisc of the ever increasing federal flood disaster assistance.till,at.therefore,the purpose of the requirement that a lender obtain a flood zone determination is not to inform the borrower of the home flood zone status,but rather to protect the lender and the federal government from the financial risk that is posed by uninsured homes located in flood zones.see id.the flood zone report was prepared for the benefit of the lender,and indirectly the federal government audler was neither the intended user of the report,nor was he a member of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance the report was contracted and supplied.barrie,at see also duong allstate ins,d,distinguishing barrie because a flood zone determination is undertaken for the benefit of the lender and not for the benefit of the borrower.
the third factor identified by barrie is whether the information was supplied in the context of a business transaction for which the alleged tortfeasor received compensation.here,the flood zone determination report was prepared in the context of a transaction between audler and gulf coast,the refinancing of audler home,and cbc was compensated for the preparation of the report.however,in barrie the court found that the old minden rd bossier city,la ultimate purpose for the report,and its employment,was to facilitate the sale of the dwelling it inspected.indeed,in barrie,the obligation to obtain the termite certificate arose in the purchase agreement between the seller of the home and the barries.audler argues that gulf coast purpose of obtaining a flood zone determination was the same as the purpose of the lender in facilitate the completion of a transaction between the parties.this is not the case.the obligation to obtain a flood certificate did not arise from an agreement to obtain such in a contract between audler and gulf coast mortgage company rather,the obligation arose from the requirements of the nfia regulating the lender regarding its collateral property.see a,d.although the need to undertake a flood zone determination may have been triggered by audler refinancing,the purpose of the report was not to facilitate the transaction.instead,as explained above,gulf coast purpose in obtaining the flood zone determination was to aid gulf coast in complying with the nfia and to protect its collateral.see oliver cent.bank,so d,holding that lender owes no duty to borrower to procure flood insurance because lenders purpose in obtaining insurance pursuant to the nfia was to protect the bank collateral not to protect the borrower.
fourth,the court must consider whether extending tort liability in these circumstances would serve public policy.this court has previously found that congress did not intend to create a private right of action for violations of the nfia.till,at.of course,the question of whether a right of action exists for violations of the nfia is a matter of state law.till,at.however,state courts that have considered the issue have rejected any such common law causes of action,based in part on principles of federalism.see.bank of chicago first sav.loan ass of holland,d,we believe that
