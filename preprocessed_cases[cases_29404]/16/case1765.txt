commercial union insurance commercial and cu lloyd of texas cu lloyd collectively,appellants seek reversal of the district court decision to enforce a judgment obtained by valmont energy steel,and valmont microflect,collectively,valmont against continental manufacturing,continental,a company insured by appellants.the district court concluded that appellants insurance policies covered the injury suffered by valmont and enforced the judgment.appellants raise three points of error that there was no occurrence within the meaning of the insurance policies that there was no property damage within the meaning of the policies and that the your product exclusion in appellants policies with continental plainly excluded coverage.here,because we find the your product exclusion unambiguous,we need not address the questions of whether there was property damage and an occurrence within the meaning of appellants policies.we find the your product exclusion clearly barred coverage of the damages suffered by valmont.we thus reverse the decision of the district court and render judgment in favor of appellants.
background 
the pertinent underlying facts are as follows valmont entered into a contract with continental for the purchase of steel flanges for use in valmont construction of microwave towers.under the terms of the contract,the steel flanges were required to have a yield and tensile strength.with each shipment of flanges,continental agreed to include either a material test report mtr that verified the grade and quality of the steel used in the production of the flanges or a certification that continental had the original mtr verifying the steel specifications on file in their nacogdoches,texas,offices.continental represented to valmont that it had an mtr on file confirming that each steel flange satisfied valmont quality specifications.continental shipped the flanges to valmont,which used some flanges in the construction of a microwave tower.
a valmont customer service representative later noticed inconsistencies in the paperwork submitted by continental,and valmont requested that continental supply the mtrs.valmont then reviewed the mtrs and contacted the steel manufacturer listed,steel steel.steel responded that the mtrs had been substantially altered and that it could not verify to valmont the origin of the steel used in the flanges or the steel strength.valmont subsequently submitted six of the flanges to an independent tester to determine their tensile strength.in order to test the flanges,each had to be destroyed all six flanges failed to meet the contract specifications.
in november valmont filed a breach of contract suit against continental in district court relying upon diversity of citizenship for jurisdiction.a bench trial was held in november.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court in such prior suit concluded that continental had supplied false information because the steel used in the flanges was not of the quality specified continental had not maintained the original certifications on file continental had not exercised reasonable care in providing the certifications and the flanges were unusable by valmont because they could not be tested without destroying them.on february,the district court in such prior suit found continental liable to valmont for negligent misrepresentation and awarded valmont its out of pocket expenses,meaning the difference between the purchase price of the flanges and the value received,plus pecuniary total of.
appellants had provided continental with two commercial insurance policies a general liability policy and an umbrella policy.under the general policy,cu lloyd agreed to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which the insurance applies.the general policy defined property damage either as p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property,or as l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.property damage was covered by the general policy only if it was caused by an occurrence.the general policy defined occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.like the general policy,the umbrella policy issued by commercial applied to property damage caused by an occurrence.the umbrella policy thus provided similar coverage on an excess basis.
the general policy contained an exclusion that stated no coverage was provided for p roperty damage to your product arising out of it or any part of it.the term your product was defined in the general policy as a ny goods or products manufactured,sold,handled,distributed or disposed of by the insured.that definition of your product expressly included w arranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness,quality,durability,performance or use of your product.the umbrella policy also contained an identical your product exclusion and similarly defined your product.
after judgment for valmont was entered in the prior suit,continental filed for bankruptcy and appellants refused to indemnify continental because the damages caused by continental were outside the scope of the policies.on february,valmont filed the present diversity suit as judgment creditor against appellants in district court,alleging appellants were liable to pay valmont damages under the terms of their policies with continental.on october,appellants moved for summary judgment,arguing first,that continental negligent misrepresentations did not cause property damage because valmont was awarded only economic damages in the underlying suit second,that negligent misrepresentation did not constitute an occurrence within the meaning of the policies and third,that the your product exclusion barred any coverage.
the district court disagreed and denied appellants motion on september.the court found property damage because the flanges were rendered unusable by continental carelessness.under the plain terms of the policies,the loss of use of the flanges constituted property damage.pursuant to case law,the court further held that continental negligent misrepresentations constituted an occurrence.lastly,the district court concluded that the your product exclusion did not bar coverage here because the exclusion conflicted with the operations hazard definition and the operations aggregate limit in the appeared to provide coverage.given the conflict,the district court concluded the your product exclusion was ambiguous and allowed coverage.valmont then moved for summary judgment on january.the district court relied on its findings from its order denying appellants motion for summary judgment and granted valmont motion for summary judgment on march.appellants timely appealed.
