kellie ballard appeals from the judgment of the district court dismissing her federal and state equal credit opportunity act ecoa claims,and her claims for unjust enrichment and a declaratory judgment.we affirm.
kellie ballard husband,michael ballard,owns and operates foodswing,a company.in march,he entered into an agreement with bank of america the bank to obtain a loan for foodswing in the amount of.although ballard assertedly plays no role in the ownership or operation of foodswing,bank of america required her to sign the loan agreement as a guarantor.she guaranteed full and complete payment of the loan and waived a ll rights of redemption with respect to the property securing the loan.
in,foodswing defaulted on the loan.michael ballard then entered into a modified loan agreement with bank of america to restructure the debt.foodswing defaulted two more in and once in.more debt restructuring agreements followed these defaults.as with the initial loan,bank of america required that ballard guarantee each new agreement.these restructuring agreements contained a comprehensive waiver requiring and ballard to waive any and all claims past,present,or future against bank of america.in each agreement,and ballard acknowledged that they actively and with full understanding participated in negotiating the agreement after consultation and review with their counsel.
although counsel represented ballard at the time she signed all of the loan documents,she contends that her counsel operated under impermissible conflicts of interest.she alleges that she signed the loan agreements only at the insistence of her conflicted attorneys.at oral argument,ballard counsel also claimed that her husband misinformed her about the nature of the documents she signed.
among other assets,a home in maryland and a winery in california secured the loans to foodswing.ballard these two properties with her husband.after the default,bank of america recorded consensual liens on both properties.
in november,ballard filed this action against bank of america.she alleges that the bank violated the federal and state ecoa by requiring her to serve as her husband guarantor.she seeks equitable and injunctive relief for these asserted ecoa violations,asserts a claim for unjust enrichment,and seeks a declaratory judgment.the district court dismissed her complaint with prejudice,reasoning that she failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and that,in any event,waiver and limitations barred her claims.

the equal credit opportunity act makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant,with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of marital status.a.specifically,ecoa regulations prohibit lenders from requiring a spouse signature on a loan agreement when the applicant individually qualifies for the requested credit.d lenders may not require the signature of an applicant spouse or other person,other than a joint applicant,on any credit instrument if the applicant qualifies under the creditor standards of creditworthiness.congress enacted this prohibition to eradicate credit discrimination against married women,whom many creditors traditionally had refused to consider for individual credit.
not every signature required of a borrower spouse,however,constitutes credit discrimination under ecoa.rather,the statutory scheme provides for several exceptions permitting lenders to obtain the signature of a borrower spouse on a loan agreement.
first,and most obviously,ecoa regulations expressly authorize lenders to obtain the signature of a borrower spouse if the borrower does not independently qualify for the loan.but lenders may obtain the spouse signature only after determining that the borrower does not qualify under the creditor standards of creditworthiness for the amount and terms of the credit requested.id.
second,ecoa permits lenders to obtain the signature of a borrower spouse who owns or the entity benefitting from the loan.even if the spouse does not technically apply for the loan herself,she qualifies as a de facto joint applicant because she possesses an ownership stake in the business for which the loan is sought.given that ecoa regulations expressly permit a lender to require a signature from a joint applicant spouse,see,courts have found no ecoa violation where a lender requires a signature from a de facto joint applicant spouse.see midlantic bank hansen,cir because loans financed a company by the spouses,the wife at the very least was a de facto joint applicant who could be required to guarantee the loans riggs bank of webster,because the loan was obtained to renovate a property owned by the borrower wife,she was de facto a joint applicant who could be required to guarantee the loan.thus,banks may treat the of a business as a joint applicant for a loan to that business even if the happens to be the primary applicant spouse.
third,when two spouses property designated as collateral for a loan as opposed to the entity seeking a loan,ecoa permits a lender to require the spouse to sign the loan for the purpose of creating a valid lien,passing clear title,waiving inchoate rights to property,or assigning earnings.a.ecoa regulations clarify that,in an application for secured credit,a creditor may require the signature of the applicant spouse on any instrument necessary,or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary,under applicable state law to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default.d.these provisions ensure that a lender can acquire collateral by the borrower spouse in the event that the borrower defaults.
the parties primarily contest and the district court primarily addressed whether bank of america violated ecoa.we therefore consider this question first.
ballard contends that bank of america violated ecoa by forcing her to guarantee the loan agreement without first evaluating her husband independent creditworthiness she apparently concedes that it would have been permissible to require her signature for the limited purpose of relinquishing her rights to property she with her husband the maryland home and the california winery.appellant br.but she claims that ecoa prohibited bank of america from requiring her to assume unlimited liability on the debt.
ecoa text lends support to ballard claim that bank of america violated ecoa by requiring her to guarantee the foodswing loan.it is undisputed that bank of america required ballard to execute an unlimited guarantee of the loan.this guarantee was therefore permissible only if it was subject to an exception to ecoa general rule barring lenders from requiring a spousal signature.no such exception is apparent here.
first,the guarantee apparently can not be justified on the ground that the bank had concluded that ballard was not creditworthy.this is so because ballard alleges in her complaint that bank of america did not assess her husband creditworthiness before requiring her to sign on the loan.in reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss,we must assume the truth of this allegation.
second,obtaining ballard signature apparently can not be justified on the ground that she the business benefitting from the loan.ballard alleges in her complaint that she is neither an owner nor a shareholder of foodswing.and so,again,we must assume the truth of this allegation at this stage of the litigation.because spouses are de facto joint applicants only when they the entity benefitting from the loan,the bank apparently could not require ballard to sign as a guarantor on the theory that she was a de facto joint applicant.
finally,it does not appear that the unlimited guarantee can be justified on the ground that ballard two properties securing the loan.although ecoa permits lender
