sheila gilley and thomas gilley,independent administrator of the estate of george gilley the gilleys,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the government on claims under the federal debt collection procedures act fdcpa,and common law unjust enrichment.the gilleys argue that the district court improperly concluded that sheila gilley was unjustly enriched when a certificate of deposit that she posted as collateral for a bank loan to her husband company,against which the government had filed a false claims act suit,was returned to her after the loan was released and when a loan of that she made to her husband company was repaid.further,the gilleys argue that the district court improperly found that monthly payments made to sheila gilley by her husband from to constituted fraudulent transfers under the fdcpa.
the government counters that the district court properly found that sheila gilley was unjustly enriched when the loans she made to her husband insolvent company were repaid in full,while the government has never been recompensed for the money that george gilley fraudulently obtained from it.the government further argues that the district court correctly found that the monthly payments made by george gilley to his wife from to were fraudulent under two separate provisions of the fdcpa because they were not made for reasonably equivalent value and they were made with the actual intent to defraud the government.
we conclude that the district court incorrectly entered summary judgment in the government favor and,therefore,we vacate that decision in its entirety and remand for proceedings in accord with this opinion.
background 
in november,the united states of america recovered a million judgment against a defunct home health care company,century health services,century,and two of its former executives,george gilley and billie goforth,on claims under the false claims act for misuse of medicare reimbursement funds 
unable to obtain satisfaction of this judgment from the defendants,the government filed suit in november against the wives of george gilley and billie goforth,alleging that the wives should be held liable under the fdcpa and common law theolies of unjust enrichment to satisfy,at least in part,the judgment rendered against their husbands 
the government moved for summary judgment in august.the government eventually reached a settlement with the goforths but it proceeded to seek summary judgment against the gilleys,based on three main arguments.first,the government asserted that sheila gilley was liable under the theory of unjust enrichment in relation to a certificate of deposit cd which she owned and which,in may,she put up as collateral for a loan to century by south holland bank.the cd was released to gilley in september,when the loan was paid off with proceeds from the sale of the bulk of century assets to another health care company.second,the government asserted that sheila gilley was liable under the principle of unjust enrichment for,the amount of a loan that she made directly to century in april,which also was repaid following the sale of century assets.third,the government asserted that sheila gilley was liable under the fdcpa for,the total amount of monthly payments that she received from her husband from to,allegedly to cover household expenses 
the government based only its third household expense the fdcpa.its summary judgment motion on the first two grounds rested only on the theory of unjust enrichment,although it made reference in its brief to the policies and considerations of the fdcpa.
in an opinion and order dated august,the district court found in favor of the government and entered judgment in the amount of,consisting of,the amount of the south holland bank loan to century which was secured by sheila gilley cd,the amount of the april loan made by sheila gilley to century and,the sum of monthly payments made by george gilley to his wife from to the court based its award on the first two components of the judgment on both the fdcpa,a,and the theory of unjust enrichment.its award on the third component was based only on the fdcpa,a.
in their timely appeal,the gilleys challenge all aspects of the district court opinion,order,and judgment.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to because the united states was the plaintiff,as well as under,because the action arose under a federal statute,the fdcpa.this court has appellate jurisdiction under.

iii.analysis 
the elements of an unjust enrichment claim under tennessee law,which the parties agree applies here,are a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff appreciation by the defendant of such benefit and acceptance of such benefit under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for him or her to retain the benefit without payment of the value thereof.freeman,llc eastman chem,citation omitted.under tennessee law,to establish an unjust enrichment claim,a plaintiff must have conferred a benefit upon the defendant.perry v.the american tobacco,cir citing paschall,dozier.
the government claims for unjust enrichment against sheila gilley based on the release of her cd by the south holland bank and the repayment by century of the loan fail because the government conferred no benefit,directly or indirectly,on sheila gilley in connection with these transactions.it is undisputed that the cd was at all times sheila gilley property and,upon repayment of the south holland bank loan,the encumbrance incurred through its collateralization was simply released.sheila gilley was left with nothing more than what she owned in the first place.similarly,the repayment by century of the loan from sheila gilley was simply the fulfillment of a contractual obligation,and it conferred no benefit on gilley.
in analogous circumstances,courts have found that the theory of unjust enrichment may not be used to allow a stranger to a loan contract or promissory note to seek funds repaid pursuant to such an agreement.for example,in comerica suburban trust and savings bank,wl cir,we held that the repayment of loans by a company who fraudulently pledged the same collateral to different lenders did not unjustly enrich the lender who was repaid while other lenders loans went unsatisfied.applying the michigan standard for unjust enrichment,which is arguably broader than tennessee,this court nonetheless found that the repayment of a loan under such circumstances did not support a claim for unjust enrichment 
first,comerica has failed to establish that columbia received any benefit from comerica.the record reflects that columbia loaned computer leasco million in exchange for a promissory note,which was repaid in full.comerica does not allege that columbia was paid more than what was due.unlike the cases cited by comerica,no benefit arose from plaintiff that was inappropriately or illegally transferred to defendant second,no inequity has been shown by columbia retention of the amounts it was owed.to allow comerica to recover against columbia would be to substitute one promisor,in this case computer leasco,with another,columbia,an impermissible result under unjust enrichment law.
