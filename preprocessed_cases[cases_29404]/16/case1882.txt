barbara conner,and harvey renger,collectively the doctors appeal the district court partial grant of summary judgment to the lavaca hospital district,its board of directors,and its medical director collectively the defendants.we affirm.
from through part of,the doctors,both practitioners of family medicine,worked at the lavaca family health clinic the clinic,a rural health clinic operated by the lavaca hospital district the district.pursuant to written contracts,the doctors provided services to the clinic and leased the use of the facilities of the clinic and the district hospital,the lavaca medical center the hospital.conner contracts were for terms.both her and contracts guaranteed a monthly salary plus a fixed amount for each clinic patient she treated.in,conner entered into another agreement with the district under which she received a monthly salary plus percent of the gross charges from her patients at the clinic and the hospital that were generated in excess of her monthly salary.
as the expiration of her contract approached,conner entered into negotiations with the district for a new contract.around that same time,the internal revenue service notified conner that she had dramatically understated her income.after discussing this problem with the hospital,she concluded that the method of billing employed under her current contract would continue to cause the understatement of her income and that it would be necessary for her new contract to separate clinic funds from hospital funds.after the expiration of her contract,conner entered into a series of contracts,the last of which expired june.from the time of the expiration of her last contract,conner worked for the district without a contract,continuing to negotiate for a new contract.
renger entered into contracts with the district.renger and contracts,like conner contracts,provided a monthly salary.under these contracts,renger received percent of the gross charges that exceeded his base salary.renger contracts also included a provision for a workweek.renger health problems necessitated this limited work schedule.renger contract was to expire at the end of,and he too entered into negotiations with the district as that expiration approached.
after attempts to negotiate a new contract,the doctors appeared at an october,meeting of the district board of directors the board.the meeting agenda slated the board to receive information from renger and conner on rural health clinic physician contracts and have consultation with the hospital district attorney on rural health clinic physician agreements.with all of its members present,the board voted unanimously to adopt the following motion 
to enter into a new agreement for harvey renger with a monthly compensation of per month,eighteen days vacation,term the attorneys,administrator and representative of the doctor would get together with regard to the additional for gross charges,what does that include,how can we legally do that,and come back to the board and the doctors for approval on that issue and the same with regard to the medical directorship position that again would be something that would be worked out preferably by the doctors involved and that barbara conner agreement would be per month,eighteen days vacation,term retroactive to july,the attorneys,administrator and representatives of the doctor would get together with regard to the additional for gross charges,what does that include,how can we legally do that,and come back to the board and the doctors for approval on that issue and the same with regard to the medical directorship position that again would be something that would be worked out preferably by the doctors involved.
the board subsequently approved the minutes reflecting this motion on november,and both the board secretary and president signed the minutes.
two days after the october meeting,the board executive committee met to discuss some of its members apprehensions about the october motion.the executive committee decided to hold an emergency board meeting that evening,october.at that emergency meeting,the board voted to rescind the october motion.despite the motion rescission,the doctors continued to provide services to the clinic until april.during that time,the district made other offers to the doctors containing less lucrative terms than those contained in the october motion the parties were unable to reach an agreement.
subsequently,the doctors filed suit against the defendants,alleging various federal and state law claims.they filed for partial summary judgment on a number of their claims including breach of contract,anticipatory repudiation,and the hospital statute of frauds affirmative defense the defendants also filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the october motion did not satisfy the statute of frauds because the motion expressed merely an offer because it failed to show that the doctors consented to the motion and it lacked the essential elements of a contract,with one of the terms too indefinite to enforce and two material elements missing altogether from the motion.the district court found that without an enforceable contract the following claims failed impairment of contract in violation of the contracts clause,const.art.i,anticipatory repudiation and breach of contract claims for violation of the doctors due process rights and tortious interference with contract.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment on these claims.
pursuant to b,the district court certified that its order granting partial summary judgment involved a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.a panel of this court granted leave for interlocutory appeal.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standards as the district court.see mcclendon city of columbia,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see rios rossotti,cir auguster vermilion parish sch,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.we can affirm a grant of summary judgment on any grounds supported by the summary judgment record.see cabrol town of youngsville,cir.
on appeal,the doctors contend that the district court erred in finding that the motion was not an enforceable contract under the statute of frauds that even if the motion failed to satisfy the statute of frauds,their part performance took the contract out of the statute of frauds and in support of their claims,the doctors asseverate that,even without an enforceable contract,they had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment,and thus had a property interest protected by the due process clause.we address each of these contentions in turn,finding none of them availing.
under texas law whether a contract falls within the statute of frauds is a question of law.see choi mckenzie,christi.a promise that is not performable within a year of its inception must satisfy the statute of frauds.see.bus.ann.b vernon.in the case at bar,the october motion contains a term of employment,placing it squarely within the statute of frauds.
to satisfy the statute of frauds and thus be enforceable,the oral agreement must be evidenced by a written memorandum which is complete within itself in every material detail,and which contains all of the essential elements of the agreement,so that the contract can be ascertained from the writings without resorting to oral testimony.cohen mccutchin,see ep operating mjc energy,christi,writ denied.the minutes of a board meeting can satisfy this writing requirement.see,republic supply waggoner,writ ref minutes were sufficient memorandum of oral contract kerby collin county,no writ same.it must also be signed by the party charged with its enforcement.see.bus.ann.a vernon.
generally,duration,compensation,and the employee duties are essential elements of an employment contract.see foley whitehill,writ dismissed duration is an essential element hurt standard oil,paso,no writ employee stock plan failed to satisfy statute of frauds where it did not contain,inter alia,the wages to be paid farrar.indep.sch,writ ref board minutes failed to set out terms of employment contract such as compensation,the duties to be performed,and the working hours see also martin credit protection ass n,writ dismissed covenant not to compete was not ancillary to an employment contract where contract did not contain any terms or provisions usually associated with an employment contract such as title,position,duration of employment,compensation,duties or responsibilities.while these are often the terms of an employment contract,under texas contract law,e ach contract is considered separately to determine its material terms.stanley boot bank of el paso,no writ.thus,even if the terms set out in the memorandum under consideration previously have been found to satisfy the statute of frauds,those terms are not necessarily sufficient in the case at hand.see lynx explor.prod.oper,writ denied finding that although elements set out in contract had been found to satisfy the statute of frauds in another case,the incorporation of additional indefinite terms in the case at bar made the contract unenforceable.the parties can leave some of the contract terms open for future negotiation.see scott ingle.pacific,but parties may agree upon some of the terms of a contract,and understand them to be an agreement,and yet leave other portions of an agreement to be made later.nonetheless,those terms left open can not be essential or material elements of the contract because leaving such terms open renders the contract unenforceable under the statute of frauds.see valores corporativos,de mclane,antonio,pet.denied when a material element is left unresolved and subject to future negotiations,there is no binding contract.internal quotations and citations omitted.in determining whether a term is an essential element of a contract,we look at whether a party rejection of the term could have affected the negotiation of the other terms.crss runion,dist,pet.denied see neeley bankers trust,cir applying texas law a n essential promise denotes one that the parties reasonably regarded,at the time of contracting,as a vitally important part of the bargain.failure to fulfill such a promise,in other words,would seriously frustrate the expectations of one or more parties as to what would constitute sufficient performance of the contract as a whole.
the doctors contend that the october motion satisfied the statute of frauds because the contract contained the essential elements of an employment contract,namely,monthly salary,duration,and vacation terms.the motion does not outline how the gross charges were to be attributed for tax purposes,nor does it include renger limited work schedule.nevertheless,the doctors maintain that the absence of these terms does not prevent the motion from satisfying the statute of frauds because these terms were not essential elements,and,therefore,could be left for future negotiation.
with respect to the attribution of the gross charges,the doctors assert that this is a ministerial detail,and as such could be left open.the doctors compare this term to the payment of taxes or insurance in mcculley fine arts gallery,x partners,paso,no writ,which the texas court of appeals concluded were details involv ing the form and not the substance of the transaction and therefore were not essential elements of the contract.unlike in mcculley,where no party indicated that taxes and insurance payments were of any import,conner testified as to the significance of the attribution term to her.the irs notified her that she had dramatically understated her income.conner concluded this problem arose from the terms of her last contract and,to prevent this problem,she sought to have included in her contract a term clarifying the attribution of clinic and hospital revenues.thus,while the attribution could in other circumstances be simply a ministerial term concerning the form of the transaction,conner testimony established that she considered the attribution of gross charges a necessary term in the new contract.consequently,we find that this term was an essential element of a contract between conner and the district and its absence from the october motion renders the contract unenforceable as to conner.
as with the attribution of income,the doctors maintain that renger schedule term was a detail that could be left open.specifically,the doctors correctly assert that renger schedule was not the source of any disagreement among the parties and that all terms agreed upon by the parties need not appear in the writing.see preload tech.constr,cir applying texas law a memorandum of an agreement need not embody all terms agreed upon botello.nonetheless,the proposition that all the terms agreed upon by the parties need not appear in the memorandum governs only if the schedule is not an essential element because the essential elements of a contract must appear in the writing to satisfy the statute of frauds.in short,we must first decide whether the schedule is an essential element of the contract.
to this end,the doctors point to cases where texas courts have enforced contracts that were silent as to the employee schedule.see winograd willis,dist,writ denied bordeleau universal weather aviation,writ ref.in doing so,the doctors assume that if an employee schedule was not an essential element in one contract,a schedule is not an essential element in another contract.this approach ignores that the determination of whether a term is essential must be done with respect to the contract and the particular circumstances in each case.in this case,it is undisputed that renger had health problems that limited his work schedule.past contracts with the district provided renger with a workweek in the clinic.altering renger schedule to require a full workweek would have had serious negative consequences for the negotiation of his contract given that the schedule was borne out of medical necessity rather than mere convenience.consequently,renger schedule is an essential element of the contract and had to be expressed in the october motion.
the doctors also claim that renger contract is a renewal contract,and,therefore,we can imply the schedule term as part of his contract.we disagree.first,the october motion was not simply a renewal contract.the motion changed material terms of the doctors employment contract,such as their salaries.moreover,the motion itself refers to the agreement as new and it does not allude to the terms of past contracts.therefore,the october motion can only be considered a renewal contract if a renewal contract is defined generally as a contract between parties who had a previous contractual relationship and who are negotiating for a subsequent contract,a broad definition for which we have found no support in texas law.
second,even if it was a renewal contract,the doctors have supplied no authority,nor have we found any,for the proposition that a term that would otherwise be an essential element can be implied from its inclusion in earlier contracts where the contract being negotiated is a renewal contract.see also montgomery county hosp.dist.brown,noting in statute of frauds case that e ven if a term can be supplied by implication,there is no basis for doing so in this case emphasis added.instead,we find instructive the requirement that where an oral contract is memoralized in more than one writing,one of the writings must refer to the others in order for the writings to be read together.see owen hendricks,see also boddy gray,writ ref w e can only look to the writings for the essential elements of an alleged contract.the october motion makes no reference to the schedule set out in previous contracts nor to any of the prior agreements between the doctors and the district.hence,this argument fails,rendering the
