in this declaratory judgment action,the district court granted two motions for summary judgment by landmark insurance landmark and denied a by scottsdale insurance scottsdale.the court concluded that landmark did not owe a duty to defend and was not obligated to cover breach of warranty claims brought in an underlying suit against shade tree electric,shade tree,which was the insured of both scottsdale and landmark.knox park construction knox park,who had asserted the breach of warranty claims,had joined scottsdale concerning the coverage issue.scottsdale and knox park appeal.we dismiss the appeal of knox park,and as to the appeal of scottsdale,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
facts and proceedings 
in an underlying state court action,knox park sued shade tree after identifying construction defects in work performed by shade tree for knox park.knox park asserted,inter alia,negligence,breach of warranty,and breach of contract causes of action.in september,scottsdale sought a declaratory judgment in federal court regarding its duties to defend indemnify its insured,shade tree in the underlying dispute.scottsdale was shade tree primary insurer,and knox park and shade tree were the original named defendants in the declaratory judgment action.
in december,scottsdale filed an amended complaint in the declaratory judgment action,adding landmark,another of shade tree insurers,as a defendant.the initial and amended federal complaints together asserted that landmark owed an obligation to defend and indemnify shade tree and that scottsdale did not.in the federal action,knox park never filed a against its landmark.
landmark moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that scottsdale,and not landmark,owed a duty to defend shade tree in the underlying state court suit.the district court granted landmark motion and later administratively closed the case pending the resolution of the case in state court.scottsdale,shade tree,and knox park later settled the state court action for.the settlement agreement provided that scottsdale would pay to knox park.in exchange,knox park released shade tree and scottsdale from all liability.landmark was not a party to the agreement and,consequently,received no favors from the parties to it.knox park reserved the right to recover the difference between and million from landmark alone.scottsdale reserved its right to recoup part of the in settlement funds from landmark in the federal action.
following the settlement,the district court the federal action,and landmark filed a second motion for summary judgment,arguing that scottsdale had not shown an ultimate defined loss in excess of the scottsdale policy limit that would trigger coverage under the landmark policy scottsdale had not complied with all conditions precedent to recovery in the landmark policy and scottsdale had not shown that shade tree was the insured in the landmark policy.scottsdale opposed and filed a for summary judgment against landmark knox park purported to join the,though it had never filed a claim against landmark.
reaching only the first of landmark arguments,the district court found that scottsdale had failed to demonstrate an ultimate net loss in excess of the limit reserved to the scottsdale policy and granted summary judgment in favor of landmark.

questions of standing are reviewed de novo.maiz virani,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment is also reviewed de novo.morris equifax info,llc,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.the parties do not dispute that texas law applies to this diversity case.see erie tompkins.
iii.discussion 
three issues are raised by the parties landmark argues that knox park does not have standing to appeal scottsdale and knox park assert that the district court grant of summary judgment on the coverage issue was erroneous and scottsdale alone argues that the district court grant of summary judgment on the duty to defend issue was in error.
whether a party has standing to appeal involves the question of justiciability,namely,whether the plaintiff has made out a case or controversy between himself and the defendant within the meaning of article iii.rohm hass,ortiz.insulation,cir.merely because a party appears in the district court proceedings does not mean that the party automatically has standing to appeal the judgment rendered by that court.id.there must be some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action,warth seldin,d internal quotation omitted,and a litigant may not merely champion the rights of another,ortiz,at.regarding the injury required,a n indirect financial stake in another party claims is insufficient to create standing on appeal.id.alteration in original internal quotation omitted.t he injury or threat of injury must be both real and immediate,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.internal quotation omitted.
we agree with landmark that knox park has no standing to appeal.knox park has never filed a against landmark.instead,knox park joined scottsdale motion for summary judgment on scottsdale claim that sought to establish that the landmark policy covers breach of warranty damages and,consequently,that landmark must indemnify scottsdale for the amount scottsdale paid to knox park for such damages.knox park,however,can not champion a claim brought by scottsdale.id.at.knox park does not gain anything if scottsdale prevails and wins indemnity from landmark because knox park has released scottsdale from liability.
without a claim of its own in the federal litigation,knox park has only an indirect financial stake in the resolution of the coverage dispute through its ability to litigate its claims in the future.id.at internal quotation omitted.the district court judgment concerned whether the landmark policy covered breach of warranty damages caused by the insured.because knox park is neither the insured nor an insurer in this dispute,a determination that the landmark policy covers breach of warranty damages does not automatically result in a recovery by knox park of the damages that it preserved in the state court settlement agreement and now seeks on appeal.without a claim,knox park can only posit that a favorable coverage ruling here is likely to later result in its recovery of damages from landmark after a settlement or further litigation.
knox park raises some arguments in support of standing,all of which are meritless.knox park contends that a holding that it has no standing could result in conflicting judgments,speculating that if it is dismissed and this court holds that the landmark policy does not cover breach of warranty damages,a subsequent suit between knox park and landmark could end with a contrary result.a potential for conflicting results,however,does not confer standing without a direct,real,and immediate injury.see id.the test for standing focuses on whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of jurisdiction,warth,at.quoting baker carr,d,not on whether the result may possibly conflict with that in a hypothetical future lawsuit.
knox park also argues that its failure to file a claim against landmark is not fatal because the federal rules render permissive and because it does not need its own claim,since scottsdale complaint sought declarations regarding all parties rights and duties.knox park is correct that are permissive,but their permissiveness speaks not to whether relief can be granted when there is no claim filed but to whether those claims can be brought in subsequent litigation.see dunn sears,roebuck,cir c ross claims are permissive rather than compulsory,and a party to an action has the option to pursue them in an independent action.
knox park argument that it has standing based on scottsdale request for declarations of all parties rights and duties is also flawed.declaratory judgment does not exist to allow courts to decide rights between two when they have not sought to have their rights declared.the declaratory judgment act provides that any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.a emphasis added.similarly,summary judgment is available only for parties who have filed a claim.see.a a party seeking to recover upon a claim,counterclaim,or or to obtain a declaratory judgment may move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment.knox park and landmark did not formally seek to have their rights one another determined by the district court.knox park appeal is dismissed.
the resolution of this issue depends entirely on language in the policies.the district court granted landmark motion for summary judgment and denied scottsdale and knox park motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the landmark policy covered any of knox park claims against shade tree.the court found that scottsdale presented no evidence of a loss that would trigger the landmark policy,which the district court found to exist for damages caused by the insured that exceeded.scottsdale challenges this ruling,contending that the breach of warranty damages were covered by the landmark policy and not the scottsdale policy.landmark is therefore required,according to scottsdale,to indemnify it for the portion of the paid to knox park that represents payments for breach of warranty damages.
landmark subrogation arguments 
landmark argues that scottsdale right to indemnification is based on scottsdale contractual subrogation to the rights of its insured,shade tree,and that the settlement agreement released shade tree from liability,thus extinguishing any subrogation rights.
landmark argument is unavailing,however,because even assuming scottsdale had no contractual right of subrogation on the basis of a release of liability in favor of shade tree,it can equitably subrogate to the rights of shade tree to enforce the landmark policy.see employers cas.transport ins,noting that if the policy in question did not allow contractual subrogation,equitable subrogation applies.the doctrine of subrogation is given a liberal application,and is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting voluntarily,has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.liberty mut.ins.ins,internal quotation omitted see also am.indem.lloyds travelers prop.cas.ins,cir noting that when two primary insurers of the same insured settle a claim and one insurer pays more than its share,the other insurer is entitled to recover the excess paid.if the landmark policy covers the breach of warranty claims,scottsdale is entitled to recover,since scottsdale paid the debt on those claims.
the landmark policy 
two types of insurance policies are at issue the scottsdale primary policy and the landmark policy,which is labeled an umbrella policy.umbrella policies can provide horizontal coverage,even though the policy limits of the primary policy have not been exhausted,in situations where the primary policy does not cover claims that are covered by the umbrella policy.see,mission ins.duke transp,cir applying louisiana law.
the relevant portion of the landmark policy provides 
we will pay those sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies 
retained limit means the greater of 
a.the sum of amounts applicable to any claim or suit from 
underlying insurance,whether such underlying insurance is collectible or not and 
other collectible primary insurance or 
b.the retention 
underlying insurance means the coverage s afforded under designated insurance policies 
emphasis added.the parties do not dispute the district court conclusion that the scottsdale policy is the only designated policy referred to in the definition of underlying insurance.
the coverage issue turns on whether coverage s afforded means insurance coverage provided,and not excluded,by the scottsdale policy for particular categories of liability,or whether,taking into consideration the underlying insurance definition reference to coverage s afforded,the landmark policy is not triggered until the total amount of coverage afforded by the scottsdale policy for claims in all categories is exhausted.
scottsdale asserts that the district court erred by not specifically considering the definition of underlying insurance,which is coverage s afforded by the scottsdale policy.because r etained limit is defined with reference to underlying insurance and the landmark policy provides coverage for damages in excess of the retained limit,scottsdale argues,the landmark policy provides horizontal coverage when the scottsdale policy provides no coverage for a given type of claim.per scottsdale view,coverage s afforded means the insurance provided,and not excluded,by the scottsdale policy.
the contrary reading of the phrase coverage s afforded in the definition of underlying insurance is one in which coverage s afforded means the total monetary coverage,policy limit,afforded by the underlying insurance,notwithstanding any coverage exclusions.thus,the landmark policy,as the district court found,would only provide coverage when the total damages both covered or not covered by the scottsdale policy exceeded the scottsdale policy limit of.
the latter reading of the policy is faulty.it confuses the concepts of liability limits and coverage limits,which are distinct.wells gulf ins,cir.insurance policies,moreover,are strictly construed against the insurer in order to avoid exclusion of coverage,see puckett fire ins,and landmark drafted the policy.
interpreting underlying insurance to mean the insurance coverage provided and not excluded properly gives meaning to the words coverage s afforded and resolves any uncertainty about the policy language in favor of coverage also,the landmark policy excludes from its coverage situations in which the primary insurance becomes uncollectible,due to,inter alia,insolvency.it defines retained limit with reference to u nderlying insurance,whether such underlying insurance is collectible or not.applicability,collectibility,recoverability,and coverage are concepts used to define the scope of horizontal coverage.see duke transp,at.landmark only specified underlying insurance.it could have added language like whether covered or not but did not do so.
we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of landmark on the issue of whether the landmark policy provided coverage for breach of warranty damages when retained limit was defined as coverage s afforded by the underlying insurance.that leaves the issue of whether the scottsdale policy covers the breach of warranty claims at issue.if it does not,the landmark policy covers horizontally.
the scottsdale policy 
scottsdale contends that the scottsdale policy and the landmark policy differ in one important respect that requires a holding that the former does not cover breach of warranty damages and the latter does.that difference is in the policies exclusions on property damage.scottsdale argument is that the scottsdale policy property damage exclusion is broader than the corresponding exclusion in the landmark policy because of the policies respective definitions of your work,a term that forms part of both policies property damage exclusions.the scottsdale policy definition of your work includes w arranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness,quality,durability,performance or use of your work.landmark does not argue this point thus it concedes that the scottsdale policy excludes damages arising from such warranties.
the landmark policy definition of your work applicable to the property damage exclusion does not include warranties and representations,and therefore the landmark policy does not exclude damage from such acts.since the damages at issue are breach of warranty damages,the landmark policy covers.
