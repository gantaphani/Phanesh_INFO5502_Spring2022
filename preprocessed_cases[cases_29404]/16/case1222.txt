opinion of the court 
raymond battaglia,battaglia appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the district court that granted summary judgment in favor of mary ann mckendry,mary anne battaglia,james doorcheck,raymond battaglia,and james battaglia collectively,the appellees,denied battaglia for summary judgment and ordered that the parties claims be arbitrated without further delay.battaglia claims on appeal that the district court erred by failing to hold that under pennsylvania law the arbitrator does not have the authority to determine whether an issue is arbitrable.we conclude that the district court did rule on this issue,and we affirm its ruling that under pennsylvania law it was for the court to determine the scope of the arbitration clause.battaglia also asserts on appeal that the district court erred in finding that the arbitration clause was broad enough to reach i disputes relating to the formation of the underlying settlement agreement,and ii disputes arising from a related consulting agreement.we affirm the district court determination that the arbitration clause is sufficiently broad to reach disputes relating to the formation of the settlement agreement.however,because we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute with respect to the integration of the settlement and consulting agreements,we reverse and remand to the district court to reconsider,in light of this opinion,whether the arbitration clause in the settlement agreement reaches disputes arising from the consulting agreement.

battaglia is the father of mary ann mckendry,raymond battaglia,and james battaglia and the of mary anne battaglia.battaglia is also the former president of james doorcheck,the company.raymond battaglia.and james battaglia are the president and the,respectively,of the company.raymond battaglia,james battaglia and mary ann mckendry are each shareholders in the company.they held the same ownership interests and control of the company in november,at the time of the settlement at issue in this case.
appellees mary ann mckendry and mary anne battaglia are trustees under the agreement of trust of mary battaglia the wife,now deceased,of battaglia,dated march,the trust the trust provides,among other things,that the trustees shall distribute to my husband,raymond,all of the net income in annual or more frequent periodic installments.upon battaglia death,the trust provides that the balance of principal then remaining of this trust shall be distributed to my mary battaglia children.
following his wife death,battaglia filed an action against the appellees and others in the district court captioned battaglia brantz,et,civil action the litigation.in the litigation,battaglia complained that the trustees were not investing trust assets in order to maximize income,but instead were maximizing principal to benefit themselves.it is not clear from the record what allegations were made with respect to the company.in any event,the parties resolved the litigation by entering into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement and a consulting agreement the consulting agreement,and together with the settlement agreement,the agreements a form of the consulting agreement was attached to the settlement agreement as exhibit a.the settlement agreement provides,among other things,that t he trustees shall invest the trust assets in such a way as to maximize the income to battaglia during his lifetime.
the settlement agreement contains several references to the consulting agreement 
now,therefore,intending to be fully and legally bound,and in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein,the parties hereto agree as follows 
simultaneously with the execution of this settlement agreement,battaglia and the company have entered into a consulting agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit 
all parties to this settlement agreement will act in good faith to secure to battaglia the benefits of this settlement agreement and all of the amounts due to him under the consulting agreement,and will cause the company to do likewise.in the event of a transfer of company assets or of a transfer of a controlling interest in the stock of the company,the company shall take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the obligations due to battaglia under the consulting agreement are paid by the transferee.

the settlement agreement,which is governed by pennsylvania law,contains an arbitration clause the arbitration clause 
this settlement agreement and the obligations created hereunder shall be interpreted under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania,and the parties hereto further agree that in the event that any controversy arises hereunder,venue in philadelphia,pennsylvania with the american arbitration association is appropriate for the resolution of such controversy.

iii.discussion 
we address in order the three issues battaglia raises on appeal who determines the scope of the arbitration clause is the arbitration clause sufficiently broad to cover disputes related to formation of the settlement agreement and whether the arbitration clause in the settlement agreement reaches disputes under the consulting agreement,which does not contain its own agreement to arbitrate.
first,we must decide who has the authority under pennsylvania law to determine the scope of the arbitration court or the arbitrator.the issue arises because battaglia questions whether the arbitrator had the authority to decide whether the appellees duress counterclaim is arbitrable.by granting the appellees motion for summary judgment and indeed by direct statement in its memorandum opinion,the district court made a ruling that it was for the court to determine the scope of the arbitration clause.battaglia attempts to raise the actual merits of the claims here are completely irrelevant to the issue of arbitrability,which is the only issue before the court.see at t technologies,communications workers of america,d arbitrability of a dispute is for the court to decide.memorandum opinion at.flightways keystone helicopter.w hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter including arbitrability,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.under pennsylvania law,the threshold question of whether a party agreed to arbitrate a dispute is a jurisdictional question that must be decided by a court.smith cumberland group.furthermore,there is no the language of the arbitration clause or otherwise in the record before this the parties intended to arbitrate the scope of the clause itself.consequently,this determination was properly made by the district court.see first options,at.c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistak able evidence that they did so.second and third alterations in original.
battaglia next argument on appeal is that the arbitration clause is limited to disputes involving the interpretation and performance of the settlement agreement,and thus the clause does not encompass disputes going to the formation of that agreement.in particular,battaglia asserts that because the arbitration clause uses the language any controversy that arises hereunder,under the settlement agreement,rather than broader language such as any controversy arising under or related to the settlement agreement,the arbitration clause does not encompass the appellees counterclaim in the arbitration proceeding alleging that the settlement agreement was void from its inception by reason of egregious duress committed by battaglia.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court that the arbitration clause is sufficiently broad to reach disputes regarding the formation of the settlement agreement.
in construing the scope of an arbitration clause,courts generally operate under a pronounced presumption of arbitrability 
w here the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
at t,at.second alteration in original quoting united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d.the pennsylvania supreme court has adopted an identical rule.see lincoln of the commonwealth of higher educ.lincoln.chapter of the am.ass of.professors.this presumption of arbitrability is particularly applicable where the arbitration clause at issue is broad.see at t,at.finding to be broad a clause providing for arbitration of any differences arising with respect to the interpretation of this contract or the performance of any obligation hereunder.
in ordering arbitration,the district court relied on the presumption of arbitrability and on the expansive,language of the arbitration clause.memorandum opinion at.flightways,at broad arbitration is agreed for a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement can not be circumvented by an allegation that the contract was void ab initio because of fraud in the inducement.
in arguing that the arbitration clause has a more limited scope,battaglia relies on in re kinoshita,cir,and cases relying thereon.but this line of cases has been discredited both in the second circuit and in other jurisdictions.in kinoshita,the second circuit found that an arbitration provision providing for arbitration of any dispute or difference aris ing under the contract containing the clause was not sufficiently broad to require arbitration of a claim alleging fraudulent inducement of the contract.see kinoshita,at.the second circuit explained that when an arbitration provision refers only to disputes under or arising out of a contact,arbitration is limited to disputes relating to the interpretation of the contract and matters of performance.see id.the court distinguished the arbitration clause at issue from clauses including disputes relating to a contract,stating that the latter would encompass claims of fraud in the inducement.see id.
although kinoshita has not been formally overruled by the second circuit,that court has repeatedly distinguished kinoshita and limited the case to its precise facts.the second circuit first limited kinoshita in mineracao da utah int l,cir,where the court found that an arbitration clause requiring arbitration of any question or dispute aris ing or occur ring under the agreement was sufficiently broad to reach claims of fraud in the inducement.see id.at.the court noted that while the distinction between the arbitration clause at hand and the clause at issue in kinoshita was far from overwhelming,it was at least as reasonable as the distinction drawn in kinoshita.id.at.while the court acknowledged that kinoshita is inconsistent with the federal policy favoring arbitration,it declined to overrule kinoshita on policy grounds 
we decline to overrule in re kinoshita,despite its inconsistency with federal policy favoring arbitration,particularly in international business disputes,because we are concerned that contracting parties may have in theory at least relied on that case in their formulation of an arbitration provision.we see no reason,however,why we may not confine kinoshita to its precise facts.we are confident that parties who have actually relied on kinoshita,in an attempt to formulate a narrow arbitration provision,have adopted the exact language of the arbitration provision involved in kinoshita.the provision involved in kinoshita required arbitration of any dispute or difference aris ing under the agreement.thus,to ensure that an arbitration clause is narrowly interpreted contracting parties must use the foregoing phrase or its equivalent,although the better course,obviously,would be to specify exactly which claims are and are not arbitrable.
id.alteration in original.
the second circuit again distinguished kinoshita in genesco,kakiuchi,cir.there the second circuit found that an arbitration clause requiring arbitration of all claims and disputes of whatever nature arising under this contract was broad enough to reach claims of fraud in the inducement.see id.at.although the only material difference between the clauses in genesco and kinoshita is that the former contains the phrase of whatever nature,the second circuit rested its decision on this distinction 
the instant clause is distinguishable from the kinoshita clause.the clause here requires arbitration of all claims and disputes of whatever nature arising under this contract.the phrase of whatever nature indicates the parties intent to submit all claims and disputes arising under the contract to arbitration,whether they be tortious or contractual in nature.
again,the second circuit declined to overrule kinoshita 
we are invited to overrule kinoshita.while we recognize,as did mineracao,that kinoshita is inconsistent with the federal policy favoring arbitration,nevertheless,we decline the invitation.because the instant clause is distinguishable from the kinoshita clause,we need not discuss the continued viability of kinoshita.see scherk,at.at clause requiring arbitration of any controversy or claim aris ing out of this agreement held to cover fraudulent misrepresentations claim.
id.at citation omitted third alteration in original.although the second circuit does not discuss the continued viability of kinoshita,its citation to scherk implies that,even in the second circuit,kinoshita is no longer good law paul fire marine ins.employers reinsurance,in both se
