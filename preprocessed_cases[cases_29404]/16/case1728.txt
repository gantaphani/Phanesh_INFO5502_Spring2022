the publishing corporation,a louisiana citizen,brought suit against zurich american insurance company zurich,a new york citizen,in the state court of orleans parish,louisiana alleging various state law causes of action related to zurich refusal to pay the,as an insured under a zurich excess policy covering employee dishonesty,for certain embezzlement losses.zurich removed the case to the eastern district of louisiana,and the district court ultimately entered summary judgment in its favor.we reverse.
facts and proceedings below 
the material facts of this case are undisputed.
from january,until july,the was insured under a series of six primary insurance policies issued by federal insurance company federal that covered,among other things,acts of employee dishonesty.the first of these primary policies ran from january,to july,and each subsequent policy was for a one year term beginning july,with the sixth and final primary policy running from july,to july.notably,the federal primary polices each contemplated the possibility that surreptitious crimes like embezzlement might be perpetrated during the life of one policy but not discovered until sometime thereafter.each of the primary policies covered losses occurring during the policy period and required the insured to file proof of loss within days after discovery of the loss.coverage extended to losses discovered within one year after the policy expired the discovery period importantly here,each primary policy also provided coverage on certain conditions for losses which occurred prior to the policy period,pursuant to a prior loss clause reading as follows 
loss sustained prior to effective date 
if you were continuously insured by a policy prior to this insurance providing the same insurance as this policy,but can not recover on a loss because that policy was terminated and its discovery period has run out,we will cover your loss provided 
this insurance would have covered your loss had it been in effect at the time the acts that caused the loss occurred and 
you discovered the loss within one year after this insurance is terminated.
we will not pay more than the limit of insurance for the loss under the prior policy or under this insurance when it became effective,whichever is less.the amount we pay will be a part of this insurance,not in addition to it.
if we have insured you under other policies whose discovery period had not run out when you discovered a loss that occurred partly under those policies and partly under this policy,we will pay up to the limit of insurance under this policy or the prior policies issued by us,whichever is less.
in january of a employee named arthur anzalone embarked on a embezzlement scheme during which he would eventually steal from the until he was discovered in december of.over the course of his crime,anzalone stole during the term of federal first primary policy during the second policy during the third policy during the fourth policy during the fifth policy and during the sixth and last primary policy.following the discovery of anzalone ongoing theft,the timely made proof of loss and filed a claim with federal under its sixth primary policy for both the losses incurred during that policy period as well as the previously undetected losses that were sustained while the preceding federal primary policies were in effect.though it did not admit liability,federal in december settled with the for the full policy limit of.
that settlement,however,left the with in embezzlement losses that were not reimbursed by federal primary policy.it was to recover this sum that the turned to zurich.in july of,along with its second primary policy,the also purchased from federal a excess policy that would cover,inter alia,acts of employee dishonesty exceeding the policy limit of the underlying primary policy.the renewed this excess policy with federal on july,but,on july,the switched excess carriers and bought a,policy from zurich that was effective from july,until july.the timely filed an excess claim with zurich for the not covered by because in excess of the policy limits of the federal july,primary policy.
zurich balked,however.first,although the zurich excess policy itself contains no prior loss clause nor any express limitation to losses after policy inception or exclusion of losses,the third sentence of the excess policy insuring clause provides that coverage under this policy shall then on exhaustion of required primary coverage apply in conformance with and subject to the warranties,limitations,conditions,provisions,and other terms of the primary policy.accordingly,zurich contended that under the prior loss clause in the federal primary policy,zurich was not responsible for any losses incurred before july,because in neither year in which the had excess coverage from federal did anzalone embezzle more than the limit of the underlying primary policy second,in light of its conclusion that it had no liability under the prior loss clause,zurich maintained that it was only bound to cover losses exceeding incurred during the life of its own excess policy.the amount anzalone embezzled during this period was.zurich took the position that,once federal in primary coverage was subtracted,its exposure under its excess policy was actually only out of the in embezzlement losses that were not covered by because in excess of the limits of the federal primary policy zurich offered to settle for roughly this amount and in fact made a payment to the.
on september,the filed a complaint in louisiana state court alleging,inter alia common law breach of the zurich excess insurance policy contract breach of contract in bad faith a violation of.ann,which requires the prompt adjustment of insurance claims in good faith a violation of.ann,which requires prompt payment of a claim on receipt of a satisfactory proof of loss a breach of the common law implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory judgment.zurich removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 
the district court granted partial summary judgment to zurich,ruling as a matter of law that zurich excess policy unambiguously confined its liability only to those losses incurred during the term of the zurich policy that exceeded the limit of the underlying federal primary policy.the district court subsequently entered a.b judgment as to count one of the complaint,concluding that,in light of the partial summary judgment order and a payment already made to the,zurich remaining liability on count one was.the premise behind the rule b judgment is that the could not prevail on any of its five other causes of action without first having prevailed on its basic breach of contract claim.
the only issue the raises on appeal is whether zurich is responsible under its excess policy for all or some part greater than awarded by the district court of the in embezzlement losses that were not covered by because in excess of the policy limits of federal july,primary policy,or is only responsible for of the that was embezzled during the term of zurich excess policy.
standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo under the same standard applied by the district court.keelan majesco software,cir.where,as in the instant case,none of the material facts are in dispute,the court may enter judgment as a matter of law.
the language of the excess insurance contract 
the parties do not dispute that louisiana law controls.
under louisiana law,a court should interpret an insurance policy under ordinary principles for the interpretation of a contract.the intentions of the parties,as reflected by the words of the policy,should determine the extent of coverage.the words should be given their plain meanings,and the court should not change the coverage of the policy under the guise of interpreting ambiguous language.the court should consider the policy as a whole,and interpret the policy to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in the light of the customs and usages of the industry.if a clause remains ambiguous after such consideration,then it should be construed against the insurer.
trinity,ins.of,cir citations and footnotes omitted.
we begin,therefore,with the relevant provisions of the zurich policy itself.
a.the insuring clause of the zurich policy provides 
insuring clause.
the underwriter shall provide the insureds with insurance coverage during the policy period excess of the underlying insurance.coverage under this policy shall attach only after all of the limit s of liability of the underlying insurance has been exhausted by the actual payment of loss es.except as otherwise provided herein,coverage under this policy shall then apply in conformance with and subject to the warranties,limitations,conditions,provisions,and other terms of the primary policy as in effect the first day of the policy period,together with the warranties and limitations of any other underlying insurance.in no event shall coverage under this policy be broader than coverage under any underlying insurance.
b.the drop down clause clause iiib of the zurich policy provides 
of underlying limits 
in the event and only in the event of the reduction or exhaustion of the limit s of liability of the underlying insurance solely as the result of actual payment of loss covered thereunder,this policy shall i in the event of reduction,pay excess of the reduced limit s of liability of the underlying insurance,and ii in the event of exhaustion,continue in force as primary insurance excess of the retention applicable in the primary policy,which retention shall be applied to any subsequent loss as specified in the primary policy.
notwithstanding any of the terms of this policy which might be construed otherwise,this policy shall drop down only in the event of reduction of exhaustion of the underlying insurance by the actual payment of loss and shall not drop down for any other reason including,but not limited to,uncollectibility in whole or in part of any underlying insurance.the risk of uncollectibility of such underlying insurance in whole or in part whether because of financial impairment or insolvency of the underlying insurer or for any other reason,is expressly retained by the insureds and is not in any way or under any circumstances insured or assumed by the underwriter.
the decision of the district court 
in granting summary judgment to zurich on the contract claim,the district court largely ignored the zurich policy drop down clause,and focused instead on the prior loss clause of the federal primary policy.it adopted this approach in reliance on first bank of amarillo continental cas,cir.
in amarillo,the first national bank of amarillo,texas,bought two insurance policies,called bonds in that case,from continental on february.one continental policy provided in primary coverage and replaced a prior primary policy issued by another insurer for the same amount.the other continental policy provided in excess coverage.unlike continental primary policy,the excess policy did not replace preexisting excess coverage from continental or any other insurer.the excess policy had a rider stating that it would provide excess coverage for any loss sustained under the prior primary policy that was uncollectible because that policy had been terminated.
in april of,first national bank discovered that an employee had embezzled.the embezzler stole before february,and thereafter.in other words,neither before nor during the term of continental excess policy did the embezzler steal more than the limit of the underlying primary policies.
the continental primary policy had a rider attached to it that covered undetected prior losses as long as those losses would have been covered by first national bank prior primary policy issued by another insurer.continental exhausted the primary policy by paying for the prior loss and for the loss incurred during the term of its own primary policy.the first national bank then sought to collect the remaining from continental under the excess policy,but continental refused to pay.
this court,over a vigorous dissent by judge hutcheson,sided with continental.though not citing any contractual language,the court began by concluding that the remaining could not be collected under the excess policy itself because it provided only for future losses in excess of and first national bank only sustained a loss after february.the court then turned to the rider attached to the excess policy.the court reasoned that this rider too could not be invoked because it referred specifically to losses that would have been recoverable under the prior primary policy and the amount embezzled during the life of that policy did not exceed.
it was irrelevant to the court that continental primary insurance had been exhausted by the payment of benefits for aggregate losses suffered during both the prior and current primary policies 
the primary bond became liable under the terms of its own rider for the loss of sustained during the life of the prior bond.that bond and the prior canceled bond may not properly be treated as one and thereby make the excess bond liable for losses which it had not assumed.the excess bond assumed liability for losses above incurred either before or after its effective date but it did not contemplate or authorize the adding together or combining of losses incurred both before and after that date.to take future losses and add them to past losses and thus make up an amount sufficient to create a liability under the excess bond would be not to construe the contract by which the casualty company agreed to be bound,but to make one under which the bank could recover.
the district court applied this reasoning to the claim,concluding that the prior loss provision of the federal primary policy,as applicable under the language of the third sentence of the insuring clause of zurich excess policy,was never triggered because the embezzlement losses incurred during the two years of prior excess coverage amounted to only,well under the limit of the federal primary policies then in force finding that the primary policy prior loss provision as applicable in the zurich excess policy under that policy insuring clause was never triggered,the district court ruled that zurich was responsible only for prospective losses exceeding that were incurred after the july,inception date of its excess policy.this resulted in liability to the under the contract for because the suffered a loss over the course of zurich policy.put differently,the district court ruled that zurich excess policy was only responsible for of the entire that the lost over and above the limit of its primary policy with federal.the district court,following amarillo,ruled that it was irrelevant that the july,primary policy had been exhausted by prior losses.
the scope of excess coverage 
amarillo does not control 
we begin with the conclusion that amarillo is not controlling authority.amarillo was decided in,four years before the supreme court issued its landmark decision erie tompkins,in which the court held that federal courts sitting in diversity should apply substantive state law and federal procedural law.amarillo cites no court decision,treatise or other authority whatever in support of its conclusions,and the only reasonable inference is that the amarillo panel was simply elucidating a federal common law of insurance contracts,a law that has long since ceased to apply to cases of this kind.furthermore,amarillo was on appeal from the northern district of texas,not a federal court in louisiana.in our view,it is inappropriate to treat such a texas case,particularly one that went uncited between and the decision of the district court in this case,as controlling authority respecting an insurance contract dispute under louisiana law 
in addition,even if we were to consider amarillo,it is distinguishable on its facts.first,unlike the instant case,there were no preexisting excess policies in amarillo.second,and more importantly,the prior loss provision was in the excess policy itself in amarillo and it specifically referred to a loss that would have been collectible under the prior primary policy.in the instant case,on the other hand,the prior loss clause in the federal primary policy,so far as applicable in zur
