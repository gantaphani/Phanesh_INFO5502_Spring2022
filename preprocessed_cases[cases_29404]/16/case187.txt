appellants henry rosciti,donna rosciti,and henry rosciti,the roscitis sued monaco coach corporation monaco over alleged defects in a motor home monaco manufactured.monaco was for liability up to,and appellee insurance company of the state of pennsylvania icsop provided excess insurance for liability above.monaco went bankrupt shortly after the roscitis filed their lawsuit.therefore,the roscitis added icsop as a defendant,invoking a rhode island statute allowing tort victims to recover damages directly from liability insurers of a bankrupt tortfeasor,but only within the limits of the insurance policy.
icsop moved for summary judgment,arguing that its coverage obligations had not been triggered.icsop pointed to a limiting provision in monaco policy stating that icsop duty to pay arose only after monaco had paid the initial,which monaco had not done the roscitis countered by pointing to other language in the policy providing that monaco bankruptcy would not relieve icsop of its payment obligations.the roscitis also argued that if the provisions on which each side relied created a conflict in the policy,rhode island law required this conflict to be resolved in the roscitis favor.
the district court agreed with icsop and granted its summary judgment motion.see rosciti liberty mut.ins,d.however,because we find that enforcing the limiting provision in the policy would violate the public policy of rhode island,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
henry and donna rosciti purchased a mobile home manufactured by monaco on january.the mobile home allegedly suffered from numerous defects that resulted in water leakage.monaco attempted to fix the problems at various times between and,but these attempts were allegedly unsuccessful.the roscitis claim that the water leakage eventually led to the growth of toxic mold in the mobile home,rendering it uninhabitable.henri rosciti,occupied the mobile home,and the roscitis allege that he developed a range of medical problems as a result of his exposure to the mold.
during the relevant time period,icsop provided special excess liability policies the excess policies to monaco.the excess policies provided liability coverage for claims above,up to limits ranging from million to million,depending on the policy monaco was for liability up to a retained limit of.
icsop insurance policies with monaco contain two provisions that are central to this appeal.the first of these is section iii c the retained limit provision,which provides 
icsop duty to pay any sums that monaco become s legally obligated to pay arises only after there has been a complete expenditure of monaco retained limit s by means of payments for judgments,settlements,or defense costs.
the second is section vi d,entitled bankruptcy or insolvency the bankruptcy provision,which provides 
monaco bankruptcy,insolvency or inability to pay,or the bankruptcy,insolvency or inability to pay of any of monaco underlying insurers shall not relieve icsop from the payment of any claim covered by this policy.but under no circumstances shall such bankruptcy,insolvency,or inability to pay require icsop to drop down or in any way replace monaco retained limit or assume any obligation associated with monaco retained limit.
on december,the roscitis sued monaco in the superior court of rhode island,asserting claims of negligence,breach of warranty,and strict products liability.on march,after filing its answer but before responding to the roscitis discovery requests,monaco filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware on june,the roscitis filed an amended complaint in the rhode island superior court adding monaco insurers,including icsop,as defendants.the roscitis argued that monaco insurers were liable under rhode island direct action statute,which provides 
any person,having a claim because of damages of any kind caused by the tort of any other person,may file a complaint directly against the liability insurer of the alleged tortfeasor seeking compensation by way of a judgment for money damages whenever the alleged tortfeasor files for bankruptcy,involving a chapter liquidation,a chapter reorganization for the benefit of creditors or a chapter wage earner plan,provided that the complaining party shall not recover an amount in excess of the insurance coverage available for the tort complained of.
the roscitis have never specified the amount of monetary damages they are seeking.however,they assert that the value of their claim is greater than the retained limit because their claim includes at least the purchase price of the mobile home plus henry rosciti,medical expenses.monaco has not paid any portion of the roscitis claims,and because it is currently in bankruptcy proceedings,all creditors claims are stayed.
icsop removed the case to the district court for the district of rhode island on july.the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to a the roscitis voluntarily dismissed monaco other insurers,liberty mutual insurance company and liberty northwest insurance,on april.
icsop moved for summary judgment on may.icsop contended that the roscitis claim should be dismissed because there was no coverage available for it under the excess policies.icsop argued it was not liable for any portion of the roscitis claim under because the bankruptcy provision explicitly stated that icsop would not have to drop down and pay anything under the retained limit.icsop also argued that it was not liable for the part of the roscitis claim above the limit because its payment obligation had never been triggered.icsop noted that the retained limit provision specified that icsop obligation to pay arose only after there ha d been a complete expenditure of monaco retained limit.because monaco had not yet exhausted the retained limit,icsop argued that it had no obligation to pay anything above the limit 
in response,the roscitis conceded that icsop was not liable for any portion of their claim below.however,they argued that because the bankruptcy provision stated that monaco bankruptcy would not relieve icsop of any payment obligations,icsop was still liable above,despite the fact that monaco had not yet exhausted the retained limit.the roscitis also argued that to the extent the retained limit provision conflicted with the bankruptcy provision,rhode island law required that the conflict be resolved in their favor.see amica mut.ins.streicker,stating that ambiguities in insurance policies are strictly construed against the insurer.
the district court held that there was no conflict between the retained limit provision and the bankruptcy provision.rosciti,d at.the bankruptcy provision provides that icsop would still be liable for claims covered by the policies if monaco went bankrupt.the court read this language to incorporate the exclusions that appeared elsewhere in the excess policies,including in the retained limit provision.id.at.thus,because monaco had not exhausted the retained limit,icsop payment obligations could not be triggered even if the roscitis claim was over,and therefore the roscitis claim could never be covered under the excess policies.id.
the court also held that the direct action statute did not void the retained limit provision.the court reasoned that the retained limit provision could not be read as a grab for immunity from the direct action statute because there were circumstances under which monaco conceivably could have exhausted the retained limit.id.at.the court also noted that the direct action statute,explicitly limited claims against insurers to coverage available under the plan,and concluded that exhaustion requirements such as the retained limit provision were not prohibited by the statute.id.at.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving this case,the roscitis.kuperman wrenn,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.robidoux muholland,cir.the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.carmona toledo,cir.
because this case was heard in the district of rhode island pursuant to the court diversity jurisdiction,we apply the substantive law of the state of rhode island.see artuso vertex,cir a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the substantive law of the forum state.citing erie tompkins.rhode island direct action statue,only allows the roscitis to recover insurance coverage available for their claim from icsop.therefore,the central question for this court is whether there can be any coverage available under the excess policies in light of monaco inability to exhaust its retained limit.
icsop urges us to affirm the district court ruling that there is no coverage available because the retained limit provision has not been satisfied.the roscitis raise two arguments against the application of the retained limit provision.first,they argue that the retained limit provision and the bankruptcy provision create a conflict in the excess policies that must be resolved in their favor.second,they argue that the direct action statute renders the retained limit provision inapplicable.we address these points in turn.
ambiguity in the excess policies 
ordinarily,when interpreting an insurance policy,a court look s at the four corners of the policy,viewing it in its entirety,affording its terms their plain,ordinary and usual meaning.town of cumberland interlocal risk mgmt.trust,internal quotation marks omitted.however,i n situations in which ambiguity does exist in an insurance policy or the terms are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,the contract will be strictly construed against the insurer.amica mut.ins,at.
the roscitis argue that there is a clash between the retained limit provision and the bankruptcy provision.the bankruptcy provision says that monaco bankruptcy,insolvency or inability to pay shall not relieve icsop from the payment of any claim covered by the excess policies.however,the roscitis argue,if the retained limit provision remains in force,then its net effect in this case is to relieve icsop from the payment of a claim covered by the excess policies.since this reading would nullify the bankruptcy provision,the roscitis urge us to read an exception to the retained limit provision for situations where,as here,it can not be satisfied due to insolvency.
icsop,in contrast,argues that the roscitis are asking us to impermissibly read ambiguity into the contract where none exists.see town of cumberland,at court should not indulge in mental gymnastics to read ambiguity where none is present internal omission and quotation marks omitted.icsop notes that the bankruptcy provision applies only to claims covered by the excess policies.this,icsop argues,is a clear reference to limitation provisions elsewhere in the excess policies,including the retained limit provision.thus,according to icsop,the meaning of the excess policies is clear icsop is liable if monaco is bankrupt,but only if the retained limit provision is somehow satisfied.
we agree with icsop that the policy is not ambiguous.we see no inherent conflict between the retained limit provision and the bankruptcy provision rather,we agree with icsop that the latter is plainly subject to the limitations in the former.we disagree with the roscitis that the reverse reading of the excess policies under which the bankruptcy provision is a limit on the retained limit provision is also plausible.the bankruptcy provision,by referring to claims covered by this policy,clearly alerts the reader to examine the rest of the contract for possible limits on icsop liability.the retained limit provision,in contrast,contains no such cautionary language icsop is liable only after there has been a complete expenditure of monaco retained limit emphasis added.
since we will not read ambiguity into the contract,see town of cumberland,at,we will not automatically construe the excess policies against icsop.contra amica mut.ins,at.rather,we will give the excess policies their plain meaning icsop is still liable above the retained limit if monaco is bankrupt,but only after monaco exhausts the retained limit.however,this does not end our inquiry,for we must still consider whether this result is compatible with public policy.
public policy 
under rhode island law,a contract term will not be enforced if it violates public policy.gorman raphael.if a contract provision frustrates a right created by statute,a court will void that provision as against public policy.pepin am.universal ins,voiding contract provision that was found to frustrate statutory right to binding arbitration.
the roscitis argue that,as interpreted by the district court,the retained limit provision nullifies their rights under.because monaco has not exhausted and is now incapable of exhausting the retained limit,the roscitis can not recover anything above that amount from icsop.this frustrates the legislature purpose in passing,which was to give an aggrieved and injured party the right to proceed directly against an insurer in those circumstances in which the tortfeasor has sought protection under the applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code.johnston partners.
icsop counters,however,by noting that the rhode island legislature limited recovery under to insurance coverage available for the tort complained of emphasis added.thus,icsop argues,it was clearly not the legislature intent to expand the scope of coverage available under an insurance policy.barber canela,holding that a related direct action statute,laws,is designed only to provide a remedy to the injured party and not to enlarge the liability of the insurer beyond the limits stated in the policy emphasis added.yet icsop contends that nullifying the retained limit provision would have precisely that effect,by eliminating the critical threshold requirement for icsop obligations.icsop also contends that the roscitis position would effectively require icsop to drop down below the retained limit,since any recovery from icsop would represent the first dollars the roscitis recover on their claim.
in deciding what rhode island public policy requires in this case,we would ordinarily be bound by the teachings of the rhode island supreme court.am.specialty ins.lapalme,cir.however,the parties have not identified,and we have not discovered,any ruling by the rhode island supreme court that directly addresses the question of whether a retained limit provision frustrates the purpose of.in the absence of a definitive ruling by the highest state court,we may consider analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.id.quoting gibson city of cranston,cir.we thus examine the broader public policy context surrounding and explore how other courts have resolved the policy question present here.when we apply this analysis,we conclude that the roscitis position is correct.
faced with insurance companies arguing that their policies were merely contracts of indemnity thus preventing recovery against the insurer without the insured actually discharging liability to the victim many states enacted legislation 
requiring that liability insurance contracts include a provision to the effect that the insolvency or bankruptcy of an insured shall not release an insurer from liability.in time,similar legislation almost certainly would have been adopted in every state had not insurers revised the standard policy forms used for liability insurance to provide coverage without regard to an insured insolvency.
robert keeton alan widiss,insurance law b,at practitioner ed.rhode island does not have such a statute,which we term a bankruptcy provision law.nevertheless,it is clear that rhode island public policy is to prevent insurance companies from avoiding their obligations when an insolvent insured can not make an expenditure towards discharging liability.as noted above,the passage of re
