in september,american airlines,american began charging passengers a fee of for each bag checked with porters who provide curbside service called skycaps at boston logan airport.arguing that passengers mistook the fee for a mandatory gratuity for the skycaps and stopped tipping,several porters brought suit against american the present appeal is a product of that litigation.the facts and proceedings are as follows.
some passengers at logan carry their own luggage into the airport and some have it brought inside to the counter by skycaps,but a great many check their luggage onto flights at curbside ordinarily,the skycap will take the luggage from the curb,write up the baggage tags,and place the luggage on a conveyer belt destined for the airline cargo facilities.prior to,american made skycap services available to its customers free of charge beyond the plane fare with the airline bearing the cost of skycap labor and other facilities involved in curbside conveyer belts,rent for space.
american once itself employed skycaps to provide these services to passengers but now,at least in boston,relies primarily on contractors most recently,a company called secure staff,llc.although all the american and skycaps earned an hourly wage,their main source of income was tips.the customary gratuity at logan airport was about per bag,and nearly all passengers tipped.
in early,one of american competitors began charging a curbside fee in seattle.american tested the idea there before expanding the practice to other cities across the country.separate charges for services that had once been bundled together for example,for meals or extra bags were becoming common in airline operations during this period.due to deregulation,airline fares had fallen on many major routes,airlines were suffering low profits or losses,and separate charges were one of the responses.
like its competitors,american set the price for curbside at per bag,with an initial goal of merely offsetting the expense of providing skycap service.revenues from the fee proved more than enough to recoup those costs,and american netted a substantial profit from the charge.in cities where american relied on contractors to provide skycap services,the airline and the contractor shared the proceeds from the new charge.at logan,sixty percent went to the airline and forty percent to.
as for the skycaps,american knew that the new fee would lessen tip income from passengers at least temporarily in fact,some hourly salaries for the skycaps at logan airport were raised to comply with minimum wage laws in light of reduced tips.the skycaps were required to collect the fee in cash to be turned over to the airline at the end of the business day they were not supposed to solicit tips,although some apparently did but they were free,if the customer inquired,to say that the fee was not a gratuity.
when it instituted the fee at logan in september,american notified its customers of the new charge on its website as well as on three large,signs adjacent to the podiums outside the airport terminal.a typical sign,in its original format,read as follows 
check.domestic flights per bagamerican airlines 
within a week or two,skycaps had added notations to the official signs saying gratuity not included or words to this effect,and american then revised its standard posters to include this caveat placed in considerably smaller lettering immediately below the fee itself.by october,american had ordered several hundred signs with this revised language for use across the country the website,which referred only to the per bag charge,was not altered.in boston,four of the modified signs were posted at the skycap podiums and along the curbside.
the skycaps tip income fell significantly once the new charge began.some passengers likely thought that per bag was enough to pay and chose not to tip,but others interpreted the fee as a mandatory tip to the skycap rather than a charge paid to the airline.confusion persisted despite modification of the signs the curbside can be hectic at busy times there were other unrelated signs and some luggage was collected far from the signage,down the line of parked cars and taxis.
in december,two skycaps at logan,don difiore and leon bailey,brought a putative class action against and american in massachusetts superior court,which the defendants removed to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the claims against were dismissed in light of an arbitration agreement,and class certification was denied.eight more skycap plaintiffs joined the suit against american and the complaint was twice amended.
by the time of the third amended complaint now the operative pleading the claims against american were these that american curbside fee violated a massachusetts statute governing tips.laws ch,that the airline conduct created liability under state common law as tortious interference with advantageous relations,unlawful conversion,and unjust enrichment and that the skycaps were entitled to restitution under principles of quantum meruit.
the tips law is the centerpiece of the appeal and its pertinent language provides that n o employer or other person shall demand or accept from any service employee any payment or deduction from a tip or service charge given to such service employee by a patron.laws ch,b.the skycaps qualified as service employees for purposes of the statute.id.a.the term service charge is defined as 
a fee charged by an employer to a patron in lieu of a tip to any service employee including any fee designated as a service charge,tip,gratuity,or a fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to a service employee in lieu of,or in addition to,a tip.
id.the gravamen of the tips law claim is that the fee is a service charge under state law and must therefore go to the skycaps because customers reasonably expect ed it to be given to the skycaps.
american moved to dismiss the complaint,or alternatively for summary judgment,principally on the ground that the claims were barred by the express preemption clause of the airline deregulation act no state may enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.b.judge young denied the motion,difiore am.airlines,d,but later granted summary judgment to american on the quantum meruit,conversion,and unjust enrichment counts theories not pursued on appeal.
the claim for recovery under the tips law.laws ch,f,and the claim were both tried to a jury in march and april.the jury awarded each logan skycap plaintiff per bag checked at curbside by that skycap from september to the start of trial,plus fees collected in march and april during the trial.the louis skycap not covered by the massachusetts tips law and bringing only a claim under missouri law was awarded nothing and has not appealed.
for those logan skycaps who claimed both tortious interference and a violation of the tips statute,the jury awarded identical damages on both theories the district court construed state law as permitting the jury to award treble damages,see.laws ann.ch,west amended wiedmann bradford,but the jury declined to award anything on this account.
thereafter the district court temporarily set aside the jury award but reinstated it after the state highest court answered a certified question not germane to the disputed issues on this appeal involving the interpretation of the tips statute.difiore am.airlines.further motions led to another opinion rejecting the preemption claim,difiore am.airlines,d,and determining damages for the period of march and april,id.at.
a final amended judgment gave the nine prevailing skycaps plus prejudgment interest the court also awarded attorneys fees and costs.american now appeals on multiple grounds the successful skycap plaintiffs,arguing that the tips statute award should have been trebled.the central issue,federal preemption,is a question of statutory construction that we review de novo.united parcel,flores galarza,cir.that it is a difficult one is confirmed by decisions conflicting with that of judge young by two other judges in
