defendants leonard schneider schneider and his children,leslie,scott,and susan schneider collectively,defendants or the schneiders appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york leisure,which held them liable for damages to plaintiff highland capital management lp highland and rbc dominion securities rbc jointly,appellees,pursuant to a jury verdict after trial,in the amount of approximately million for breach of an alleged contract for the sale of promissory notes.highland claimed to be the beneficiary of an alleged contract by which the schneiders,acting through an agent,glen rauch securities grs,agreed to sell promissory notes of the mcnaughton apparel group,mcnaughton at percent of their face value to rbc.appellees contend that,after several weeks of negotiation between glen rauch of grs,acting for the schneiders,and rbc,they concluded the alleged contract in an unrecorded telephone conversation on march.the schneiders argue,among other contentions,that there could be no contract because their agent,grs,had neither actual nor apparent authority to make the alleged contract on their behalf.we agree with the schneiders that the evidence can not support a finding that rauch had either actual or apparent authority to make the contract or even that he expressed agreement to sell the notes.we therefore remand to the district court with instructions to set aside the verdict and enter judgment in favor of the schneiders.
background 
the evidence at trial,seen in the light most favorable to appellees,showed the following.the schneiders owned and operated two apparel businesses,which they sold to mcnaughton in april.in connection with this sale,they received mcnaughton promissory notes for million.the schneiders later became interested in selling the notes.to assist them in making the sale,they engaged grs,which acted through its principal,glen rauch.rauch contacted rbc as a potential purchaser.before beginning negotiations in earnest over the sale of the notes,rbc and rauch executed a letter agreement outlining the terms of the negotiations.the agreement stated 
reference is made to certain promissory notes of mcnaughton held by the schneiders.
rbc understand s that glen rauch securities,grs represents the schneiders in the possible resale of some or all of the notes 
we both understand that the consummation of any transaction remains in the sole discretion and satisfaction of the schneiders and rbc,including without limitation with respect to price.
pl.ex.rauch instructed rbc that its communications concerning the proposed transaction should go through him and that it should not communicate directly with the schneiders.
rbc intended to purchase the notes incurring only minimal risk by,prior to purchase,arranging to resell them to a third party at a markup over its own purchase price.during the course of its negotiations with the schneiders,rbc received bids for the notes from highland and another firm.
most of the negotiations for rbc purchase of the notes from the schneiders were conducted by telephone,between kenneth ambrecht of rbc and rauch.because of doubts about mcnaughton solvency,the negotiations discussed prices representing a discount from the face value of the notes.the content of the negotiations is largely undisputed,because rbc routinely recorded all telephone calls through its trading desk.the recordings of the conversations between rauch and rbc show that,in accordance with the letter agreement,rauch always sought authorization from the schneiders before making any firm proposal to rbc and always made clear to rbc that any proposed terms required the schneiders approval.for example,on january,ambrecht asked rauch,i s there any way you can get a firm offer.rauch responded,i tell the schneiders to make you an offer.id.on february,after consulting with the schneiders,rauch responded to ambrecht with a firm offer at percent of face value.after rbc rejected this price,rauch told ambrecht on february he was percent sure he could trade the whole piece at percent of face value,explaining his uncertainty by noting,i mean you know,dealing with individuals that are laughter.later that day,rauch told ambrecht that the schneiders would probably agree to a price of for the entire block of their notes.however,rauch also told ambrecht that he had recently spoken with leonard schneider and it was schneider position that at anything less than schneider was gon na hold on to em for a while.id.
the negotiations continued in similar fashion into march.on march,ambrecht made an offer at.rauch replied,i going to have to reflect back because the last thing i told the schneiders was is firm and now i got to go back and tell them fifty and a half.when the schneiders rejected this price,ambrecht said he would attempt to raise the price to,but rauch told him,no,at this point,now,they not going to do anything for a day and a half.yet on march rauch still thought they probably trade them all at.he told ambrecht,you know we not haggling we done at if it gets done and it will probably be tomorrow morning.
unbeknownst to rauch and rbc,however,the schneiders had received information from mcnaughton that significantly altered prospects for payment of the notes,and hence their value.on march,mcnaughton informed the schneiders attorneys that it had received an inquiry from another company about the purchase of mcnaughton.the attorneys contacted schneider the same day,and advised him that something good was happening with mcnaughton.trial tr.on march,the schneiders met with the attorneys,who talked about the possibility of a merger or an acquisition of mcnaughton and that if that happened,that the notes would be paid cents on the dollar.trial tr.
this case turns on the events of the following day,march.rauch and ambrecht had two recorded phone calls that day.approximately ten minutes after the second recorded call,rbc called rauch back,in an effort to pin rauch down.trial tr.this call,unlike the others,was not recorded,because it was made from the office of max holmes,of rbc group,and not from rbc trading desk.appellees contend that during the unrecorded call,rbc and rauch,on behalf of the schneiders,formed a contract for the sale of the notes at.we discuss in detail below the evidence of the content of all three march phone calls.as explained below,the trial evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that rauch had received authorization from the schneiders to make the sale,that rbc could have reasonably believed that rauch had received authorization from the schneiders to conclude the trade,or that,under the circumstances,rbc could have reasonably interpreted rauch words as expressing agreement to sell the notes at.
rauch learned soon after the unrecorded call that the schneiders had lost interest in selling the notes.on the night of march,the schneiders attorney,jim alterbaum,left a message for rauch telling him that alterbaum was not sure the schneiders want rauch to proceed with phone calls to rbc and advising rauch not to spin his wheel.pl.ex.the schneiders then told rauch they had decided to put on hold any sale of the notes.on march,rauch told ambrecht,nothing is going to happen with the bonds probably for five weeks.
the schneiders never sold the notes.on april,jones apparel group announced that it would buy mcnaughton.on june,the notes were paid in full.
this litigation followed,involving claims by rbc and highland that,during the unrecorded march call between rauch and rbc representatives,the schneiders contracted to sell their mcnaughton notes at and that they subsequently breached the contract.the schneiders denied that rauch had actual authority to make such a sale,that apparent authority for the transaction was ever communicated to the buyers,or that rauch ever agreed to sell the notes.after a tortuous pretrial history,which we do not recite because it has no pertinence to the issues on this appeal,the case proceeded to trial.the jury found against the schneiders and awarded damages for breach of contract totaling approximately million to rbc and highland.the district court denied the schneiders motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol or a new trial,and this appeal followed.

appellees claims rely on a contract between the schneiders and rbc,which they contend rauch agreed to on the schneiders behalf during the unrecorded phone call of march.the evidence would support a finding of such a contract only if it allowed for a reasonable finding that rauch had actual authority to make the agreement or if rbc relied on his apparent authority to do so.merrill lynch interfunding,argenti,cir a n agent must have authority,whether apparent,actual or implied,to bind his principal.we conclude that the record contains insufficient evidence to support either finding,or indeed even a finding that rauch purported to enter a contract without authorization.
actual authority 
under new york law,an agent has actual authority if the principal has granted the agent the power to enter into contracts on the principal behalf,subject to whatever limitations the principal places on this power,either explicitly or implicitly.ford unity,an agent power to bind his principal is coextensive with the principal grant of authority.as we have explained 
actual authority is created by direct manifestations from the principal to the agent,and the extent of the agent actual authority is interpreted in the light of all circumstances attending those manifestations,including the customs of business,the subject matter,any formal agreement between the parties,and the facts of which both parties are aware.

to conclude that rauch had actual authority to enter a contract to sell the notes at,a jury would have to find that the schneiders authorized a sale of the notes at that price or that they had authorized rauch to exercise discretion as to the terms of the sale.leonard schneider and rauch,of course,expressly denied that the schneiders authorized the sale of the notes at,trial tr,and nothing in the record supports a finding that the schneiders gave rauch such authorization.at the time of the last recorded call on march,ten minutes prior to the unrecorded call,they had not done so,and appellees put forward no evidence that the schneiders gave rauch any further authorization in the ten intervening minutes.indeed,it is virtually inconceivable that they would have done so after learning that mcnaughton was likely to be acquired and then to pay the notes at their face amount.
nor does the record contain evidence that rauch had actual authority to conclude a contract without obtaining the schneiders agreement to the terms.the letter agreement unequivocally states that the consummation of any transaction remains in the sole discretion and satisfaction of the schneiders and rbc.all the evidence of the behavior of the parties during the course of the negotiations further confirmed that the schneiders withheld authorization from rauch to conclude a contract on their behalf without their consent to the terms.rauch presented firm offers to rbc only after obtaining the schneiders permission to do so,and he presented rbc offers to the schneiders before responding to them.there was,therefore,no basis upon which a jury could conclude that rauch had received actual authorization to enter into a contract without the schneiders express agreement to its terms,which he never received.
appellees primary argument in support of a finding that rauch had actual authority to enter into a contract for a sale of the notes at is that customs of business,peltz,at,imply that rauch had actual authority to accept a price on behalf of his clients.pl.br.at.they argue,t here is no evidence that the letter agreement foreclosed the possibility that rauch would be communicating the schneiders approval of the transaction.id.this may be true,but the crucial question is not whether rauch could accept a price on behalf of the schneiders,but whether he could do so without their authorization.likewise,the question is not whether rauch was authorized to communicat e the schneiders approval,but whether he had received the schneiders approval.there was no evidence that rauch had authorization to exercise his own discretion on behalf of his principals as to the terms of the transaction.to the contrary,all the evidence showed that rauch had no actual authority to contract except upon receipt of the sellers approval of the terms,and there was no evidence that he had received such approval.
ii.apparent authority 
appellees also contend that rauch had apparent authority to bind the schneiders to a contract for the sale of the notes at.where an agent lacks actual authority,he may nonetheless bind his principal to a contract if the principal has created the appearance of authority,leading the other contracting party to reasonably believe that actual authority exists.apparent authority exists when a principal,either intentionally or by lack of ordinary care,induces a third party to believe that an individual has been authorized to act on its behalf.peltz,at internal quotation marks omitted see also wells fargo home mortgage,hiddekel church of god,essential to the creation of apparent authority are words or conduct of the principal,communicated to a third party,that give rise to the appearance and belief that the agent possesses authority to enter into a transaction.quoting standard funding lewitt.however,t he mere creation of an agency for some purpose does not automatically invest the agent with apparent authority to bind the principal without limitation.ford,at.a party can not claim that an agent acted with apparent authority when it knew,or should have known,that the agent was exceeding the scope of its authority.sphere drake ins.clarendon ins,cir.
to conclude that rauch had apparent authority to make the contract,a jury would need to find that the schneiders induced the reasonable belief by rbc that rauch made the contract having received the authorization of the schneiders to do so.see peltz,at.no evidence suggests that the schneiders did anything to induce rbc to believe that rauch was authorized to enter an agreement without their specific assent to its terms.the letter agreement expressly advised appellees that he could not,and rauch repeatedly confirmed this limitation on his authority throughout his negotiations with rbc.for example,on january,when ambrecht asked for a firm offer,rauch replied,i tell the schneiders to make you an offer.he responded with a firm offer twelve days later,after consulting with the schneiders.
rauch had apparent authority,therefore,to conclude an agreement only if the schneiders induced rbc to reasonably believe that the schneiders had agreed to make a deal on the terms offered.we assume arguendo that by authorizing rauch to negotiate with rbc on their behalf,the schneiders gave rauch apparent authority to communicate their assent either expressly or by implication even if they had not in fact assented.nevertheless,in light of the evidence of the negotiations preceding the unrecorded march phone call,appellees failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a reasonable finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that rbc reasonably believed that rauch had received authorization from the schneiders to sell the notes at.
the recordings of the first two calls on march make clear that,at the times those calls took place,rauch lacked authority to sell the notes at.in the first call,at,
