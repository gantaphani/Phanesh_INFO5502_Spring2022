appellee united mine workers of america,international union union entered into a limited agreement with peabody coal company peabody coal.the agreement,which included an arbitration clause,also bound peabody coal parent company and the parent company subsidiaries.positing that the parent company peabody holding company,llc peabody holding and a subsidiary black beauty coal company black beauty had shirked their obligations under the agreement,the union submitted a grievance to the arbitrator.the arbitrator found that the matter was arbitrable but deferred a ruling on the merits.
peabody holding and black beauty appellants responded to the arbitrator ruling by seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court that the dispute is not arbitrable.the union filed a counterclaim,requesting a declaratory judgment that appellants must proceed before the arbitrator.the district court entered judgment in favor of the union.it first ruled that the arbitrator properly determined the arbitrability of the dispute.in the alternative,the court concluded that the dispute was arbitrable,even if the arbitrator lacked authority to decide the arbitrability question.appellants timely noted an appeal.
we affirm the judgment of the district court.as an initial matter,we find that the court,not the arbitrator,must decide whether the dispute is arbitrable.the parties agreement lacks the requisite clear and unmistakable language evincing an intent to arbitrate arbitrability.exercising our independent judgment on the arbitrability question,we conclude that appellants have not rebutted the ordinary presumption in favor of arbitrability.accordingly,the parties must proceed to arbitration.
from time to time,the union negotiates a labor agreement with the bituminous coal operators association,bcoa.the bcoa is a bargaining group comprising a number of employers,each of whom is bound by the resulting agreements.employers subject to these agreements are known as signatory companies.
in,the union sought to extend certain obligations to nonsignatory companies that were either parent companies of a signatory company or subsidiaries of such a parent company.acceding to at least some of the union demands,signatory companies agreed to bind their nonsignatory parent companies and nonsignatory subsidiaries of those parent companies to a set of terms.
peabody coal,as a signatory company,executed a contract with the union in that memorialized the agreement.the agreement was renewed in,and.the memorandum of understanding regarding job opportunities jobs agreement forms the basis of this action.the jobs agreement bound,among others,peabody coal peabody holding,the parent company of peabody coal and black beauty,a subsidiary of peabody holding.
the jobs agreement aims to provide job opportunities for work of a classified nature to certain and active miners.specifically,it mandates that the nonsignatory companies offer a fixed percentage of jobs to miners who are either currently working for peabody coal or were laid off by peabody coal.the jobs agreement applies only to existing,new,or newly acquired nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operations of the nonsignatory companies,and it does not constitute a covenant running with the land and does not apply to the sale of nonsignatory coal lands,coal reserves or coal operations either asset sales or stock sales of the companies.id.moreover,nothing in the jobs agreement encumber s or limit s in any way the rights of the nonsignatory companies to sell,exchange,release,or otherwise similarly convey any of their nonsignatory coal lands,coal reserves or coal operations to third parties.id.the contract lists on december,as the agreement time of termination.
the jobs agreement contains an arbitration clause,which extends authority to a jobs monitor 
in order to effectuate the implementation of these job opportunity provisions,the union and the companies subject to this jobs agreement agree that the impartial jobs monitor shall serve as the monitor under this jobs agreement.the monitor shall review the job selections pursuant to these provisions and investigate any alleged violations herein.the monitor shall have the authority to request such information which may be reasonably necessary in order to secure compliance with the job selection provisions.the parties have the obligation to comply with such requests.
any dispute alleging a breach of this jobs agreement,if not resolved by the parties,may be submitted to the jobs monitor for resolution.id.the jobs monitor resulting decisions are final and binding on all parties.id.but the jobs agreement forbids the jobs monitor to alter,amend,modify,add to or subtract from,or change in any way the provisions of the contract.id.the jobs agreement further prohibits companies,the union,and miners from using any existing or future contractual grievance procedure to resolve any dispute that may arise concerning the interpretation or application of the contract.id.
in a november,letter to peabody holding,the union stated its expectation that peabody holding and its nonsignatory subsidiaries would continue to comply with the jobs agreement.the union highlighted its concern with black beauty mining operations in lynnville,indiana and the company apparent unwillingness to extend job preferences in accordance with the jobs agreement.
peabody holding responded in a december letter.it stated its belief that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries was bound by the jobs agreement any longer.previously,on october,peabody energy corporation peabody energy,the owner of peabody holding and black beauty,divested itself of peabody coal,transferring the company to patriot coal corporation patriot.because peabody coal the only signatory company once having a corporate relationship with peabody holding and black beauty no longer shared any ties with appellants,peabody holding contended that its obligations under the jobs agreement had been terminated.an obligation to secure job opportunities for union members under the jobs agreement,wrote peabody holding,does not survive conveyance of the union represented subsidiary to a third party such as patriot.according to peabody holding,then,its responsibilities under the jobs agreement had extinguished on october,well before the union had raised its current complaint.
disputing peabody holding assertions that it was no longer bound by the jobs agreement,the union submitted its grievance to the jobs monitor.both the union and peabody holding provided the jobs monitor with materials supporting their respective arguments,though peabody holding maintained that it did not accept or acquiesce to consideration by the job sic monitor of claims asserted under the jobs agreement,as that instrument no longer applies to the company,id.
the jobs monitor concluded that he,as the arbitrator,must decide the arbitrability of the dispute under the jobs agreement.he ultimately decided that the dispute was arbitrable but deferred a final resolution on the merits until further argument could take place.
appellants responded to the jobs monitor decision by filing a declaratory action in the district court.they sought an order vacating the jobs monitor decision,declaring that the union claim is not arbitrable,and declaring that they have no obligation to provide hiring preferences.the thrust of appellants argument was that the divestiture of peabody coal left them without a corporate relationship with any signatory company,thereby extinguishing their obligations under the jobs agreement.the union,for its part,filed a counterclaim.it sought an order declaring that the jobs monitor decision is enforceable and directing appellants to comply with the decision and proceed to a hearing on the merits before the jobs monitor.
after the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of the union.it first concluded that the jobs monitor,not the court,must decide whether this dispute is arbitrable.construing the supreme court recent decision in rent a center,west,jackson,the court held that the arbitrator decides arbitrability where,as here,the defendant challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole.
in the alternative,the court held that the dispute was arbitrable.even if the court,not the arbitrator,must resolve the arbitrability question,the district court still found that the union prevailed.the court emphasized the purportedly broad language of the arbitration clause and noted that appellants arguments impermissibly implicated the merits question at the arbitrability stage.
this appeal followed.
arbitrability disputes often necessitate a inquiry.e,first options of chicago,kaplan.first,we determine who decides whether a particular dispute is arbitrable the arbitrator or the court.second,if we conclude that the court is the proper forum in which to adjudicate arbitrability,we then decide whether the dispute is,in fact,arbitrable.we review de novo the district court ruling as to both prongs.carolina tools,int l tool supply,cir.
for the following reasons,we hold that the court must determine the arbitrability of this dispute and that this dispute is arbitrable.
we first determine who decides the arbitrability issue.appellants contend that nothing in the jobs agreement rebuts the heavy presumption that contracting parties intend that the court evaluate arbitrability.the union counters that the arbitration clause in the jobs agreement is sufficiently broad to demonstrate that the parties intended for the jobs monitor to decide arbitrability.we agree with appellants.the jobs agreement wholly lacks language clearly and unmistakably providing that the jobs monitor must decide the arbitrability question.the union is thus unable to demonstrate that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.
as in any contractual claim,the intent of the contracting parties guides our analysis.carson food giant,cir.although we have adopted a general,federal presumption in favor of arbitration,that presumption is not applied to resolve questions of the arbitrability of arbitrability issues themselves.id.at quoting.carolina tools,at.indeed,the question of arbitrability is undeniably an issue for judicial determination.at t,commc ns workers of.parties,to be sure,can agree to arbitrate arbitrability,but such agreement must clearly and unmistakably provide that the arbitrator shall determine what disputes the parties agreed to arbitrate.carson,at quoting at t,at 
the clear and unmistakable standard is exacting,and the presence of an expansive arbitration clause,without more,will not suffice.see id.the clear and unmistakable test set forth by the supreme court requires more than simply saying that the arbitrator determines the meaning of any disputed contractual terms.we have therefore found that an arbitration clause committ ing all interpretive disputes relating to or arising out of the agreement does not satisfy the clear and unmistakable test.id.at see also dupont de nemours martinsville nylon emps.council,cir unpublished holding clear and unmistakable test not met where contract provided for arbitration of a ny question as to the interpretation of this agreement or as to any alleged violation of any provision of this agreement.those who wish to let an arbitrator decide which issues are arbitrable need only state that all disputes concerning the arbitrability of particular disputes under this contract are hereby committed to arbitration,or words to that clear effect.carson,at.
contrary to the assertions of the union and reasoning of the district court,the supreme court decision in rent a center did not signal retrenchment from the clear and unmistakable doctrine.quite the opposite,the court reaffirmed the continuing vitality of the demanding test.see.at.the court acknowledged that,to submit the arbitrability determination to an arbitrator,a court must find clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.id.it further clarified that the clear and unmistakable test applies only to the parties manifestation of intent,not the agreement validity.id.thus the court rejected the plaintiff argument that,to submit the merits question to the arbitrator,a court need find a clear and unmistakable absence of unconscionability.id.
applying these principles to the jobs agreement,we find that the terms of the contract fail to satisfy the clear and unmistakable test.therefore,the court,not the jobs monitor,must determine the arbitrability of the parties dispute.the jobs agreement provides for arbitration of a ny dispute alleging a breach of this jobs agreement.the parties arbitration clause is thus more narrow than those found insufficient to commit the arbitrability question to the arbitrator in carson,at a ny grievance or dispute regarding the terms of this agreement,and dupont,at any question as to the interpretation of this agreement or as to any alleged violation of any provision of this agreement.in short,nothing in the jobs agreement even approaches the model language that we suggested parties use to evince a clear intent to arbitrate arbitrability,see carson,at.given the exacting test that parties must meet to overcome the presumption that they intended that a court decide arbitrability,at t,at,we readily conclude that the jobs agreement fails to satisfy this standard.accordingly,we must proceed to decide whether this dispute is arbitrable 
finding that the parties have committed to the court the authority to determine whether this dispute is arbitrable,we turn to that inquiry.appellants contend that a court must resolve the threshold inquiry of whether the severance of their relationship with peabody coal,the lone signatory company once in their corporate structure,extinguishes their obligations under the jobs agreement.according to appellants,they can not be forced to arbitrate a dispute that calls into question the enduring validity of the very contract that the union points to as the font of appellants duty to arbitrate.
we disagree.federal courts have developed a robust presumption in favor of arbitrability,one that appellants are unable to rebut.we have further cautioned that we must not delve into the merits while conducting the arbitrability analysis,and a party may not cloak substantive contentions in jurisdictional garb to evade its obligations under an arbitration clause.accordingly,we hold that the union and appellants must proceed to arbitration to resolve this dispute.
the twin pillars of consent and intent are the touchstones of arbitrability analysis.arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.t he determination of what disputes are arbitrable is focused on the intent of the parties.carson,at quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation.we have insisted that,in general,the parties not the courts control which disputes will be arbitrated.id.at.
our analysis in this context follows a markedly different course from determining who decides arbitrability.federal law reverses the presumption when deciding whether a dispute is arbitrable,adjudging a dispute arbitrable unless the parties have clearly indicated otherwise.first options,at.when interpreting a contract containing an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.at t,at quoting warrior gulf,at.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.id.quoting warrior gulf,at.
sound analytical and policy reasons justify this judicial embrace of arbitration.a presumption in favor of arbitrability generally vindicates the intent of the contracting parties.the question of whether a particular dispute is arbitrable arises when the parties have a contract that provides for arbitration of some issues.in such circumstances,the parties likely gave at least some thought to the scope of arbitration.first options,at.because the parties negotiate with a backdrop of the law permissive policies in respect to arbitration,one can understand why the law would insist upon clarity before conclud
