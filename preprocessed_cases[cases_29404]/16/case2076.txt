on appeal,p t challenges the dismissal of its intentional misrepresentation claim for failure to satisfy.b,and its claim under the tcpa as barred by the statute of limitations set forth in ann.also,while abandoning its claim for breach of fiduciary duty,p t contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on its negligence claim.finally,p t argues that the district court erred in finding that defendants were entitled,either singly or collectively,to indemnification under one or more provisions of the written agreements.no challenge is made to the reasonableness of the amount of the judgment.after review of the extensive record and the arguments presented on appeal,we affirm.
p t supply,a tennessee corporation headquartered in memphis,distributes telecom products to telephone,communications,and cable companies.p t used the banking services of first tennessee bank for many years,including a syndicated line of credit sloc for working capital and inventory purchases.first tennessee was the lead bank on that syndicated credit facility.participated in the sloc for the first time in august,and finally succeeded in replacing first tennessee as p t primary bank in november.in soliciting p t business,suntrust made two presentations central to p t claims in this case.
the presentations,made in september and january,pitched the investment banking services and products of suntrust capital markets and its subsidiary suntrust corporate finance stcf,including syndicated credit facilities,term loans,private placements,and derivative interest rate swaps.p t alleges that the suntrust defendants misrepresented the level of care that would be taken in providing such services.in particular,p t relies on the following statements from the written materials that described the advantages of stcf services 
stcf works almost exclusively with clients and prospects of its banks.this creates a high level of accountability.

also,in pitching their lending syndication services,the materials from both presentations stated that stcf would assist throughout the process,helping clients structure a marketable transaction that best meets the company needs,and would stay involved after the transaction is completed,thereby facilitating conversation regarding future transactions and reinforcing our role as financial advisor.with respect to risk management,the materials stated we take seriously our responsibility to recommend only those strategies that are appropriate for our customers and will not recommend an inappropriate or high risk transaction.
in april,only a few months after the second presentation,first tennessee and suntrust proposed that p t hedge against rising interest rates on the sloc and discussed the relative risks and benefits of an cap versus an swap.p t rejected suntrust proposed swap,and decided instead to purchase a interest rate cap at on a notational amount of million.p t did not move the sloc to suntrust until november,more than a after the second presentation,and did not enter the swap agreements at issue until july and july,respectively.
in november,when the existing sloc matured,took over as p t primary bank and became the lead lender on a new million sloc.the new sloc,or credit facility,was documented by restated credit and restated security agreements,which explicitly provided that nothing in them or any related documents created a fiduciary relationship between p t and either suntrust or any participating lender.
in june,as p t borrowing under the sloc grew,suntrust proposed that p t enter an swap to hedge against increases in the variable interest rate on its higher loan balances.suntrust equitable securities corporation stes presented p t with a written proposal that explained the swap,disclaimed any advisory role on the part of suntrust,and advised that p t should determine the risks and merits of the transaction without reliance on suntrust or its affiliates.that proposal was accepted and p t entered into a swap on a notational amount of million,under which p t would pay at a fixed rate of and would pay at a floating rate tied to the london interbank offered rate libor.
as is typical of such contracts,the swap was governed by a master agreement and confirmation setting forth the particulars of the transaction.the master agreement an international swap dealers association isda master agreement included terms of dealing and risk disclosures,which,in turn,expressly disavowed the existence of any advisory or fiduciary relationship absent an express written undertaking by suntrust.the confirmation incorporated the master agreement,acknowledged the terms of dealing and risk disclosures,and specifically acknowledged that the transactions involved certain risks.the risks identified included that the swap may increase or decrease in value with a change in interest rates market risk and that the swap could not be terminated quickly at or near its value liquidity risk.
the swap was initially favorable to p t because interest rates rose over the next year.p t received quarterly statements reflecting that the swap had a positive unwind value of in december,in april,and in may.rising demand for credit in the spring of led p t to seek an increase in the suntrust sloc and caused further concern about the risk of rising interest rates.stes prepared a comparison of estimated costs for the following scenarios if p t did not choose to further hedge its borrowing if it simply added a second swap on a notational amount of million or if it unwound the favorable swap for cash value and entered a newly restructured interest rate swap on a notational amount of million.p t decided to keep the swap and enter into a second swap on a notational amount of million under which p t would pay at a fixed rate of and would pay based on the libor.
this second swap,effective july,was memorialized by a confirmation that incorporated the earlier master agreement,acknowledged the market and liquidity risks of the transaction,and again disavowed any advisory or fiduciary relationship unless expressly agreed to in a written engagement letter.in an august loan commitment letter,suntrust and stes agreed to provide p t with a new million sloc.the terms of the commitment letter included as a condition that p t hedge at least of the sloc and required of the sloc and the swaps.p t alleges that the second interest rate swap was entered into at defendants urging and in anticipation of the hedging requirement.the new million sloc was executed in october.
interest rates,specifically the libor,began dropping dramatically in november.p t borrowing under the sloc also fell off,steadily declining from a high of approximately million in june,to approximately million in february,million in october,million in december,and in february.as a result,while p t obligations under the sloc fell,p t quarterly obligations under the swap agreements grew.estimates of the cost to unwind the now unfavorable swaps were provided to p t and reflected liability of approximately million in march,million in july,and million in november.p t held the swaps until october,when p t decision to move the sloc to another bank triggered suntrust right to terminate the swaps at a cost to p t of.
p t filed the original complaint in state court on march,and defendants removed it to federal court.successive motions to dismiss and to amend the complaint followed,and p t filed a first,second,and third amended complaint seeking to recover approximately million allegedly incurred as a result of the swap agreements.p t asserted various claims based on the contention that defendants deceived it into believing they were acting as financial advisors,and then recommended the swaps to hedge against rising interest rates when the swaps were inappropriate and resulted in of the debt.defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,which was granted in part and denied in part.while dismissing claims for breach of contract,misrepresentation,unfair trade practices,common law suitability,and unlawful tying,the district court found that the breach of fiduciary duty,agency,and negligence claims survived on the narrow grounds that p t should be afforded an opportunity to produce any written agreements evidencing that suntrust undertook a fiduciary relationship with p 
p t promptly filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification of that order with respect to the claims for misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,and deceptive trade practices.before that motion was decided,defendants moved for entry of summary judgment in their favor both on p t remaining claims and on their counterclaim for indemnification.p t,in turn,moved to dismiss defendants counterclaim.on may,the district court denied reconsideration of the dismissal order and granted summary judgment to defendants on p t remaining claims.on may,the district court entered an order with respect to the counterclaim,denying p t motion to dismiss and granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.judgment was entered in favor of defendants,and this appeal followed.
motion to dismiss 
our review of the district court decision to dismiss claims under.b is de novo.lewis acb bus,cir.we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all the factual allegations as true,and determine whether the plaintiff can prove a set of facts in support of its claims that would entitle it to relief.bovee coopers lybrand,cir.the court need not accept legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences as true.morgan church fried chicken,cir.
the tennessee consumer protection act tcpa provides a cause of action for one who suffers an ascertainable monetary loss as a result of another unfair or deceptive acts.code ann.a.an action under this section must be brought within one year from discovery of the unlawful act or practice.code ann.in tennessee,a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the injury occurs or is discovered,or when in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence,it should have been discovered.potts celotex.
p t argues that the district court misapplied tennessee discovery rule by failing to recognize that knowledge sufficient to put a plaintiff on notice requires not only an awareness of the injury,but also the tortious origin or wrongful nature of that injury.shadrick coker.that same case further adds,however,that a plaintiff may not wait to file suit until after all of the injurious effects or the specific type of legal claim are known.id.applying this standard de novo,we find the district court did not err in concluding that this claim was time barred.
since this action was commenced on march,we are concerned with what p t knew or should have known before march.p t alleged that the suntrust entities deceived p t into believing that they would act as financial advisors,that the swap transactions would be suitable and appropriate tools to manage the risk of rising interest rates,and that the swaps could be renegotiated if interest rates fell.p t started paying on the first swap in july,the second swap was executed in october,and variable interest rates dropped dramatically beginning in november.over the next year,it is alleged,p t borrowing fell steadily and virtually eliminated the need to hedge against rising interest rates under the sloc.at the same time,the independent obligations under the swaps grew substantially.p t made quarterly payments under the swaps and was aware that the cost to unwind the swap transactions increased from million in march to million in november.taken together,the circumstances as alleged demonstrated that p t knew or should have known that it incurred financial injury as a result of defendants allegedly deceptive practices before march,
intentional misrepresentation 
intentional misrepresentation is analyzed as a claim for fraud under tennessee law.shahrdar global.as such,it must be stated with particularity,and the plaintiff must,at a minimum,allege the time,place and content of the misrepresentations the defendant fraudulent intent the fraudulent scheme and the injury resulting from the fraud.fed.civ.b coffey foamex,cir.the elements of a fraud claim are an intentional misrepresentation of material fact the misrepresentation was made knowingly,without belief in its truth,or recklessly without regard to its truth or falsity the plaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentation and suffered damages and the misrepresentation relates to an existing or past fact,or,if the claim is based on promissory fraud,then the misrepresentation must embody a promise of future action without the present intention to carry out the promise.stacks saunders,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
p t alleged generally that defendants misrepresented their intent to act as a financial advisor,the appropriateness of the swaps,and the ability to renegotiate the swaps if they became unfavorable.the district court dismissed this claim for failure to specifically allege the circumstances of the purported misrepresentations,the defendants fraudulent intent,or the fraudulent scheme.apparently acknowledging the lack of specificity,p t has narrowed the focus of this claim to the representations found in the written materials from the and sales presentations because those materials were attached to the complaint.
the essence of the claim based on the sales presentations is that,in pitching p t business,defendants misrepresented the intention to act as a financial advisor to p statements of future intention,opinion,or sales talk are generally not actionable because they do not involve representations of material past or present fact.mcelroy boise cascade.the representations at issue,set out in the statement of facts,involved generalized sales talk and not representations of existing or past fact.instead,p t claims that those representations induced p t into believing that defendants would act as p t financial advisor 
fraudulent inducement,recognized in tennessee as promissory fraud,requires that the misrepresentation be made without the present intention to carry it out.neither the failure to in fact keep the promise,nor the plaintiff subjective impression will demonstrate that there was no present intention to carry out the promise.oak ridge precision,first.bank ass n.p t did not allege that defendants promised to act as a financial advisor without the present intention to do so if they were to secure p t corporate finance business.nor has p t alleged that the representations made during the sales presentations in and were part of a scheme intended to induce p t to enter into unsuitable swap agreements in and.if anything,the representations were made to induce p t to work with suntrust generally not to induce p t to rely on its advice in entering the swap agreements more than two years later.
summary judgment 
we review the district court decision granting summary judgment de novo.smith ameritech,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view all factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
negligence 
to establish a claim for negligence,a plaintiff must demonstrate a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff conduct by the defendant falling below the applicable standard of care an injury or loss causation in fact and proximate,or legal,causation.bradshaw daniel.both the motion to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment focused on the question of duty,the existence of which is entirely a question of law for the court.id.the court must determine whether upon the facts in evidence,such a relation exists between the parties that the community will impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of,more simply,whether the interest of the plaintiff which has suffered invasion was entitled to legal protection at the hands of the defendant.id.at quoting lindsey miami dev.
tennessee common law generally does not impose fiduciary or similar duties on banks with respect to their customers,depositors,or borrowers absent special circumstances.glazer first am.bank,oak ridge precision,at.this rests on the recognition that or relationships generally involve arm length dealings.the district court concluded that no fiduciary or advisory relationship had been established with respect to the swap transactions in this case.as a result,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the agency and breach of fiduciary duty claims.while that decision has not been appealed,p t takes issue with the district court further decision to grant summary judgment to defendants on the common law negligence claim because the only recognized legal duty asserted in support of that claim was a fiduciary duty to evaluate and advise p t on the appropriateness of the swap transactions.
to avoid the legal conclusion that there was no duty to advise p t regarding the appropriateness of the swaps,p t contends that it has asserted a claim for professional negligence for which a duty to exercise reasonable care arises as a matter of law,and the standard of care may be established from expert witness testimony regarding banking industry standards there being no cases applying a professional negligence standard to a relationship,p t relies on the general articulation of such claim in wood clapp,sneed.in wood,a medical malpractice case,the court explained 
a ny one who assumes to be qualified for the exercise of any profession,art,or vocation,is responsible for any damage which may result to those who employ him from the want of the necessary and proper knowledge,skill,and science which such profession demands he impliedly contracts with those who employ him that he has such skill,science,and information as will enable him properly and judiciously to perform the duties of his calling this is the general rule applicable to all professions and avocations in which men are employed to act for others in any particular department of business requiring skill,art,or science.
id.at.the premise of this standard is,of course,that the individual undertook or was engaged to perform professional services.see dooley everett,holding pharmacist is professional.
here,p t argues that this standard should apply because defendants held themselves out to be market professionals and financial advisors provided training to their managers on how to develop relationships and be successful financial advisors and assumed a duty to recommend only appropriate derivative products.in other words,this claim rests on the alleged undertaking to act as p t financial advisor in connection with the swap transactions.calling this a professional negligence claim does not make it distinct from a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.because p t has not demonstrated that defendants owed it a legal duty to advise it on the appropriateness of the swap transactions distinct from the agency and breach of fiduciary duty claims,we find the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants on p t professional negligence claim.
indemnification 
tennessee adheres to the american rule under which prevailing parties pay their own attorney fees absent statutory authorization,agreement of the parties,or other exception.pullman standard,abex.attorney fees and costs are recoverable under an express indemnity contract if the language of the agreement is broad enough to cover such expenditures.id.the contractual language must be construed as written and enforced according to its plain an unambiguous terms.planters gin fed.compress warehouse.
the district court found that defendants were entitled to indemnification for the amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with this action under some but not all of the indemnity provisions on which defendants relied.p t argues on appeal both that it was not obligated under any of the indemnity clauses,and that it was error to find that the defendants could recover collectively.addressing only those provisions that the district court found entitled defendants to indemnification iii of both the and restated credit agreements l of the restated security agreement and of the loan commitment affirm 
loan commitment letter 
the loan commitment letter,to which suntrust bank and stes were parties,included the following indemnification provision in paragraph 
indemnification.you further agree to indemnify and hold harmless suntrust equitable securities and each lender including suntrust bank and each director,officer,employee,affiliate,and agent thereof each,an indemnified person against,and to reimburse each indemnified person,upon its demand,for any losses,claims,damages,liabilities or other expenses losses incurred by such indemnified person insofar as such losses arise out of or in any way relate to or result from this commitment letter,the fee letter or the financing contemplated hereby,including,without limitation,losses participating sic in any legal proceeding relating to any of the foregoing.your obligations under this paragraph shall remain effective whether or not definitive financing documentation is executed and notwithstanding any termination of this commitment letter.
the plain meaning of this language provides indemnification for any expenses that arise out of or in any way relate to or result from this commitment letter,the fee letter,or the financing contemplated hereby including losses from participating in any legal proceeding relating to any of the foregoing.
p t alleged among the general allegations and incorporated into each count the averment that the suntrust entities wrongfully and imprudently required as a condition of the loan commitment letter that p t hedge at least of the sloc and that the loan be.it is further alleged that while the terms of the commitment were being negotiated,p t entered into the second swap in anticipation of and to satisfy that requirement.moreover,p t claimed specifically in count viii that the hedging and requirements constituted unlawful tying.we find that the attorney fees and costs incurred in this litigation arise out of,relate to,or result from the terms of the commitment letter itself.without contesting this on appeal,p t argues instead that this indemnity provision was superceded by the restated credit agreement that was contemplated by the commitment letter.the integration clause in the restated credit agreement,stated 
this agreement,the other credit documents,and the agreements and documents required to be delivered pursuant to the terms of this agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and thereto regarding the subject matters hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements,representations and undertakings related to such subject matters.
