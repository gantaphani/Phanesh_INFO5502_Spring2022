plaintiff local,united food and commercial workers union local or the union appeals from the entry of judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant shaw supermarkets,shaw in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the district court found that because of the parties agreement to resolve disputes internally,it did not have jurisdiction pursuant to section of the labor management relations act lmra,a,to review the union claim of breach of the collective bargaining agreement cba between the parties we affirm the district court.
shaw and local are parties to a cba covering employees of supermarkets in southeastern massachusetts and rhode island for the period of august.the cba is made up of articles,along with a series of side letters and agreements.the side agreements contain a provision that p resent night stocking crew will not be forced to work evenings and lose the stocking premium provided them as night employees.
the union brought the instant complaint in the district court alleging a breach of this provision,stating,
on or about march,shaw forced approximately bargaining unit employees doing night stocking work in stores covered by the cba to do stocking work in afternoon and evening hours that did not qualify for the cents per hour premium.this has resulted in losses of earnings for employees of at least thirty dollars per week,and lesser amounts for part time employees.
shaw action in forcing the night stocking employees to do their work during afternoon and evening hours outside the hours for which the premium is paid violates article,section,quoted supra of the side agreements.
following the filing of the union complaint,shaw moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to.c and b.shaw argued that the dispute resolution procedures in the cba constituted the exclusive remedy for grievances arising under the cba,barring the union from seeking redress in the federal courts under section of the lmra.see note,supra.
article of the cba contains grievance and arbitration provisions preceded by the following declaration in section 
the company and union concur on the usefulness and mutual advantages of providing for the prompt and fair resolution of disagreements that could arise on the meaning and interpretation of this agreement.the following procedures are intended to be the sole means for the resolution of grievances,which for the purposes of this agreement are defined as disputes between the management and the union or covered employee s concerning the meaning or application of this agreement.
article then goes on to set out in four steps the referenced procedures said to be intended to be the sole means for the resolution of grievances.the initial three steps,followed when needed by the fourth step of arbitration,are described as follows 
step an aggrieved employee or the union will bring his or her complaint to his or her store manager within seven calendar days of the incident or action being complained of,or having reasonable knowledge thereof.the store manager will make a good faith effort to resolve the matter within seven calendar days of being notified.if the store manager can not resolve the matter,it will be reduced to writing by the union and submitted to the store manager within five calendar days of the receipt of the manager verbal response.the grievance must be signed by the grieving employee s or the union representative,and must contain a statement describing the nature of the alleged contract violation and a good faith effort to identify the provision of the contract violation and dates,if known.the manager will have five calendar days to answer the grievance in writing.employees may request their steward to bring the matter to their supervisor attention on their behalf.it is the intention of the parties to resolve as many grievances as possible at this step.
step if no resolution at step,the matter may be submitted to the regional management representative or his designee within seven calendar days of receipt of the store manager answer.a step hearing will be held within ten calendar days from the management representative receipt of the written grievance.a written response will be given to the union representative within ten calendar days of the step hearing.
step if not settled at step,the matter may be further appealed in writing by the union to the company labor relations representative,within ten calendar days from the receipt of the management step response.a step hearing will be held within calendar days of the appeal and may be attended by appropriate representatives for the union and company.a written response will be given to the union within fourteen calendar days of the step hearing,or within thirty calendar days of the appeal if no hearing can be scheduled.if no answer is given within these time limits,the union may proceed to the next step 
when the above three steps have been exhausted,the matter may be appealed to arbitration,and the arbitration provisions are thereafter detailed separately under a heading of arbitration procedures.
at the root of the present controversy is a paragraph introducing the relevant side agreements.the paragraph states,t he following and understandings are hereby continued but shall not be subject to arbitration emphasis supplied.both parties have agreed that this part of the cba bars arbitration of the instant alleged violation of the side agreements,but they disagree about where that leaves them.shaw argues that the elimination of arbitration under the side agreements simply means that plaintiffs are limited to,and still must use,the initial three steps of the grievance procedure and abide by the results reached,with neither an arbitration remedy nor judicial action under section available.local contends that the elimination of an arbitration remedy with respect to alleged violations of the side agreements entitles them to go to the courts under section and obtain there a judicial determination of those grievances.alternatively,the union argues that the provision against arbitration of the and understandings is ambiguous and the question of its meaning should be submitted to a.
the district court granted judgment on the pleadings to shaw on the grounds that the applicable language in the cba is unambiguous and requires the plaintiff to forego arbitration but to use the first three steps of the grievance procedure to contest the alleged violation.accordingly,the court ruled,the court is without jurisdiction under section over the dispute.
