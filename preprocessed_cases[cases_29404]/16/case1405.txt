beam,senior circuit judge following a jury trial,the district court for the district of maryland entered judgment in favor of igen international igen and against roche diagnostics gmbh roche in the amount of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.the district court also terminated a contract upon which roche had expended more than million in developmental expenses.roche appeals and we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand.
in,igen entered a license and technology development agreement with boehringer mannheim gmbh bm,which entity was acquired in by roche holding,roche holding,a swiss corporation,and renamed roche diagnostics gmbh.the purpose of the agreement was to facilitate the development,manufacture and marketing of medical diagnostic products that employ igen patented electrochemiluminescence,or ecl,technology in exchange for various exclusive and licenses to develop and distribute products,roche agreed to pay royalties to igen,to share any improvements it acquired or developed to enhance the technology,and to market its ecl products within a specified field.roche invested more than million in the ecl project over the next several years and launched two diagnostic instruments in and.its menu of test kits or assays rapidly expanded from eleven to more than fifty,and its market share increased from zero percent in to the number four position in the american market,number two in europe,and number two worldwide by.
but in,a disagreement arose between roche and igen over the calculation and reporting of royalties.igen brought this lawsuit this case or the maryland case in september,alleging that roche incorrectly calculated and paid royalties under the contract,failed to use its best efforts in developing products,and breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing.
matters got even more complicated in when a swiss company,laboratoires serono serono,sued both igen and roche in federal district court in delaware the serono litigation or the delaware case,alleging that instruments infringed a serono patent.although both roche and igen knew of the serono patent at the outset of their relationship,they initially determined that it did not pose a threat of infringement liability.faced with the infringement suit,however,roche reevaluated the patents and determined that serono claims had some possibility of success.when roche and igen could not agree on who had primary contractual responsibility for defense of the serono action,one of roche corporate affiliates,roche hlr,acquired serono patent for million on july.
having purchased the subject matter of the serono action,hlr formally became the plaintiff in the delaware case on october,and then offered each of the roche,igen,and igen dismissal without prejudice.roche accepted but igen refused the offer.it wanted either a dismissal with prejudice or a final judgment.hlr,likewise,was unwilling to waive the right to protect its newly acquired interest in the serono patent,particularly in light of igen stormy relationship with roche.so the serono lawsuit proceeded to a bench trial in february.
meanwhile,on september,igen filed an amended complaint in this case,which complaint included,among others,new allegations concerning the handling of the serono matter.twelve of igen fourteen causes of action proceeded to trial,and six of them are before us on appeal.igen alleged that hlr continuation of the serono lawsuit amounted to tortious unfair competition by roche.it claimed that roche breached an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing when roche discontinued plans to develop an dna probe without returning to igen roche license to do so.igen also alleged that roche breached express provisions of the contract by failing to pay royalties failing to share ecl improvements with igen settling the serono lawsuit,using hlr,without igen consent and selling products outside the contractually limited field.
the jury returned a special verdict in igen favor on each of these claims.it awarded million in compensatory damages and a landmark million in punitive damages for the unfair competition claim million for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and a total of million for the other claims.additionally,the jury found that roche had materially breached its agreement with igen.the district court entered judgment in the amounts determined by the jury and declared that igen was entitled to terminate the agreement as a result of roche material breach.the court also denied roche motions for judgment as a matter of law,for a new trial,and for reduction of the punitive damages.this appeal followed.
we turn first to the issues in this case arising out of the serono litigation,which issues merit some additional procedural discussion.in its amended complaint,igen sought to hold roche liable for the role that its corporate relative,hlr,played in the serono lawsuit.in count twelve,the contract claim,igen alleged that hlr purchase of the serono patent constituted an unauthorized settlement by roche in violation of section of the agreement.in count fourteen,igen claimed that hlr continuation of the serono lawsuit amounted to unfair competition.
igen moved for partial summary judgment on count twelve.roche opposed the motion by arguing,in part,that it could not be held liable for hlr conduct because igen had failed to establish that roche and hlr were the same legal entity.the district court disagreed and ruled that,in the serono litigation,for all purposes,whatever was accomplished by roche was accomplished by boehringer mannheim,by roche,whomever the parties were.in other words,the district court determined that roche was roche second self or alter ego it also agreed with igen interpretation of the contract and,thus,granted summary judgment in igen favor.
we are inclined to believe that,under the facts of this case,the district court decision to pierce the corporate veil between roche and hlr was error.but,we need not decide that question because roche has not challenged the district court alter ego ruling on appeal.failure to present or argue assignments of error in opening appellate briefs constitutes a waiver of those issues.see edwards city of goldsboro,cir fed.a a.although roche appeals the grant of summary judgment on count twelve,its argument addresses only the district court interpretation of the contract and ignores the alter ego determination entirely had roche raised this issue on appeal,we may have been able to more narrowly resolve the claims at issue in this case.if hlr and roche are separate entities for tort liability purposes,as the record seems to indicate it is doubtful that roche could have been found responsible for damages,if any,arising from continuation of the serono litigation however,with alter ego not an issue on appeal,we turn to the merits of counts twelve and fourteen.
section of the parties agreement states that n either party shall enter into any settlement that affects the other party rights or interests without such other party written consent.igen argues,and the district court found,that hlr purchase of the serono patent for million constituted an unauthorized settlement by roche that affected igen rights and interests.roche counters that,with or without hlr purchase,the serono patent would still exist and would remain a threat to igen patent rights.the mere substitution of parties did not,according to roche,impact igen rights or interests at all,and summary judgment on count twelve was therefore improper.we disagree.
reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo,moore.brown root,cir,we find that roche view of what affects the other party rights or interests is too narrow.the plain meaning of section supports the district court conclusion that the loss of roche as a in the serono litigation affected igen interests.as,igen and roche undoubtedly could have shared trial strategy and most certainly had already shared confidential information and technology.once hlr became the serono plaintiff and dismissed roche as a defendant,igen not only lost the benefit of a trial partner,it saw its confidences transferred,through roche and hlr corporate affiliation,to its opponent.to be sure,these events did not destroy or defeat igen rights or interests,but they certainly affected them.because we must accept the district court determination that roche and hlr were the same entity in this transaction,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on count twelve.
in count fourteen,igen alleged that roche engaged in unfair competition by continuing the serono lawsuit once hlr had acquired the serono patent.soon after the district court ruled that roche could be held liable for hlr pursuit of the serono claim,roche sought the application of the doctrine,which immunizes protected first amendment petitioning activity from collateral attack.the district court denied roche request as and permitted the unfair competition claim to go to the jury,resulting in a million compensatory award the cost to igen of defending the serono action and million in punitive damages.
the doctrine grants first amendment immunity to those who engage in petitioning activity.see united mine workers of am.pennington,d eastern presidents conf.noerr motor freight,d.this includes the pursuit of litigation,california motor transp.trucking,d,and,although originally developed in the antitrust context,the doctrine has now universally been applied to business torts.see,cheminor drugs,ethyl,cir doctrine applies to common law claims of malicious prosecution,tortious interference with contract,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,and unfair competition.the application of is a question of law.tec cogeneration.power light,cir,modified on rehearing by cir.
to facilitate our analysis of the doctrine and its application in this case,we frame the issue as follows after acquisition of the serono interest,hlr continued to petition the delaware federal district court for a judgment against igen arising from serono patent claims.then,in the maryland federal district court,igen sought judgment against roche for damages arising from hlr petitioning activity in the delaware case.roche,in turn,attempted to assert first amendment immunity against igen maryland court claim.hlr has never been a named party in the maryland case but after the august,alter ego ruling the district court deemed hlr and roche to be one and the same entity.
thus,first we must decide whether roche timely asserted and second,if so,whether immunizes roche from liability for igen claim.
this circuit has previously characterized as an affirmative defense,north carolina membership carolina power light,cir,but other circuits that have addressed the issue disagree.compare bayou fleet,alexander,cir is an affirmative defense,but is not waived if raised at a pragmatically sufficient time and does not prejudice the other party,with mcguire oil mapco,cir is not merely an affirmative defense,and the party opposing its application bears the burden of showing that it does not apply.roche argues,of course,that is not an affirmative defense and therefore can be asserted at any time.in the alternative,roche contends that the district court should have granted it leave to amend its answer to include the defense.the district court rejected both arguments,ruling that must be affirmatively pleaded and that roche could not amend its answer.this was error.
we are inclined to believe that the serono litigation brought with it into this collateral proceeding against roche a rebuttable presumption of immunity,which roche was not required to plead as an affirmative defense.see mcguire oil,at the burden is on the party opposing application of to allege facts sufficient to show that it does not apply.however,because it is not essential to our holding,we need not revisit that issue today.even if is an affirmative defense,we find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow roche to amend its answer.leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a,and should be denied only when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party,when there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party,or when the amendment would be futile.johnson oroweat foods,cir.none of those conditions applies here.
roche asserted within a pragmatically sufficient time two months or the district court alter ego determination.see bayou fleet,at defense not waived if raised at a pragmatically sufficient time.any failure by roche to raise it at an earlier time was wholly consistent with its contention,prior to the alter ego ruling,that it could not be held liable for hlr conduct.and,this position could not have been a surprise to igen or the district court,either before or after the alter ego ruling it was only after the corporate veil had been pierced in this case that roche apparently thought it had need to defend the unfair competition claim on grounds.
we next consider whether effectively immunizes roche from liability for its role in the delaware lawsuit.we have already established that immunity applies to business torts like unfair competition.however,immunity is subject to an exception for sham litigation.the sham exception requires the allegedly tortious serono litigation to have been objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures,d.then,o nly if challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant subjective motivation.id.thus,even litigation that is deceitful,underhanded,or morally wrong will not defeat immunity unless it satisfies the objective baselessness requirement.baltimore scrap david joseph,cir.
procedurally,this circuit precedent holds that upon roche assertion of as an affirmative defense,igen has the burden of proving that its opponent conduct was a sham.hosp.trustees of rex,cir.igen has failed to satisfy this burden.
at trial,both igen and the district court essentially ignored the threshold requirement of objective baselessness and focused primarily on roche subjective motivation for pursuing the serono claim.on appeal,igen the first the serono lawsuit was objectively baseless in roche hands because,according to igen view of sections and of the contract igen held a license in the serono patent from the moment roche acquired it through hlr.this argument misunderstands the meaning of objective baselessness.the mere existence of a possible defense to the serono claim does not render the lawsuit a sham.roche has advanced several reasonable arguments in opposition to igen license defense,and the delaware in hlr a trial.the outcome of the dispute is irrelevant the question is whether the serono claim in hlr hands was so meritless,whether igen license argument is so irrefutable,that no reasonable litigant in roche position could have expected to succeed.we believe the answer to the question is resoundingly in the negative.indeed,we believe,for instance,that roche has advanced at least an arguably convincing defensive interpretation of sections and of the contract.the fact that hlr saw fit to grant igen a license to use the serono patent as part of a settlement that occurred subsequent to and as a result of the august,alter ego ruling in this case,does not attenuate our view.
assuming,as we must,that hlr was the alter ego of roche for purposes of the serono lawsuit,we hold that the sham exception does not apply and that the doctrine immunizes roche from collateral tort liability arising from that litigation.accordingly,we vacate the compensatory award of million and the punitive damages award of million.
even if we were to reject roche defense,we would be inclined to find that it was error for the district court to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.under maryland law exemplary damages must be justified by circumstances of aggravation.a wrong motive must accompany the wrongful act,and without proof of malice,or some other aggravation,exemplary damages can not be recovered.heinze murphy.in this case,the predicate tort or alleged wrongful act was,of course,hlr continuation of the purportedly baseless serono litigation against igen.but as we have already noted,hlr offered to dismiss igen from the serono action,
