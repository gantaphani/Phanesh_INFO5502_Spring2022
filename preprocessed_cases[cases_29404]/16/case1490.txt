this opinion addresses the issues in two related cases.the appeals were not consolidated prior to argument,and we do not consolidate them now.a single opinion is used to explain our decision in each appeal.
in one of the two appeals,the former chief executive officer of transtexas gas corporation,john stanley,argues that the district court erred by agreeing with the bankruptcy court that severance payments he received from the company were fraudulent transfers.we affirm.
in the related appeal,the liquidating trustee for transtexas,bank national association,argues that a different district court erred in denying coverage to the estate under a policy issued by national union fire insurance company.the district court held that the bankruptcy judgment against stanley was not a loss under the policy.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
transtexas gas corporation was engaged in exploration,production,and transmission of oil and natural gas.in april,transtexas filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.the reorganization plan provided that the company would enter a employment agreement with john stanley,the company founder.stanley would serve as chief executive officer and be one of five directors.the agreement was effective march.
the employment agreement provided that stanley could be terminated beginning two years after its execution.his departure was effective a few days before the agreement second anniversary,but neither party presents that as an issue.at termination,stanley would be entitled to severance pay.if he were dismissed for reasons other than cause,he would receive three million dollars.if he were terminated for cause,his payment would be one and a half million dollars.if he voluntarily resigned,he would be paid no severance.
despite its reorganization,transtexas struggled financially.in february,a law firm retained by the board to investigate allegations of stanley wrongdoing found that he could validly be dismissed for cause.however,if stanley brought suit contesting his termination,the report also concluded that the result would be uncertain.no action was taken in.
throughout,transtexas financial condition was perilous.in late,the board used funds for current operations from a reserve account intended to make payments to senior secured noteholders.that withdrawal left insufficient funds to make the note payments due in march.
on january,all five members of the board met.the minutes of that meeting state that the four directors other than stanley agreed that the severance option under stanley employment agreement should be invoked.funding would need to be found for the severance payment it was considered acceptable to divert money from the drilling program.there is no indication in the cursory minutes that the directors discussed whether stanley would be terminated for cause or the effect that would have on the payment.
between january and march,stanley remained ceo and a member of the board as he negotiated the terms of his departure.in march,stanley and transtexas agreed that he would resign.on march,the board executed a separation agreement.it explicitly superseded his employment agreement.he was to be paid three million dollars in installments.stanley received before the payments ceased.
in april,transtexas purchased an executive and organization liability insurance policy the policy from national union.stanley was an insured for any covered claims that were made during the policy period,regardless of when the incidents giving rise to the claims occurred.
as a result of its financial deterioration,transtexas in november filed a second chapter proceeding in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.the bankruptcy court confirmed the creditors plan for reorganization in august.under the plan,a liquidating trust was established with bank as the liquidating trustee.
bank filed an adversary proceeding against stanley,seeking to avoid the severance payments.it alleged that the payments violated b and,and the texas uniform fraudulent transfer act tufta.bus.west.after a trial,the bankruptcy court held that the severance payments constituted both unlawful preferences under section b and fraudulent transfers pursuant to section and tufta.stanley was ordered to repay the over two million dollars he had received,plus attorneys fees and costs.
on appeal,the district court agreed in most respects.there are two different district courts that entered rulings that are reviewed in our opinion.to keep them distinct,we will refer to this first decision as being that of chief judge hayden head.he held that stanley severance payments were avoidable as fraudulent transfers pursuant to section and tufta,but not as preferential transfers under section b.stanley repayment obligation was unaffected by the partial disagreement with the bankruptcy court.
on appeal now,both parties assert error.bank seeks reversal of the district court holding that the transfers were not preferential under section b.stanley argues for reversal of the holding that the severance payments were fraudulent transfers under section and tufta.
prior to the issuance of chief judge head opinion,the insurer,national union,filed for a declaratory judgment against stanley and bank in the united states district court for the southern district of texas.the suit was assigned to judge nancy atlas.national union sought to have the court declare that it was not liable under the policy for the judgment entered against stanley.
the pivotal issue was whether the bankruptcy court judgment against stanley constituted a loss under the policy.for summary judgment were filed.in granting national union motion,judge atlas concluded that the bankruptcy judgment against stanley was not a loss under the policy,and even if it were,it fell within the profit or advantage exclusion.on appeal,bank seeks reversal.
ii.discussion 
we examine the issues raised in these two appeals in the following order.we first analyze whether the payments amounting to more than two million dollars were fraudulent transfers.bank is actually the appellant in that case,as it seeks overturning of the decision that the payments to stanley were not preferential transfers.because we hold that the payments were fraudulent under the bankruptcy code,we need not consider other possible violations,including tufta or section b.
once the fraudulent transfer question is answered,we will turn to whether coverage to bank under the policy was properly denied.
fraudulent transfers under.
stanley arguments that the district court erred in concluding there was a fraudulent transfer are the only ones we need to consider.he argues an absence of proof on the following elements of the claim he was an insider at the time the payments were made to him transtexas did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the payments there was an intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors and transtexas was insolvent when the separation agreement was made.
we review the decision of a district court,sitting as an appellate court,by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.in re jay,cir.
findings of fact may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.in re martin,cir.in examining for clear error,we review the record as a whole and not just the evidence supporting the finding.anderson city of bessemer city.stanley alleges that heightened scrutiny must be given to the because those issued by the bankruptcy court were essentially verbatim recitals of bank proposed findings.see fdic texarkana bank,cir.a more recent description of our duty in such circumstances is that we are to approach such findings with greater caution,and as a consequence to apply the standard of review more rigorously.mclennan am.eurocopter,cir.nonetheless,our basic clear error standard is still the test.id.
stanley also alleges that irreconcilable were made,making the findings as a whole defective.when a court rules on inconsistent legal theories,and in so doing finds irreconcilable facts,the district court account of the evidence is no longer plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.see in re webb,cir quotation and citation omitted.while error may well be shown when a district court finds two mutually exclusive facts,that is not what occurred here.
several common facts supported that the transfer to stanley was both preferential under section b and fraudulent under section.when the district court rejected that section b applied,it did so due to the legal conclusion that stanley had to be an insider at the time of the actual payment.for section,the court held it was enough that insider status existed at the time the obligation arose.these conclusions do not impugn the validity of the attendant findings of fact that supported both theories.
with respect to conclusions of law,the bankruptcy court decisions are reviewed de novo.see swint.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court held that transtexas severance payments to stanley were avoidable fraudulent transfers pursuant to section.this provision of the bankruptcy code protects creditors of insolvent debtors from unlawful transfers to company insiders.if a chapter debtor has paid an insider with funds that would otherwise belong to the bankruptcy estate,the trustee may be entitled to recover those payments.
an avoidable fraudulent transfer requires a an obligation b incurred by the debtor for the benefit of an insider c made or incurred within two years before the date of petition where the debtor either d incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor,or e received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such obligation while the debtor was insolvent or made for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.a a b 
two elements are clearly satisfied.the severance payments made to stanley after his dismissal were obligations incurred by transtexas within two years of its petition date.
superficially,it would appear that the third element of stanley being an insider is beyond question.that element is challenged,though,on the basis that at the time of the actual payments,stanley had left the company and was no longer an insider.we now turn to this,the first of stanley issues.
payments to an insider 
stanley devotes a substantial portion of his appellate brief to the argument that he was not an insider as meant by the statute.most of that argument is directed towards the separate question of whether the payments should be set aside as preferential transfers.see b.if he is also asserting that his departure from the company by the time of the payments matters for a fraudulent transfer under section of the bankruptcy code,that is error.
under section,it is enough that stanley was an insider either at the time of the transfer of the funds or at the time the company incurred such obligation.the language of the statute makes that evident.a trustee may avoid any transfer including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract,if the debtor a made such transfer or incurred such obligation with the requisite intent,or b i received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation.a emphases added.
under section,there is no textual limitation of insider status to the time in which the transfer is made.because of our ultimate ruling on this statute,we need not resolve the similar issue under section b.
stanley was indisputably an insider at the time he entered into the relevant obligation.that is enough for section.
reasonably equivalent value,and 
intent to hinder creditors 
we join these two issues because the text of section makes clear they are alternatives.in order to affirm,we must conclude there was no clear error in finding that the payments were made either with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor,or that the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the obligation while the debtor was insolvent.we find no reasonable equivalency and therefore do not reach the issue of intent.
the bankruptcy court found that transtexas did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its severance payments to stanley.a bankruptcy court finding of reasonably equivalent value is a factual determination subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.in re dunham,cir the question of reasonable equivalence is largely a question of fact,as to which considerable latitude must be allowed to the trier of the facts.id.citation and quotations omitted.
to measure reasonably equivalent value,we judge the consideration given for a transfer from the standpoint of creditors.in re hinsley,cir.the proper focus is on the net effect of the transfers on the debtor estate,and the funds available to the unsecured creditors.id.citation omitted.the bankruptcy court in this case noted that the effect of stanley severance payments was removing more than two million dollars from the debtor estate,making the funds inaccessible to its creditors.
further,reasonably equivalent value means that the debtor has received value that is substantially comparable to the worth of the transferred property.bfp resolution trust.the bankruptcy court here found that stanley used overreaching tactics,abusing his position of authority to obtain favorable terms in the separation agreement to which he was not entitled.the district court did not adopt the bankruptcy court finding that transtexas received no value for stanley resignation.it did agree that stanley concessions to the company dd not reasonably equate in value to the payments made under the separation agreement.
stanley contends that he provided reasonably equivalent value in this way.the board made its decision to terminate him in january when the employment agreement was in effect.an obligation immediately arose to pay him three million dollars.consequently,the march separation agreement was merely memorializing the debt and structuring the payments.paying that amount to stanley was a satisfaction of a debt.
to support the legitimacy of the debt,stanley argues that his employment agreement was specifically approved as part of the reorganization plan in the first bankruptcy.that agreement allowed as liquidated damages a payment of three million dollars if stanley were terminated without cause.he even argues there is a res judicata effect from the earlier bankruptcy court approval of the contract itself,making the payment incontestable.these claims gloss over the fact that the issue is not the validity of the employment agreement but what rights stanley had under it in.
the bankruptcy court found there was no value to the agreement to pay three million dollars.the district court assigned some value to the exchange,such as stanley release and covenant not to sue.stanley suggests that by agreeing to go quietly,he provided benefit to the company.
the problem factually for each court that has examined the early separation agreement is that at least for a year prior to the termination,there had been evidence of good cause for which stanley could be terminated.such a termination would have reduced by half the severance payment.stanley actually resigned,which under the employment agreement would have entitled the company to pay him nothing.the bankruptcy court specifically found that stanley departure was a voluntary resignation,entitling him to nothing.the district court disagreed,holding that the resignation was part and parcel of the separation agreement,which created the right to severance pay if he resigned.regardless,there were substantial obstacles to stanley getting three million dollars for his departure.transtexas nonetheless agreed to the payment.based strictly on the legal analysis of the contracts,we find no error in the that this was not reasonable equivalence.
stanley also argues that some evidence had to be presented by the trustee to show a lack of equivalence.neither expert nor lay testimony was offered to support that three million dollars was more than stanley agreement to resign was worth.besides lay or expert testimony,stanley argues the bankruptcy court also held that a three million dollar debt existed as of january.
the bankruptcy court concluded that the three million dollar debt arose in january when the board decided to terminate stanley.the board decision was not to terminate him for cause the decision not to terminate stanley for cause in fact,he resigned was in effect a prophesy to justify paying three million dollars instead of half that amount if he were terminated for cause.those conclusions were stated in resolving the issue of preferential transfers under section b.we see in them only an analysis of what the board decision in january to terminate and to pay three million dollars did to the issue of creation of an obligation.it does not undermine other findings that the obligation was disproportionate to what was legally owed.
stanley cites a decision in which expert testimony was found necessary to overcome a presumption of reasonableness regarding the salaries and bonuses that were paid.askanase fatjo,no,wl,at,aff,cir.what someone labor is worth seems to us a much different proposition than whether the straightforward terms of an employment agreement could fairly be interpreted to require payment of three million dollars or half that amount.putting a value on the uncertainties of litigation might have allowed the admission of specific testimony,lay or expert,but we do not conclude that the absence of such testimony is fatal.
transtexas did not receive reasonably equivalent value for providing stanley greater compensation than required by the terms of the employment agreement.the district court agreed that even under the most favorable circumstances,stanley could only have been entitled to million under the employment agreement,basing that on the conclusion that there was good cause for terminating him.there is simply too much disparity between transtexas payments and any concessions stanley may have made for his expedient exit from the company.see in re fairchild aircraft,cir 
the reasonable equivalency was not clearly erroneous.even under a slightly more intense look caused by the bankruptcy court nearly verbatim adoption of the proposal of one party,we still see no error.
insolvency of transtexas 
transtexas was found either to be insolvent or became insolvent by virtue of the financial obligations incurred by the three million dollar separation agreement.stanley challenges the insolvency calculation used by the bankruptcy court.similar to what we decided on the earlier question of the timing of stanley insider status,we conclude that the insolvency issue only applies to preferential transfers under section b.we explain.
the language in section regarding fraudulent transfers is clear that there are different ways in which such transfers can occur.one alternative is that a transfer have been made when the debtor was insolvent.a b ii i.another alternative is the transfer be made to or for the benefit of an insider,or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of an insider,under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.id.a b ii iv.that latter provision applies.as we have discussed,stanley was an insider at the time the obligation was incurred.
trustee fees and costs stanley proof of claim 
for these reasons,the concluding issues raised by stanley regarding the need to set aside the order to pay the trustee fees and costs,and to allow stanley claim for three million dollars,must fail.his argument is based on the premise that we would agree with his arguments regarding the fraudulent transfer.we have not and thus reject these final points.
national union policy coverage for a loss.
as mentioned earlier,transtexas had executive and organization liability coverage through national union.stanley defense costs for the adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court were paid under the policy with a reservation of rights.on april,the judgment was entered avoiding the payments to stanley.on may,bank notified stanley that if he did not promptly pay the judgment,a garnishment would be filed against his insurance carriers.presumably,national union learned of this demand.on june,national union sued both stanley and bank,seeking a declaratory judgment that nothing was owed under the policy.
in granting summary judgment to national union,judge atlas held that the bankruptcy judgment against stanley did not constitute a loss under the policy.in the alternative,the judgment fell within the policy profit or advantage exclusion.on appeal,bank argues that both conclusions were error.after insisting in the bankruptcy that the transfers were preferential and fraudulent,bank argues now that stanley was nonetheless entitled to be paid.banks asserts that the defect found by the bankruptcy court was in the timing of transtexas payments to stanley and that transtexas intended to hinder,delay or defraud its creditors.there was not,bank argues,any holding that stanley was not owed the money.
the summary judgment was proper if the pleadings and evidence show that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that national union was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett.the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that we review de novo.allstate ins.disability servs.of the southwest,cir.the parties agree that texas substantive law applies in this diversity case.
under texas law,insurance polices are construed according to the same rules of construction used to interpret contracts.don.supply,onebeacon ins.the court primary concern is effectuating the parties expressed intent.id.if an insurance policy uses unambiguous language,it must be enforced as written.id.a policy exclusions and limitations are construed narrowly to avoid exclusion of coverage.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,willis,cir citing puckett fire ins.the insured bears the burden to prove that his claim is covered by the policy,and the insurer bears the burden to prove that an exclusion applies.fiess state farm lloyds,cir applying texas law.
stanley suffered a loss in the colloquial sense that the bankruptcy court required him to pay a judgment.however,the critical issue here is whether the repayment of the amounts received,which we have concluded were avoidable fraudulent transfers,constitute an insurable loss under the policy.a definition of the relevant term is in the policy.
loss means damages,settlements,judgments including interest on a covered judgment,defense cost and crisis loss however,loss other than defense costs shall not include 
matters which may be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy shall be construed.
this language is unambiguous and will be enforced as written.don.supply,at.accordingly,the bankruptcy judgment against stanley is not a loss within the meaning of this policy if the judgment is uninsurable under texas law.
in concluding that the judgment was not insurable,the district court held that it provided restitution.in one of the cases on which the court relied,humble oil and texaco sued nortex for drilling at a slant such that its wells were completed beneath land the plaintiffs leased.nortex oil gas harbor ins,no writ.the parties settled.nortex then made a demand on its insurer,harbor insurance company,for payment of nortex ultimate net loss.id.at.harbor denied the claim,and nortex brought suit in texas state court.id.
the texas court held that when nortex settled its claims with humble and texaco,it did not sustain a loss within the meaning of the insurance policy,because nortex was merely paying for oil that it had removed and sold from land leased to humble and texaco.id.at.the court further explained 
an insured under such a policy as we have here does not sustain a covered loss by restoring to its rightful owners that which the insured,having no right thereto,has inadvertently acquired the insurer did not contract to indemnify the insured for disgorging that to which it was not entitled in the first place,or for being deprived of profits to which it was not entitled.
