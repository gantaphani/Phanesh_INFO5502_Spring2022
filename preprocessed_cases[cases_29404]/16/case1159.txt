this is an insurance coverage dispute arising out of a motor vehicle accident involving a truck owned by sukhjit singh and a passenger vehicle driven by suzanne espenshade.at the time of the accident,the truck,used for hauling freight,was on the road principally for singh to seek its sale or.among the issues before us is whether a policy issued by underwriters at lloyd london underwriters covering singh truck,but excluding business uses,nonetheless insures this accident.we believe the answer is no,and therefore affirm the district court decision.we affirm as well the court determinations that singh expectation of business coverage can not unloose the policy unambiguous language to the contrary,and that pennsylvania public policy does not undermine in this case.
facts and procedural history 
the material facts are undisputed.at all times relevant to this litigation,singh was an independent trucker,or owner operator,who leased his tractor trailers to interstate motor carriers for the purpose of hauling freight.singh enjoyed a business relationship with bir transport company bir,an interstate trucking outfit and department of transportation authorized motor carrier,based upon a lease agreement.according to the agreement,singh leased a kenworth tractor to bir when bir required a tractor truck to haul freight.
as of the date of the accident,two relevant insurance policies were in effect.canal insurance company canal insured bir through a commercial trucking liability policy,providing indemnity and defense to bir for liabilities arising from the operation of vehicles specifically noted in the canal policy and used for bir business purposes.bir identified the tractor as an insured vehicle subject to the terms of the canal commercial trucking liability policy.in addition,singh was covered by a liability policy with underwriters that also identified the tractor as an insured vehicle.under the terms of that policy,certain uses of the tractor,including business uses,were excluded from coverage.
on april,singh completed an interstate hauling operation for bir with his tractor.four days later,on april,he hired a third party to drive the tractor and its empty trailer from harrisburg,pennsylvania,to a kenworth truck dealership in chester,pennsylvania,in order to attempt a sale or for a new tractor.although bir was made aware of the plan to go to the dealership,it is undisputed bir did not dispatch the tractor.in the event a hauling load from bir became available in the chester area,however,singh directed his driver to make the trip with an empty trailer attached.
en route to the dealership,singh truck collided with a vehicle owned and driven by espenshade.as a result of the accident,espenshade filed a lawsuit in philadelphia,pennsylvania,against all potential tortfeasors.underwriters expressly refused either to defend the defendants or to indemnify canal in the state action on the ground that the use of the tractor on the day of the accident did not fall under the provisions of its liability policy.canal,on the other hand,defended and indemnified singh,his driver,and bir in the lawsuit.ultimately,canal settled the espenshade suit,agreeing to pay compensation in exchange for full liability releases for all three defendants.it is undisputed that canal incurred an additional in litigation expenses to resolve the matter,resulting in a total indemnification and defense cost of.

iii.merits 
ambiguity of underwriters business use exclusionary language 
canal contends underwriters business use exclusionary language,which prohibits any use of the covered vehicle that promotes the business purposes of the insured,is sufficiently ambiguous to merit an interpretation in favor of coverage.underwriters,on the other hand,maintains that its business use exception is unambiguous and coverage was properly denied.
it is uncontested underwriters policy names singh as the insured and lists the tractor as a covered vehicle.the policy,however,excludes from coverage certain business uses.exclusion specifically provides that the policy does not insure 
a covered automobile while it is engaged in business use,such as proceeding to a new location,pursuant to the request,direction,control dispatch of any person or entity other than the insured,or complying with any term of a presently effective,written lease with a motor carrier.
the policy also excludes insurance for a covered automobile while used in the course and scope of the commercial business of the insured,business use.under the policy,that 
includes,but is not limited to,any use of the covered auto that promotes the business purposes of the insured or the purposes of a written,permanent lease that the insured has signed with a motor carrier such as hauling a load for the motor carrier,being under the request,direction,control dispatch to haul a load for the motor carrier with a pick up of a load,laying over on the road on the way to pick up a load or traveling for the purposes of repairing or maintaining the covered auto.the foregoing examples of business use are illustrative and.
emphasis added.thus,if at the time of the accident,singh tractor was engaged in an activity promot ing singh business purposes,underwriters business uses exclusion applies and coverage could be denied.
the legal axioms governing insurance policy interpretation are well settled in pennsylvania.where an insurer relies on a policy exclusion as the basis for its denial of coverage and refusal to defend,the insurer has asserted an affirmative defense and,accordingly,bears the burden of proving such defense.madison constr.harleysville mut.ins.the goal of interpreting an insurance policy,like the goal of interpreting any other contract,is to determine the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the policy.
the task of interpreting an insurance contract is generally performed by a court rather than by a jury.the goal of that task is,of course,to ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written instrument.where a provision of a policy is ambiguous,the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer,the drafter of the agreement.where,however,the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous,a court is required to give effect to that language.

as stated above,this controversy turns on whether the phrase any use of the covered auto that promotes the business purposes of the i nsured applies unambiguously to singh use of the tractor at the time of the accident.underwriters policy does not provide specific examples of activities that would promote singh business purposes.where critical terms are left undefined in a policy,pennsylvania case law instructs that

since singh is the insured,engaged in the business of leasing tractors,and further since the act of traveling from harrisburg to chester contribute d to the growth or prosperity of or further ed,promote d,the business purposes of singh leasing business,the losses resulting from the accident fall within the exclusion of the underwriters policy.

canal,however,does not contend it was unreasonable for the district court to interpret the plain meaning of business purposes to include singh desire to trade or sell the tractor.see aplt.br.at.rather,it maintains that underwriters business use exception relating to acts promoting the business purposes of the insured is overly broad and ambiguous.this is because the exception can be reasonably construed to mean that only acts related to or furthering the business of a commercial carrier such as bir are subject to exclusion not acts merely related to selling or trading the tractor.id.in other words,traveling to negotiate a possible sale or trade of a vehicle is not business use since it does not relate to a activity and is not maintenance or repair of the vehicle.aplt.br.at.thus,the question we must resolve is whether canal alternative interpretation of underwriters business use exclusion renders the exception ambiguous with regard to the facts of this case.complicating this determination is the absence of controlling state precedent.

canal contends that 
singh is an independent interstate truck driver his business is driving a commercial to transport the goods of on behalf of a commercial carrier.singh does not make his living leasing vehicles as a dealership or rental agency might.also,rather than functioning as a salaried employee of bir and using a tractor,singh chose to purchase his own tractor and enter into a leasing arrangement with bir whereby singh would be responsible for his own vehicle presumably in return for a greater share of the profit.
aplt.br.at.accordingly,an understanding of singh business reveals it is not so clear that the act of driving the tractor to a dealership in order to trade or otherwise negotiate a sale unambiguously promotes the business purposes of singh.id.
the weight of relevant authority does not support canal reasoning.business use and business pursuits exclusions are standard clauses in many insurance policies,including homeowners,personal umbrella,and other general liability policies.see generally construction and application of business pursuits exclusion provision in general liability policy,west.in a typical policy,the insurer states that personal liability coverage shall not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of business pursuits of any insured except activities therein which are ordinarily incident to nonbusiness pursuits.see,bullock pariser.the purpose of a business pursuits exclusion is to help the insurer keep premiums at a reasonable level by eliminating a type of coverage that normally requires specialized underwriting and rating,is not essential to most purchasers of the policy,and is provided by other insurance contracts a business owner is likely to have.avoiding the business pursuits activity as not business pursuit.proof of facts west see also rykill franklin fire ins,stating i t is a matter of common knowledge that the premium rate of insurance upon automobiles used for commercial purposes is higher than on cars used for pleasure.the obvious reason for this is the increased hazard.
the superior court of pennsylvania has interpreted the boilerplate business pursuits language in the context of a homeowners insurance policy.in bullock,the plaintiff was bitten by a dog at the defendants home,where they conducted a business partnership known as kiddie castle.the pennsylvania insurance guaranty association piga contended that the dog bite incident was covered by the separate homeowners policies of the defendants.these homeowners policies had been issued by two separate insurance companies.it was agreed that both policies contained an exclusion for bodily injury or property damage arising out of business pursuits of any insured except activities therein which are ordinarily incident to activities.at.the superior court affirmed the trial court finding that the business pursuits exclusion applied to the dog bite incident because the liability in this case arose from a strictly business related endeavor id.at quoting bullock pariser.
the court expressly rejected piga argument that,because the child care business can operate profitably with or without a guard dog,the purchase and maintenance of a guard dog is not,itself,a business pursuit,stating that 
w e find this argument to be entirely unconvincing.the fact that a business might continue to make a profit in the absence of any number of activities conducted in furtherance of its interests does not prevent such activities from being business pursuits.for example,a retail store may make a profit while employing only one salesperson,yet the hiring of a second salesperson is clearly a business pursuit.
id.at.on the basis of this reasoning,the court held that the defendants need not be in the security dog business in order for the business pursuits exclusion of their homeowner policies to apply.
here canal contends that,because singh is neither in the truck leasing business though in fact he undoubtedly is nor the truck sales business which he undoubtedly is not,the business uses exception can not apply to his attempt to sell or trade the tractor.the superior court of pennsylvania,however,instructs that singh need not be in either the truck leasing or truck sales business in order for the business use exclusion to apply.it is implicit in the language of bullock that a business pursuits clause applies where the liability arises from a endeavor and the activity in question is conducted in furtherance of the business interests id.at.similarly,underwriters business uses exception applies where the liability arises from any business use and the activity at issue promotes the business purposes of the insured.
in this case,these criteria are satisfied.the alleged liability arose from an possible trade or sale of a commercial was an exclusively activity.singh himself testified that the sole purpose of the trade or sale of the tractor was to further or promote his business interests see sun alliance ins.of puerto rico soto,cir relying on the testimony of an insured in order to determine the coverage question against him.
beyond bullock,several decisions interpreting business pursuits exclusions under pennsylvania law in contexts counsel in favor of the conclusion that underwriters business use exclusion is unambiguous and applies here.one such case is travelers indem.fantozzi.there,the insured parents and their minor son were sued after the son sexually molested a child whom the parents were babysitting.the parents homeowner policy excluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of the business pursuits of any insured except those of a clerical office employee.id.at.the policy defined business to include trade,business or occupation.id.at.in coming to its determination that the business pursuits exclusion was unambiguous,id.citing myrtil hartford fire ins,finding the same language clearly not ambiguous,the court explained that where the applicability of a business pursuits exception is at issue in the third circuit,an activity encompassed within that exclusion requires two elements.
the first is continuity,or customary engagement in the activity.the second,profit motive,may be shown by such activity as a means of livelihood,a means of earning a living,procuring subsistence or profit,commercial transactions or engagements.
sun alliance ins,at.the travelers court concluded that the continuity element was clearly satisfied the defendant parents took care of the victim child on a daily basis over the course of more than four years.thus,the time of the babysitting services was neither irregular nor of limited duration.travelers indem.at.because the defendant parents agreed to babysit on a basis as a means of gaining temporary income while the defendant dad was laid off from his customary job and there was no dispute that the defendants were motivated by a desire for compensation,the court further held that the babysitting services satisfied the profit motive element of the business pursuits exclusion.id.as a result,the homeowner policy did not provide coverage for claims made by the victim child family in the underlying tort action.
underwriters liability policy similarly precludes coverage here.singh admitted purpose in trading or selling the tractor was the furtherance of his personally owned and operated commercial trucks to motor carriers.moreover,singh testified that he had operated that business on a continuous basis for approximately ten years.because singh activity satisfies both prongs of the business pursuits exclusion motive and policy precludes coverage to singh for claims made while he was engaged in that activity.
reasonable expectations of the insured 
canal further argues that the great weight of authority in pennsylvania strongly favors a conclusion that the pennsylvania supreme court would in this case permit the reasonable expectations of the insured to be relied on to determine whether facially unclear insurance policy language is ambiguous,and further find such ambiguity to preclude exclusion and favor coverage of singh.at.specifically,canal claims that singh reasonably expected the business use exclusion to apply only to acts related to or furthering the business of a commercial carrier,not to acts related to selling or trading the tractor.id.at.because underwriters construction of its exclusionary language is contrary to the reasonable expectations of the insured,canal contends that the language is ambiguous and should be interpreted in favor of singh.relying on matcon diamond pennsylvania ins,the district court here disagreed,explaining that it is well settled in pennsylvania that the reasonable expectations doctrine does not provide relief where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous 
canal also argues that underwriters position is precluded by the doctrine of reasonable expectations of the insured as that doctrine has developed under pennsylvania law.the court disagrees.the supreme court of pennsylvania has held that the polestar for determining the parties intent is the language of the policy itself.to that end,the superior court of pennsylvania has noted that,generally,courts can not invoke the reasonable expectation doctrine to create an ambiguity where the policy itself is unambiguous.as recognized by the matcon court,the highest court in pennsylvania has limited the argument that the reasonable expectations of the insured trump the clear and unambiguous language of a policy to two occasions protecting insureds from policy terms which are not readily apparent and protecting insureds from deception by insurance agents.
canal ins,d at internal citations omitted.the court expressly declined canal invitation to look beyond the plain and unambiguous language of the policy in order to scrutinize what singh expectations may have been regarding coverage because canal advanced no argument that underwriters policy terms were not readily apparent or that there was deception by the insurance agents.id.at.
our court recently weighed in on the pennsylvania reasonable expectations doctrine,stating that 
pennsylvania case law dictates that the proper focus for determining issues of insurance coverage is the reasonable expectations of the insured.in most cases,the language of the insurance policy will provide the best indication of the content of the parties reasonable expectations.courts,however,must examine the totality of the insurance transaction involved to ascertain the reasonable expectations of the insured.as a result,even the most clearly written exclusion will not bind the insured where the insurer or its agent has created in the insured a reasonable expectation of coverage.however,this aspect of the doctrine is only applied in very limited circumstances to protect insureds from policy terms not readily apparent and from insurer deception.absent sufficient justification,however,an insured may not complain that his or her reasonable expectations were frustrated by policy limitations that are clear and unambiguous.
liberty mut.ins.treesdale,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.in this context,the district court refusal to look beyond the plain meaning of the unambiguous exclusionary language to singh reasonable expectations is consistent with the interpretation of pennsylvania case law in our circuit.
public policy considerations 
canal further argues that underwriters exclusionary language violates pennsylvania public policy ensuring adequate insurance is available to parties injured in motor vehicle accidents because enormous gaps between and commercial liabili
