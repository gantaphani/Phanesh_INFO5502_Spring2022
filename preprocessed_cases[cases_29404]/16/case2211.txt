this case arose out of the termination of a longstanding agreement between watkins,the plaintiff below,and iams,the defendant,under which watkins distributed iams products in michigan.in summary,watkins alleges that iams made parol representations to watkins that if it became an exclusive iams distributor,iams would make it the exclusive iams distributor in a territory in michigan when iams moved to an exclusive territory distribution system.watkins alleges that it relied on those representations to its detriment,but that iams terminated its distributorship agreement and gave an exclusive contract to a competing distributor.the district court dismissed watkins claim under the michigan franchise investment law pursuant to.b and granted summary judgment on its claims under the clayton act,the robinson patman act,and the sherman act,and on its common law claims we affirm the judgment.
iams is in the business of manufacturing and selling pet foods.for many years,watkins was a distributor of iams products in michigan.in or,iams began to require watkins as well as its other distributors to sign yearly written distributorship agreements.until,watkins was the sole distributor of iams products in michigan,but in,wolverton,also began selling iams products in the state 
in,iams began offering its distributors a discount on its products in return for a commitment from the distributors to sell iams products exclusively.the discount was significant,given the low profit margins customary in the business.watkins alleges that in,iams promised it that if it became an exclusive iams distributor,iams would grant it an exclusive sales territory in michigan when iams changed to a distribution system of exclusive territories.watkins claims that it became an exclusive distributor in reliance on this promise.it entered into an exclusivity agreement in july and annually thereafter through.nevertheless,iams notified watkins in september,that it would not renew its distributorship contract,and the contract expired,in accordance with its terms,on january.iams subsequently entered into an exclusive distribution contract in michigan with wolverton.
the contract of january,between iams and watkins contains the following provisions

discussion 
choice of law 
the parties agree that ohio law governs the claims for promissory estoppel and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.watkins argues that michigan law governs its fraud claim and that the public policy of michigan preserves its statutory claim under the michigan franchise investment law mfil despite the choice of law provision in the contract.iams argues that the district court properly applied ohio law to the fraud claim and that because the parties chose ohio law to govern their agreement,watkins can not prevail on its michigan statutory claim.
we review choice of law rulings de novo.northland ins.guardsman,cir.because the case was transferred from the eastern district of michigan to the southern district of ohio pursuant to a,we apply the choice of law rules of michigan,the forum of the transferring court.northland,supra at.for the following reasons,we hold that the district court did not err in applying ohio law to the fraud claim.we need not decide the choice of law problem presented by the mfil claim,because we hold,infra,that even if the choice of law clause does not bar the mfil claim,the district court did not err in dismissing the claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
under michigan law,a tort claim is governed by the law of the forum unless a rational reason exists to displace it.olmstead anderson.in imaging fin.servs,serv d cbc.lexis,wl cir,an unpublished opinion,we held that under michigan law,fraud is a tort claim,and that when an injury occurs in michigan to a michigan company,michigan law would govern the claim despite a choice of law clause.id.at.imaging fin.servs.relied on allmand assocs.hercules.but in allmand,the court applied michigan law not only because the effects of the tort were felt in michigan,but also because the parties agree d that michigan law applies.id.at.in the instant case,the parties do not so agree.moreover,in allmand,id.at,and imaging fin,supra at,the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations were misrepresentations of fact that induced the plaintiff to enter a contract.in the instant case,on the other hand,the fraud alleged is promissory fraud watkins alleges that iams made promises of future performance that it did not intend to keep.the distinction between such a claim and a claim for breach of contract is so slight that the parties agreement that ohio law would govern their agreement,their contract,is a sufficient reason to displace the law of michigan and apply ohio law to watkins fraud claim.therefore,we conclude that the court did not err by applying ohio law to the claim.
applicability of the uniform commercial code 
the case appears to have been argued on the assumption that the contract is a contract for the sale of goods within the scope of article of the uniform commercial code.we agree with the assumption.whether the contract is a sales contract is of some importance in this case,because the parol evidence rule governing commercial contracts,codified at ohio,differs from the common law rule,and because the significance of watkins allegations that iams made parol representations after execution of the written contract depends on the application of ohio b,a provision in derogation of the common law that governs oral modification or recission of written commercial contracts.
