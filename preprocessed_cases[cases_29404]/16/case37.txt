in this diversity action,arabian support services asasco,a saudi arabian business,seeks compensation for assisting textron systems corporation in its efforts,over a number of years,to complete a deal to sell sensor fuzed weapons sfws to the saudi government.asasco claims that textron failed to abide by a promise to supplement the modest fees paid under the parties written consulting agreements through an offset arrangement linked to the weapons sale the district court granted summary judgment for textron on all of asasco claims after allowing limited discovery and declining to provide asasco an opportunity to amend its complaint.
although we agree that asasco contract and tort claims are not viable,we conclude that the district court erroneously dismissed asasco chapter misrepresentation claim based solely on the failure of the contract claim.see.laws ann.ch.textron offers no persuasive alternative rationale to support the court ruling.hence,asasco is entitled to proceed with its claim that textron engaged in an unfair business practice by procuring asasco agreement to consulting contracts with the promise of a future offset benefit and then,after successfully signing the weapons deal,disclaiming any additional financial obligation to the saudi company.accordingly,we vacate the summary judgment in part and remand for further proceedings on asasco misrepresentation theory.
we will not review in full the parties lengthy relationship,which developed largely through interactions between mansour,asasco president,and avedis boyamian,textron director of middle east business development.as the history is well known to both parties,we choose here to recount only those facts pertinent to our decision.
a.the consulting agreements 
for years from march through august textron and asasco signed successive consulting contracts providing asasco with a monthly retainer of.beginning september,the consulting contract was extended in increments of one to three months on a basis.that arrangement continued for a year,until a new agreement was signed that set asasco monthly retainer at.the fee remained in place through subsequent contract extensions until august,at which point textron terminated the consulting arrangement.in the email sent on august notifying asasco that textron had elected to end the relationship,the company spokesperson stated that textron was not aware of any outstanding obligations between the parties.
each of the consulting contracts between and contained a provision stating that the parties agreed that any and all services rendered by consultant to the company shall be deemed to have been given pursuant to this agreement and no additional payments other than for approved travel expenses shall be due to or paid to consultant.however,the agreement for the first time contained an expanded version of this statement,providing that the specified compensation was the exclusive remuneration to be paid by the company for the services provide d by consultant.the agreement also featured an integration provision 
this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings,written or oral.each party hereby waives the right to assert any claim against the other,its employees,customers or assigns,based on any oral representations,statement,promise or agreement whether made before or after the date of this agreement.
b.the offset dialogue 
through the years of their consulting relationship,beginning no later than may textron and asasco regularly discussed the opportunity for additional compensation to asasco through its involvement in offset projects that were an anticipated requirement of the saudi weapons deal.the record also contains internal textron emails indicating that asasco anticipated offset activity and compensation would be independent of the consulting agreement.this correspondence includes a draft offset services agreement prepared by textron in june,an email from boyamian to that month stating that textron was in the process of getting the offset provider agreement approved,and,on the same day,an internal textron email asking that two books be started for the company business with asasco one for a new offset agreement with asasco,and one for a renewal of the consultant agreement 
textron and asasco never entered into a written offset agreement.instead,in february,textron and blenheim capital partners limited signed an offset services agreement osa that permitted but did not require blenheim to subcontract with asasco although no other subcontractor could be used without textron prior written consent.six months later,in an internal email dated september,boyamian told colleagues at textron that,effective september,textron stopped paying asasco the monthly consultancy fee because,textron through blenheim,an offset service provider company based in uk,has an offset service providing agreement with asasco for textron business offset requirements in saudi arabia.the email also reported that a renewal of asasco consulting agreement was in the works,with a nominal monthly fee of.boyamian forwarded this email to.
the association was further formalized in april,when blenheim and asasco entered into a subcontracting agreement under which asasco was entitled to percent of the fees paid by textron to blenheim under the osa.the contract anticipated that these fees would be deposited into an escrow account,which was to be created as soon as practicable,and,indeed,asasco right to payment under that contract was contingent on the full amount of the applicable fee under the offset services agreement being paid to the escrow account.although textron agreement with blenheim did not by its terms provide for an escrow account,boyamian appeared to believe that such an account would exist.in a november email to,boyamian stated his understanding that textron will be paying of the contract value to the escrow account for offset.so far as it appears from the record,no escrow account was ever created.
from the time of blenheim appearance on the scene in through early,all three businesses textron,asasco,and blenheim were involved in discussions about offset projects.among the later emails exchanged was one sent to on march,from steven cahall of blenheim,which reviewed the possible fee arrangements among textron,blenheim,and asasco depending upon whether textron was required to make offset investments the dialogue formally ended in november of that year,however,when textron sent blenheim a letter stating that the companies were mutually ending the osa by its terms,the agreement also terminated when the osa terminated.asasco claims that it was not told,and did not know,that textron and blenheim had ended the osa until september.
c.the weapons deal 
on january,roughly a month after textron sent blenheim the termination letter,boyamian sent an email reporting that saudi officials had,on december,signed a letter of offer and acceptance loa essentially a statement of intent to make a deal as a christmas gift to us.boyamian concluded his message with congratulations to all of us.through,allegedly without knowledge that its subcontract with blenheim had ended upon termination of the osa,asasco continued to work with textron to set up meetings with saudi government officials.the correspondence between the two companies included reference to the offset requirement.in an email to boyamian in november,noted an effort to set up a meeting for textron chairman with the saudi minister of economy and planning,who is also the head of the saudi economic offset which textron might want to explore with the minister.
textron and saudi arabia finalized an agreement for the weapons deal in late august.about a week later,asasco received the notification that textron was terminating their consulting relationship.in a deposition conducted on december,a textron representative testified that,as of that date,the company had not yet reached an offset agreement with the saudi arabian government,but he reported that saudi officials had confirmed that such an agreement was required
