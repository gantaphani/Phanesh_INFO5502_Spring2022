this case presents the legal issue whether the undertaking of halliburton energy services,halliburton to indemnify the well owner llog exploration company llog in this case included an obligation by halliburton to reimburse llog for sums llog was required to pay under a separate contract to a third party,falcon drilling usa,falcon.based on our case law and the language of the indemnity provisions included in the relevant contracts,we answer this question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the district court.
llog develops and operates oil and gas properties,and was provided contractual liability insurance coverage for operation of its wells by paul.in march of,llog contracted with falcon to provide a drill barge to drill an llog well off the coast of venice,louisiana.the contract between llog and falcon drilling contract provided that llog would hold falcon harmless inter alia for any personal injury claims asserted against falcon by llog employees or invitees.the drilling contract also required that llog provide a number of services usually provided by third parties required to drill the well.relatedly,llog and halliburton entered into a master service contract service contract for the performance of some of those services.the service contract required halliburton to indemnify llog and its invitees,which included falcon,against claims by halliburton employees 
gilbert goldman,a halliburton engineer and llog invitee,was injured at the well site onboard the falcon barge when it capsized in march of.goldman sued llog and falcon to recover damages for those injuries,and falcon demanded that llog defend and indemnify falcon for this claim pursuant to the drilling contract.llog initially rejected falcon demand and also requested that halliburton defend and indemnify llog against goldman claims pursuant to the indemnity provisions of the service contract.halliburton expressed some doubt about the scope of the indemnity provision,but in two separate letters in september and october of,halliburton counsel reaffirmed that halliburton would undertake the defense of llog in accordance with the agreement terms,and that it would defend and indemnify llog in this lawsuit as per the contract.
in january of,falcon instituted a limitation of liability proceeding in the eastern district of louisiana,and included a contractual indemnity claim against llog and paul.halliburton answered on behalf of llog,denying responsibility on falcon contractual indemnity claim.
falcon settled goldman claims in january for,and sought reimbursement from llog and paul under the indemnity provisions of the drilling contract.paul and llog withdrew their earlier denial of liability and reimbursed falcon the paid to goldman after llog and paul agreed to reimburse falcon,paul made demand under the terms of the service contract for halliburton to pay the settlement sum on behalf of llog to falcon.halliburton rejected that demand,asserting that the service contract did not obligate halliburton to indemnify llog against falcon contractual claims.paul then filed suit against halliburton seeking reimbursement of the settlement on the basis that halliburton was contractually obligated to indemnify llog and llog invitees,including falcon,for sums paid on account of injuries to halliburton employees 
both halliburton and paul filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion filed by halliburton and denied paul motion.the district court observed that the service contract did not expressly require halliburton to indemnify llog against third party contract liability.because halliburton did not expressly agree to indemnify llog for contractual claims,the district court concluded that halliburton was not responsible for the defense or indemnity obligations assumed by llog in its separate contracts with third parties.this appeal followed.
the parties agree that the interpretation of the contract at issue in this case is governed by general maritime law.a district court grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.see gowesky singing river hospital systems,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.pro.
the contractual relationship between llog and halliburton is governed by two documents the service contract,and the service contract rider.the service contract begins by defining the parties 
this contract,made and entered into on the above date by and between llog exploration company hereinafter referred to as llog and halliburton company,its divisions halliburton service and halliburton reservoir services,and its subsidiaries halliburton logging service,and otis engineering company hereinafter referred to as contractor.
the indemnity provision,however,begins by stating that the references to llog in that section shall include certain other parties.paragraph a provides 
for the purposes of this section any reference to llog shall include llog and any or all of llog who wholly or partially bear the cost of operations hereunder and any or all agents,directors,officers,employees or invitees of llog or such,or any or all of such parties.
although paragraph a was not modified by the rider,the remainder of the indemnity provision was replaced with revised and additional language.paragraph of the rider provides,in pertinent part 
section.imdemnity,paragraphs b and c shall be amended and paragraphs d,e,f,g,h and i added to read 
b contractor shall be responsible,and llog shall never be liable,for property damage or personal injury to or death of contractor employees or the employees of contractor subcontractors and contractor agrees to indemnify and hold llog harmless against any and all such claims,demands or suits which may be brought against llog by any such party,or the legal representative or successor of any such employee,in anywise arising out of or incident to the work to be performed under this contract by contractor,or contractor subcontractors,irrespective of whether such claims,demands,or suits are based on the relationship of master and servant,third party,or otherwise,the unseaworthiness or unairworthiness of vessels or craft,or the negligence or strict liability,in whole or in part,of llog.
paul and llog argue that this provision obligates halliburton to indemnify llog for sums llog paid pursuant to its contractual indemnity obligations to falcon.according to paul,this is required because llog payment was occasioned by the injury to goldman,a halliburton employee,and llog required payment to an llog invitee within the meaning of paragraph a.halliburton does not dispute falcon invitee status,but instead argues that the indemnity provision does not provide express notice that halliburton would be obligated to indemnify llog against indemnity claims owed as a result of llog contracts 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of halliburton,relying on our decisions in foreman exxon and corbitt diamond drilling,both of which held that express notice is required where a party seeks to shift his contractual liability to indemnify a third party,and that contractual language creating an indemnity obligation for injury to or death or illness of persons gave notice only of claims based on tortious,not contractual,injuries.foreman exxon,cir corbitt diamond drilling,cir because the service contract required indemnification for property damage or personal injury to or death of halliburton employees,and does not specifically include liability arising from contract,the district court found that the service contract did not require halliburton to indemnify llog against falcon claims,despite the fact that falcon claims were,in turn,based on a personal injury to a halliburton employee.
in addition to our decisions in foreman and corbitt,we have addressed the legal issue presented in today case on at least four occasions.see sumrall ensco offshore,cir campbell sonat offshore drilling,cir mills zapata drilling,cir,overruled on other grounds,kelly lee old fashioned hamburgers,ci
