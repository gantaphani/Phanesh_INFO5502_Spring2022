the panel opinion issued august,is withdrawn and the following opinion is substituted in its place.
this is an appeal from a trial stemming from injuries sustained by seth becker seth while he was aboard an oil rig in the gulf of mexico.after a bench trial,the district court held liable for seth injuries and liable for seth injuries.the court also held that baker was obligated to fully indemnify tidewater for any liability for its negligence resulting in an injury to seth.baker appeals the district court denials of summary judgment as well as the court final judgment on issues of apportionment of fault and indemnity.seth also appeals the district court apportionment of fault and its findings concerning gross negligence.based on the following analysis,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
seth was injured while working as a summer intern for baker as part of the crew of the republic tide the republic tide,a boat outfitted for services,in june.baker was using the republic tide pursuant to a contract with the boat owner,tidewater.
the injury occurred while the republic tide crew was performing services on the rig the rig,an oil rig owned by cliffs drilling and operated by falcon collectively,falcon in the gulf of mexico.the job required the republic tide crew to unspool a coiled steel hose from the boat stern,extend it to the rig,and attach it to the rig wellhead.while the steel hose was extended,the republic tide movements caused the hose to whip across the rig deck.to help keep the hose in place,baker employees ran it through a,apparatus called the blue shoe.the republic tide captains,captain givens and captain lachney,employees of tidewater,also sought to keep the hose in place by minimizing the republic tide movements relative to the rig.crew members tied off the boat stern to the rig with two lines one starboard and one port,and the captains used the boat bow thruster to maintain position against the gulf of mexico current.the crew kept the republic tide anchor raised because the anchor windlass had a hydraulic oil leak which was discovered by tidewater when it pulled up to the rig on the day of the incident.
while seth was aboard the rig,the republic tide bow thruster failed.this failure created an emergency because,without the thruster,the republic tide could not maintain its bow position against the current.the republic tide captain on duty,captain lachney,contacted the rig and reported that the thruster had failed.moments later,the current caused the mooring line to break.the republic tide,still connected by the mooring line and the slack steel hose,and still being pushed starboard,would collide with the oil rig without intervention.
captain lachney instructed baker crew members aboard the boat to disconnect the steel hose from the reel assembly that attached the hose to the boat.the reel assembly contained a mechanism.the reel malfunctioned due to modifications made to the system and began to lock up.the quick disconnect button did not release the hose and the employees were unable to move the reel manually.consequently,the crew was unable to disconnect the hose.
captain lachney again contacted the rig.he reported that the hose would need to be disconnected from the rig wellhead,and baker supervisor aboard the rig received this message.the supervisor ordered three baker employees,including seth,to the rig deck to disconnect the hose.
meanwhile,the gulf current continued to push the republic tide toward the rig.captain lachney,fearing impact with the rig,decided to break the mooring line.he did not,however,contact the rig before taking this action baker crew members on the rig deck were unaware that the steel hose was about to be pulled taut.captain lachney powered the boat engines and pulled away from the rig.
seth was standing in the bend of the steel hose when the republic tide movement snapped the hose taut,pinning seth.the hose cut through seth legs,amputating one leg and nearly amputating the other.he lost between eight and nine pints of blood before being evacuated.doctors later had to amputate the second leg below the knee.seth,years old at the time of the accident,now suffers from severe health problems which will require ongoing treatment,counseling,and medication for the remainder of his life.
seth sued baker,tidewater,and falcon under the jones act,the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,and general maritime law.a jury trial was held in july,concluding in a verdict finding seth to be a jones act seaman and awarding him damage.the jury apportioned fault among the defendants,assigning each a percentage.on appeal,this court reversed the jury finding and held seth to be a longshoreman,set aside liability and damage findings,and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings under the lhwca.becker tidewater,cir becker i.
on remand,the district court granted seth leave to amend his complaint to request a bench trial for his remaining claims under federal rule of civil procedure h.baker filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the district court decision to hold a bench trial rather than a jury trial,which was accepted by this court.on appeal,the district court ruling was affirmed,and the case was remanded a second time for a bench trial.becker tidewater,cir becker ii.
a limited second trial was held by the district court as an admiralty action,without a jury,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure h.before the trial on remand,baker and seth entered into a mary carter agreement baker gave seth million dollars in exchange for an agreement to share any net recovery he may have against tidewater on the basis of to baker and to seth.the district court denied all of baker motions for summary judgment that attempted to invalidate the reciprocal indemnity agreement.the court ultimately awarded seth almost million damages against baker and tidewater under the lhwca.the court held that baker,as of the boat,was liable for seth injuries and tidewater,as owner of the boat,was liable.falcon was held free from fault and liability.the court held that under the reciprocal indemnity agreement in the contract between baker and tidewater,baker was obligated to fully indemnify tidewater for any liability for seth injuries.baker and seth timely appealed the judgment of the district court.

the maritime contract entered into by tidewater and baker contained reciprocal indemnity provisions,with tidewater being responsible for injuries to tidewater employees,and baker being responsible for injuries to baker employees.on appeal,baker presents a number of arguments asserting that the district court erred in holding that baker was obligated to indemnify tidewater fully for any liability for seth injuries under this agreement.based on the following analyses,we hold that the district court did not err in holding that the reciprocal indemnity agreement between baker and tidewater obligates baker to indemnify tidewater fully for seth injuries.
first,baker appeals the district court ruling that the reciprocal indemnity agreement entered into by baker and tidewater was valid under of the lhwca.b.section b of the lhwca provides that agreements for an employer to indemnify a vessel from injuries to a longshoreman are void.id.however,agreements between employer and vessel are not void when a longshoreman is entitled to lhwca relief by virtue of the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla.b c.the question is whether seth,who was a longshoreman at the time of the incident is covered by b of ocsla.baker argues that seth is not covered because he does not satisfy the situs test and is thus not covered under b.we find this argument unavailing.
section b of ocsla extends the lhwca benefits to employees disabled or killed as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf for the purposes of exploring for or developing the natural resources of the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf.mills director,cir en banc quoting b.under this subsection,with two exceptions,all employees suffering injury or death on the outer continental shelf are covered by the lhwca if they are engaged in exploring for or developing natural resources.the only exceptions,not applicable here,are for masters or members of a crew of a vessel or employees of the united states.b.the only status requirement is that the worker be engaged in exploration or production of minerals,and the only situs requirement is that the worker be injured on the outer continental shelf.see mills,at.because seth was engaged in mineral exploration,was a,and was injured on the outer continental shelf while employed by an employer engaged in mineral production,he is covered under the lhwca 
baker and seth also contend that the indemnity provision is invalid because they allege that tidewater committed gross negligence.it is undisputed that baker escapes indemnity if tidewater actions leading to seth injuries were grossly negligent.see houston exploration halliburton energy,cir noting that a waiver of liability for gross negligence is void.the district court found that tidewater actions were negligent but not grossly negligent.
a finding that a party is negligent or grossly negligent is a finding of fact and must stand unless clearly erroneous.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.footnote omitted.this court has defined gross negligence as willful,wanton and reckless conduct that falls between intent to do wrong and ordinary negligence.id.interpreting louisiana law.mere inadvertence or honest mistake does not amount to gross negligence.see also todd shipyards turbine,cir gross negligence,which will invalidate an exemption from liability has been defined as harm willfully inflicted or caused by gross or wanton negligence.citation omitted.
baker and seth argue that tidewater actions,considered as a whole,were grossly negligent.the district court found that tidewater most egregious conduct was moving the republic tide without warning.baker and seth characterize this failure to warn as gross negligence because tidewater captain requested crew aboard the rig to disconnect the steel hose and knew that moving the republic tide would cause the hose to move across the rig deck.based on the record,the failure to warn was mere inadvertence and not gross negligence.the situation was an emergency,and the captain needed to act quickly.he moved the republic tide,but only to avoid a collision with the rig.the captain actions thus reflect a concern for safety,rather than a reckless disregard for safety.
baker and seth also contend that tidewater was grossly negligent in failing to warn the rig crew that the republic tide would be unanchored,but the record reflects that baker employees were aware the anchor was raised and,in any event,proceeding with such a job while unanchored was not unusual.baker and seth contend that tidewater knew the bow thruster was faulty when tidewater decided to rely on it instead of the republic tide anchor,but three tidewater employees and three baker employees testified that the republic tide experienced no problems prior to the accident one individual testified that a tidewater employee communicated with the rig about a problem but reported that the problem had been resolved and the testimony is unclear as to whether the problem mentioned was recent or occurred before the bow thruster had been replaced six months earlier.the district court did not commit clear error in finding that tidewater was not grossly negligent there is substantial evidence to support the holding that tidewater was merely negligent,and not grossly negligent,under the circumstances presented 
baker contends that because tidewater breached the contract,the indemnity provision contained therein was rendered void baker cites marquette transportation louisiana machinery,cir,for the proposition that a breach of a contract containing an indemnity agreement serves to invalidate the indemnity agreement.however the court in marquette,after finding that the indemnity agreement at issue was enforceable,states only that if the party had been found to be in breach of those warranties,perhaps our application of the indemnity clause would be different.at.marquette does not hold that breach of a contract necessitates invalidation of an indemnity agreement included therein.even if the indemnity agreement could be invalidated by tidewater breach of the contract,the district court did not err in holding that tidewater did not breach the contract.the contract required tidewater to deliver to baker a boat that was 
properly equipped and in every respect seaworthy and in good running order and in every way fit and ready for baker use and for the employment intended,so far as the exercise of due diligence can make her and tidewater undertakes to so maintain the vessel during the period of service under this charter.
baker contends that tidewater breached this provision by delivering the republic tide in an unseaworthy condition.whether tidewater exercised due diligence in delivering and maintaining the republic tide in seaworthy condition is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.stevens towing,cir.unit a july.baker contends that the vessel was unseaworthy because the bow thruster and anchor windlass were faulty.the district court found that tidewater exercised due diligence to deliver and to maintain the republic tide in seaworthy condition.there was conflicting testimony concerning whether tidewater knew of any problem,and several tidewater employees testified that the republic tide had never experienced any previous issues with the.although tidewater did not have evidence of september or march inspections of its anchor mechanism as its procedures required,they had inspected the anchor in may before the june incident according to testimony of tidewater engineer.the record contains substantial evidence that tidewater did not know the bow thruster or anchor were faulty,and therefore,even if tidewater breach could invalidate the indemnity agreement,the district court did not clearly err in holding that tidewater did not commit a breach of contract.
baker also argues that even if the indemnity provision is upheld,it only obligates baker to indemnify tidewater for general damages.the interpretation of a contractual indemnity provision is a question of law,reviewed de novo.weathersby conoco oil,cir per curiam.a maritime contract containing an indemnity agreement,whether governed by federal maritime or louisiana law,should be read as a whole and its words given their plain meaning unless the provision is ambiguous.id.at citing lirette popich.water,cir.
article xiv of the contract contains three paragraphs.in the first paragraph,tidewater agrees to defend and indemnify baker from and against all claims,suits,losses,liabilities,expenses,demands,costs including reasonable attorneys fees damages as a result of injury,illness,or death of tidewater employees.in the second paragraph,baker reciprocates the promise contained in the first paragraph.the relevant portion of the third paragraph reads 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,it is expressly agreed by and between the parties hereto that,regardless of the negligence on the part of any party hereto or the unseaworthiness of any vessel,neither such party shall be liable to the other for any punitive,indirect,incidental,special or consequential damages of any kind or nature including,but not limited to,loss of profits,loss of use,loss of hire,and loss of production and each party hereby agrees to waive its rights of recourse in this regard against the other party.
baker argues that this paragraph of the contract restricts the preceding indemnity provision to general damages only,which they contend encompasses only physical and mental damages and excludes damages which baker characterizes as special damages past and future medical expenses,past lost wages,and impairment of earning capacity.
there is nothing in the third paragraph to suggest that it is a restriction on the indemnity provisions in the preceding paragraphs.it references only liability between the parties to the agreement tidewater and baker,and does not reference indemnity or liability to third parties or employees.the types of damages referenced in this paragraph are those traditionally associated with contractual claims,and not the personal injury claims which are the subject of the indemnification provision.see hispanic circus,rex trucking,cir special damages are those that result from a party breach of contract but are not reasonably foreseeable.research found.magna,cir c onsequential,or special,damages are those unusual or indirect costs that,although caused by the defendant conduct in a literal sense,are beyond what one would reasonably expect to be the ordinary consequences of a breach.the illustrative parenthetical following the description of excepted damages including,but not limited to,loss of profits,loss of use,loss of hire,and loss of production also supports this interpretation.baker proffered interpretation of the term special damages does not fall within the plain meaning of the term,especially when read in context with the rest of the paragraph at issue.therefore,the district court did not err inn holding that the third paragraph of article xiv of the contract does not restrict the scope of the indemnity provision.
baker contends that tidewater must exhaust its liability insurance policies before turning to baker for indemnity.the district court held that because baker was only an additional assured under the policies for risks assumed by tidewater,there was no coverage for seth injuries because those risks were assumed by baker pursuant to the indemnity agreement.
under article xi of the contract,tidewater must procure and maintain a protection and indemnity insurance policy covering tidewater liabilities,including and crew coverage,but excluding cargo liability coverage and coverage for those risks,if any,assumed or insured by charterer baker in this charter.article xi further specifies that the policy shall include charterer,in its capacity as of the vessel,as an additional assured,but only with respect to the risks assumed by owner tidewater in this charter.
tidewater procured and maintained a primary policy.under this policy,the unqualified word assured includes any person,organization,trustee or estate to whom or to which the named assured tidewater is obligated by virtue of a contract or agreement to include or name as an assured,or additional assured.tidewater also procured and maintained an excess policy designating tidewater as a named assured but not designating baker as an additional assured.
baker cites a series of fifth circuit cases that have held that,in certain circumstances,when a contract contains a clause and requires the indemnitee to maintain an insurance policy designating the indemnitor as an additional assured,the indemnitee must exhaust the insurance coverage before receiving indemnity.see,tullier halliburton geophysical,cir klepac champlin petroleum,cir ogea loffland,cir.the primary question posed here is whether baker is an additional assured under tidewater insurance policy for seth claims.in order to determine if baker is an additional assured,we must read the insurance and indemnity provisions of the contract in conjunction in order to properly interpret the meaning of the contract.see ogea,at.
baker contends that it is an additional assured because tidewater must procure and maintain insurance designating baker as an additional assured.tidewater argues that,under article xi plain language,tidewater duty is more limited it must procure and maintain insurance designating baker as an additional assured,but only with respect to the risks assumed by owner tidewater in this charter.tidewater thus argues that because the risk of injury to baker employees,the contract does not require baker to be designated as an additional assured for coverage over seth injuries.tidewater also argues that the language in its insurance policies demonstrates that baker is not covered for seth claim because the policy specifically limits baker additional assured coverage to risks assumed by tidewater under the.
baker contends that this issue is addressed in klepac,which held that an indemnitor obligation does not begin to run until the indemnitee insurance policy,naming the indemnitor as the additional assured,is exhausted.klepac,at.however,the contract in klepac did not limit additional assured coverage to only risks assumed by the indemnitee,as the does here.id.the klepac contract stated that the insurance coverage shall include coverage for which the insured indemnitee was reciprocally obligated to indemnify the indemnitor.the court extended the obligation to cover damages for which the indemnitor was obligated to cover the insured indemnitee.id.at.here,however,the contract specifically excludes from coverage risks assumed by baker.thus,klepac does not present the exact situation at issue here.
although there is no case which presents a contract with the precise limiting language at issue here,article xi of the contract expressly limits tidewater obligation to designate baker as an additional assured to the risks assumed by owner tidewater in this charter.tidewater insurance policy,in turn,limits baker status as an additional assured to when tidewater is obligated by virtue of a contract or agreement to designate baker as an additional assured.furthermore,the specifically excludes risks assumed by baker from tidewater insurance coverage.here,the injury was to seth,a baker employee.under the parties agreement,baker,not tidewater,assumed the risk of injury to baker employees.because tidewater did not assume the risk of injury to seth,baker is not an additional assured to tidewater insurance for seth injuries.thus,the district court did not err in holding that the insurance policies need not be exhausted before baker indemnification obligation began.
baker also argues that tidewater insurers,under the policies discussed in the foregoing analysis,were obligated to defend baker against the claims made by seth against baker in determining whether an insurer had a duty to defend,we look to the face of the pleadings.snug harbor,zurich,cir.the insurer is under a legal duty to defend if,and only if,the petition alleges facts construing a cause of action within the coverage of the policy.id.citation omitted.an insurer duty to defend is greater than its duty to provide coverage.landry oceanic contractors,cir.
because the pleadings stated only a claim by one of baker employees,a risk expressly assumed by baker in the contract,there was no cause of action plausibly within the coverage of the policy.because baker could be entitled to a defense under the policy only for covered risks assumed by tidewater,suits brought by tidewater employees against baker,tidewater insurer was not obligated to defend baker in this suit.
appellants also present arguments concerning the liability attributed to baker and tidewater,respectively.seth argues that tidewater conduct in breaking the republic tide mooring line without warning was a superseding cause of seth injuries,and thus tidewater should be entirely liable.the issues of proximate causation and superseding cause involve application of law to fact,which is left to the factfinder,subject to limited review.exxon,sofec,d.
