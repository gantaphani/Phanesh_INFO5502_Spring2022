opinion of the court 
introduction 
the aes corporation aes operates power facilities.aes alleges that dow chemical company dow and its subsidiary,destec energy,destec violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act in connection with a transaction in which aes purchased the stock of one of destec subsidiaries,destec engineering,dei.dei sole asset was a contract to design and construct a power plant in the netherlands the elsta plant.according to aes,dow and destec conspired to sell dei at an artificially inflated price by making misrepresentations material to an evaluation of dei.
during the pendency of this case in the district court,aes and destec entered into a settlement agreement.thus,only the claims against dow remain.there has been no discovery.dow moved for summary judgment,relying solely on documents relating to the transactions in which aes acquired dei stock.in response,aes filed a rule f affidavit requesting discovery in identified areas.the district court nevertheless granted dow summary judgment motion.the district court held that certain clauses in the transaction documents rendered aes reliance on the alleged misrepresentations unreasonable as a matter of law.
ii.background 
dow formed destec to build and run power plants that would supply power to dow chemical facilities and users.in,after determining that it could not profitably run destec as its subsidiary,dow retained morgan stanley to perform a valuation of destec in order to initiate a public sale.
morgan stanley issued a confidential offering memorandum on behalf of destec.as a precondition to receiving the offering memorandum,aes signed a confidentiality agreement that provided in part 
we aes acknowledge that neither you destec,nor morgan stanley destec investment banker or its affiliates,nor your other representatives,nor any of your or their respective officers,directors,employees,agents or controlling persons within the meaning of section of the securities exchange act of,as amended,make any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information,and we agree that no such person will have any liability relating to the information or for any errors therein or omissions therefrom.we further agree that we are not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of the information and that we will be entitled to rely solely on any representations and warranties as may be made to us in any definitive agreement with respect to the transaction,subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be contained therein.
app.at.dow was not a party to the confidentiality agreement but is alleged to have been a controlling person of destec within the meaning of a of the exchange act.
the offering memorandum included projections and estimates about the future performance of destec businesses,including dei and the elsta plant.like the confidentiality agreement,the offering memorandum warned readers that they were not to rely on the accuracy or completeness of information contained therein.it further stated 
o nly those particular representations and warranties which may be made to a purchaser in a definitive agreement,when,as,and if executed,and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such definitive agreement,shall have any legal effect.
app.at alteration in original.
dow and destec provided information about destec to potential bidders in several other ways.first,destec officers gave a presentation to potential bidders,which aes representatives attended.dow and destec also sent certain documents to potential bidders and made others available in a room at a destec facility in houston,texas.further,dow and destec gave potential bidders a computer model to value the destec assets.this model included assumptions about the expenses and revenues of the elsta plant.lastly,dow and destec allowed aes,as part of its due diligence,to visit the elsta plant.
aes contacted dow about the possibility of purchasing the international assets of destec.dow responded that it would prefer to sell all of destec,rather than dispose of it piecemeal.as a result,aes approached ngc corporation ngc to propose submitting a joint bid for all of destec,and a joint bid was subsequently made.
the joint bid was accepted by dow.the transaction took place in two steps.first,ngc acquired all of the stock of destec pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement entered into by dow,destec,and ngc.second,aes purchased all of the international assets of destec,including all of dei outstanding stock,pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between aes and ngc.
section of the merger agreement,to which aes was not a party,provided as follows 
except for the representations and warranties contained in this article iv,neither dow nor any other person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of dow.
app.at.article iv of the merger agreement contained two pages of representations and warranties of dow.it warranted that it was duly organized as a corporation that it was authorized to enter the agreement that the execution and consummation of the agreement would not violate the terms of any court order or dow contract that no government approval was necessary and that no broker was entitled to a fee in connection with the transaction.article iv contained no representation or warranty with respect to the elsta plant.
similarly,section of the asset purchase agreement,signed by ngc and aes,states that except for the representations and warranties contained in this article iii,neither ngc nor any other person as defined in the merger agreement makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of ngc.app.at,section.the merger agreement defines person to mean an individual,partnership,joint venture,trust,corporation,limited liability company or other legal entity or governmental entity.app.at.article iii of the asset purchase agreement contains limited representations and warranties by ngc very similar to those made by dow in the merger agreement.
the merger agreement provided that t his agreement and the confidentiality agreement,and certain other agreements executed by the parties hereto as of the date of this agreement,constitute the entire agreement,and supersedes sic all prior agreements and understandings written and oral,among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.app.at,section.
according to aes,shortly after purchasing dei and destec other international assets,it realized that the elsta plant would cost far more to complete than its due diligence investigation had indicated and would open for operation much later than dow and destec had represented it would.instead of providing the predicted million in profit,the project ultimately occasioned a million loss.aes contends that dow knew specific facts about the elsta plant that contradicted the representations it had made prior to and during due diligence.its complaint alleges fourteen affirmative misrepresentations and eight material omissions upon which it relied.some involved profit and cost projections,but others involved currently existing facts.further,aes contends that,as part of the scheme to defraud,dow concealed the true state of the elsta plant and frustrated its due diligence efforts by causing destec and its employees to provide false and misleading information to aes.
the district court opinion refers to all of the above quoted provisions of the transaction documentation and concludes that the no clauses in the agreements between dow and aes are enforceable.app.at.the reference to agreements between dow and aes is not clear to us,but we assume for present purposes that aes commitment in the confidentiality agreement was made for the benefit of dow and,if enforceable,is enforceable by it.in that document,aes acknowledge d that no express or implied representations or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information had been made and agreed that destec and dow would not have any liability relating to the information and that aes would be entitled to rely solely on the representations and warranties it would be able to secure in any definitive agreement.app.at.in order to avoid further repetition of this acknowledgment and agreement,we will refer to them hereafter as the clause.
iii.analysis 
a.the federal law 
section b of the exchange act prohibits the use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.b.rule,which was promulgated to implement section b,makes it unlawful for anyone engaged in the purchase or sale of a security to 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which the were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
to state a valid claim under rule,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a misstatement or an omission of a material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which the plaintiff reasonably relied and that the plaintiff reliance was the proximate cause of his or her injury.semerenko cendant,cir.
the reasonable reliance element of a rule claim requires a showing of a causal nexus between the misrepresentation and the plaintiff injury,as well as a demonstration that the plaintiff exercised the diligence that a reasonable person under all of the circumstances would have exercised to protect his own interests.straub vaisman and,cir.in straub,we identified a set of factors to aid in determining whether a party reliance was reasonable under all of the circumstances.we noted that courts may consider whether a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties whether the plaintiff had the opportunity to detect the fraud the sophistication of the plaintiff the existence of long standing business or personal relationships and the plaintiff access to the relevant information.see id.at.
the district court held that as a result of aes contractual commitment not to rely on any representations other than those incorporated in the final agreements,its alleged reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law.aes insists that this holding is incorrect in light of section a of the exchange act,a.section a provides any condition,stipulation,or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this title or of any rule or regulation thereunder,or of any rule of an exchange required thereby shall be void.a.that is,by its terms,section a prohibits waiver of the substantive obligations imposed by the exchange act.express,mcmahon,d.the underlying concern of this section is whether the challenged agreement weakens the ability to recover under the exchange act.id.at.quotation omitted.
b.the applicable law 
aes emphasizes that the merger and asset purchase agreements stipulated that delaware law would govern their interpretation and insists that we must look to that law to determine the effect to be given the clause.while we will not rule out the possibility that state law may play a role in some situations involving a rule claim,we conclude that it has no role here.reasonable reliance is an element of a federal law claim and what constitutes such reliance is a matter of federal law.federal law calls for the determination of reasonableness to be made on a basis based on all of the surrounding circumstances.the terms of any agreement between the parties may be among these relevant circumstances and,if there is a material dispute about what the parties agreed to,reliance on state contract law may be appropriate to resolve that dispute.
the delaware cases relied upon by aes,however,do not involve rules of contract interpretation.primary reliance,for example,is placed upon norton poplos,which involved a contract to sell commercial real estate in which the parties had represented that they do not rely on any written or oral representations not expressly written in the contract.id.at.the delaware supreme court held that delaware law will not enforce such a clause to bar a common law rescission claim based on fraudulent,or innocent but material,misrepresentation by a seller.id.aes and dow dispute whether this is an rule of delaware law or whether its application is limited to contracts between unsophisticated parties we need not resolve that issue the issues of what constitutes an anticipatory waiver of a federal securities claim and whether a purported anticipatory waiver of such a claim is enforceable are matters of federal law.see newton rumery,d the agreement purported to waive a right to sue conferred by a federal statute.the question whether the policies underlying that statute may in same circumstance render that waiver unenforceable is a question of federal law.
c.the role of the clause 
this brings us back to section a of the exchange act which forecloses anticipatory waivers of compliance with the duties imposed by rule.we believe the conclusion inescapable that enforcement of the clauses to bar aes fraud claims as a matter of law would be inconsistent with section a.
as we have noted,reliance is an essential element of a rule claim.it necessarily follows that,if a party commits itself never to claim that it relied on representations of the other party to its contract,it purports anticipatorily to waive any future claim based on the fraudulent misrepresentations of that party.the same is true if the commitment is more limited,a promise not to claim reliance on any representation not set forth in the agreement.the scope of the anticipatory waiver is more limited,but it is nevertheless an anticipatory waiver of potential future claims under rule.
we,thus,find ourselves in agreement with the conclusion of the court of appeals for the first circuit in rogen ilikon,cir.there,a stockholder and former officer and director of the defendant company brought suit alleging that during negotiations for the sale of his stock after his separation from the company,officers and directors of the defendant corporation failed to disclose material information about the possibility of new prospects for the company.in the agreement to sell his stock,plaintiff represented that he was familiar with the business of the company and that he was not relying on any representations of the purchaser or its agents.in addressing the propriety of this type of contractual provision under the exchange act,the court concluded 
this type of contract clause is not,in its terms,a condition,stipulation,or provision binding plaintiff to waive compliance with the securities act of as set forth in section a of the act,a.but,on analysis,we see no fundamental difference between saying,for example,i waive any rights i might have because of your representations or obligations to make full disclosure and i am not relying on your representations or obligations to make full disclosure.were we to hold that the existence of this provision constituted the basis or a substantial part of the basis for finding as a matter of law,we would have gone far toward eviscerating section a.
at alterations in original.
as the rogen court noted,this is not to say that a plaintiff declaration in a contract of an intent not to rely may not be evidence that he or she did not rely on representations of the defendants.that declaration,alone or in conjunction with other evidence of,may establish an absence of reliance and,when unrebutted,may even provide a basis for summary judgment in the defendant favor.thus,in this case,the clauses are some evidence of an absence of reliance.however,the district court did not find that the evidence of was unrebutted.indeed,dow does not contend that the information provided by it and its associates played no material role in aes decision to enter the agreement.
dow does contend,and we understand the district court to have held,that the clauses establish as a matter of law that any reliance of aes was unreasonable reliance.we find the
