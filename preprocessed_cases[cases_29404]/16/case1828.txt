gulf guaranty life insurance company filed an initial claim in the district court in alleging that connecticut general life insurance company breached a reinsurance contract between them.gulf guaranty subsequently filed claims in the district court in alleging that connecticut general breached an agreement to arbitrate the reinsurance dispute,as well as claims for conspiracy and malice allegedly committed by connecticut general with respect to connecticut general conduct in the arbitration process.the district court consolidated the and actions and compelled arbitration of the consolidated action.the district court further denied a motion by gulf guaranty to discovery and granted a motion by connecticut general to remove a chosen arbitrator,gary fagg,from service.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order compelling arbitration of all disputes between gulf guaranty and connecticut general in the consolidated action we affirm the district court decision dismissing gulf guaranty claims for breach of the arbitration agreement and for conspiracy and malice we affirm the district court decision denying gulf guaranty motion to discovery but we reverse the district court decision granting the motion to strike fagg from service as an arbitrator.
factual and procedural history 
in,gulf guaranty life insurance company gulf guaranty entered into a contract with connecticut general life insurance company connecticut general by which connecticut general agreed to reinsure gulf guaranty on certain credit life insurance certificates issued by gulf guaranty.their reinsurance contract contained an arbitration provision governing disputes under the contract in,a holder of one of the insurance certificates sued gulf guaranty for payment.following judgment in favor of that certificate holder,gulf guaranty sought reimbursement from connecticut general pursuant to their reinsurance contract.connecticut general offered gulf guaranty payment in an amount that gulf guaranty found unsatisfactory.on or about september,gulf guaranty sued connecticut general and cigna reinsurance company cigna collectively,the defendants in mississippi state court for breach of contract and wrongfully placing conditions on payment.this was the suit.
the suit was removed to federal court in october of.connecticut general and cigna sought to compel arbitration pursuant to the connecticut guaranty reinsurance contract.in january of,a magistrate judge stayed all proceedings in the suit against connecticut general and compelled arbitration of the reinsurance dispute.in april of,the district court likewise stayed the action against cigna pending arbitration.
in september of,gulf guaranty appointed gary fagg as its arbitrator of choice.in january of,the defendants appointed oscar scofield as their arbitrator of choice.it is undisputed that scofield and fagg discussed selection of peter jaynes to serve as the third arbitrator.whether the two arbitrators agreed upon and appointed jaynes as the third arbitrator,or whether his selection was merely discussed between them,is a matter of dispute based on this dispute over selection of arbitrators,on august,gulf guaranty filed a second lawsuit in mississippi state court that alleged breach of the arbitration agreement by the defendants,alleged waiver of the defendants right to arbitrate,and alleged conspiracy and malice and reckless disregard for gulf guaranty rights.this was the suit.
the suit was likewise removed to federal court.on december,the district court the suit and consolidated it with the suit.on june,upon motion by the defendants to compel arbitration and to dismiss the suit,the district court issued an order finding that the defendants had not waived their right to arbitrate.in that june order,the court also granted the defendants motion to compel arbitration and granted the defendants motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by plaintiff gulf guaranty on august,making no mention of the status of the suit component of the underlying consolidated action as stayed or dismissed.in the same june order,the district court further denied gulf guaranty motion to discovery and granted the defendants motion to strike fagg from service as an arbitrator.
on july,the district court stayed enforcement of its june order compelling arbitration pending appeal of that order to this court.on september,the district court denied a motion by gulf guaranty for relief from the district court judgment pursuant to fed.civ.b.gulf guaranty now timely appeals the district court order of june,that compelled arbitration and dismissed gulf guaranty claims for waiver,breach and conspiracy denied gulf guaranty motion to discovery and struck arbitrator fagg.
ii.the order compelling arbitration 
a.this court jurisdiction over appeal of the district court june order compelling arbitration 
the parties agree that this court should have jurisdiction over the district court june order compelling arbitration of the consolidated action,but such agreement is insufficient to confer jurisdiction on this court.due to procedural ambiguity within the june order regarding the precise status of the suit of the consolidated action as stayed or dismissed,there is some question as to whether this court has jurisdiction subsequent to the supreme court decision in green tree fin.randolph,d.in green tree,the supreme court addressed the appealability of orders compelling arbitration under the federal arbitration act,a the faa the supreme court held in green tree that,when a district court issues an order compelling arbitration,that order is appealable as a final decision under section a only if the district court dismisses the underlying action.see at.the court further held in green tree that when a district court compels arbitration but enter s a stay instead of a dismissal of the underlying action,that order would not be appealable under the faa.id.at.citing b 
it is undisputed that the district court june order explicitly dismissed the underlying suit that was filed on august.however,because the district court neglected to explicitly address the status of the suit,which suit that court acknowledged it had for the purpose of consolidating the suit with the suit,this court must determine,pursuant to the dictates of green tree,whether we can hear this appeal of the june order compelling arbitration.because we conclude that the record shows clear intent by the district court that its june order compelling arbitration be immediately appealable to this court pursuant to the supreme court mandate in green tree,we further conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear appeal of that order under a of the faa,and in accordance with green tree.
the supreme court decision in green tree did not confront the circumstance of consolidated actions.subsequent to that decision,no other court of appeals has yet confronted the precise circumstance of this case of determining appellate jurisdiction over an order compelling arbitration of a consolidated action that explicitly dismissed only a portion of the claims in that action and neglected to declare the status of the remaining claims as stayed or dismissed.the supreme court noted in green tree that congress did not define the term final decision as it is used within the faa.see at.the court thus held that the term final decision should be accord ed its well established meaning,as a decision that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.citations and quotation omitted.
we recently construed a district court order compelling arbitration that did not precisely conform with the dismissal language of green tree as providing the functional equivalent of the required dismissal of the underlying case,and thus to allow for our exercise of jurisdiction over that appeal in accordance with green tree.see am.heritage life ins.orr,cir citing green tree,at.in the order compelling arbitration at issue in that case,the district court used the term clos ed rather than dismiss ed to indicate the status of the underlying case.see id.we concluded that there is no practical distinction between dismiss and close for purposes of this appeal,where the application of each word results in a termination on the merits,leaving the sic court with nothing more to do but execute the judgment so that we determined the decision to be final within the contemplation of a of the faa.id.thus,we have previously inferred that an order that did not precisely conform with the supreme court requirement in green tree that claims be dismissed per se to allow appellate jurisdiction nonetheless constituted a final decision for the purposes of our jurisdiction in conformance with green tree.
the district court in the instant case took the following actions that suggest that court intent to issue a final decision in its june order compelling arbitration that would be immediately appealable to this court,in full accord with green tree.we note first that the district court lifted the stay on the suit by that case when it consolidated the actions,so that no stay of the suit remained in effect.we further note that there was no motion before the district court by any party to stay any portion of the consolidated action at the time that court issued its june order compelling arbitration of the entire consolidated action.rather,there was only a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants along with the defendants motion requesting the district court to the parties to arbitrate their entire dispute in its june order compelling arbitration,the district court did dismiss the suit in order to compel the entire action to arbitration in accord with the previous order compelling arbitration of the suit.
additionally,in its subsequent order of july,the district court stayed enforcement of its june order compelling arbitration pending appeal to this court of that june order,referencing the cause numbers of both the and filed suits in that july stay order.moreover,in that july order,the district court expressly referenced its june order compelling arbitration and described that order as follows this june order is considered a final judgment for the purposes of appeal.see a green tree fin.randolph,d.the district court express reference to green tree when describing its june order is very compelling evidence that the district court clearly intended to issue a final decision compelling arbitration in its june order for the purposes of this court jurisdiction to entertain immediate appeal of that order fully in accord with green tree.
last,the district court subsequently entertained and denied a motion made by gulf guaranty pursuant to fed.civ.b for relief from the district court judgment of june.we note that trial courts have no jurisdiction to entertain rule b motions for relief from a judgment except from an order that is a final judgment,order,or proceeding fed.civ.b thus,the district court acceptance of jurisdiction over,and denial of,gulf guaranty rule b motion further evinces that court belief that its june order constituted a final decision immediately appealable to this court.we conclude from this record that the district court order of june compelling arbitration of the entire instant consolidated action constitutes a final decision within the meaning of green tree,at.the district court failure to reference explicitly the suit as dismissed in the court june order compelling arbitration of the entire consolidated action was simply an oversight.clearly,the intention,as well as the effect,was to dismiss it.
no waiver by connecticut general of its right to arbitrate 
in the suit,gulf guaranty claimed that connecticut general waived its right to arbitrate based on connecticut general alleged attempted veto of the selection of jaynes as a third arbitrator by scofield and fagg.based on this dispute over arbitrator selection,gulf guaranty alleged that connecticut general refused to move forward with arbitration,took active steps to prevent arbitration,and attempted to counsel or coerce scofield into repudiating an agreement that gulf guaranty alleges was completed between scofield and fagg and appointed jaynes as the third arbitrator.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the waiver claim.we agree with the district court that,even taking gulf guaranty allegations as true at the motion to dismiss stage,such allegations regarding connecticut general participation in the dispute over the composition of the arbitration panel do not indicate sufficient overt acts evincing a desire by connecticut general to litigate,instead of arbitrate,the reinsurance dispute that would constitute waiver of connecticut general contractual right to arbitrate.
this court reviews de novo a district court dismissal of a claim that a party waived its right to arbitrate.see subway equip.leasing forte,cir waiver copeland wasserstein,perella,cir motion to dismiss.as the district court correctly set forth,a party claiming that another party waived the contractual right to arbitrate bears a heavy burden to establish the claim.there is a strong presumption against a finding that a party waived its contractual right to arbitrate,and any doubts thereabout must be resolved in favor of arbitration.texaco exploration prod.amclyde engineered prods,cir citing subway,at.ordinarily a party waives its right to arbitrate when it initially pursues litigation and then reverses course and attempts to arbitrate id.however,waiver can also result from some overt act in court that evinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration.id.quoting subway,at.
however,mere delay falls far short of the waiver requirements id.citing subway,at.in subway,for example,this court rejected a claim of waiver even where it was alleged a party sought related judicial bankruptcy proceedings involving issues separate from the arbitration in an affirmative attempt to delay that arbitration.see at.similarly,in texaco exploration,this court rejected a claim of waiver based on a party seeking litigation of another dispute with the same opposing party that was separate from the arbitrable dispute,even where this court recognized that the unrelated litigation had the effect of delaying the arbitration and narrowing its scope.at.this court has further recognized that,even where a party takes substantial steps toward litigation of the arbitral dispute,or participates substantially in litigation procedures,it ordinarily will not waive the right to arbitrate.see tenneco resins,davy int l,ag,cir collecting cases.in tenneco,for example,this court found that a party had not waived its right to arbitrate when it waited almost eight months before moving that the district court proceedings be stayed pending arbitration,and in the meantime participated in discovery.id.this court noted that this and other courts have allowed such actions as well as considerably more activity without finding that a party has waived a contractual right to arbitrate.id.at citing southwest indus.import export,wilmod,cir see also guar.ins.new orleans agency,cir finding no waiver although a party filed an answer to a court claim denying liability and filed counterclaims,as well as attempted to implead parties and allowed taking of two depositions before demanding arbitration.
in contrast,in one of the few cases in which we have recognized a party waiver of the right to arbitrate,we found that the party had demonstrated a clear and unmistakable disinclination to arbitrate to substantial detriment and prejudice of the other party,including the bringing of a state court suit that did not rely on or even mention the arbitration clause,and where the parties did not attempt to schedule an arbitration hearing until almost three years later.see miller brewing fort worth distrib,cir ernst,manhattan constr.of,cir finding that extensive postsuit sic actions in all phases of this complex litigation served as waiver of a party right to demand that an opposing party arbitrate grievances.connecticut general did not initiate any litigation action in this case it merely defended itself against gulf guaranty court claims.gulf guaranty offers no authority supporting its proposition that,even taking its allegations as true,connecticut general participation in the dispute over the composition of the arbitration if protracted and deliberately causing delay in to the level of the type of overt act that would indicate connecticut general desire to resolve the underlying reinsurance dispute via litigation rather than arbitration for the purposes of waiver.we find no such authority either.we thus agree with the district court that connecticut general did not waive its right to arbitrate its dispute with gulf guaranty.
iii.dismissal of gulf guaranty claims for breach of the arbitration agreement and conspiracy and denial of gulf guaranty motion to reopen discovery 
dismissal of gulf guaranty remaining claims for damages for breach of the arbitration agreement,conspiracy,and a tort of malicious,willful,or reckless disregard for gulf guaranty rights 
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss claims de novo.see copeland,at.in gulf guaranty august,complaint alleging that connecticut general refused to move forward with arbitration based on the dispute over selection of jaynes as a third neutral arbitrator,gulf guaranty claimed that connecticut general breached the arbitration agreement,conspired to deprive gulf guaranty of its rights under the reinsurance agreement,and committed malicious,willful,or reckless disregard for gulf guaranty rights,which latter claim gulf guaranty indicated constituted an independent tort.gulf guaranty sought actual damages,attorneys fees and costs,as well as punitive damages in an amount sufficient to punish these defendants and to deter others from similar misconduct in its june order,once the district court found that connecticut general did not waive its right to arbitrate and compelled arbitration,that court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the entire lawsuit filed on august,thus including gulf guaranty claims for breach,conspiracy and malice.the court did so without any further reference by the court to those claims or discussion of their merits.
the dismissal without discussion suggests that the district court declined to reach the merits of those claims.gulf guaranty argues that this was an improper dismissal of the claims on the merits and further contends that,even if its pleaded allegations failed to make out its claim of waiver,gulf guaranty allegations of breach and conspiracy and malice,if taken as true,are nevertheless sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.the defendants contend that the district court properly dismissed these three claims on their merits and posit that the district court must have done so based on a conclusion by that court that such claims were merely reiterative of gulf guaranty failed waiver claim.
we disagree with the parties assumption that the district court dismissed gulf guaranty claims for damages for breach,conspiracy and reckless and malicious behavior on the merits.we acknowledge that it is not entirely clear from the june order upon which ground the district court based its dismissal of those two on the merits or without reaching the merits.however,we are not restricted to ruling on the district court reasoning,and may affirm a district court grant of a motion to dismiss on a basis not mentioned in the district court opinion.see in re comshare.sec,cir citation omitted see also razzoli fed.bureau of prisons,explaining that an appellate court can affirm a correct decision even if on different grounds than those assigned in the decision under review internal quotation and citation omitted.consequently,because we conclude that it was proper for the district court,when compelling arbitration,to dismiss gulf guaranty breach,conspiracy and malice claims without reaching the merits of those claims,we affirm the order dismissing those claims.
gulf guaranty offers no basis for a court jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for damages of the type made by gulf guaranty that arise from the alleged failure or breach of the agreed upon arbitral process with respect to selection of jaynes as arbitrator,and we find none.no court appears to have addressed the precise instant circumstance in which a party alleges failure of the arbitral process and seeks damages,rather than compelled arbitration,from the court for breach of a valid arbitration agreement,as well as damages for conspiracy and tort.however,review of the applicable principles regarding a court limited authority to intervene in the arbitral process when there is a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement indicates that it was proper for the district court to dismiss gulf guaranty breach,conspiracy,and malice claims without addressing the merits of those claims.
under the faa,jurisdiction by the courts to intervene into the arbitral process prior to issuance of an award is very limited.see larry united super,werries,cir.courts are limited to determinations regarding whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists and the scope and enforcement of the agreement,including the arbitrability of given underlying disputes under the agreement.see id.at a court compelling arbitration should decide only such issues as are essential to defining the nature of the forum in which a dispute will be decided.quoting great western peacock,cir republic of nicaragua standard fruit,cir our role is strictly limited to determining arbitrability and enforcing agreements to arbitrate.section of the faa provides for a court role in the arbitral process prior to issuance of an award in the event of a claimed default of that process pursuant to a valid agreement 
a party aggrieved by the alleged failure,neglect,or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition a district court for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement the court upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement if the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure,neglect,or refusal to perform the same be in issue,the court shall proceed to the trial thereof if the jury find that an agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder,the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.
the faa does not provide therefore for any court intervention prior to issuance of an arbitral award beyond the determination as to whether an agreement to arbitrate exists and enforcement of that agreement by compelled arbitration of claims that fall within the scope of the agreement even after the court determines some default has occurred.moreover,enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate under the faa does not appear to include any mechanism beyond those geared toward returning the parties to arbitration,thus appearing not to authorize compensation by a court to parties in the form of damages prior to issuance of an arbitral award.moses cone hosp.mercury constr,d the faa provides two parallel devices for enforcing an arbitration agreement a stay of litigation in any case raising a dispute referable to arbitration,and an affirmative order to engage in arbitration.both of these sections call for an expeditious and summary hearing,with only restricted inquiry into factual issues.
we have at least once rejected a claim for damages arising from an alleged failure in the arbitral process and ordered the parties instead to resume arbitration.see folse richard wolf med.instruments,cir.in folse,we found that a district court erred by refusing to compel parties to return to arbitration and refusing to stay a court action that included a claim for damages from failure of arbitration arising from an arbitral process that was ongoing for more than three years without resulting in an award.id.in so doing,we noted that,although it was unfortunate that the arbitration has failed the expectations of at least one,if not both,of the parties,n onetheless,these facts do not permit us to intervene until the parties see this arbitration through to a final award.id.at.
additionally,this court follows the rule by which challenges to the procedural aspects of arbitration are for the arbitrator to decide,while challenges to the substantive arbitrability of disputes are for the courts to decide.see smith barney shearson,boone,cir finding that a party claim that arbitration was was a proper dispute regarding arbitration procedure for the arbitrator where rules regarding timeliness were incorporated into the agreement to arbitrate and the parties agreed to have any dispute between them resolved by arbitration.educ.ass.prof l staff,cir.unit b,citing united steelworkers am,d see also livingston john wiley sons,cir i ssues of compliance with grievance and arbitration procedure are properly within the competence of the arbitrator.as the fourth circuit has explained,g enerally,objections to the nature of arbitral proceedings are for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance f airness objections should generally be made to the arbitrator subject only to limited judicial review as set forth in section of the faa.see hooters of,phillips,cir.
there are circumstances in which courts will intervene in the arbitral process when a challenge goes to the making of the agreement or suggests that the agreement is void or warrants rescission.in hooters of america,for example,the fourth circuit found that a party materially breached its arbitration agreement by promulgating rules under that agreement that were so biased in favor of an employer that the rules were tantamount to unconscionability,thus requiring the extreme remedy of rescission of the agreement.see id we have recently similarly determined that a court may entertain a challenge to the enforcement of arbitration agreements based on a theory that the agreement is void as against public policy.see inv.partners,glamour shots licensing,cir.however,gulf guaranty claims for damages arising from breach of the arbitration agreement,and from conspiracy and a tort of malice,based on its allegations regarding connecticut general responsibility for failure in the arbitrator selection process,make no such challenges to the making of or validity of the arbitration agreement,nor do these claims suggest that the agreement is void,unenforceable,or worthy of rescission based on public policy or any other ground.rather,gulf guaranty appears improperly to attempt to cast challenges that essentially go to the procedure of arbitration,specifically the arbitrator selection process,and to the alleged unfairness of that process,as claims for damages for breach of contract and tort injury.we find no authority under the faa for a court to entertain such challenges prior to issuance of the arbitral award.
the parties do not dispute that they have a valid agreement to arbitrate and that their underlying reinsurance dispute is arbitrable under that agreement.the district court has already provided for enforcement of the valid agreement pursuant to the mechanisms outlined in the faa via that court june order compelling arbitration.as we indicated in folse,prior to issuance of an arbitral award,a party prayer for actual and punitive damages for any alleged failure of that process does not appear to fall within the ambit of a court authority to enforce a valid arbitration agreement under the faa.see at.we conclude,therefore,based on a court limited authority under the faa to intervene in the arbitral process prior to issuance of an award,that it was appropriate for the district court in this case to dismiss gulf guaranty claims seeking damages for breach,conspiracy,and malice without addressing their merits when that court issued an order the parties to arbitration.
denial of gulf guaranty motion to discovery 
we review a district court refusal to discovery for abuse of discretion.see martin herend imports diamond gem trading,cir.gulf guaranty requested that the district court discovery with respect to the issue of whether scofield in fact agreed with fagg to appointment of jaynes as a third arbitrator.once the district court disposed of gulf guaranty other claims,that court denied the discovery motion in its june order without further discussion.under this circumstance,we conclude that decision was proper.
the district court properly found that any alleged coercion regarding the composition of the panel,including whether jaynes was appointed as an arbitrator,was insufficient as a matter of law to constitute waiver of connecticut general right to arbitrate.any further evidence regarding the dispute over jaynes appointment would not alter that finding.additionally,once the district court properly dismissed gulf guaranty other claims for breach of the arbitration agreement,conspiracy,and malice,and then compelled any remaining disputes between the parties to arbitration,no court claims remained before the district court for which discovery by gulf guaranty would have been necessary at that time.moreover,in the event that arbitration resolved all of the issues between the parties,such discovery in pursuit of gulf guaranty court claims would have been wasteful.we conclude,therefore,that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying gulf guaranty motion to discovery regarding the dispute over jaynes appointment as an arbitrator.
iv.the striking of fagg as an arbitrator by the district court prior to issuance of an arbitral award 
the defendants filed a motion with the district court to strike gulf guaranty chosen arbitrator,gary fagg,from service.the district court interpreted the language of the arbitration agreement to require that only executives of a life insurance company may serve as arbitrators.the court thus concluded that,because fagg is the executive of a reinsurance company,which the court concluded is not a life insurance company,then fagg qualifications fail to satisfy a condition precedent in the arbitration agreement for fagg to serve as an arbitrator.the district court thus granted the defendants motion to strike fagg from service as an arbitrator.gulf guaranty appeals that decision on the ground that the district court erred in determining that the court had authority to remove fagg from service as an arbitrator prior to issuance of an arbitral award based on any qualification of fagg to serve we agree.
as the supreme court has acknowledged,the congressional purpose of the faa is to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.moses cone,at.additionally,the faa does not expressly provide for court authority to remove an arbitrator prior to issuance of an arbitral award.under the faa,courts may intervene into the arbitral process to select an arbitrator upon application of a party,if the parties fail to avail themselves of a method for arbitrator selection within their agreement or if for any reason there shall be a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator.see however,there is no authorization under the faa express terms for a court to remove an arbitrator from service.rather,even where arbitrator bias is at issue,the faa does not provide for removal of an arbitrator from service prior to an award,but only for potential vacatur of any award.see thus,the faa does not expressly endorse court inquiry into the capacity of any arbitrator to serve prior to issuance of an arbitral award.more importantly,the faa appears not to endorse court power to remove an arbitrator for any reason prior to issuance of an arbitral award 
as the district court conceded,it is well established that prior to issuance of an award,a court may not make inquiry into an arbitrator capacity to serve based on a challenge that a given arbitrator is biased.see aviall,ryder,cir although the faa provides that a court can vacate an award where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,it does not provide for removal of an arbitrator.quoting this court has never confronted the question whether,prior to issuance of an arbitral award,a court has authority to remove an arbitrator,as did the district court,based on the type of challenge to the arbitrator qualification to serve under the terms of the arbitration agr
