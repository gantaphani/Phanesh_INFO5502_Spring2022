opinion of the court 
this case is before us for the second time on appeal.in the previous appeal,eichorn,cir,cert.denied,d,we held that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence of the defendants specific intent to interfere with their pension rights to survive summary judgment on their claims under of the employee retirement income security act erisa.id.at.we reversed the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants and remanded for further proceedings.id.after nearly three years of additional proceedings on remand,the district court again granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that the relief the plaintiffs sought was not available to them.the plaintiffs appeal from that order and challenge several of the district court interlocutory orders.we will affirm.
we have previously set forth the basic facts in this litigation,eichorn,at,and we recite only the facts relevant to the present decision.
the plaintiffs are former employees of paradyne corporation paradyne.in,paradyne was part of.reorganized that year,splitting into three parts,lucent technologies,lucent,and ncr corporation.in the course of the reorganization,transferred paradyne to lucent.in,lucent sold paradyne to a business called texas pacific group texas pacific.before that sale,the plaintiffs in this case had pension plans that included certain bridging rights.if an employee left lucent or another of the former companies and returned within six months,either to the company the employee had left or to another of the former companies,the employee could bridge the two terms of employment,receive pension credit for all prior service,and continue to accrue pension benefits as if he had never left.if the employee left and did not return until after the bridging period had expired,the employee would need to work for an additional five years to regain his previous level of pension benefits.
the alleged basis for the plaintiffs erisa claims is that the defendants entered into agreements as part of the sale of paradyne that had the effect of canceling the plaintiffs bridging rights.in,when paradyne was part of,announced its intent to sell paradyne.recognizing the value of paradyne work force,and wanting to make paradyne more attractive to potential buyers,announced a policy precluding any employee who voluntarily left paradyne from being hired by any other division of.on june,lucent and texas pacific signed a purchase agreement for the sale of paradyne,and on july,the sale closed.the june purchase agreement included a to in this litigation as the pre closing net whereby lucent promised that neither it nor any of the other former companies would hire any paradyne employees who left paradyne voluntarily before the sale closed and whose annual salaries were more than.on the date of the closing,lucent signed an employee matters agreement,which included a to in this litigation as the post closing net extending the provisions of the pre closing net for days eight months after the closing.
once the sale closed,the paradyne employees employment with lucent terminated,and the bridging period began.because the agreement embodied in the pre closing net and post closing net lasted for eight months,the paradyne employees who made more than annually were prevented from exercising their bridging rights 
near the time of the paradyne sale,kurt eichorn and gilbert daley filed substantially identical class action complaints in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,naming,lucent,and texas pacific as defendants,and asserting,inter alia,that the pre closing net and post closing net violated of erisa.the actions were consolidated and,after discovery,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,holding that the plaintiffs had not put forth sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants had the required intent to interfere with the plaintiffs bridging rights.eichorn,wl,at.on appeal,this court reversed and remanded that holding because we determined that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the defendants intent.eichorn,at.the panel also directed the district court on remand to address the plaintiffs motions for additional discovery and for class certification.id.at.
on remand,the district court reopened discovery and allowed the plaintiffs to file a motion for class certification.the parties appear to have proceeded after remand on the assumption that the plaintiffs would be entitled to some form of compensatory damages if they succeeded in proving their erisa claims.on may,over three months after the close of reopened discovery and some seven years from the start of the case,the plaintiffs submitted spreadsheets to the district court,offering their damage calculations for the first time.the spreadsheets were prepared by plaintiffs counsel son,stephen crowley,who was not offered as an expert and has no training or experience with the economics of employment benefits.
crowley calculations purported to quantify what each plaintiff would have earned in pension benefits,had he or she remained employed at an company after the sale of paradyne.in performing the calculations,crowley made various assumptions about such future events as when the plaintiffs would have retired,how their salaries would have increased had paradyne remained part of lucent,what choices the plaintiffs would have made with respect to their pension benefits,and what each plaintiff life expectancy was.with his calculations,crowley submitted a life expectancy chart from the foundation for infinite survival and various statistical tables from the united states department of labor which,he asserted,provided part of the basis for his calculations.
the district court accepted the plaintiffs belated submissions and reopened discovery again to allow the defendants to depose crowley.after deposing crowley,the defendants made a motion to strike his calculations and to preclude him from testifying at trial.the plaintiffs opposed the motion and argued that,if the district court were to grant the defendants motion,the plaintiffs should be allowed to engage a damages expert.on november,the district court granted the defendants motion and denied as untimely the plaintiffs request for leave to engage an expert.
in the course of making his initial ruling from the bench,which was later reduced to a written order,the district judge explained that he did not believe his order would effectively end the case for the plaintiffs,because the plaintiffs might still be entitled to seek back pay and would not need the assistance of an expert to establish their entitlement to that relief.the judge said,
at a minimum,it would appear that a back pay case can in some manner or other go to the jury.indeed,in this type of erisa claim,a back pay claim is normally one of the court claims which go.in short,the theory of the case is that the plaintiffs were precluded from employment because of and based upon a desire to deny them rights which they have under erisa 
and therefore,in the court view,what could and would go to the jury would indeed be claims predicated upon the denial of their employment and potential back pay claims.
further,the district judge noted that the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief,and the judge agreed that there was at least a possibility that such relief was available.even so,he did not definitively rule on the issue,and the written order stated that the court does not reach the issue whether plaintiffs can quantify or establish any right to back pay equitable relief increasing plaintiff s pension benefits and reserves such issue for resolution at or before trial.after he granted the defendants motion to strike crowley testimony and evidence,the district court ordered the parties to confer with a magistrate judge to schedule limited discovery of remaining damages issues and preparation of a final pretrial order.
after the reopened discovery closed,the defendants moved for summary judgment.they argued that the only relief available to the plaintiffs on their claim under erisa for unlawful interference with benefits is the appropriate equitable relief available through a of the statute.summary judgment was appropriate,they argued,because the only relief that the plaintiffs had requested or could the district court order striking stephen crowley submissions and denying the plaintiffs leave to find an expert to replace back pay,which is not equitable relief under a.the district court agreed with that analysis and,accordingly,granted summary judgment to the defendants.the plaintiffs now appeal,challenging the summary judgment order,the order that struck stephen crowley submissions and denied leave to retain an expert,and certain other interlocutory orders 
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred both in ruling that crowley proposed evidence was inadmissible and in denying them leave to present an expert in lieu of crowley.more specifically,though the plaintiffs concede that crowley was not qualified as an expert,they argue that no special qualifications were necessary to testify regarding future damages in this case and that crowley testimony and spreadsheets were admissible under federal rule of evidence as summaries of the contents of the statistical tables he submitted.the plaintiffs also argue that the district court order denying them leave to retain an expert witness after crowley was excluded was an abuse of discretion.those arguments are without merit.
in excluding crowley evidence,the district court was within the broad discretion afforded it under federal rules of evidence and to act as a gatekeeper charged with preventing unreliable opinion testimony.although this court has recognized that lay opinion as to technical matters may sometimes be appropriate,asplundh div.benton harbor eng g,cir,we have cautioned that rule requires that a lay opinion witness have a reasonable basis grounded either in experience or specialized knowledge for arriving at the opinion that he or she expresses in order to satisfy these disposition of this case.rule requirements,the trial judge should rigorously examine the reliability of the lay opinion by ensuring that the witness possesses sufficient special knowledge or experience which is germane to the lay opinion offered.id.at original emphasis.whether a witness is qualified to offer opinion testimony is committed to the discretion of the trial court,and we have no difficulty holding that the district court was within its discretion in saying that crowley was not qualified to offer a damages opinion here.as the plaintiffs concede,crowley had no personal knowledge of the underlying facts and no relevant experience or training 
we also reject the plaintiffs argument that crowley submissions were admissible under rule.that rule provides that t he contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.courts have cautioned that rule is not a vehicle for the introduction of evidence which is otherwise inadmissible,and that the voluminous evidence that is the subject of the summary must be independently admissible.peat,vanguard research,cir see also united states pelullo,cir.the plaintiffs proffered calculations are better described as a synthesis rather than a summary of the charts and other evidence on which crowley relied.the calculations went beyond the data they summarized and included several assumptions,inferences,and projections about future events,which represent crowley opinion,rather than the underlying information.the proposed evidence is thus subject to the rules governing opinion testimony and was properly held inadmissible.see,gomez great lakes steel div.steel,cir proposed exhibit was improperly admitted because,despite being labeled summary of actual damages,it projected future events and economic losses,and was therefore not a simple compilation of voluminous records.state office,olivetti,cir projections of future lost profits set forth in a summary are not legitimately admissible as summaries under rule,since they are interpretations of past data and projections of future events,not a simple compilation of voluminous records.
in denying the plaintiffs leave to engage an expert to replace crowley,the district court was within its power under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to make and enforce scheduling orders.rule gives the district courts wide latitude to manage discovery and other pretrial matters,and to set deadlines for amending pleadings,filing motions,and completing discovery.subsection b provides that scheduling orders shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge.this court and others have frequently upheld a trial court exercise of discretion to deny a party motion to add experts or other fact witnesses after the close of discovery or after a deadline in a scheduling order,burks.publ g,cir geiserman macdonald,cir koplove ford motor,cir.
in this case,the reopened discovery on remand closed in january of.as the defendants note,the plaintiffs were obligated under federal rule of civil procedure a c to disclose early in the case,at or within days after the discovery planning conference required by rule f,a computation of any category of damages claimed and the documents or other evidentiary material,not privileged or protected from disclosure,on which such damage computation is based the plaintiffs did not submit that information until may,several months after the reopened discovery had closed,and nearly seven years into this litigation.although the district court pressed plaintiffs counsel about plaintiffs plan to proceed without expert testimony on the issue of damages,and although the court told plaintiffs counsel that defendants have to know what claims a plaintiff is going to pursue in terms of damages in order to be able to prepare for it,the plaintiffs insisted that no expert testimony was necessary.the district court then reopened discovery again to allow the defendants to depose crowley.the plaintiffs did not request leave to present a damages expert until after the defendants filed their motion to exclude crowley.the district court considered the plaintiffs explanation for the lateness of their request,the prejudice that would result if it were granted or denied,and the extent to which the plaintiffs decision to proceed without expert testimony was a deliberate one.under the circumstances,the district court was well within its discretion to deny the plaintiffs motion.
section of erisa,makes it unlawful for an employer to act against an employee for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant might become entitled under a benefit plan.section concludes with the statement that t he provisions of section,erisa of this title shall be applicable in the enforcement of this section.the supreme court has held that the remedies available for a violation of are thus limited to those set forth in a of erisa.mcclendon,d pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.mut.life ins.russell,d see also cox keystone carbon,cir explicitly rejecting the argument that once congress created a right pursuant to,congress was without power to restrict the remedies available and it is entirely up to the court to fashion appropriate remedies.
though the parties dispute the scope and application of subsections a b and a,they do not suggest that any other portions of erisa apply to this case.
the district court held that the plaintiffs could not seek relief under erisa a b because that section only provides relief for violations of the terms of a benefit plan,and the plaintiffs have not alleged such a violation.we agree.
subsection a b provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b emphasis added.the subsection thus provides a cause of action only where a plaintiff alleges a violation of the terms of a benefits plan or an ambiguity in the plan requiring judicial interpretation.in holding that subsection a b is not an appropriate vehicle for enforcing a claim of interference with the benefits of a plan,which is the gravamen of the claim here,the seventh circuit explained 
t o enforce the terms of a plan under section,the participant must first qualify for the benefits provided in that plan.rather than concerning itself with these qualifications,one of the actions which section makes unlawful is the interference with a participant ability to meet these qualifications in the first instance.
tolle carroll touch,cir citation omitted.this appears to be the view of the few courts that have squarely confronted the issue.see strom goldman,sachs,cir citing tolle russell northrop grumman,citing tolle.other courts have implicitly taken this view by indicating in dicta that a is the provision available for enforcing a interference claim.see millsap mcdonnell douglas,cir section a of erisa provides the plan participant with his exclusive remedies for a violation.spinelli gaughan,cir quoting a as the enforcement mechanism for rights under custer pan am.life ins,cir section,enforced through a,a,provides a companion to a,which provides actions to recover benefits or clarify rights.held mfrs.hanover leasing,cir if discharging the plaintiff was unlawful under,plaintiff was entitled to bring and did bring an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under,which authorizes the relief set forth in erisa a.dana muir,erisa remedies chimera or congressional compromise,iowa,nn.many commentators and courts agree that section a provides the sole basis for suits alleging a violation of section.decisions from at least one court appear to take the opposite view.see zimmerman sloss,the remedies for a violation of erisa are those set forth in erisa a b and a.babich unisys,wl,at the damages available to an erisa plaintiff are found in erisa enforcement provision,a b and a.citing zimmerman and cox keystone carbon,cir 
we agree with the seventh circuit reasoning in tolle,which follows from a straightforward reading of the statute.subsection a b provides remedies only against a defendant who has failed to comply with the terms of a benefits plan.it allows plaintiffs to collect benefits due under the terms of the plan or to enforce rights under the terms of the plan.here,the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants interfered with their ability to become eligible for further benefits,not that the defendants have breached the terms of the plan itself.we therefore agree with the district court that subsection a b does not provide relief for the violation of erisa that the plaintiffs have alleged,and,accordingly,summary judgment on the issue was proper.
the plaintiffs argue that this court decisions in cox keystone carbon,cir cox i and cox keystone carbon,cir cox ii,and the tenth circuit decision in adams cyprus amax minerals,cir,support a different result.in this they are mistaken.
the plaintiffs principal argument appears to be that,although they have not alleged that the defendants violated the terms of the benefits plan,the district court could nevertheless effectively create a violation of the plan through a decree ordering lucent to adjust its pension records to treat the plaintiffs as if they had remained at lucent until retirement.the plaintiffs contend that such an order would result in an immediate obligation on the part of the defendants to pay the plaintiffs money that was rendered past due by operation of the court decree,thus entitling the plaintiffs to seek relief under subsection a b.this bootstrap approach finds no support in the decisions the plaintiffs cite.
the tenth circuit opinion in adams is inapposite,as the plaintiffs in that case alleged violations of the terms of a plan rather than interference with the attainment of benefits.the court in adams was not asked to construct a violation of an order and then treat that violation as if it were a violation of the terms of a benefit plan.the court was simply asked to construe the terms of the plan itself to determine whether the plaintiffs were eligible for the benefits they sought.at.unlike the plaintiffs in this case,the plaintiffs in adams alleged a violation of the terms of their former employer plan and were thus clearly entitled to seek relief under erisa a b.here,by contrast,the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants interfered with their ability to become eligible for benefits,which,as the seventh circuit explained in tolle,is not a proper basis for relief under a b.
although cox i and cox ii involved claims under erisa,they are also unavailing as support for the plaintiffs argument.in cox i,this court indicated in dictum that could be enforced through a b when an claim is alleged.at.however,that appears to have been a proposition assumed by the parties and accepted by us without analysis or discussion.moreover,we expressly declined to decide whether a b provided any relief to the plaintiff in that case.id.at.instead,we remanded for the district court to determine in the first instance if cox is entitled to relief pursuant to a b,and if so,whether or not cox is entitled to a jury trial on this claim.id.
on remand,the district court held that cox had stated a claim enforceable under a b,but that he was not entitled to a jury trial and that he lost on the merits of that claim.cox appealed,and we affirmed in cox ii.as in cox i,the primary focus of our discussion was whether cox was entitled to a jury trial.at.we did not undertake any analysis of whether the district court had correctly held that a claim under could be enforced under a b.the only comment we made that appears directly relevant to this issue undermines,rather than supports the plaintiffs position in this case.in disposing of cox arguments,we stated,t o the extent that cox seeks compensatory damages for tortious interference,that claim does not fall within section a b.at.our decisions in cox i and cox ii thus do not conflict with the seventh circuit reasoning in tolle,nor do they prevent us from adopting that reasoning in this case,as the district court did.because we find that reasoning persuasive,we hold that a claim for interference with benefits is not enforceable under a b.
the district court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to appropriate equitable relief under erisa a because they had waived their right to request equitable restitution or injunctive relief.alternatively,the district court ruled that,even if the plaintiffs had not waived any of their rights with respect to a remedy,the relief they requested was not appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of the statute.we agree on the latter point and,therefore,do not reach the question of waiver.
section a of erisa,a,provides 
a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary 
a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or 
b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief 
i to redress such violations or 
ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan 
emphasis added.the supreme court has held that the phrase appropriate equitable relief means only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity in the days of the divided bench,life annuity ins.knudson,d quoting mertens hewitt,d original emphasis.according to the supreme court,such relief includes injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.mertens,at.thus,a plaintiff seeking relief under erisa a must tie that request to a form of relief typically available in equity.in,the court suggested that the basic contours of the term equitable relief are well known,and can be understood by consulting standard current works such as dobbs,palmer,corbin,and the restatements,which make the answer clear.at.see also sereboff mid atl.med,d referring to dobbs,palmer,and pomeroy equity jurisprudence to explain the contours of the right to an equitable lien.
as earlier noted,the plaintiffs sought a decree from the district court requiring lucent to adjust its pension records retroactively to create an obligatio
