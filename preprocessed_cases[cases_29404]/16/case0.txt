petitioner directv,and its customers entered into a service agreement that included a binding arbitration provision with a waiver.it specified that the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable if the law of your state made waivers unenforceable.the agreement also declared that the arbitration clause was governed by the federal arbitration act.at the time that respondents,california residents,entered into that agreement with directv,california law made waivers unenforceable,see discover bank superior court,cal.this court subsequently held in mobility llc concepcion,however,that california discover bank rule was by the federal arbitration act.
when respondents sued petitioner,the trial court denied directv request to order the matter to arbitration,and the california court of appeal affirmed.the court thought that california law would render waivers unenforceable,so it held the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable under the agreement.the fact that the federal arbitration act that california law did not change the result,the court said,because the parties were free to refer in the contract to california law as it would have been absent federal.the court reasoned that the phrase law of your state was both a specific provision that should govern more general provisions and an ambiguous provision that should be construed against the drafter.therefore,the court held,the parties had in fact included california law as it would have been without federal.
held because the california court of appeal interpretation is by the federal arbitration act,that court must enforce the arbitration agreement.
a no one denies that lower courts must follow concepcion,but that elementary point of law does not resolve the case because the parties are free to choose the law governing an arbitration provision,including california law as it would have been if not.the state court interpreted the contract to mean that the parties did so,and the interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a matter of state law to which this court defers,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.the issue here is not whether the court decision is a correct statement of california law but whether it is consistent with the federal arbitration act.
b the california court interpretation does not place arbitration contracts on equal footing with all other contracts,buckeye check cashing,cardegna,because california courts would not interpret contracts other than arbitration contracts the same way.several considerations lead to this conclusion.
first,the phrase law of your state is not ambiguous and takes its ordinary meaning valid state law.second,california case law that under general contract principles,references to california law incorporate the california legislature power to change the law retroactively,doe harris,cal,clarifies any doubt about how to interpret it.third,because the court nowhere suggests that california courts would reach the same interpretation in any other context,its conclusion appears to reflect the subject matter,rather than a general principle that would include state statutes invalidated by other federal law.fourth,the language the court uses to frame the issue focuses only on arbitration.fifth,the view that state law retains independent force after being authoritatively invalidated is one courts are unlikely to apply in other contexts.sixth,none of the principles of contract interpretation relied on by the california court suggests that other california courts would reach the same interpretation elsewhere.the court applied the canon that contracts are construed against the drafter,but the lack of any similar case interpreting similar language to include invalid laws indicates that the antidrafter canon would not lead california courts to reach a similar conclusion in cases not involving arbitration.

on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california,second appellate district 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal arbitration act states that a written provision in a contract providing for settle ment by arbitration of a controversy arising out of that contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we here consider a california court refusal to enforce an arbitration provision in a contract.in our view,that decision does not rest upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract,and we consequently set that judgment aside.
directv,the petitioner,entered into a service agreement with its customers,including respondents amy imburgia and kathy greiner.section of that contract provides that any claim either of us asserts will be resolved only by binding arbitration.app.it then sets forth a waiver of class arbitration,stating that n either you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration.at.it adds that if the law of your state makes the waiver of class arbitration unenforceable,then the entire arbitration provision is unenforceable.at.section of the contract states that,the arbitration provision,shall be governed by the federal arbitration act.ibid.
in,the two respondents brought this lawsuit against directv in a california state court.they seek damages for early termination fees that they believe violate california law.after various proceedings not here relevant,directv,pointing to the arbitration provision,asked the court to send the matter to arbitration.the state trial court denied that request,and directv appealed.
the california court of appeal thought that the critical legal question concerned the meaning of the contractual phrase law of your state,in this case the law of california.does the law of california make the contract waiver unenforceable if so,as the contract provides,the entire arbitration provision is unenforceable.or does california law permit the parties to agree to waive the right to proceed as a class in arbitration if so,the arbitration provision is enforceable.
at one point,the law of california would have made the contract waiver unenforceable.in,the california supreme court held in discover bank superior court,cal,that a waiver of class arbitration in a consumer contract of adhesion that predictably involve s small amounts of damages and meets certain other criteria not contested here is unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.see cohen directv,cal.app,cal.rptr,holding a waiver similar to the one at issue here unenforceable pursuant to discover bank see also consumers legal remedies act,cal.civ.code ann,a west invalidating waivers for claims brought under that statute.but in,this court held that california discover bank rule stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress embodied in the federal arbitration act.mobility llc concepcion,quoting hines davidowitz,see sanchez valencia holding,llc,cal,holding that concepcion applies to the consumers legal remedies act to the extent that it would have the same effect as discover bank.the federal arbitration act therefore and invalidates that rule,at see,art.vi,cl.
the california court of appeal subsequently held in this case that,despite this court holding in concepcion,the law of california would find the class action waiver unenforceable.cal.app,cal.rptr.the court noted that discover bank had held agreements to dispense with procedures unenforceable under circumstances such as these.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.it conceded that this court in concepcion had held that the federal arbitration act invalidated california rule.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.but it then concluded that this latter circumstance did not change the result that the class action waiver is unenforceable under california law.at,cal.rptr,at.
in reaching that conclusion,the court of appeal referred to two sections of california consumers legal remedies act,a,rather than discover bank itself.see cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.section renders invalid any waiver of the right under a to bring a class action for violations of that act.the court of appeal thought that applying state law alone that is,those two sections would render unenforceable the waiver in of the contract,at,cal.rptr,at.but it nonetheless recognized that if it applied federal law then the class action waiver is enforceable and any state law to the contrary is preempted.ibid.as far as those sections apply to waivers,they embody the discover bank rule.the california supreme court has recognized as much,see sanchez,supra,at,at,and no party argues to the contrary.see supp.brief for respondents the ruling in sanchez tracks respondents position precisely we shall consequently refer to the rule as the discover bank rule.
the court reasoned that just as the parties were free in their contract to refer to the laws of different states or different nations,so too were they free to refer to california law as it would have been without this court holding invalidating the discover bank rule.the court thought that the parties in their contract had done just that.and it set forth two reasons for believing so.
first,of the contract,stating that the federal arbitration act governs the arbitration provision,is a general provision.but the provision voiding arbitration if the law of your state would find the waiver unenforceable is a specific provision.the court believed that the specific provision is paramount to and must govern the general.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at quoting prouty gores technology group,cal.app,cal.rptr,brackets omitted.
second,the court said that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton.directv had drafted the language to void the arbitration provision was against its interest.hence the arbitration provision was void.the court of appeal consequently affirmed the trial court denial of directv motion to enforce the arbitration provision.
the california supreme court denied discretionary review.app.to pet.for cert.directv then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari,noting that the ninth circuit had reached the opposite conclusion on precisely the same interpretive question decided by the california court of appeal.murphy directv.we granted the petition.
no one denies that lower courts must follow this court holding in concepcion.the fact that concepcion was a closely divided case,resulting in a decision from which four justices dissented,has no bearing on that undisputed obligation.lower court judges are certainly free to note their disagreement with a decision of this court.but the supremacy clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.howlett rose,khan state oil,vacated.the federal arbitration act is a law of the united states,and concepcion is an authoritative interpretation of that act.consequently,the judges of every state must follow it,art.vi,cl.t he judges in every state shall be bound by the laws of the united states 
while all accept this elementary point of law,that point does not resolve the issue in this case.as the court of appeal noted,the federal arbitration act allows parties to an arbitration contract considerable latitude to choose what law governs some or all of its provisions,including the law governing enforceability of a waiver.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.in principle,they might choose to have portions of their contract governed by the law of tibet,the law of russia,or as is relevant here the law of california including the discover bank rule and irrespective of that rule invalidation in concepcion.the court of appeal decided that,as a matter of contract law,the parties did mean the phrase law of your state to refer to this last possibility.since the interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a matter of state law to which we defer,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior,we must decide not whether its decision is a correct statement of california law but whether assuming it is that state law is consistent with the federal arbitration act.
although we may doubt that the court of appeal has correctly interpreted california law,we recognize that california courts are the ultimate authority on that law.while recognizing this,we must decide whether the decision of the california court places arbitration contracts on equal footing with all other contracts.buckeye check cashing,cardegna.and in doing so,we must examine whether the court of appeal decision in fact rests upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.that is to say,we look not to grounds that the california court might have offered but rather to those it did in fact offer.neither this approach nor our result steps beyond concepcion or any other aspect of federal arbitration law.see post,at ginsburg,dissenting hereinafter the dissent.
we recognize,as the dissent points out,post,at,that when directv drafted the contract,the parties likely believed that the words law of your state included california law that then made waivers unenforceable.but that does not answer the legal question before us.that is because this court subsequently held in concepcion that the discover bank rule was invalid.thus the underlying question of contract law at the time the court of appeal made its decision was whether the law of your state included invalid california law.we must now decide whether answering that question in the affirmative is consistent with the federal arbitration act.after examining the grounds upon which the court of appeal rested its decision,we conclude that california courts would not interpret contracts other than arbitration contracts the same way.rather,several considerations lead us to conclude that the court interpretation of this arbitration contract is unique,restricted to that field.
first,we do not believe that the relevant contract language is ambiguous.the contract says that i f the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,then this entire section the arbitration section is unenforceable.app.absent any indication in the contract that this language is meant to refer to invalid state law,it presumably takes its ordinary meaning valid state law.indeed,neither the parties nor the dissent refer us to any contract case from california or from any other state that interprets similar language to refer to state laws authoritatively held to be invalid.while we recognize that the dissent believes this phrase to be ambiguous,post,at,or anomalous,post,at,we can not agree with that characterization.
second,california case law itself clarifies any doubt about how to interpret the language.the california supreme court has held that under general contract principles,references to california law incorporate the california legislature power to change the law retroactively.see doe harris,cal,holding that plea agreements,which are governed by general contract principles,are deemed to incorporate and contemplate not only the existing law but the reserve power of the state to amend the law or enact additional laws quoting people gipson,cal.app,cal.rptr.and judicial construction of a statute ordinarily applies retroactively.rivers roadway express.as far as we are aware,the principle of california law announced in harris,not the court of appeal decision here,would ordinarily govern the scope of phrases such as law of your state.
third,nothing in the court of appeal reasoning suggests that a california court would reach the same interpretation of law of your state in any context other than arbitration.the court of appeal did not explain why parties might generally intend the words law of your state to encompass invalid law of your state.to the contrary,the contract refers to state law that makes the waiver of class arbitration unenforceable,while an state law would not make a contractual provision unenforceable.assuming as we must that the court reasoning is a correct statement as to the meaning of law of your state in this arbitration provision,we can find nothing in that opinion nor in any other california case suggesting that california would generally interpret words such as law of your state to include state laws held invalid because they conflict with,say,federal labor statutes,federal pension statutes,federal antidiscrimination laws,the equal protection clause,or the like.even given our assumption that the court of appeal conclusion is correct,its conclusion appears to reflect the subject matter at issue here arbitration,rather than a general principle that would apply to contracts using similar language but involving state statutes invalidated by other federal law.
fourth,the language used by the court of appeal focused only on arbitration.the court asked whether law of your state mean s the law of your state to the extent it is not preempted by the federal arbitration act,or the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect,if any of the federal arbitration act.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.framing the question in such terms,rather than in generally applicable terms,suggests that the court of appeal could well have meant that its holding was limited to the specific subject matter of this contract arbitration.
fifth,the court of appeal reasoned that invalid state arbitration law,namely the discover bank rule,maintained legal force despite this court holding in concepcion.the court stated that i f we apply state law alone to the class action waiver,then the waiver is unenforceable.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.and at the end of its opinion it reiterated that t he class action waiver is unenforceable under california law,so the entire arbitration agreement is unenforceable.at,cal.rptr,at.but those statements do not describe california law.see concepcion,at,sanchez,cal,at,at.the view that state law retains independent force even after it has been authoritatively invalidated by this court is one courts are unlikely to accept as a general matter and to apply in other contexts.
sixth,there is no other principle invoked by the court of appeal that suggests that california courts would reach the same interpretation of the words law of your state in other contexts.the court said that the phrase law of your state constitutes a specific exception to the agreement general adoption of the federal arbitration act.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at.but that tells us nothing about how to interpret the words law of your state elsewhere.it does not answer the relevant question whether those words encompass laws that have been authoritatively held invalid.prouty,cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at specific words govern only when a general and a particular provision are inconsistent 
the court added that it would interpret ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it,namely directv.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at quoting mastrobuono,at.the dissent adopts a similar argument.see post,at.but,as we have pointed out,supra,at,were the phrase law of your state ambiguous,surely some court would have construed that term to incorporate state laws invalidated by,for example,federal labor law,federal pension law,or federal civil rights law.yet,we have found no such case.moreover,the reach of the canon construing contract language against the drafter must have limits,no matter who the drafter was.the fact that we can find no similar case interpreting the words law of your state to include invalid state laws indicates,at the least,that the antidrafter canon would not lead california courts to reach a similar conclusion in similar cases that do not involve arbitration.
taking these considerations together,we reach a conclusion that,in our view,falls well within the confines of and goes no further than present law.california interpretation of the phrase law of your state does not place arbitration contracts on equal footing with all other contracts,buckeye check cashing,at.for that reason,it does not give due regard to the federal policy favoring arbitration.volt information sciences,at.thus,the court of appeal interpretation is by the federal arbitration act.see perry thomas,noting that the federal arbitration act decisions that take their meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue hence,the california court of appeal must enforc e the arbitration agreement.
the judgment of the california court of appeal is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

it has become routine,in a large part due to this court decisions,for powerful economic enterprises to write into their form contracts with consumers and employees arbitration clauses.the form contract in this case contains a delphic provision stating that if the law of your state does not permit agreements barring class arbitration,then the entire agreement to arbitrate becomes unenforceable,freeing the aggrieved customer to commence litigation in court.this court reads that provision in a manner most protective of the drafting enterprise.i would read it,as the california court did,to give the customer,not the drafter,the benefit of the doubt.acknowledging the precedent so far set by the court,i would take no further step to disarm consumers,leaving them without effective access to justice.
this case began as a putative class action in state court claiming that directv,by imposing hefty fees,violated california legislation,including the consumers legal remedies act clra,cal.civ.code ann.et west.app.directv did not initially seek to stop the lawsuit and compel bilateral arbitration.see,at.the reason for directv failure to oppose the litigation is no mystery.the version of directv service agreement applicable in this case the version requires consumers to arbitrate all disputes and to forgo class arbitration,at.if the relevant provision stopped there,the court recent precedent,see american express italian colors restaurant,mobility llc concepcion,would control,and directv could have resisted the lawsuit.but directv form contract continued the entire arbitration clause is unenforceable i f the law of your state would find unenforceable the agreement prohibition.app.at the time imburgia and greiner commenced their court action,bars like the one in directv agreement were per se unenforceable as unconscionable under the law of california.see discover bank superior court,cal.
nearly three years into the litigation,this court held in concepcion,at,that the federal arbitration act faa,et,preempts state rules that render bans unenforceable.directv then moved to halt the lawsuit and compel bilateral arbitration.app.to pet.for cert.the california superior court denied directv motion,no.super.los angeles,app.to pet.for cert,and the california court of appeal affirmed.the court of appeal first observed that,under the california law directv confronted when it drafted the clause in question,provisions relinquishing the right to proceed under the clra on behalf of a class would not be enforced.cal.app,cal.rptr.the question dispositive of directv motion,the california court explained,trains on the meaning of the atypical contractual phrase the law of your state does it mean the law of your state to the extent it is not preempted by the faa,or the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect,if any,of the faa at,cal.rptr,at.
in resolving this question,the california court emphasized that directv drafted the service agreement,giving its customers no say in the matter,and reserving to itself the right to modify the agreement unilaterally at any time,at,cal.rptr,at.see also brief for respondents.directv used the same contract everywhere it did business.ibid.t o protect the party who did not choose the language from an unintended or unfair result,the california court applied the rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton.that rule was particularly appropriate in this case,the court reasoned,for,as a practical matter,it seems unlikely that plaintiffs anticipated in that the supreme court would hold in that the faa preempts protection against compelled waivers.cal.app,at,cal.rptr,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court today holds that the california court of appeal interpreted the language in directv service agreement so unreasonably as to suggest discrimination against arbitration in violation of the faa.ante,at.as i see it,the california court interpretation of the law of your state provision is not only reasonable,it is entirely right.
arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.animalfeeds int l,internal quotation marks omitted.the faa requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate,like other contracts,in accordance with their terms.volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.t he interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law,which this court does not sit to review.at.see also first options of chicago,kaplan,when interpreting arbitration agreements,courts should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts historically,this court has respected interpretations of arbitration agreements.see mastrobuono,at,volt information sciences,at.indeed,in the more than years between volt information sciences and this case,not once has this court reversed a decision on the ground that the state court misapplied state contract law when it determined the meaning of a term in a particular arbitration agreement.today decision is a dangerous first.
beyond genuine debate,directv originally meant the law of your state clause to refer to its customer home state law untouched by federal preemption.as directv explained in a filing,the clause prevented enforcement of the arbitration agreement in those states,california among them,where the proscription was unenforceable as a matter of state law,while requiring bilateral arbitration in states that did not outlaw purported waivers of class proceedings.app.the customer agreement between directv and its customers provides that the customer home state laws will govern the relationship,and that any disputes will be resolved in individual arbitration if the customer home state laws enforce the parties arbitration agreement.emphasis added.
according to directv,because the ban,is enforceable in all states,this case must now be resolved,if at all,in bilateral arbitration.the court agrees.after concepcion,the court maintains,it no longer matters whether directv meant california home state laws when it drafted the version of its service agreement.but concepcion held only that a state can not compel a party to engage in class arbitration when the controlling agreement unconditionally prohibits class procedures.see,at arbitration is a matter of contract,and the faa requires courts to honor parties expectations,so parties may consent to class procedures even though such procedures may not be required by state law.just as a contract itself may provide for class arbitration,so the parties may choose to be bound by a particular state law,in this case,the clra,even if the faa would otherwise displace that state law.hall street associates,mattel,t he faa lets parties tailor some,even many,features of arbitration by contract,including procedure and choice of substantive law.in principle,the court acknowledges,parties might choose to have portions of their contract governed by the law of tibet,or the law of russia.ante,at see brief for petitioner observing that the faa would allow parties to bind themselves by reference to the rules of a board game russian law,but not california home state laws operative and unquestionably valid in makes little sense to me.
nothing in concepcion or the faa nullifies provisions of the clra.they hold sway when parties elect judicial resolution of their disputes,and should similarly control when parties choose that law to govern their arbitration agreements.see volt information sciences,at where parties had incorporat ed california rules of arbitration into their agreement,they had no right to compel arbitration on terms inconsistent with those california rules thus,even after concepcion,one could properly refer to the clra proscription as california law.to repeat,the dispositive question in this case is whether the parties intended the law of your state provision to mean state law as preempted by federal law,as the court today reads the provision,or home state law as framed by the california legislature,without considering the preemptive effect of federal law,as the california court read it.
the latter reading is the better one.directv had no occasion to refer to the law of its customer state had it meant to incorporate state law as preempted by the faa.that is,directv,like virtually every other company with a similar service agreement,could have employed a clause directly conditioning enforceability of the arbitration agreement on the exclusion of class arbitration.indeed,directv has done just that in service agreements both before and after.app.the version provides that a court may sever any portion of the arbitration agreement that it finds to be unenforceable,except for the prohibition on class or representative arbitration brief for respondents stating that the june version of directv agreement provides that a court may sever any portion of the arbitration agreement that it finds to be unenforceable,except for the prohibition on class arbitration internal quotation marks omitted.had directv followed this pattern in its form contract,the arbitration agreement,unquestionably would have been enforceable in all states.in the version,however,directv chose a different formulation,one referring to the law of its customer state.i would not translate that term to be synonymous with federal law.if directv meant to exclude the application of california legislation,it surely chose a bizarre way to accomplish that result.
as earlier noted,see supra,at,and as the california court appreciated,courts generally construe ambiguous contractual terms against the drafter.see mastrobuono,at respondents drafted an ambiguous document,and they can not now claim the benefit of the doubt.this rule of contract interpretation,at,reflects the principle that a party should not be permitted to write an ambiguous term,lock another party into agreeing to that term,and then reap the benefit of the ambiguity once a dispute emerges.the rule has particular force where,as here,a court is interpreting a standardized contrac t that was not the product of bilateral bargaining.restatement second of contracts,comment a.
allowing directv to reap the benefit of an ambiguity it could have avoided would ignore not just the hugely unequal bargaining power of the parties,but also their reasonable expectations at the time the contract was formed.see mastrobuono,at it is particularly appropriate to construe terms against the draf
