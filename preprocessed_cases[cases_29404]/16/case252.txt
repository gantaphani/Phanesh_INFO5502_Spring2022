rectrix aerodrome centers,rectrix is a tenant at the barnstable municipal airport that provides certain aviation services to planes using the airport.it sued the barnstable municipal airport commission bmac two airport commissioners,two airport managers,and its outside counsel,claiming that they prevented rectrix from competing with bmac in the sale of jet fuel.the district court dismissed some of rectrix claims and on others granted summary judgment against rectrix.the facts are as follows.
beginning in,rectrix operated a hangar at the barnstable municipal airport for private jets.rectrix lease with bmac provided that it could apply to bmac to expand the scope of rectrix operations and become what is known in the industry as a fixed base operator or fbo a service center that provides such things as fuel,oil,and hangar storage.at the time,bmac had in place a code of rules and regulations,which the parties refer to as the minimum standards,that imposed standards of operation and maintenance on fbos at the airport.rectrix says it did not see a copy of the minimum standards until.
these standards which have since been altered provided in article as follows 
a fixed base operator shall provide all fuel services,including the sale and storage of,and jet fuel,for as long as these grades are normally available for resale.the barnstable municipal airport commission may limit the types of fuel to be sold.
not surprisingly,in this controversy about rectrix ability to sell jet fuel,rectrix relies heavily on the first sentence barnstable,on the second.
according to bmac,at least since it has reserved for itself the right to sell jet fuel at the airport,has declined to allow fbos to do so,refused specifically on a prior occasion in to allow another fbo griffin avionics,to sell jet fuel,and has the blessing of both massachusetts law and the federal aviation administration faa for its right to follow this policy.rectrix claims that revenues generated by jet fuel sales were illegally diverted to help support the town as well as the airport,but bmac disputes any charge of unlawful conduct.
bmac also asserts that when rectrix first became a tenant in,it had full notice of this reservation.bmac points to a set of self service standards which are distinct from the minimum standards referenced august,that rectrix received prior to signing its lease this document says that a s the proprietor of the barnstable airport,the airport commission reserves the exclusive right unto itself to sell jet fuel on the barnstable airport.the lease thereafter signed with rectrix in august gave it the right to operate a hangar for corporate jets,but not to conduct fbo operations,and contained the following terms 
it is further agreed that lessee shall not conduct or permit to be conducted on said premises any flight schools,or aircraft refueling activities specifically related to,and including resale of aviation or jet fuels,all subject to below.
lessee may at any time during the term of this lease or additional terms thereof,submit in writing to the barnstable municipal airport commission,lessee desire to modify or expand its scope of operation.lessee agrees that any change in its scope of operation may be subject to negotiable rates and charges,with agreed upon terms and conditions to be executed by both parties on separate letters of agreement.
rectrix says it first learned of the minimum standards as opposed to the standards in may and that it obtained a copy of those standards only in june.soon after,in october,rectrix requested permission to expand its operations and become a fbo it says it wanted to become a fbo at this point because it believed that the minimum standards would give it the right to sell jet fuel 
rectrix says that to prevent it from selling jet fuel,bmac refused to give proper consideration to its application to become an fbo,delayed approval on other applications as well,and imposed operating restrictions that complicated rectrix ability to serve its customers.it says that it in various respects has been treated,to its disadvantage,differently than griffin avionics.after arguments back and forth with bmac,rectrix began the law suit that has led to this appeal.
in its complaint filed in federal district court,rectrix asserted a variety of claims against bmac and the individuals named above arising under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,the constitution and section,and federal and state antitrust laws.laws ch,along with various common law claims.
the district court granted a motion to dismiss rectrix antitrust claims,rectrix aerodome,barnstable mun.airport comm n,d rectrix i,and later granted summary judgment in favor of barnstable on its rico and section claims,rectrix aerodome,barnstable mun.airport comm n,d rectrix ii.the district court then declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.id.at.
rectrix now appeals both the grant of the motion to dismiss and the grant of summary judgment,both rulings being subject to de novo review.gargano liberty int l underwriters,cir paparo eternity,cir.we address first the rico and antitrust claims,both of which directly attack bmac restriction on jet fuel sales the remaining claim,complaining of a civil rights violation under section and the constitution,is considered thereafter.
rico.rectrix first,and most detailed,argument on appeal is that the district court erred in rejecting rectrix rico claim.a civil rico claim,c,requires proof of several elements including the existence of a racketeering enterprise and its conduct through a pattern of racketeering activity,which requires at least two acts of racketeering so related,id.the acts are ones specified in the statute and include mail and wire fraud as possible predicate acts.id,c.
rectrix claim of fraud rests at bottom on the proposition that it was entitled under the minimum standards then in force to sell jet fuel,that the defendants falsely represented that rectrix lacked that right and concealed the minimum standards until they were discovered by rectrix in,and that these acts of misrepresentation and concealment reflected a pattern of fraudulent acts that damaged rectrix and are within the purview of the rico statute.rectrix also says that the defendants diverted revenues thus gained to barnstable for its municipal use in violation of law and sought to conceal this as well.
the answer,as the district court ruled,rectrix ii,d at,is that the minimum standards did not entitle rectrix to sell jet fuel.those standards provide that an fbo operator must supply fuel,including jet fuel,but qualify this in the next sentence by saying that bmac may limit the types of fuels to be sold.before the lease was signed,and before rectrix ever sought fbo status,the standards bmac gave to rectrix told it that bmac reserves the exclusive right unto itself to sell jet fuel on the barnstable airport,and the lease itself expressly forbade rectrix from selling any fuel.
rectrix counters that the first sentence of the minimum standards describes jet fuel as a grade and the second sentence merely reserves bmac right to limit the particular types within the grade rectrix claiming there are separate types of jet fuel,such as jet,jet a,and jet b but the straightforward reading is that the word types refers to the varieties given in the prior sentence,and jet fuel.in addition,the lease itself forbids rectrix from providing any fuel.
it appears that the faa itself is content to have municipal airports reserve jet fuel sales to themselves,seemingly so as to allow airports to fund maintenance and improvements rectrix says that it was improper for bmac to funnel any of the jet fuel profits for municipal use and that bmac committed further acts of fraud by concealing this diversion from the faa.but whether or not the diversion occurred or was district court made no was the reservation to bmac of exclusive rights,not the diversion of bmac profits,that caused damage to rectrix.
finally,rectrix complains that when it sought fbo status,bmac engaged in delays,proposed burdensome terms and otherwise hindered its application and operation
