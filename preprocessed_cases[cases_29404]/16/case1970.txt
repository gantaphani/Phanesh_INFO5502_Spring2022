background 
on the afternoon of june,lori duniver discovered that her daughter,devan,was missing from her home in new philadelphia,ohio.the following day,devan body was found in a wooded area near her home.she had been stabbed seven times in the neck.
captain jeffrey urban urban of the new philadelphia police department led the investigation into devan murder.urban identified several persons of interest who might have killed devan,including devan mother,lori,who had recently called a suicide hotline to report that she was depressed and considering harming herself and her children lori boyfriend,jaimie redmond,a drug addict and felon of whom devan was afraid,who had previously kidnapped devan for three days and beaten her with a belt,who may have been in the neighborhood of devan house at the time of her disappearance,who was later found in possession of an unexplained pack of children playing cards,and whose alibi witness was later discovered to have given a false name and social security number to the police devan father,richard,a violent alcoholic who had recently complained about having to pay child support for devan and who refused to help lori search for devan after devan disappearance,claiming to be too drunk to drive devan brother,dylan,who was described by several individuals as violent and who had recently stabbed a cat and harris,a,neighbor of the caucasian dunivan family.
harris had no criminal record,but he had once pushed or struck devan in the arm and threatened to kill her,and he was seen,soon after devan disappearance,near the wooded area where her body would later be found.on the day after devan disappearance,before her body was found,harris approached urban and another officer and volunteered the statement that devan was a rude,nasty little girl who would eat in front of him.joint appendix at urban dep.at.several days later,when questioned by urban about his whereabouts at the time of devan disappearance,harris gave conflicting answers.
on july,at urban request,harris mother,cyndi harris cyndi brought harris to the police station for a analysis vsa,which urban described as being similar to a polygraph,or,test.the vsa was to be conducted by millersburg,ohio police chief tom vaughn vaughn.upon harris arrival at the station,vaughn took him into a room with a mirror,while urban and cyndi sat in an adjacent room from which they could,through the mirror,see but not hear the conversation between vaughn and harris.cyndi was told that vaughn would conduct a interview to relax harris and then perform the vsa.
once inside the interview room,however,vaughn informed harris of his rights and then proceeded to interrogate him about the murder.under vaughn persistent questioning,harris confessed to having killed devan,but many aspects of harris confession conflicted with the known facts of the murder.when asked to provide a written statement,harris asked to speak with his mother and then immediately recanted his confession.
upon learning that harris had confessed,urban telephoned spies,the tuscarawas county chief prosecutor,who came to the station and listened to the tape of vaughn interrogation and harris confession.at spies direction,urban then arrested harris and transported him to a detention facility.
harris was subsequently tried in a juvenile court and convicted of the murder of devan duniver.on march,he was sentenced to a term of incarceration to last until his birthday.on june,however,the ohio court of appeals reversed his conviction,on the ground that the juvenile court had improperly denied a motion to suppress his confession,which was coerced in violation of his fifth amendment privilege against.in re harris,wl oh.june.
on june,harris was released from prison.spies held a press conference that day,at which she stated,f rankly,in my heart and in my gut,i feel that anthony harris is responsible for the murder of devan duniver.at spies dep.at.no further charges were ever filed against harris,and no one has since been arrested for or convicted of devan murder.
harris filed the instant suit in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio in august.the following year,he applied to enlist in the marine corps.during the application process,he disclosed to marine corps master sergeant mark baker baker that he had been convicted of and incarcerated for murder and that the conviction had later been reversed.harris signed a release permitting the marine corps to access the police and court records pertaining to his criminal case.baker then instructed marine corps staff sergeant william brahen brahen to go to the new philadelphia courthouse and retrieve those records.
when brahen arrived in spies office and requested the documents,spies reacted by saying,in a hostile tone of voice,a re you fucking kidding me at brahen dep.at.she asked brahen to accompany her to a conference room,where she proceeded to tell him a little bit about the case and what happened.at brahen dep.at.she asked brahen whether the marine corps would actually take anthony harris into the marines.id.brahen dep.at.brahen became uncomfortable and asked spies to speak with baker on the telephone.spies agreed and proceeded to inform baker that harris would always be a suspect in the murder of devan duniver because there were no other suspects.she also mentioned that harris had filed the instant civil suit against her.the marine corps subsequently declined to allow harris to enlist,citing his continuing status as a suspect in the murder and the fact that his conviction had been reversed on a technicality.
in his amended complaint,harris asserts claims for fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendment violations and first amendment retaliation,pursuant to a conspiracy to interfere with his civil rights,pursuant to and ohio claims for aiding and abetting,malicious prosecution,defamation,and tortious interference with a prospective business relationship.after harris settled his claims against all of the other defendants,spies and tuscarawas moved for summary judgment on all of his claims against them.on may,the district court granted the motion,dismissing with prejudice all of harris claims.harris now appeals.

the district court possessed jurisdiction over harris federal claims pursuant to and supplemental jurisdiction over harris state claims pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction over harris appeal from the district court final judgment pursuant to.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.the moving party bears the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.plant morton int l,cir.once the movant has satisfied its burden,the nonmoving party must produce evidence showing that a genuine issue remains.id.
the court must credit all evidence presented by the nonmoving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party favor.id.the nonmovant must,however,do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.summary judgment is proper when the nonmoving party has had adequate time for discovery and yet fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex,at.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see,spencer bouchard,cir.
absolute immunity 
in the district court,spies argued that she was entitled to both absolute and qualified immunity for her alleged role in deciding that harris should be arrested on the day of his confession.the district court determined that spies could not invoke absolute immunity,because she did not make the arrest decision within the scope of her role as an advocate,but that she was entitled to qualified immunity,because she reasonably concluded that probable cause existed to support the arrest.
the analytical key to prosecutorial immunity is the actions in question are those of an advocate.skinner govorchin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the challenged actions of the prosecutor were not performed in his role as advocate,if they do not relate to an advocate preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings,then only qualified immunity applies.id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.in other words,p rosecutors are not absolutely immune when they perform administrative,investigative,or other functions.holloway brush,cir en banc.
in ireland tunis,cir,cert.denied,d,we elaborated on the distinction between prosecutorial actions that are and those that are not protected by absolute immunity 
absolute prosecutorial immunity is justified only for actions that are connected with the prosecutor role in judicial proceedings,not for every conduct.a prosecutor is therefore absolutely immune from suit for soliciting false testimony from witnesses and participating in a probable cause hearing that led to the issuance of a search warrant,but not for giving legal advice to the police regarding the use of hypnosis as an investigative technique and the existence of probable cause to arrest.for this latter type of prosecutorial activity,administrative or investigative acts unrelated to judicial proceedings,qualified immunity is all that is available.
id.at emphasis added internal citations omitted quoting burns reed,d.
subsequently,in prince hicks,cir,we affirmed the denial of absolute immunity to a prosecutor who advised police that probable cause existed to arrest a suspect.in so holding,we relied upon the supreme court opinion in burns reed,d.
in burns,two police officers investigating a shooting of two boys suspected that the mother had multiple personalities and may have been responsible for the crime.the two officers contacted the chief deputy prosecutor to inquire as to the legality of subjecting the mother to hypnosis.the prosecutor advised the police officers that they could proceed.after the hypnosis session,upon hearing the statements the mother had made,the prosecutor advised the officers that they probably had probable cause to arrest the mother.the supreme court held that advising the police in the investigative phase of a criminal case is not so intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process that it qualifies for absolute immunity.the court added,it is incongruous to allow prosecutors to be absolutely immune from liability for giving advice to the police,but to allow police officers only qualified immunity for following the advice.
prince,at internal citations omitted quoting burns,at.
in this case,urban testified that he arrested harris because spies told him to,and that he had no input into the decision to make the arrest.at urban dep.at.as this testimony demonstrates,and as spies does not deny spies went beyond merely advising the police she instructed them to arrest harris,without soliciting any officer opinion.accordingly,the district court correctly determined that spies was acting in an administrative or investigative capacity and is,therefore,not entitled to absolute immunity.
qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity precludes actions for damages against government officials on the basis of discretionary actions that do not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.williams mehra,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.we analyze claims of qualified immunity using a test,which requires us to determine whether a constitutional right was violated whether that right was clearly established and one of which a reasonable person would have known and whether the official action was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.id.in other words,an arresting agent is entitled to qualified immunity if he or she could reasonably even if erroneously have believed that the arrest was lawful,in light of clearly established law and the information possessed at the time by the arresting agent.hunter bryant,d.
the substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.united states romero,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.in determining whether an arrest is supported by probable cause,we look to the totality of the circumstances.id.at.we consider only the information possessed by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.id.at see also wolfe perry,cir.
a finding of probable cause does not require evidence that is completely convincing or even evidence that would be admissible at trial all that is required is that the evidence be sufficient to lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the arrestee has committed or is committing a crime.united states shaw,cir.a mere suspicion of criminality,however,is insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.williams ex rel.allen cambridge bd.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court concluded that spies had a reasonable basis for concluding that probable cause supported harris arrest,because harris confession was corroborated by substantial evidence.at dist.mem.at.that evidence,according to the district court,included devan aunt report to the police that harris had previously threatened devan life the fact that harris was seen,near the time of devan disappearance,in the area where her body was later found the fact that harris told the police five different stories concerning his whereabouts and route home on the day of devan disappearance harris prior physical altercation with devan the confession itself and the subsequent recovery of a knife that was,for a time,suspected to be the murder weapon at dist.mem.at.
the district court erred,as a threshold matter,in concluding that spies was free to consider any part of harris confession in determining whether probable cause supported his arrest.on the contrary,any reasonable prosecutor in spies position would have known,after listening to the tape of the confession,that it was involuntary as a matter of law and thus untrustworthy.first,as the ohio appellate court held,any waiver of miranda rights was rendered involuntary by harris age,lack of any previous criminal history or experience,and physical separation from his mother,in addition to the intensity of the interview conducted by vaughn.harris,wl,at.more important,the techniques used by vaughn in questioning a child were coercive,irrespective of the effectiveness of the miranda warning.id.at.
in any event,harris attempts to give the answers demanded by vaughn clearly demonstrated that harris was unfamiliar with details of the crime that the perpetrator would have known.for instance,even after protracted coaxing and implicit threats by vaughn,harris could only guess at what devan might do to make him harris angry enough to hurt her throw a rock at him,perhaps,or use profanity or racial invective toward him.at suppression hr g tr.at.when vaughn continued to insist that harris was guilty and again asked him why he had become angry at devan,harris eventually responded,she hit me with a brick.at suppression hr g tr.at.harris was referring,of course,to the prior incident when he had pushed or struck devan after she threw a brick at him.
vaughn,however,took harris reference to that incident as an admission of guilt and pressed for incriminating details,which harris could not provide.when asked whether the murder weapon was a stick or a knife,harris replied,probably a pocket knife.at suppression hr g tr.at.he denied knowing whose knife it was pressed hard by vaughn,he said that it belonged to a friend of his mother or something and then stated that one of his own friends had it.id.he went on to describe,again,the prior incident when he had pushed devan after she threw a brick at him,noting that he had immediately told devan mother the truth about the incident.at suppression hr g tr.at.
when vaughn continued to insist that harris discuss the murder,and vaughn made a series of devan had run from harris in the woods,that harris had caught her and then stabbed her in the throat with a pocket finally broke down and said y es.id.he continued,however,to give factual answers at odds with the known details of the crime.he stated that he did not know how many times he had stabbed devan,denied that it was five o six times,and finally after vaughn suggested that it was o nce or twice said,probably twice.at suppression hr g tr.at.he denied having gotten blood on his hands when asked whether he had gotten blood on the pocket knife,he replied,probably a little.at suppression hr g tr.at.harris repeatedly stated that he did know or was sure of the answers to vaughn questions.id.when prodded by vaughn to describe the pocket knife,harris could not say whether the handle was black or silver,smooth or rough.at suppression hr g tr.at.despite an extensive search,no murder weapon was ever found.at spies dep.at.
when vaughn asked harris to write out his confession,harris asked for his mother.as soon as she entered the room,harris recanted his statement.although his mother questioned him pointedly and at length,harris remained adamant that he had not killed devan,that his responses to vaughn questions had been guesses,and that he had confessed because he was just scared and s ome of those questions were too hard.at suppression hr g tr.at.
spies listened to the recording of vaughn interrogation of harris as soon as she arrived at the police station and before she ordered harris arrest.at urban dep.at.accordingly,she should have known that harris confession was suspect and inherently untrustworthy because it was extracted from a child with no previous experience,outside the presence of his mother,through the use of intensive interrogation techniques.thus,the district court erred in concluding that the confession provided support for spies finding of probable cause for the arrest.see beck ohio,d holding that whether an arrest is supported by probable cause turns upon whether at the moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the arresting official knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense emphasis added.
after the elimination of harris confession from consideration,an examination of the remaining record indicates that the district court improperly relied upon disputed facts in concluding that the information possessed by spies supported her determination that probable cause existed to arrest harris.see,hale kart,cir if disputed factual issues underlying probable cause exist,those issues must be submitted to a jury for the jury to determine the appropriate facts.one such alleged fact was that,s uspiciously,harris gave the police at least five different versions about where he was and the route he took home before finally admitting the truth.at dist.mem.at.the district court based this conclusion upon urban testimony,at harris subsequent detention hearing,that i had about five stories i believe from anthony on how he got home that day.at detention hr g tr.at.according to urban,harris first told devan mother that he had walked home from school that day,and later told urban that he had been dropped off in front of a friend house the eckert house and had walked home from there had walked home from the eckert house,taking a route between a fence and the wooded area where devan body was found,a route that urban described as being east of the woods had walked home from the eckert house via a route that took him west of the woods,near robert plumbing and had walked home directly through the woods.at detention hr g tr.at.
as an initial matter,we note that there is no indication that spies was aware of this information at the time of harris arrest the day before the detention hearing,and thus the information should not have been considered in determining whether the arrest itself was supported by probable cause.hunter,at.describing the relevant considerations as clearly established law and the information the arresting officers possessed internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.in any event,descriptions and are not inconsistent with any of accounts through it is undisputed that harris went to school on the day of the murders and that he did arrive home on foot,notwithstanding an intervening stop at the eckert house.taking into consideration the fact that the declarant was a child being questioned about the details of one instance of a routine trip home from days after the fact a reasonable official would not have drawn an adverse inference from such a minor discrepancy as the omission of a stop at a friend house.
moreover,a review of the audiotape of urban interview of harris reveals that descriptions and were actually suggested by urban,not harris urban pointed to various spots on a map and suggested various routes that harris had taken,to which harris merely assented.at,dep.ex.at.harris eventually himself provided description,by pointing at the map and describing the path that he had taken through the woods.at dep.ex.at.when urban later asked why harris had initially indicated that he had skirted the woods instead of walking through them,harris responded,because i always walk around that and that where there people around those houses.at dep.ex.at.harris then reiterated that he was now certain that he had walked through the woods rather than around it on the day in question.id.again,viewed in context,these statements more likely indicate a confusion about which particular path he had followed on a specific day than a sense of guilt or an intent to deceive.
in addition,although it is true that a knife though not the murder weapon was found by police and awaiting testing by the time the hearing took place,no knife had yet been recovered at the time of harris arrest.at urban dep.at.finally,although harris admitted to having once engaged in a scuffle with devan,urban testimony at the hearing established that harris did not attack devan without provocation in that instance but,rather,knocked her down only after she threw a brick at him.at probable cause hr g tr.at he told us that devan had thrown a brick at him a week or two ago and that he had knocked her down and she had scraped herself up.that was the only other violence that i was aware of.
thus,the only evidence properly considered by the district court in determining whether harris arrest was supported by probable cause is the fact that harris was admittedly present,shortly after devan disappearance,in the wooded area where her body was later found the prior threat that he allegedly made against her and his previous act of striking or pushing her after she threw a brick at him.this evidence is insufficient to give rise to probable cause to arrest harris for devan murder.
first,it is that an individual mere presence at a crime scene does not constitute probable cause for an arrest.united states,cir holmes kucynda,cir united states ingrao,cir united states garcia,cir,cert.denied,d united states ashcroft,cir,cert.denied,d.furthermore,the supreme court has made clear that a probable cause finding may not be based upon information too vague and from too untested a source.wong sun united states,d.in this case,the only evidence cited by appellees in support of their assertion that harris had threatened devan consists of urban testimony that he was told by one of devan family members described variously as either an aunt or a stepmother that harris had,at some unspecified time and place,threatened to kill devan.appellees br.at at urban dep.at it depends on where we talking about on july,because i think it was either the or the first that i also received information that anthony had threatened to kill devan.and that increased my interest,at urban dep.at i think my first information came from duniver,which is a,i think his sic stepmother that anthony had or that devan had talked to her and said that anthony had threatened to kill her,at detention hr g tr.at urban testimony i learned that devan had told her aunt,prior to being brought home that saturday,that anthony had threatened to kill her,and those were her words.both the vagueness of the information and the impossibility of determining,on the record,even the identity to say nothing of the reliability of the source preclude a finding of probable cause based upon this information.
finally,the prior act of violence committed by harris against devan,appellees br.at,consisted of harris striking or pushing her in the arm after she threw a brick at act to which harris readily admitted and which he has described fairly consistently and an event of which devan mother was aware.at urban,ex,at tr.of july,conversation i just like,do you know her little brother dylan just like,hit her back,i mean i just tapped her softly,she tripped over on her feet and the gravely sic and she cut her stomach,i just tapped her softly,at suppression hr g tr.at vaughn interrogation recording i pushed her and she fell over on some stone and she went in the house,told her mom,her mom like yelled at me.i told her exactly what happened.i told her the truth what happened,i pushed her by accident,she fell,cutting herself on some rocks.this isolated squabble between neighbor children who often played together which apparently did not result in any substantial injury to devan,does not support a finding of probable cause to arrest harris for devan murder.
even considered cumulatively,this evidence indicates only that harris and devan,neighbors who played together every day,once had a squabble that a purported relative of devan,whose precise identity is unknown,may have said that harris had once threatened devan and that harris was seen on the day of the murder in an area that he frequented every day.this evidence would not lead a reasonable officer to conclude that harris had murdered devan.accordingly,we hold that harris arrest was unsupported by probable cause.moreover,it was clearly established at the time of harris arrest that the fourth amendment requires every arrest to be supported by probable cause,donovan thames,cir,the reasons set forth above,and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to harris a reasonable official in spies position would not have concluded that there was probable cause to arrest harris for devan murder.accordingly,because the district court erred in concluding that spies was entitled to qualified immunity,we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of spies on grounds as to harris claims.
harris brady claim 
harris next claims that spies violated his right to the disclosure of exculpatory evidence in the government possession,under brady maryland,d.specifically,harris contends that spies wrongfully and deliberately withheld evidence that lori duniver reported to police on the day of devan disappearance that she had seen a car resembling redmond in the neighborhood a letter from lori duniver to a police officer mentioning that alleged report and records of a public agency establishing that redmond had beaten devan with a belt and that devan had stated that she was afraid of redmond.
the district court concluded that harris had forfeited his brady claim when he failed to seek to amend the complaint again and asserted this new cause of action for violation of his brady rights for the first time in response to the instant motion for summary judgment.at dist.mem.at.the district court further determined that harris brady claim was factually unsupported,because harris was aware of the essential facts that would enable him to take advantage of the exculpatory evidence and should have known to check public records for such evidence.id.at dist.mem.at.
we utilize a course of the proceedings test to determine whether defendants in a action have received notice of the plaintiff claims where the complaint is ambiguous.cummings city of akron,cir.the complaint in cummings alleged violations of the fourteenth amendment and,but we held that statements made by both cummings counsel and defendants counsel during cummings deposition demonstrate d that both sides understood cummings suit to encompass fourth amendment claims not explicitly set forth in the complaint,and we therefore addressed those claims on appeal.id.judge griffin suggests in dissent that harris complaint wholly failed to plead a brady claim and thus did not fall within the range of ambiguity contemplated by cummings.harris brady claim implicating the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,however,fell within the scope of the allegation in his complaint that the engaged in a pattern of activity and course of conduct that was intended to manufacture anthony conviction in violation of the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.at compl.at at amend.compl.at.accordingly,harris,whose brady claim lies within the scope of his pleaded fourteenth amendment claim,is in an even stronger position than the plaintiff in cummings,whose fourth amendment claim did not lie within the scope of the fourteenth amendment claim pleaded in his complaint.we thus determine that it is appropriate to follow the analysis established in cummings.
judge griffin argues in dissent that the course of the proceedings exception to our pleading rules does not apply when the alleged notice arises during the course of a discovery deposition.certainly,the breadth of discovery under.b and d a allows questions designed to elicit admissible evidence,which at trial might be deemed irrelevant.the breadth of discovery,however,does not lead logically to judge griffin conclusion that questions posed by plaintiff counsel during depositions can not put defendants on notice regarding a claim not specifically alleged in the complaint.this conclusion ignores the fact that the proceedings referred to in cummings themselves involved a deposition.at see also torry northrop grumman,cir holding that a claim not alleged in the complaint was pre tried by implied consent of the parties during four years of discovery and other pretrial maneuverings.
the transcript of spies deposition indicates that all parties were aware,well before the summary judgment stage,that harris complaint encompassed a brady claim 
q is that something that you would have found necessary to turn over to defense counsel in anthony harris murder case 
a i do believe so.
q even though it in a finding or a report,of children services,documenting redmond kidnapping and physical abuse of devan 
a i do believe so.
q and can you explain to me why not 
a because it deals with an incident that occurred almost a year prior to this particular incident it occurred in the columbus area it did involve devan,and in my mind that really the only similarity.
it does indicate to me,you know,did she get the bruises,whatever,when she was visiting dad did she get the bruises from redmond did she get the bruises from lori did she get them because her and her brother dylan were roughhousing,and he grabbed the belt and hit her i do know that.
at spies dep.at see also at spies dep.at.harris counsel asked spies repeated questions concerning the potentially exculpatory duniver report to the police regarding her sighting of a vehicle that resembled redmond car,lori letter to a police officer regarding the car,and the agency a sustained period that produced over transcript pages.at et.spies dep.at et the transcript makes clear that harris counsel was not merely fishing for admissible evidence but rather laying the foundation for a brady claim.harris counsel,in fact,specifically mentioned brady maryland,as well as the related cases united states agurs,d,and giglio united states,d,and suggested that spies had violated her obligation under brady to disclose exculpatory evidence.see at spies dep.at at spies dep.at.accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that harris had forfeited this claim by failing to plead it with specificity.
the district court also erred in determining that harris was on notice of the existence of the evidence.it is true that,under spirko mitchell,a prosecutor has no obligation to disclose information where the evidence was available to the defendant from other sources than the state,and he was aware of the essential facts necessary for him to obtain that evidence,cir,cert.denied,d.here,however,there is no indication that harris knew or had reason to know that redmond had abused devan or that lori duniver had reported seeing a car similar to the one used by redmond in her neighborhood near the time of devan disappearance.accordingly,because the district court granted summary judgment on improper grounds,we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of tuscarawas on harris brady claim.
harris claim under 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of spies and tuscarawas on harris claim that they conspired to deprive him of his constitutional rights.harris does not address this claim on appeal.accordingly,he has waived it.radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir a party failure to raise an argument in his appellate brief constitutes a waiver of the argument on appeal.
retaliation 
harris alleges that spies statements to the marine corps recruiters were motivated by a desire to retaliate against him for filing the instant suit.
in order to prove a claim for retaliation,a plaintiff must establish the following elements that the plaintiff was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity that the defendant adverse action caused the plaintiff to suffer an injury that would likely chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity and that the adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the exercise of the plaintiff constitutional rights.
bloch ribar,cir.the district court concluded that harris could establish neither the second nor the third element of his claim.
with regard to the second district court determined that,because the marine corps denied harris application based upon the determination that his conviction was reversed on a technicality and because,i n the eyes of the marines,the suppression of the plaintiff confession by the state appellate court did not negate its existence,spies statement did not cause harris injury.at dist.mem.at.
the record,however,demonstrates that spies comments deterred the marine corps from proceeding with harris application for employment 
q if you had obtained the letter from the prosecutor in anthony case that said in substance that anthony had been wrongfully convicted of murder,and that there was no probable cause that anthony had committed the murder,would that have been sufficient for you to pursue his application 
cleary objection.
a i would also have to have something saying that he was not undergoing any further court action.if that was included in it,i would favorably endorse it to go to my next higher level but because of the severity of the charge,i could not sign off and approve that waiver.
q so the fact that the prosecutor in this case said just the opposite,that he would always be a suspect,was significant to you in terms of not pursuing the waiver process,right 
cleary objection.
q and that was why you did pursue it,is that right mr cleary objection.
mr cleary objection.
at gonzalez dep.at.
the district court also noted that spies actions did not stop the plaintiff from proceeding with this civil suit.at dist.mem.at.that is not,however,the relevant question.first,the issue is whether a person of ordinary firmness would be deterred,not whether the plaintiff himself actually was deterred.thomas eby,cir.second,if subsequently challenging the state action ipso facto demonstrated that the challenged action was not sufficiently adverse to undermine constitutional rights,no case alleging retaliation for exercising first amendment rights could ever be brought.id.
spies action would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness from pursuing a claim against the government.harris is obviously aware that his conviction of and incarceration for a notorious crime will likely always concern potential employers.moreover,spies aggressive attempt to convince one such employer of harris guilt has actually prevented harris from securing the career that he wants.a more effective deterrent is difficult to imagine.accordingly,harris has satisfied his burden with regard to the second element 
as for the third,or causation,element of the prima facie case,the district court stated only that t he statement of spies to the marine corps recruiter was motivated by the strength of her belief and her desire to provide accurate information,rather than any attempt to intimidate the plaintiff into abandoning the case at bar.at dist.mem.at.in so concluding,the district court appears to have ignored the evidence that spies referred explicitly to the instant lawsuit in her communications with the recruiters.
usually,the question of causation is a factual issue to be resolved by a jury,and may be satisfied by circumstantial evidence.hartsel keys,cir internal citation omitted,cert.denied,d.here,spies mention of harris civil suit during the course of her conversation with the recruiters constitutes powerful circumstantial evidence that her other remarks were motivated by retaliatory animus.accordingly,because a genuine issue of material fact exists with regard to harris retaliation claim,we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on that claim.
aiding and abetting 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on harris claim.harris does not address the issue in his briefs on appeal,and accordingly he has waived the claim.radvansky,at.
malicious prosecution 
ohio has set forth the elements of a malicious prosecution claim as follows malice in instituting or continuing the prosecution,lack of probable cause,and termination of the action in favor of the defendant.swiecicki delgado,cir citing trussell motors,ohio,ohio.in this case,the district court concluded that the plaintiff confession alone provided probable cause to initiate and pursue the criminal charge against him,at dist.mem.at,and,moreover,that there was substantial evidence to corroborate the plaintiff confession,at dist.mem.at.
the ohio courts define probable cause for the purposes of a malicious prosecution claim as a reasonable ground of suspicion,supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious individual in the belief that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he or she is charged.rogers barbera,ohio,ohio quoting ash marlow,ohio.for the same reasons that we determined harris demonstrated that his arrest was unsupported by probable cause under federal law,we also find a lack of probable cause under the above ohio state definition.the ohio courts have further held,however,that 
a finding of guilty of a criminal offense by a court having jurisdiction to try and dispose of the case,even though later and finally reversed by a reviewing court,raises a conclusive presumption of probable cause and constitutes a complete defense in a later action for malicious prosecution brought by the defendant in the criminal case against the instigator thereof.

in general,then,throughout the united states,where the complaint on its face shows that the plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution was,in the prosecution complained of,convicted in a lower court,although such conviction was subsequently dismissed by a court of superior jurisdiction,the action will be defeated unless plaintiff alleges and proves further facts tending to impeach the validity of the judgment of conviction and the presumption of probable cause arising therefrom,such as the fact that the conviction was brought about by fraudulent or perjured testimony or through undue or unfair means employed by defendant in the malicious prosecution action,a mere allegation of lack of probable cause being insufficient.
id.at.subsequent ohio decisions confirm that when a conviction gives rise to a presumption of probable cause under vesey,the court hearing a claim must search the record to determine whether the conviction was secured by fraud or unlawful means.courtney rice,ohio app d.
neither we nor the ohio courts have previously decided whether a brady violation suffices to trigger the undue or unfair means exception to the ohio presumption,and other federal courts applying similar state laws have disagreed on the issue.compare walker tyler county comm n,cir unpublished rejecting a claim brought pursuant to west virginia law only because the evidence of the underlying brady violation was not based upon personal knowledge and the plaintiffs had thus failed to prove that the defendants used fraud or other unfair means to obtain a conviction,with ware united states,make no mistake about it,the prosecution breached its constitutional obligation to disclose the fingerprint report to ware.however,this breach was remedied by judge castagna when he vacated ware conviction and granted him a new trial i t did not affect the presumption of probable cause.
we have previously held that a brady violation may rise to the level of fraud on the court under circumstances similar to those alleged here.in demjanjuk petrovsky,cir,we held that the prosecutors,in failing to read reports in their possession that turned out to be exculpatory,acted with reckless disregard for the truth and for the government obligation to take no steps that prevent an adversary from presenting his case fully and fairly.id.at.this was fraud on the court in the circumstances of this case where,by recklessly assuming demjanjuk guilt,they failed to observe their obligation to produce exculpatory materials requested by demjanjuk.id.at.similarly,in this case,harris claims that spies failed to provide him with evidence that another potential suspect had been present in devan neighborhood near the time of her disappearance.indeed,the defendants do not argue that spies did not possess the information or that she disclosed it to harris before trial.accordingly,harris has alleged facts and provided evidence sufficient to satisfy the second element of a prima facie case of malicious prosecution.
ohio law defines malice as an improper purpose,or any purpose other than the legitimate interest of bringing an offender to justice.criss springfield,ohio,ohio.i f the lack of probable cause is demonstrated,the legal inference may be drawn that the proceedings were actuated by malice.thacker city of columbus,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also criss,at ohio if the basis for prosecution can not be shown,those who made the decision will appear to have acted with no is maliciously.because the prosecution lacked probable cause we draw an inference of malice,and conclude that harris has satisfied the first element of the prima facie case.finally,harris conviction was reversed on direct appeal,thus terminating the action in his favor.accordingly,because harris has established that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his claim,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on that claim.
defamation 
under ohio law,the elements of a defamation claim,whether libel or slander,are a a false and defamatory statement concerning another b an unprivileged publication to a third party c fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher and d either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.waste oil,oil,ohio app d,ohio internal quotation marks omitted.because the determination of whether words are defamatory is a question of law,summary judgment is appropriate in defamation actions.brown lawson,ohio app d,ohio.
the district court in this case concluded that spies statement at the press conference in my heart and in my gut,i feel that anthony harris is responsible for the murder of devan duniver did not constitute defamation because it was a protected statement of opinion.the district court further concluded that spies statements to the recruiters could not constitute defamation because they were truthful.
expressions of opinion are protected under the ohio constitution and therefore can not constitute defamation under state law.vail plain dealer publ g,ohio,ohio,cert.denied,d.in determining whether a statement is an expression of opinion,the ohio courts use a test mandating the consideration of the specific language used,whether the statement is verifiable,the general context of the statement,and finally,the broader context in which the statement appeared.id.
the supreme court has held that expressions of opinion may often imply an assertion of objective fact.milkovich lorain journal,d.for example,i f a speaker says,in my opinion john jones is a liar,he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that jones told an untruth.id.we have characterized such a statement as a mixed expression of opinion,which may be the basis for an action for defamation,since it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion.falls sporting news publ g,cir,cited in webster united auto workers,local,cir,cert.denied,d we have explained the respective functions of the judge and jury as follows 
it is the function of the court to determine whether an expression of opinion is capable of bearing a defamatory meaning because it may reasonably be understood to imply the assertion of undisclosed facts that justify the expressed opinion about the plaintiff or his conduct,and the function of the jury to determine whether that meaning was attributed to it by the recipient of the communication.
under the circumstances in which it was made,spies statement at the press conference was a mixed statement of opinion sufficient to give rise to a defamation claim.spies made the statement during the workday,in a public venue,during an appearance at which she was accompanied by her in the county prosecutor office.all of these elements combined to imply that her statement was based upon facts not known to the general public.accordingly,it is the province of a jury to determine whether the marine corps recruiters to whom the statements were made interpreted them as based upon such implied facts.
the district court also erred in concluding that spies statements to the recruiters were true and thus could not constitute defamation.spies statement that harris would always be a suspect because there are no other suspects is directly contradicted by urban deposition testimony.accordingly,because genuine issues of material fact persist with regard to harris defamation claim,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of spies as to that claim.
tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
finally,harris claims that spies statements to the recruiters tortiously interfered with his prospective employment relationship with the marine corps.under ohio law,t he tort of interference with a business relationship occurs when a person,without a privilege to do so,induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to enter into or continue a business relationship with another.mcconnell hunt sports,ohio app d,ohio.the elements of tortious interference with a business relationship are a business relationship,the wrongdoer knowledge thereof,an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship,and damages resulting therefrom.id.the district co
