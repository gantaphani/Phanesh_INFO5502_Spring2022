background 
air products and chemicals,air products,operates a chemical plant in calvert city,kentucky.the company is an employer in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of.the union is a labor organization which represents employees in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of.air products and the union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement collective bargaining agreement or the agreement.the union is the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees of air products plant.
air products also operates a plant known as the power plant.air products constructed this plant adjacent to the chemical plant in the spring of.according to air products,the power plant is separate and distinct from the chemical plant.air products contends that its company is divided into two different operating groups the chemicals group and the gases and equipment group.the chemicals group,according to air products,consists of various operating departments,including vinyl acetate,acetylenics,polyvinyl alcohol,utilities,emulsion,spray dryer,and any other operating plant which may be added during the life of the parties collective bargaining agreement and it also operates the chemical plant.the gases and equipment group,on the other hand,provides steam and electricity to the chemical plant and the tennessee valley authority.in addition,the gases and equipment group markets the power plant steam and electricity to others,within calvert city and throughout the country.air products provides the following facts in support of its contention that the chemical plant and the power plant are distinct operating plants they are managed independently there is no integration the gases and equipment group is responsible for its own recruiting,hiring,and training of new employees at the power plant the chemicals group has no supervisory authority over employees at the power plant there is no interchange of employees between the plants and while in close proximity,the plants are separated by a fence and separate driveways and entrances.
following the construction of the power plant,union members who were employed at the chemical plant attempted to exercise seniority rights to the new jobs in the power plant.air products refused their attempts.thereafter,on october,the union exercised its rights as outlined in the collective bargaining agreement,and it filed a grievance with air products in which it protested air products actions.article xxv of the agreement describes the manner in which grievances shall be addressed 
any grievances of any employee covered by the terms of this agreement,or any dispute which shall arise between the union or its members and the company,with respect to the interpretation or application of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement shall be determined,during the term of this agreement,by the procedure set forth by this article.
the grievance stated as follows 
in order to replace an existing utilities plant,in air products and chemicals,started construction of a cogeneration unit adjoining the existing utilities unit at their calvert city,kentucky location in october,air products and chemicals,announced the hiring of new unit employees to staff the cogeneration unit and the abolishment of the existing utilities,steam generation unit positions air products and chemicals,company is in violation of the current collective bargaining agreement between the company and paper,allied industrial,chemical and energy workers international union,local pace union by refusing to allow unit employees to exercise their seniority rights to the jobs that will be available at the cogeneration unit expected to be in operation in the spring of the year.
grievance report,at.within the grievance,the union requested that air products cease and desist from violating the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union and agree that current employees under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement be allowed to exercise their seniority rights to the jobs when the cogeneration unit becomes operative.at.
on november,air products denied the union grievance.air products position was that the current bargaining unit employees of the calvert city chemical plant have no contractual rights to the jobs at the new cogeneration plant.air products stated in its answer to the grievance that the new cogeneration plant is not part of the chemical plant therefore,its operation and staffing is not covered by the labor agreement.id.
the union then attempted to move the matter to arbitration,as it believed it was entitled to do under article xxvi of the collective bargaining agreement with air products,which provides that in the event that a grievance is not settled satisfactorily by the grievance procedure,the question may be submitted to arbitration at.air products,however,refused to arbitrate.thereafter,the union commenced the within litigation,and it seeks to enforce air products to arbitrate its grievance.
the collective bargaining agreement at issue herein was entered into on or about february,between air products and the union in order to further the mutual interests of both the company and its employees.at.the agreement states that the parties agree to provide a peaceful method of adjusting differences which may arise between the parties and to provide for the operation of the calvert city,kentucky chemical plant of air products and chemicals,inc at.the agreement specifically covers 
all hourly rated production and maintenance employees,including operational employees,warehousers,electricians,painters,bagger operators,storekeepers,utility persons and janitors of the chemical plant of air products and chemicals,at calvert city,kentucky 
article xxii of the agreement sets forth specific guidelines with respect to the seniority of its employees.plant seniority is the right of preference to,recalls to work,and filling job vacancies where there are no experienced personnel bidding for the posted job.at.contained within this section is a list of the various operating departments which may be available to such members,including vinyl acetate,acetylenics,polyvinyl alcohol,utilities,emulsion,spray dryer,and any other operating plant which may be added during the life of this contract.at.following an outline of qualifications for hiring,transferring,and promoting in each of the job classifications,the agreement delineates various requirements concerning the filling of job vacancies in all departments.at.specifically,paragraph of this section of the agreement,entitled new operating plant opening,provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
job openings in a new operating plant will be filled by plantwide bidding for a period of one year from date of the posting of the first job opening 
air products maintains that the collective bargaining agreement is limited to operations at the chemical plant and there is no provision extending its terms to any other facility operated by air products.in support of its contention,it refers to the stated purpose of the agreement outlined above to provide for the operation of the calvert city,kentucky chemical plant of air products and chemicals,at.in addition,it states that the issue at hand is a representational issue,specifically whether the union representation should be extended to the new power plant,and that issue is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb and is not subject to arbitration.the union,however,contends that article xxii of the agreement,as stated above,allows for an arbitrator to decide if the new cogeneration power plant is an operational department,is part of utilities,or is any other operating plant which may be added during the life of this contract.at.
on july,the district court entered a memorandum opinion granting defendant air products motion for summary judgment.in its opinion,the district court wrote as follows 
the main issue before this court is whether the company is required to submit to arbitration a grievance regarding whether air products chemical plant employees have seniority rights at a new,separate air products power plant.an obligation to arbitrate a labor dispute does not arise solely by operation of law.litton fin.printing div.national labor relations,d.a party is compelled to submit its grievance to arbitration only if it has contracted to do so.id.a rbitration is a matter of consent,and it will not be imposed upon parties beyond the scope of their agreement.id.at.at.t he court role is limited to deciding if the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.general drivers,salesmen,and warehousemen local union malone hyde,cir citations omitted.
in stating that the union breach of contract claim raises issues of representation,the district court concluded that the union can not avoid the nlrb exclusive jurisdiction by characterizing what is essentially a representation issue as a breach of contract issue.thus,as the district court held,the within dispute involves statutory interpretation within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb.id.
following the district court memorandum opinion,plaintiff union filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.in its memorandum opinion and order of october,denying plaintiff motion,the district court held as follows 
the facts indicate that while this dispute may involve issues of contract interpretation,it is essentially an argument over whether the union contract covers the employees at the new air products power plant,whether it represents those employees.in such cases where the nlrb resolution of representational issues could also resolve the controversial breach of contract claims brought under,the federal courts should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the contractual allegations.international brotherhood of boilermakers,iron ship builders,blacksmiths,forgers helpers,olympic plating industries,cir.
on october,the union filed the within appeal.the union appeals the district court order granting defendant air products motion for summary judgment.it also appeals the district court order denying its motion for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.united ins.sst fitness,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the,establishes that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.c see also terry barr sales agency,cir.see advance watch,kemper ins,cir.
the district court determined that the union breach of contract claim raises issues of representation because the union claims that the scope of the collective bargaining agreement extends to the power plant,which is operated by air products and is adjacent to the chemical plant,and the union is asserting itself as the collective bargaining agent of the employees at the separate facility.at.having determined that the crux of the matter is essentially a representation issue which is characterized as a breach of contract issue,the district court concluded that the parties dispute is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb.
upon review,however,we conclude that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant,air products.this case is a matter primarily of contract interpretation,while potentially implicating representational issues.pursuant to section of the labor management relations act lmra,and in accordance with the law in this circuit,we find that federal courts may have jurisdiction to examine alleged violations of agreements.moreover,we find that the particular contract at issue,the collective bargaining agreement between the union and air products,on its face,provides for arbitration of the matter outlined in the union grievance.thus,where neither the union nor air products has sought to invoke the powers of the nlrb,and the disputed issue is of a contractual nature,a federal court may properly exercise its jurisdiction over the matter.
jurisdiction 
section a of the labor management relations act lmra vests federal courts with jurisdiction to examine alleged violations of contracts between certain employers and labor organizations.section states,in pertinent part,as follows 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter,or between any such labor organizations,may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
a.the united states supreme court has held that section does more than confer jurisdiction it expresses a federal policy that federal courts should enforce such agreements and that industrial peace can be best obtained only in that way.textile workers union of am.lincoln mills,d.
moreover,the supreme court has held that even if the contract dispute involves a representational question,and even though an alternative remedy before the board is available,under section a of the lmra,federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce an arbitration clause.carey westinghouse,d.thus,in some instances,section can provide parties to a labor contract with an independent forum for resolution of representational or contractual issues,in addition to nlrb disposition.specifically,the supreme court in carey held that where there was a dispute between an employer and two unions as to whether certain employees in one union were doing the work of employees in another union,a suit either in federal courts,pursuant to the lmra,or before authorized state tribunals,is proper notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy before the nlrb,d.
carey concerned a jurisdictional dispute involving two unions and an employer,wherein the dispute could be one of two different,though related,matters work assignment or representation.at.the supreme court acknowledges that classifying the dispute can be difficult,occurring where one party believes the matter is essentially a representational one and the other party characterizes it as a work assignment or contractual issue and in some cases,the issues are intertwined.carey,at.the court determined,though,that however the dispute is work assignment or representation we see no barrier to use of the arbitration procedure.at.the court continued 
if it is a work assignment dispute,arbitration conveniently fills a gap and avoids the necessity of a strike to bring the matter to the board.if it is a representation matter,resort to arbitration may have a pervasive,curative effect even though one union is not a party by allowing the dispute to go to arbitration its fragmentation is avoided to a substantial extent and those conciliatory measures which congress deemed vital to industrial peace citing textile workers lincoln mills.and which may be dispositive of the entire dispute,are encouraged.the superior authority of the board may be invoked at any time.
this court considered a similar issue to the case at hand in local of international union,district,united mine workers of america dow corning,cir.in dow,the union demanded arbitration of certain grievances filed against the employer,dow corning.the grievances included alleged violations of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to seniority determination and application as well as improper work assignment.the union filed an action in district court pursuant to section of the lmra.dow corning contended that the arbitration agreement of the parties specifically excluded the grievances from submission to arbitration because certain procedural prerequisites had not been followed and the underlying grievances,which amounted to allegations of unfair labor practices representation issues,are within the jurisdiction of the nlrb,and therefore,the court should have stayed its decision to compel arbitration.dow,at.
with respect to dow corning contention concerning the nlrb jurisdiction to hear disputes underlying the grievances,we determined that the fact that the alleged contract violations may also be unfair labor practices within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb does not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the union section action.at.this is true whether the dispute concerns unfair labor practices or lawsuits to compel arbitration of grievances such as pay rates and hours of work.id.at.the authority of the board to deal with an unfair labor practice which also violates a collective bargaining contract is not displaced by,but it is not exclusive and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the courts in suits under the concept that all suits to vindicate individual employee rights arising from a collective bargaining contract should be excluded from the coverage of has thus not survived.dow,at quoting smith evening news ass n,d.we,therefore,concluded that it would be inappropriate to withhold enforcement of the arbitration agreement.at.
dow corning contended also that one of the grievances concerned a representational dispute which is within the nlrb jurisdiction.in this respect,the complaint stated that the particular grievance protests the defendant performance of work at its midland corporate center properly assignable to within the contractually recognized bargaining unit.at.in observing the decision reached by the supreme court in carey,supra,this court concluded in dow that regardless of the dispute one involving work assignment as stated above or one concerning representation we see no barrier to the use of the arbitration procedure because i f it is a work assignment dispute,arbitration conveniently fills a gap and avoids the necessity of a strike to bring the matter to the board.if it is a representation matter,resort to arbitration may have a pervasive,curative effect dow,at quoting carey westinghouse,at.we,therefore,affirmed the decision of the district court,in dow,to order the submission of grievances to arbitration in accordance with the parties collective bargaining agreement.
in the case at hand,union members who were employed at the chemical plant operated by air products attempted to exercise seniority rights to the new jobs in the power plant.when air products refused their attempts,the union filed a grievance stating that air products was in violation of the current collective bargaining agreement by refusing to allow unit employees to exercise their seniority rights to the jobs that will be available at the new power plant.air products,in denying the grievance,stated that the current bargaining unit employees of the calvert city chemical plant had no contractual rights to the jobs at the new plant.
the dispute which underlies the grievance filed by the union concerns whether the current union members of the chemical plant have seniority for the new jobs at the power those members have any rights to the work at the new plant.it is a question of work assignment.in order to determine whether the current bargaining unit senior employees have any contractual rights to the jobs at the new plant,one must look to the collective bargaining agreement in existence between air products and the union.the agreement provides that members with plant seniority have a right of preference to fill job vacancies where there are no experienced personnel bidding for the posted job.at.article xxii of the agreement,entitled seniority,states that various operating departments which may be available to such members,include any other operating plant which may be added during the life of this contract.at.furthermore,the agreement states that j ob openings in a new operating plant will be filled by plantwide bidding for a period of one year from the date of the posting of the first job opening.at.therefore,the question becomes is the new plant an operating department,a new operating plant,or is it any other operating plant which may be added during the life of this contract in order to answer such questions,it is necessary to interpret the pertinent provisions of the agreement.thus,this dispute is a matter of contract interpretation.and in accordance with the decisions of the united states supreme court in carey and the decision of this circuit in dow,this court has jurisdiction to compel arbitration of such a matter.
the crux of air products argument is that the underlying dispute involves a representational issue which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb.in support of its position,air products refers to international brotherhood of boilermakers,iron ship builders,blacksmiths,forgers helpers,olympic plating industries,cir,in which this court recognized a strong policy in favor of using the procedures vested in the board for representational determinations in order to promote industrial peace.at citation omitted.in olympic plating,the international union filed an action against the employer,claiming breach of contract.the international also filed an action with the board against the employer and the local union for unfair labor practice.this circuit determined that regardless of how the breach of contract claim was characterized,the claims before the court and the board were virtually identical and the underlying substance of the two claims were meaningfully indistinguishable.id.thus,we held that where the board resolution of issues could also resolve the controversial breach of contract claims brought under,the federal courts should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the contractual allegations.at citing amalgamated clothing textile workers union,facetglas,cir finding that where nlrb resolution of representational issues would also resolve contractual issues,the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the contractual claim.
olympic plating,however,is distinguishable from the instant case.in olympic plating,the international union alleged that olympic breached the collective bargaining agreement by recognizing the local union as the bargaining representative of olympic employees.we determined,in olympic plating,that the underlying resolution of which union is the proper bargaining representative of the company primarily representational,and simply referring to the claim as a breach of contract was insufficient for purposes of federal courts jurisdiction.the instant case,however,does not involve a determination of which union should represent air products employees there are no competing unions.rather,the question is whether air products chemical plant employees,undeniably governed by the existing collective bargaining agreement,are entitled to jobs at the new power plant.even if this matter does implicate a collateral representational issue,the matter is,first and foremost,a genuine section contract dispute,and it is not so essentially representational as to preclude section jurisdiction.
moreover,unlike in olympic plating,in this case,there is no charge pending before the board.in olympic plating,this court specifically noted that both one in federal court and the one before the essentially the same claims,and one decision would necessarily answer both claims.hence,they were meaningfully indistinguishable.at.in the case at hand,only the federal court has been presented with the disputed issue.therefore,pursuant to section,the court has jurisdiction over the union dispute.
arbitration 
air products concedes that the parties contracted to arbitrate a grievance when the underlying dispute involves the interpretation or application of the terms and provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.according to air products,however,the dispute in this case is an issue of the union representation should be extended to the new power requires no interpretation of the terms and provisions of
