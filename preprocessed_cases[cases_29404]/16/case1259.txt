this appeal presents the significant question under chapter of the bankruptcy code of how to mediate between the united states interests in recognizing and cooperating with a foreign insolvency proceeding and its interests in protecting creditors of the foreign debtor with respect to assets,as provided in and.
qimonda ag,a german corporation that manufactured semiconductor devices and was,for a brief time,one of the world largest manufacturers of dynamic random access memory dram,filed for insolvency in munich,germany,in january.the principal assets of qimonda estate consisted of some patents,about of which were patents.these patents were subject to agreements with qimonda competitors,as was common in the semiconductor industry to avoid infringement risks caused by the patent thicket resulting from the overlapping patent rights of some patents in the semiconductor industry.
ancillary to the german insolvency proceeding,michael jaffé,the insolvency administrator appointed by the munich court,filed an application in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia under chapter of the bankruptcy code,petitioning the court to recognize the german insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding in order to obtain an array of privileges available under chapter.among other relief,jaffé specifically requested that the bankruptcy court entrust to him,pursuant to a,the administration of all of qimonda assets within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,which largely consisted of the patents.
contemporaneously with the chapter proceeding,jaffé sent letters to licensees of qimonda patents under its agreements,declaring that,under of the german insolvency code,the licenses granted under qimonda patents are no longer enforceable,including the licenses under the company patents.as jaffé later indicated to the bankruptcy court,he intended to qimonda patents for the benefit of qimonda creditors,replacing licenses paid for with with licenses paid for with cash through royalties.
the bankruptcy court entered an order recognizing the german insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding and a separate order granting jaffé the discretionary relief he requested under a.but,following a evidentiary hearing,it conditioned the relief with the requirement that jaffé afford the licensees of qimonda patents the treatment they would have received in the united states under n,which limits a trustee ability to reject unilaterally licenses to the debtor intellectual property by giving licensees the option to retain their rights under the licenses.after balancing the interests of qimonda estate with the interests of the licensees of its patents,the bankruptcy court concluded that the application of n was necessary to ensure,as required by a,that the licensees were sufficiently protected,even though it would adversely affect qimonda estate.the bankruptcy court also concluded,pursuant to,that allowing jaffé to cancel unilaterally qimonda licenses of patents would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states,recognizing a fundamental public policy promoting technological innovation,which would be undermined if it failed to apply n to the licenses under qimonda patents.
in this direct appeal from the bankruptcy court,jaffé challenges both of these conclusions,arguing that the court erred in its construction of chapter and abused its discretion in applying it.
we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly recognized that jaffé request for discretionary relief under a required it to consider the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor under a and that it properly construed a as requiring the application of a balancing test.moreover,relying on the particular facts of this case and the extensive record developed during the evidentiary hearing,we also conclude that the bankruptcy court reasonably exercised its discretion in balancing the interests of the licensees against the interests of the debtor and finding that application of n was necessary to ensure the licensees under qimonda patents were sufficiently protected.accordingly,we affirm.
the german insolvency proceeding 
qimonda ag filed an application to open a preliminary insolvency proceeding in the munich insolvency court on january,which was converted to a final proceeding on april.upon converting the proceeding to a final one,the court appointed michael jaffé to serve as the estate insolvency administrator,a position akin to a bankruptcy trustee under law.subsequently,qimonda ceased all manufacturing operations and began to liquidate its estate.the principal assets of the estate consisted of its approximately patents,including about patents.most of these patents covered products or processes related to dram,but some covered other types of semiconductor technology.
the patent thicket and the practice of 
at the time qimonda opened its insolvency proceeding,its patents were subject to numerous agreements with other semiconductor manufacturers,including infineon technologies ag from which qimonda had spun off in,samsung electronics company,international business machines corporation ibm,intel corporation,hynix semiconductor,nanya technology corporation,and micron technology.while some of these agreements were designed to facilitate specific joint ventures,most simply reflected the strategy widely adopted in the semiconductor industry in response to infringement risks arising from the industry patent thicket a term used to describe a dense web of overlapping intellectual property rights.carl shapiro,navigating the patent thicket cross licenses,patent pools,and standard setting,in innovation policy and the economy,adam jaffe et.as the bankruptcy court in this case aptly explained and all parties agreed,there are so many patents implicated by any new semiconductor product that it would be all but impossible to design around each and every one.in re qimonda ag.indeed,such is the number of potentially applicable patents that it is not always possible to identify which ones might cover a new product id.
the problem of the patent thicket is exacerbated by the enormous costs incurred to bring a new semiconductor product to market.according to one expert,the price of building a new semiconductor fabrication facility can now exceed billion.these sunk costs could create a classic holdup problem if a new product were ultimately found to infringe someone else patent,with the patent owner being able to extract a substantially higher royalty after the investment had been made than if a license had been negotiated beforehand.thus,to avoid this holdup premium and enhance their design freedom,competitors in the semiconductor industry have routinely entered into broad,agreements with each other,sometimes with the addition of equalizing payments either payments or running royalties to account for differences in the size and breadth of the respective patent portfolios.in re qimonda ag,at.
consistent with this industry practice,qimonda had patent agreements with nearly every other major semiconductor manufacturer at the time it opened its insolvency proceeding.
the chapter proceeding 
jaffé commenced this chapter proceeding on june,for recognition of the german insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding under.jaffé petition identified qimonda known assets in the united states as including its active patents and patent applications filed with the united states patent and trademark office,and it sought relief designed to give effect to the german proceedings in the,protect the assets,and to prevent creditors in the from taking actions that might frustrate the german proceedings.jaffé also sought an order entrusting to him,under a,t he administration or realization of all or part of the assets of qimonda within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states and further declaring that the german proceedings be granted comity and be given full force and effect in the united states.
the bankruptcy court granted the relief jaffé requested,entering an order granting recognition of the german insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding under.at the same time,it also entered a separate supplemental order grant ing further relief under.the supplemental order made jaffé the sole and exclusive representative of qimonda ag in the united states and,as requested,specifically gave him the power to administer the assets of qimonda ag within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.it authorized jaffé to examine witnesses,take evidence,seek production of documents,and deliver information concerning qimonda.finally,it specified that,in addition to those sections of the bankruptcy code made applicable pursuant to,a number of other provisions of the bankruptcy code would be applicable in this proceeding,including.that provision gives a bankruptcy trustee power to assume or reject any of the debtor executory contracts.but one subsection,n,limits the trustee ability to unilaterally reject licenses to the debtor intellectual property,reserving to the licensees the option to elect to retain their rights under the licenses.
shortly after the bankruptcy court entered its supplemental order,jaffé began sending letters to companies that had agreements with qimonda,invoking of the german insolvency code and declaring that the licenses under qimonda patents were no longer enforceable.section of the german insolvency code,much like of the bankruptcy code,permits an insolvency administrator to decide whether to continue to perform the debtor executory contracts.but,unlike,which includes the n exception,does not specifically address intellectual property licenses.in jaffé view,however,the licenses under qimonda patents fell within the scope of,and it was his duty,as insolvency administrator,not to recognize them since they provided no useful compensation to qimonda estate.
after receiving these letters,samsung and elpida memory,responded with letters,taking the position that n protected their licenses under qimonda patents and announcing that they were electing to retain their rights under the licenses.
the letters from samsung and elpida prompted jaffé to move to amend the bankruptcy court july,supplemental order to delete entirely its reference to.alternatively,jaffé asked the court to add a proviso to the supplemental order specifying that section n applies only if the foreign representative rejects an executory contract pursuant to section rather than simply exercising the rights granted to the foreign representative pursuant to the german insolvency code.several companies that had licenses under qimonda patents through agreements namely,infineon,samsung,micron,nanya,ibm,intel,and hynix hereafter,the licensees opposed jaffé motion to amend the supplemental order 
by an opinion dated november,the bankruptcy court granted jaffé motion,stating that its inclusion of was improvident.the court explained that consistent with chapter goal of providing a systematic and consistent resolution to insolvencies,the fate of the patent agreements should be decided in the german insolvency proceeding by applying german law.the court accordingly amended its supplemental order to include the alternative proviso that jaffé had requested as an amendment.
the appeal to the district court and its remand order 
the licensees appealed the bankruptcy court amended order to the district court,which thereafter remanded the case back to the bankruptcy court to consider a requirement that the bankruptcy court ensure that the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,were sufficiently protected.the district court explained that a required the bankruptcy court to balance the relief granted to the foreign representative and the interests of those affected by such relief,without unduly favoring one group of creditors over another.in re qimonda ag,b,emphasis omitted quoting in re tri cont l exch.the court found it unclear on the somewhat anemic record whether the bankruptcy court adequately balanced the parties interests,as required by,noting that the bankruptcy court had not adequately explained why the application of n would unduly prejudice jaffé or,conversely,fully considered whether cancellation of licenses for qimonda patents would put at risk the licensees investments in manufacturing or sales facilities in this country for products covered by the patents.id.at.
as a separate basis for remand,the district court also found that the bankruptcy court had failed to consider whether n embodies the fundamental public policy of the united states,such that subordinating n to german insolvency code is an action manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states,under.at.the district court concluded that there were two primary circumstances in which a bankruptcy court should invoke first,when the foreign proceeding was procedurally unfair and second,when the application of foreign law or the recognition of a foreign main proceeding under chapter would severely impinge the value and import of a statutory or constitutional right,such that granting comity would severely hinder united states bankruptcy courts abilities to carry out the most fundamental policies and purposes of these rights.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finding the application of that standard unclear on the record,the court also directed the bankruptcy court on remand to consider whether conditioning the applicability of n was a prohibited action manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states under.id.at.
on remand to the bankruptcy court 
on remand,jaffé filed papers in the bankruptcy court in which he committed to qimonda patent portfolio to the licensees at a reasonable and nondiscriminatory rand royalty.he stated that he was prepared to enter into good faith negotiations with the licensees to set the royalty rates and,if necessary,to submit the rate amounts to arbitration before the world intellectual property organization wipo 
in march,the bankruptcy court held a evidentiary hearing,receiving testimony regarding the likely effects of applying n to licenses under qimonda patents.jaffé testified at the hearing that a ruling applying n would render the central assets of qimonda estate,that is its patents largely worthless.he also said that such a ruling would violate the principle of equal treatment of creditors under german law by giving the licensees preferential treatment over qimonda other creditors.
jaffé also presented the expert testimony of william kerr,an economist,who concluded that based on his review of existing licenses and licensing practices in the semiconductor industry,qimonda estate would receive approximately million per year if jaffé were allowed to qimonda patents covering dram products at rand terms.observing that million would represent a small fraction of what the licensees spend on research and development every year,kerr gave his opinion that discontinuance of the at issue and subsequent at a rand rate would not unduly impair the function of the semiconductor industry or the licensees.
by contrast,the licensees witnesses testified to the harm that would befall the licensees,as well as the semiconductor industry as a whole,if the reference to n were removed from the supplemental order.for example,jerry hausman,the licensees economist,gave his opinion that b y destabilizing the system of licensing that has enabled the extraordinary success of the semiconductor industry and other industries,failure to apply section n would reduce investment,innovation,and competition,which would harm productivity growth and consumers as well as worldwide productivity and consumers.hausman also disputed kerr calculation of the likely rand royalty rates,forecasting significantly higher sums and arguing that the holdup threat could not be eliminated.moreover,in hausman view,jaffé offer to the patents at rand terms could not provide adequate protection for the interests of the licensees,in part because of the danger that jaffé would subsequently sell the patent portfolio to an entity that might itself file for bankruptcy,thus extinguish ing the licensees licenses once again.
the bankruptcy court decision on remand 
at the conclusion of the hearing,the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum opinion denying jaffé motion to amend the supplemental order and confirming that n applies with respect to qimonda patents.in re qimonda ag,at.the court assumed for the purpose of its analysis that jaffe interpretation of german law was correct and that of the german insolvency code would authorize him to terminate the licensees right to practice qimonda patents.with that assumption,the court concluded that the balancing of debtor and creditor interests required by a weighs in favor of making n applicable to jaffé administration of qimonda patents.id.at.
explaining its balancing analysis,the bankruptcy court recognized that its ruling would result in less value.being realized by the qimonda estate but noted that qimonda patents would by no means be rendered worthless.at.on the other hand,the court found that a contrary ruling would create a very real risk to the very substantial investment the licensees had collectively made in research and manufacturing facilities in the united states in reliance on the design freedom provided by the agreements.id.at.the court acknowledged that jaffé offer to qimonda patents on rand terms would lessen the holdup risk,but observed that,because of the licensees sunk costs,they would not have the option of avoiding royalties altogether by designing around the patent.id.at.
as an independent ground for its decision,the bankruptcy court also concluded,under,that deferring to german law,to the extent it allows cancellation of the patent licenses,would be manifestly contrary to public policy.at.referencing the legislative history of congress enactment of the intellectual property licenses in bankruptcy act,stat,the court noted that n resulted from congress determination that allowing patent licenses to be terminated in bankruptcy would impose a burden on american technological development.in re qimonda ag,at quoting,at,reprinted in.informed by this congressional policy choice,the court reasoned that a lthough innovation would obviously not come to a grinding halt if licenses to patents could be cancelled in a foreign insolvency proceeding,the court is persuaded by professor hausman testimony that the resulting uncertainty would nevertheless slow the pace of innovation,to the detriment of the economy.id.at.on this basis,the court concluded that failure to apply n under the circumstances of this case and this industry would severely impinge an important statutory protection accorded licensees of patents and thereby undermine a fundamental public policy promoting technological innovation.id.
the bankruptcy court thus held that public policy,as well as the economic harm that would otherwise result to the l icensees,require d that the protections of n apply to qimonda patents.at.
the direct appeal to the court of appeals 
jaffé appealed the bankruptcy court ruling and sought from the district court a certification under d for a direct appeal to this court.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court order qualified for certification,and,by order dated june,we authorized the direct appeal.see d.
congress enacted chapter of the bankruptcy code in as part of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat,stating that its purpose was to incorporate the model law on cross border insolvency,which had been developed in by the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral,so as to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of insolvency.a see also,pt,at,reprinted in.in this respect,chapter replaced former,which authorized bankruptcy courts to award appropriate relief in a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding but which was largely discretionary.see c.chapter lists five specific objectives to encourage cooperation with the courts and other competent authorities of foreign countries involved in cases to increase legal certainty for trade and investment to promote the fair and efficient administration of insolvencies so as to protect the interests of all creditors,and other interested entities,including the debtor to protect and maximize the value of the debtor assets and to facilitate the rescue of financially troubled businesses.a see also,pt,at.
to further these stated objectives,chapter authorizes the representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding to commence a case in a bankruptcy court by filing a petition for recognition of the foreign proceeding,a.if the petition meets the requirements listed in,the court must enter an order granting recognition of the foreign proceeding.and if that foreign proceeding is pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests,it is recognized as a foreign main proceeding.b see also id.with the entry of an order recognizing a foreign main proceeding,the foreign representative of the proceeding automatically receives relief as stated in,including the automatic stay created by with respect to the debtor and its property within the united states and the ability to operate the debtor business within the united states under,as well as the right to sue and be sued and the right to intervene in any proceedings in a state or federal court in the united states in which the debtor is a party.id.a,b.moreover,the statute provides that following entry of a recognition order,a court in the united states shall grant comity or cooperation to the foreign representative,thereby implementing a principal purpose of chapter.id.b.
even before entry of the order granting recognition,authorizes the bankruptcy court,on the foreign representative request,to grant preliminary relief when urgently needed to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of the creditors.
in addition to the automatic relief that comes with the entry of an order granting recognition of a foreign main proceeding,authorizes the bankruptcy court to grant discretionary relief.specifically,provides that where necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of the creditors,the court may,at the request of the foreign representative,grant any appropriate relief.a.this discretionary relief may include entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor assets within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states to the foreign representative,id.a,as well as entrust ing the distribution of all or part of the debtor assets located in the united states to the foreign representative,id.b.the bankruptcy court,however,may only grant discretionary relief under if it determines that the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,are sufficiently protected.id.a.it may also subject the discretionary relief it grants under to conditions it considers appropriate,including the giving of security or the filing of a bond.id.b.
finally,all of the actions authorized in chapter are subject to,which provides that n othing in this chapter prevents the court from refusing to take an action governed by this chapter if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states.
chapter thus authorizes an ancillary proceeding in a united states bankruptcy court that is largely designed to complement and assist a foreign insolvency proceeding by,among other things,bring ing people and property beyond the foreign main proceeding jurisdiction into the foreign main proceeding through the exercise of the united states jurisdiction.in re abc learning centres,cir see also,pt,at cases brought under chapter are intended to be ancillary to cases brought in a debtor home country.this structure reflects the united states policy in favor of a general rule that countries other than the home country of the debtor,where a main proceeding would be brought,should usually act through ancillary proceedings in aid of the main proceedings,in preference to a system of full bankruptcies often called secondary proceedings in each state where assets are found,pt,at.notwithstanding this general policy,chapter also expressly contemplates that a fter recognition of a foreign main proceeding,a case under another chapter of the bankruptcy code may be commenced if the debtor has assets in the united states.
thus,taken as a whole,chapter like the model law on which it was several modest but significant steps toward implementing a modern,harmonized and fair framework to address more effectively instances of insolvency.uncitral,guide to enactment of the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency,in legislative guide on insolvency law,hereinafter,guide to enactment.
jaffé contends that the bankruptcy court erred by employing a sufficient protection requirement to subject his right to administer qimonda patents to the constraints imposed by n,thus allowing the licensees to elect to retain their license rights under qimonda patents,contrary to german law as he understands it.in re qimonda ag,at.the bankruptcy court limited the authority it conferred on jaffé under a by balancing the interests of the licensees with the interests of qimonda estate under a and concluding that the licensees should receive the protection of n.id.at.in support of his challenge,jaffé makes essentially three arguments that the district court and the bankruptcy court erred in even considering a,because that section applies only to relief granted under,that the relief granted under may be requested only by the foreign representative,and that he,as the foreign representative,never requested the inclusion of n as part of the relief that the bankruptcy court misunderstood the type of protection afforded by a by applying a test that balanced the debtor interests and the creditors interests instead of a test that placed all creditors on an equal footing and that in balancing the competing interests,the bankruptcy court overstated the risks to the licensees,especially in view of jaffé offer to qimonda patents to them,and failed to treat all creditors interests equally.we address these points in order 
first,jaffé argues that both the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in even considering sufficient protection requirement because a applies to relief that may be granted under,and a,in turn,provides that the court may,at the request of the foreign representative,grant any appropriate relief.emphasis added.he asserts that he never asked the bankruptcy court to include in its supplemental order or sought other relief relating to n such that the licensees would have the option to retain their licenses under qimonda patents.thus,according to jaffé,because application of was not specifically requested by him,the bankruptcy court sua sponte inclusion of was legal error,the correction of which must precede any consideration of a sufficient protection requirement.
we believe that jaffé view of the relationship between a and a is too myopic.while it is true that jaff é never affirmatively requested rejection authority under,he did request several forms of discretionary relief under,among which was the privilege,pursuant to a,to have the bankruptcy court entrust him with t he administration or realization of all or part of the assets of qimonda within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,specifically identifying the company patents as among the assets he sought to control.and,as a prerequisite to awarding any relief,the court was required to ensure sufficient protection of the creditors and the debtor.section a states this explicitly,providing in relevant part,the court may grant relief under section only if the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,are sufficiently protected.a emphasis added.additionally,the court was authorized to subject any relief to conditions it considers appropriate.id.b see also,pt,at describing as giv ing the bankruptcy court broad latitude to mold relief to meet specific circumstances,including appropriate responses if it is shown that the foreign proceeding is seriously and unjustifiably injuring united states creditors.
this is precisely what the bankruptcy court did here.it granted discretionary relief under and,as mandated,considered the question of sufficient protection under a.upon such consideration,it conditioned its relief on application of n,finding that such protection was appropriate in the circumstances presented.
to be sure,the bankruptcy court did not frame its initial inclusion of in the supplemental order as a condition on the authority it was granting jaffé under.indeed,when initially faced with jaffé motion to amend,the court described the inclusion of as improvident.but on the licensees appeal,the district court correctly recognized that it was incumbent on the bankruptcy court,on remand,to consider whether the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,would be sufficiently protected under a were the court to modify its earlier order so as to grant jaffé control over the administration of qimonda patents without providing for the application of n to the licenses on those patents.see in re qimonda ag,at.
the bankruptcy court consideration of a was thus undoubtedly appropriate when authorizing relief under.
jaffé next contends that even if the bankruptcy court was correct to consider sufficient protection requirement in granting relief,the court nonetheless employed the wrong test in applying a.he maintains that the bankruptcy court ruling fundamentally misunderst ood the interests a protects by failing to recognize that a is merely a procedural protection designed to ensure that all creditors could participate in the bankruptcy distribution on an equal footing and thus should not be used to protect parties from the substantive bankruptcy law that would otherwise apply in the foreign main proceeding.emphasis added.he asserts that d isregarding foreign law based on an balancing test under a is contrary to chapter basic design,which,according to jaffé,requires courts to defer to foreign substantive law except only as allowed under,which provides a narrow exception when the court action would otherwise violate the most fundamental policies of the united states,pt,at.in sum,he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by interpreting sufficient protection requirement as incorporating a balancing test that could achieve a result that treated creditors differently and that would therefore be in tension with german law,and that,to the extent a was implicated at all,the bankruptcy court should have limited its analysis to ensuring that the doors of the german insolvency proceeding would be open to the licensees on equal footing with qimonda other creditors.
jaffé theory of how the sufficient protection requirement of a operates is not illogical.the text of the statute is broad and somewhat ambiguous regarding the test that courts should employ to determine if the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,are sufficiently protected.a.but we are not convinced that jaffé theory can fully be squared with the text or with congress intent in enacting the text.
section a requires the bankruptcy court to ensure the protection of both the creditors and the debtor.a.the provision thus requires the court to ensure that the relief a foreign representative requests under does not impinge excessively on any one entity interests,implying that each entity must receive at least some protection.and because the interests of the creditors and the interests of the debtor are often antagonistic,as they are here,providing protection to one side might well come at some expense to the other.the analysis required by a is therefore logically best done by balancing the respective interests based on the relative harms and benefits in light of the circumstances presented,thus inherently calling for application of a balancing test.
we also find support for this interpretation in the model law on cross border insolvency,on which chapter was based.in enacting chapter,congress stated that it intended to codify the model law.see a.and,in doing so,it also indicated strongly that the model law,and the accompanying guide to enactment issued by uncitral in conjunction with its adoption of the model law,should inform our interpretation of chapter provisions.indeed,chapter provides that i n interpreting this chapter,the court shall consider its international origin,and the need to promote an application of this chapter that is consistent with the application of similar statutes adopted by foreign jurisdictions.id.see also,pt,at interpretation of this chapter on a uniform basis will be aided by reference to the guide and the reports cited therein,which explain the reasons for the terms used and often cite their origins as well to the extent that the united states courts rely on these sources,their decisions will more likely be regarded as persuasive elsewhere emphasis added.thus,the model law and its guide to enactment also provide relevant guidance in determining the appropriate meaning of chapter provisions.
the guide to enactment contains a number of paragraphs that bear directly on the question of how a court should assess the interests of others and protect them prior to granting the discretionary relief sought by a foreign representative.for example,the guide acknowledges that the representative of a foreign main proceeding will normally seek to gain control over all assets of the insolvent debtor.guide to enactment,at.but it stresses that the model law makes t he turnover of assets to the foreign representative discretionary,adding that the model law contains several safeguards designed to ensure the protection of local interests before assets are turned over to the foreign representative.id,at emphasis added.chief among those safeguards is article of the model law,which is largely codified as according to the guide,the idea underlying a rticle is that there should be a balance between relief that may be granted to the foreign representative and the interests of the persons that may be affected by such relief.this balance is essential to achieve the objectives of insolvency legislation.id,at emphasis added.the guide to enactment separately indicates that article is designed to protect the interests of the creditors in particular local creditors,the debtor and other affected persons.id,at.finally,the guide states,i n addition to article specific provisions,article of the model law in a general way provides that the court may refuse to take an action governed by the model law if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the enacting state.id,at emphasis added.
informed by the guide to enactment description of the relationship between articles and of the model law and in the bankruptcy code,we do not share jaffé view that public policy exception forecloses use of a balancing analysis under.contrary to jaffé position,chapter does not require a bankruptcy court,in considering a foreign representative request for discretionary relief under,to blind itself to the costs that awarding such relief would impose on others under the rule provided by the substantive law of the state where the foreign insolvency proceeding is pending.instead,chapter,like the model law,anticipates the provision of particularized protection,as stated in a.
we therefore conclude,through interpretation of a text and consideration of chapter international origin,that the district court correctly interpreted a sufficient protection requirement as requiring a particularized balancing analysis that considers the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,a,and,in this case in particular,a weighing of the interests of the foreign representative the debtor in receiving the requested relief against the competing interests of those who would be adversely affected by the grant of such relief here,the licensees.and we also agree that is an additional,more general protection of interests that may be evaluated apart from the particularized analysis of a.
in reaching this conclusion,we join the fifth circuit,which interpreted a similarly,based largely on the language in the guide to enactment.see in re vitro de,cir see also in re int l banking,in re tri cont l exch.
finally,jaffé contends that the bankruptcy court balancing analysis,even if assumed appropriate,was flawed in implementation.he argues that the court dramatically overstated the risk to the licensees investments made in reliance on the agreements,especially in light of his offer to qimonda patents to the licensees at a rand royalty rate.in this regard,he maintains that the court balancing analysis failed to recognize that a requires courts to protect the interests of all creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor not just one set of contracting parties.
the licensees respond,arguing that the bankruptcy court properly recognized that jaffé offer to relicense did not change the balance of harms and that the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that,without n protection,the licensees would face both the immediate harm of a and the future destabilization of the licensing regime in the semiconductor industry.they maintain that in light of the bankruptcy court detailed findings and careful reasoning,jaffé simply can not meet his heavy burden to demonstrate that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in its application of.
it should be noted that after hearing four days of evidence,the bankruptcy court considered the outcome of its balancing analysis to be a close one.but in the end it concluded,reasonably we believe,that the balancing of debtor and creditor interests required by a,bankruptcy code,weigh ed in favor of making n applicable to jaffé administration of qimonda patents.in re qimonda ag,at.the court recognized jaffé claim that the application of n would result in less value.being realized by the qimonda estate.id.but it noted that qimonda patent portfolio would by no means be rendered worthless because the patents could still be licensed to parties that did not already have a license,and jaffé,to the extent permitted by german law,would be able to fully monetize the patents.id.additionally,the bankruptcy court found it significant that a pplication of n would impose no affirmative burden on jaffé,but instead would merely limit his ability and,importantly,the ability of the patents subsequent owners to bring infringement actions against the very entities that qimonda had previously promised not to sue.see imation koninklijke philips elecs,characterizing a patent agreement as essentially a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee for infringement citation omitted.
in considering and weighing the licensees interests,the bankruptcy court largely credited their evidence indicating that entrusting jaffé with the right to administer qimonda patents without making n applicable to the preexisting licenses under those patents would have ill effects.it explained that the risk to the very substantial investment the licensees particularly ibm,micron,intel,and samsung had collectively made in research and manufacturing facilities in the united states in reliance on the design freedom provided by the agreements,though not easily quantifiable,was nevertheless very real.in re qimonda ag,at.while the bankruptcy court acknowledged that the licensees had been unable to identify specific qimonda patents implicated by the products they manufacture d and s old,it noted that the lack of such evidence was not at all surprising,since the whole point of portfolio was to eliminate the necessity and in some cases impossibility of individually analyzing each and every patent that might possibly apply to determine if a new design infringe d on it.id.at.thus,although the bankruptcy court could not,in the course of its balancing analysis,make a finding that cancellation of the licensees right to use qimonda patents would have a specific dollar impact on them,it did find that it create d a substantial risk of harm,adding that the threat of infringement litigation can be as damaging as an actual finding of infringement.id.
we find the bankruptcy court thorough examination of the parties competing interests to have been both comprehensive and eminently reasonable.
jaffé relies heavily on the mitigation that would result from his commitment to qimonda patents to the licensees on rand terms,arguing that it would provide sufficient protection for their interests.of course,his proposal first mentioned after the district court remand does weigh in his favor by decreasing the licensees holdup risks.but just because the rand proposal would reduce the licensees risks does not mean that their interests would be sufficiently protected by jaffé promise to.the bankruptcy court expressly recognized this,explaining that the risk is lessened by jaffé offer to the patents on rand terms,but emphasizing that even if the wipo expert determination process were to arrive at the same figure that would have been agreed to in an ex ante scenario,the licensees,because of their sunk costs,would not have the option of avoiding royalties altogether by designing around the patent.in re qimonda ag,at.we conclude that the bankruptcy court findings in this regard are not unreasonable and that the bankruptcy court was justified in its skepticism of jaffé claim that the licensees interests would now be sufficiently protected by his commitment not to charge them an exorbitant rate during their negotiations.
moreover,the bankruptcy court also noted that it remained an open question whether any new license issued by jaffé on rand terms would itself be secure,expressing its concern that 
jaffé could still sell the underlying patents to a purchaser whether a practicing entity or a troll that might itself file for insolvency under german law or transfer the patent to a special purpose entity for the purpose of having it file for insolvency under german law.
id.at.the court recognition of this concern was also reasonable,as it is far from clear whether,having once facilitated the termination of license rights in a foreign insolvency proceeding,the genie could ever be put back into the bottle.rather,as indicated by expert testimony that the bankruptcy court credited,it would seem all too likely that such a result would introduce a dangerous degree of uncertainty to a licensing system that plays a critically important role in the semiconductor industry,as well as other sectors of the global economy.
at bottom,we affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court,finding reasonable its exercise of discretion in conducting the balancing analysis under a and concluding that attaching the protection of n was necessary when granting jaffé the power to administer qimonda patents.see in re vitro de,at noting in the course of affirming a bankruptcy court decision not to enforce the reorganization plan adopted in a foreign main proceeding that i t is not our role to determine whether the evidence would lead us to the same conclusion and adding that o ur only task is to determine whether the bankruptcy court decision was reasonable emphasis added.
it is important,we think,to recognize,as jaffé would have us do,the importance of chapter to a global economy,in which businesses needing bankruptcy protection increasingly have assets in various countries.in mimicking the model law on cross border insolvencies,chapter furthers a policy of the united states of cooperating with other countries in providing fair and efficient insolvency proceedings for such international businesses.consistent with its stated purposes,chapter provides for the ready recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings,see,and grants automatic relief to protect assets upon entry of an order granting recognition,see id.it also provides for a broad range of discretionary relief under.thus,it represents a full commitment of the united states to cooperate with foreign insolvency proceedings,as called for by the model law on cross border insolvency.and at bottom,such cooperation will provide greater legal certainty for trade and business to the benefit of the global economy.
but the united states commitment is not untempered,as is manifested in both chapter and the model law on which it was based.thus,a requires that a bankruptcy court,when granting the discretionary relief authorized by,ensure sufficient protection of creditors,as well as the debtor.and at a more general level,which covers any action under chapter,authorizes a bankruptcy court to refuse to take an action that would be manifestly contrary to public policy.
in this case,it is sufficient for us to affirm the bankruptcy court,based on its application of a.but in doing so,we understand that,by affirming the bankruptcy court application of n following its balancing analysis under a,we also indirectly further the public policy that underlies n.the senate report accompanying the bill that became n explicitly recognized that licensees have a strong interest in maintaining their right to use intellectual property following the licensor bankruptcy and that to deny them that right would impose a burden on american technological development that was never intended by congress,at.the report added that t he adoption of this bill will immediately remove that burden and its attendant threat to the development of american technology.id.at.
in this case,the bankruptcy court,in weighing the respective interests of the licensees and the debtor under a,found that without the protection of n,the risk of harm to the licensees would be very real,impairing the design freedom provided them by the agreements.in re qimonda ag,at.and as the bankruptcy court otherwise found,this potential harm to the licensees would,in turn,threaten to slow the pace of innovation in the united states,to the detriment of the economy.id.at.thus,the court findings,which were,to be sure,focused on the licensees interests,nonetheless necessarily furthered the public policy underlying n.
we thus recognize that by affirming the bankruptcy court,even though on its a analysis,we too necessarily further the public policy inherent in and manifested by n.
the judgment of the bankruptcy court is accordingly 
the only question we need to address in this appeal concerns the bankruptcy court discretion in ensuring that the interests of the creditors and other interested entities,including the debtor,are sufficiently protected under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and whether the bankruptcy court abused that discretion here.i agree with the majority opinion that in reviewing this issue,we look not to whether the record evidence would lead us to the same conclusion but that o ur only task is to determine whether the bankruptcy court decision was reasonable.in re vitro de,cir.accordingly,i am happy to concur in the language in parts i,ii,and iii of the majority opinion that analyzes and addresses only this issue.i do not join in part iv because it is unnecessary dictum.
infineon,samsung,micron,nanya,and elpida originally objected to the motion,while ibm,intel,and hynix were later allowed to intervene as objectors.elpida,which also had elected to enforce its licenses from qimonda under n,subsequently reached a settlement with jaffé and therefore is not an objecting licensee.
rand royalties are relatively common in industries because of the role played by organizations,which help ensure the interoperability of products,among other functions.to avoid the holdup problem in this context,organizations typically require their members to agree in advance to license any patent identified as necessary to a standard at rand terms.both qimonda and the licensees belong to such an organization.nonetheless,the federal trade commission has observed that there is much debate over whether such rand commitments can effectively prevent patent owners from imposing excessive royalty obligations on licensees,noting complaints by industry representatives that the term rand is vague and with regard to what royalty rate is reasonable.fed.trade comm n,the evolving ip marketplace aligning patent notice and remedies with competition.
we note as well that the united states has appeared as amicus curiae to express its concern that the bankruptcy court overstepped its authority below.specifically,it criticizes the bankruptcy court as approach ing this case as though it were empowered to decide whether the foreign administrator should be permitted to reject appellees license agreements based on an erroneous assumption that it could superimpose section n on the operation of german i
