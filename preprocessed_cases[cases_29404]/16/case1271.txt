defendant appellant michael marinucci marinucci appeals from the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court finding of fraud and entry of a nondischargeable judgment for plaintiff appellee sg homes associates,lp sg homes.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
marinucci was the president and a shareholder of chesapeake site contracting,chesapeake.on december,chesapeake responded to sg homes bid request for site work on a building project at crabbs branch way in montgomery county,maryland crabbs branch way project or the project.
some time before december,marinucci and chesapeake senior project manager,jay munnikhuysen munnikhuysen,met and discussed chesapeake bid with two sg homes officials,procurement manager paul deverger deverger and procurement vice president lorin randall randall.marinucci asked whether sg homes would require a bond or accept a higher retainer instead.although randall agreed to consider a retainer,sg homes ultimately required a bond.
on january,sg homes awarded chesapeake the work and requested a certificate of insurance,a performance bond,and a completed w tax form.although the parties had not signed a written contract,chesapeake hired subcontractors and suppliers and began work on the crabbs branch way project almost immediately.
on or before february,marinucci completed a bond request form from the atlantic risk management corporation requesting performance and payment bonds.on february,marinucci told randall in an email that chesapeake was pursuing the performance and payment bonds as we agreed.by,however,marinucci had decided not to obtain a bond because his wife would not sign a personal guaranty which the bonding companies required.nonetheless,on march,munnikhuysen copied marinucci on an email to deverger that said,our office advises me that you should see the p p bond by the end of next week.
work continued without a written contract,and chesapeake submitted monthly payment applications to sg homes.each application contained a certification from chesapeake that,to the best of chesapeake knowledge,the work covered by the application for payment ha d been completed in accordance with the contract documents and all amounts previously paid to chesapeake under the contract ha d been used to pay chesapeake costs for labor,materials,and other obligations.see.marinucci reviewed each application and directed an employee to sign the certification.chesapeake deposited the payments received from sg homes into a common fund from which it paid some of its subcontractors and suppliers on the project,but also paid other creditors who did not provide services or supplies for the crabbs branch way project.
on may,chesapeake and sg homes executed a written agreement the contract governing the project.the contract was ambiguous about whether chesapeake was required to obtain a bond.subsection g,under payment conditions,noted that all subcontractors were subject to a retainer must post a bond guaranteeing satisfactory completion of the work.an x was placed next to both options indicating the contract required a retainer and a bond.
subsection m,part a of the contract performance and payment bonds,under general conditions,stated that chesapeake would pay for and provide performance and payment bonds to sg homes,unless a box was checked and no bond was indicated above.there was neither a box nor a check next to this provision.however,part b of subsection m stated that,if chesapeake was not then required to post a bond or bonds,sg homes could require a bond at any time,at sg homes expense for the crabbs branch way project.
subsection l of the contract,under payment conditions,required chesapeake to insure that all subcontractors,employees,and suppliers,at all times were paid all amounts due in connection with the performance of the contract,and submit evidence of payments.emphasis added.sg homes was authorized to withhold any payments due chesapeake should the subcontractors not be paid and was also authorized to pay such subcontractors directly.subsection h,under general conditions,required chesapeake to keep the project free of liens.
marinucci testified that he understood the contract required chesapeake to use the money from sg homes to pay the subcontractors and suppliers working on the project.further,marinucci affirmed that chesapeake contracts with the project subcontractors and suppliers provided that chesapeake would pay them when it was paid by sg homes.marinucci also testified that he knew about the maryland construction trust statute,which requires money disbursed to a contractor by a project developer to be used only to pay that project subcontractors.see,real,
on may,munnikhuysen sent an email to deverger to say that chesapeake bond had been cancelled because chesapeake assumed that sg homes no longer wanted it.deverger responded the same day,noting that there may have been a communication breakdown because sg homes still needed a bond.deverger asked how soon chesapeake could obtain a bond,and at what cost,so that the contract could be revised.munnikhuysen replied that he had talked to marinucci via telephone and chesapeake would get on the bond right away.j.on june,deverger emailed munnikhuysen and asked when the bond would be issued.munnikhuysen responded that he would check again and let deverger know.marinucci was copied on every email in the exchange.
on june,munnikhuysen sent deverger and copied marinucci on an email with the subject line crabbs branch way.munnikhuysen said that he had received deverger telephone message and forwarded it to marinucci,who was out of the office but handling the issues deverger had called about.
in september,randall emailed marinucci to say that a subcontractor had told sg homes that it had performed work for chesapeake on the project in july but would not be paid until october.randall told marinucci that he would pay them directly and back the amount out of chesapeake next payment.on october,randall emailed marinucci about another subcontractor that was owed money from chesapeake on the project,and that a joint check would be issued to the subcontractor.
on october,randall emailed marinucci to inform him that other project subcontractors and suppliers had reported that they had not been paid by chesapeake.randall said that sg homes would pay them directly with funds due to chesapeake.after the suppliers and subcontractors were paid,however,sg homes preliminary calculations indicated that no money would be due chesapeake.sg homes subsequently terminated the contract.
in february,sg homes sued chesapeake and marinucci in maryland state court for breach of contract,fraud,and violation of the maryland construction trust statute.while the case was pending in state court,marinucci filed individually for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland.sg homes was listed as a creditor of marinucci based on any liability arising from the crabbs branch way project.the state court stayed sg homes suit against marinucci,pursuant to,but the case proceeded against chesapeake.
in january,the state court entered a default judgment against chesapeake as to liability.subsequently,the state court determined the amount of damages and entered a final judgment of in favor of sg homes on april.
four days later,sg homes filed an adversary proceeding against marinucci in the bankruptcy court,seeking a declaration that marinucci debt to it was nondischargeable under a a.sg homes contended that marinucci had violated his fiduciary duties as a statutory trustee under the maryland construction trust statute.the complaint alleged that chesapeake had held money in trust for subcontractors,marinucci had controlled that money,and he had knowingly withheld payment from the subcontractors,in violation of the statute.sg homes sought to recover,plus fees and costs from marinucci as a nondischargeable debt.
on july,marinucci moved for judgment on the pleadings.he argued that a violation of the maryland construction trust statute was not a valid basis for objecting to the discharge of his debt.sg homes opposed the motion and moved to amend the complaint,seeking to add two new grounds for nondischargeability fraud and subrogation.
on september,the bankruptcy court granted marinucci motion on the sole count of the original complaint,violation of the maryland construction trust statute.however,the bankruptcy court granted sg homes motion to add the fraud count,but denied the motion to add the proposed subrogation claim.
on july,the case went to trial solely on the fraud count,which sg homes presented based on two separate theories of liability first,it asserted that marinucci had falsely represented that chesapeake would obtain a payment bond.second,it alleged that marinucci had falsely certified in the monthly payment applications that chesapeake was paying its subcontractors and suppliers on the crabbs branch way project from those funds.
at trial,the parties stipulated that sg homes had paid to subcontractors and suppliers of chesapeake that had worked on the crabbs branch way project but had not been paid by chesapeake.randall testified at trial and explained how he calculated the amount using invoices,balance sheets,and chesapeake payment applications.he also testified that,had he known in january or february that chesapeake would not obtain a bond,sg homes would not have awarded the contract to chesapeake or allowed it to start work.he further testified that,had he known after execution of the contract that chesapeake would not obtain a bond or pay the subcontractors,sg homes would have paid the subcontractors and suppliers directly,or made an arrangement to issue joint checks.
marinucci testified that when sg homes paid the subcontractors and suppliers,it owed chesapeake.he presented no supporting exhibits,however,and conceded during that he had not reviewed the invoices used in randall calculations.a spreadsheet of unpaid bills,created by chesapeake,showed that the company owed to its crabbs branch way project subcontractors and suppliers in november.
the bankruptcy court made extensive findings of fact based on the trial evidence.these findings included that the parties had agreed that chesapeake would obtain a bond that insured payment,and that marinucci had misrepresented chesapeake intent to obtain the bond.the court also found from the totality of the evidence,that the certifications at the bottom of each monthly payment application constituted a false representation that monies received from sg homes were used to pay only subcontractors and suppliers connected to the crabbs branch way project.
t he intent was to assure the owner that from monies received on this job,the subcontractors and material men and expenses of the job were being paid,it is the whole purpose of such certification,it is in the context of a draw request that was not a correct statement of fact at the bottom.
because what was happening without any dispute of fact is that all the funds received were going into a common account and being paid out for payables of chesapeake without regard to which job and based upon decisions solely made by marinucci who would indicate which payables were to be paid when money was available.
the bankruptcy court found that sg homes had proven fraud by marinucci on both of the theories presented and that sg homes had relied on the fraudulent misrepresentations to its detriment.first,that marinucci defrauded sg homes by intentionally failing to obtain a bond.second,that marinucci intentionally misrepresented that he would use the funds received to pay the crabbs branch way project subcontractors and suppliers.the court specifically ruled in the alternative,finding each ground as an independent basis for judgment against marinucci for fraud,the amount of damages,and the nondischargeability of the debt.
the bankruptcy court found that the damages marinucci owed sg homes were,the amount sg homes had double paid the subcontractors and suppliers.crediting sg homes evidence over marinucci unsupported testimony,the court found that there was an ultimate deficit on this job after sg homes had paid the subcontractors and suppliers.the court stated it must conclude that as a result of either of the two frauds incurred that sg homes has been damaged in the amount requested.
the bankruptcy court further determined that the judgment debt was nondischargeable under a a,which disallows the discharge of a debt obtained by fraud.the court reasoned that marinucci had drawn a salary from chesapeake and 
w ithout revenue,the company would fail,and when the company failed,the salary would stop.when the company fail ed,the investment,the percent ownership interest,would go from whatever value it may have had to zero and it did ultimately although marinucci did not get a check directly he did get money and an enhancement of value of property as a result of his personal fraud so a does apply.
marinucci appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the district of maryland,arguing that the adversary proceeding should have been dismissed because the state court judgment collaterally estopped sg homes from suing him in bankruptcy court.alternatively,he argued that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding sg homes a nondischargeable judgment because sg homes had failed to establish fraud.sg homes the bankruptcy court dismissal of its original complaint based on the maryland construction trust statute.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court findings of fraud,damages,and entry of nondischargeable judgment for sg homes the court declined to address the merits of sg homes,reasoning that the alleged error would have no adverse consequence if the court affirms the judgment in sg homes favor.
marinucci timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.

under the bankruptcy code,a debtor is entitled to the discharge of his debt obligations at the conclusion of chapter bankruptcy proceedings,absent the application of a statutory exception.see a identifying nineteen statutory exceptions to discharge.in these proceedings,sg homes objected to the discharge of marinucci debt under a a,which disallows the discharge of a debt obtained by fraud a plaintiff proof of fraud under subsection a requires satisfaction of the elements of common law fraud false representation,knowledge that the representation was false,intent to deceive,justifiable reliance on the representation,and proximate cause of damages.nunnery rountree in re rountree,cir gourdine crews,see also field mans,explaining that operative terms of subsection a are terms.
on appeal,marinucci contends that the bankruptcy court erred in entering a nondischargeable judgment against him because sg homes failed to prove two of the elements of fraud reliance and damages.both elements require proof of facts,and the bankruptcy court findings of fact may not be set aside on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous.kielish,at.as explained below,the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that sg homes justifiably relied on marinucci fraudulent misrepresentations,and thereby suffered proven damages.
we turn first to the bankruptcy court finding that sg homes was justified in relying on marinucci false certifications in the monthly payment applications that chesapeake was paying its subcontractors and suppliers marinucci contends that this finding was clear error because the applications required chesapeake to certify only that it used sg homes money to pay any of chesapeake subcontractors and suppliers,not that the funds be used to pay only vendors providing services or supplies to the crabbs branch way project.
to satisfy the justifiable reliance element in proof of fraud,a plaintiff must show that it actually relied on the debtor misrepresentations,and was justi
