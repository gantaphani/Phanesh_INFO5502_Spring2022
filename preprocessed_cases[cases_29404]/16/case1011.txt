opinion of the court 
before us are an appeal and a arising from an action brought by attorney benjamin post post against his legal malpractice insurer,paul travelers insurance company travelers,for,among other things,insurance bad faith and breach of contract.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of travelers on the bad faith claim,the order from which post now appeals.travelers appeals the district court damage award of to post for breach of contract.
post argues that his bad faith claim was erroneously dismissed at summary judgment,and asserts,among other things,that there was sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that travelers lacked a reasonable basis to deny coverage.travelers contends that the district court erred by awarding damages on post breach of contract claim because the malpractice insurance policy contained an explicit coverage exclusion for sanctions proceedings.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in travelers favor on post bad faith claim,but we vacate and remand with respect to the district court damage award for breach of contract.
factual and procedural background 
a.the bobbett case 
in,post and tara reid,both employed at the time by the law firm of post schell,were retained to defend mercy hospital wilkes barre,mercy healthcare partners,and catholic healthcare partners collectively,mercy in a medical malpractice action filed in the court of common pleas of luzerne county,pennsylvania,captioned bobbett,et grabowski,et,case c.
in may,post left post schell to start a new law firm with his wife post post,thereafter,he continued to represent mercy in the bobbett matter,and reid joined post post as an associate.
trial of the bobbett case began in september.during its first week,the plaintiffs introduced evidence suggesting that post and reid had engaged in misconduct during discovery.specifically,on friday,september,plaintiffs counsel examined a risk manager,anne marie zimmerman,regarding allegedly undisclosed redactions from medical policies produced by mercy in discovery.zimmerman testified that post and reid were responsible for the redactions.plaintiffs counsel characterized zimmerman testimony as establish ing that post and reid covertly redacted and withheld information from documents,simply failed to produce requested documents without permission from this court notice to plaintiffs counsel.plaintiffs counsel then suggested to the presiding judge,peter paul olszewski,jr,that the trial be adjourned for the day.on learning of this possible discovery misconduct,mercy replaced post as its counsel.
fearing that the jury now believed that there had been a involving its lawyers,and concerned with the substantial potential of uninsured punitive exposure,mercy,represented by new counsel,began settlement negotiations with the plaintiffs over the weekend.the negotiations resulted in a settlement of million,which represented the full extent of mercy medical malpractice policy limits.the settlement was presented to judge olszewski in court on tuesday,september.it included a release among the parties,but with one significant caveat the settlement agreement did not release post,reid,post schell,post post from any liability they,or any of them,might have to mercy for malpractice.mercy did in fact threaten post with a malpractice suit.

post schell was insured against claims of legal malpractice by travelers under policy the policy.the policy had an annual premium of,and had an occurrence and aggregate limit of.the policy insured the firm and protected persons,the firm attorneys against claims and suits asserting malpractice.it thus insured post for any alleged acts within the scope of coverage occurring during the policy term and while post was employed by post schell.

mercy legal malpractice claim against post 
on sunday,september,james saxton,an attorney with the law firm of stevens lee,mercy newly retained counsel,advised post father,barton post,that mercy intended to bring a lawsuit for legal malpractice against post,and that the claim should be reported to post insurance carrier.saxton asked for the name of the insurance carrier so that he could make a report.
michael williams,vice president for risk and insurance for catholic healthcare partners,sent two letters on october to post advising him that he was terminated as mercy counsel and instructing him not to destroy any documents from the bobbett case.
on october,williams sent post a third letter,this time asserting that the bobbett settlement was forced on mercy because the alleged by post and reid during discovery had caused mercy substantial uninsured punitive exposure.
williams stated the following 
w hat clearly drove the settlement was the damage done during the testimony of anne marie zimmerman regarding the document production issues raised during her testimony.more specifically is the fact that there was a claim in front of the jury that there was a that appeared to involve our lawyers.further,under those circumstances and knowing that zimmerman would likely invoke her fifth amendment right or testify under immunity,we absolutely disagree regarding your ability to rehabilitate.there were other aggravating factors that occurred involving you,your father and other members of your firm however,this is not the time to review them.
an unprecedented and certainly unanticipated situation arose in which mercy employees needed to retain criminal counsel as directly related to the issue of redacted policies and procedures policies and procedures that you admitted had been redacted,notwithstanding your position that such was not relevant.in fact,those redactions were most relevant and,as a result,an irreconcilable conflict developed with your firm,all of which put us at tremendous risk.in light of these dramatic developments,the physicians insurers all tendered their policy limits and were prepared to take a joint tortfeasor release.we determined the case had to be settled to protect not only the assets of the trust but to eliminate the substantial potential of uninsured punitive exposure resulting from the actions of your firm.
on october,williams again wrote to post,stating 
pursuant to our internal protocols,your former clients,catholic healthcare partners,mercy health partners,and mercy hospital wilkes barre are providing you with a copy of the executed release in the above captioned matter.we ask that you note the for claims.
please notify your professional liability insurer of this,and ask a representative of that company to contact me upon receipt.
on october,post schell notified travelers that mercy had retained stevens lee as its counsel to review the matter for possible professional malpractice implications.post schell enclosed the aforementioned letters sent by williams.
george bochetto,counsel for post,sent a letter to travelers on november to put it on notice of a claim or potential claim against post.he enclosed the october letter from williams.on receipt of the letter which was contemporaneous with its receipt of the october letter from post schell,travelers opened a claims file for post.
michael spinelli,a senior claims specialist in travelers new york office,assumed responsibility for the claim.during the month of november,spinelli had numerous conversations and at least one email exchange with post schell partner william sutton regarding travelers retention of counsel to represent the firm in connection with mercy malpractice claim.there is no evidence that spinelli communicated with bochetto or post during this time,not even to acknowledge receipt of the claim.this was despite a travelers policy providing that 
t he claims professional is instructed to attempt to contact the insured within hours of receiving the claim to introduce yourself to the insured,acknowledge that you have received the claim and to speak with them to find out more information so you could assist the insured in the handling of the matter.
on november,saxton wrote to bochetto to place post on notice again of mercy malpractice claim.in relevant part,saxton letter stated 
as a to the various letters and discussions regarding this matter,please be advised that mercy is in the process of assigning counsel to pursue its claims against its former counsel in the bobbett case.however,before getting too far into the litigation process,i wanted to further discuss a meeting of the stakeholders that you first proposed verbally to my partner,jim schwartzman,esquire.while mercy is moving forward with preparation for litigation,it remains open to a meeting to discuss possible resolution prior to suit being filed.
to that end,they will need certain information from you,namely confirmation that you notified your client insurers regarding the potential claim,the name of the insurance carriers,and the name of the claims representative,if assigned.
d.the sanctions petition 
on november,the plaintiffs in the bobbett case filed a page petition for sanctions against post,reid,barton post,and post post.post schell was not named as a respondent.in the petition,the plaintiffs claimed that post and reid violated the pennsylvania rules of civil procedure and the rules of professional conduct in their handling of discovery by failing to produce producing altered versions of responsive documents,and misrepresenting to the plaintiffs and the court what documents mercy had in its possession.they asserted also that post and reid had engaged in dilatory,obdurate,vexatious,bad faith conduct.the discovery misconduct allegedly occurred while post and reid were with post schell and also while with post post.the plaintiffs sought sanctions against each defendant,as well as any other relief this court deems just and equitable 
by letter dated november,bochetto advised travelers of the sanctions petition and,pursuant to the policy,requested that travelers pay for post defense costs and indemnify post with respect to the petition.after receiving bochetto letter seeking a defense to the petition for sanctions,spinelli had a lengthy discussion with bochetto partner,jeffrey ogren,on december,about the bobbett case,the sanctions petition,and mercy malpractice claim.post contended that mercy made a malpractice claim that was covered by the policy.spinelli view was that the sanctions petition only sought relief in the form of sanctions,which are expressly excluded under the policy.as such,spinelli inclination was to deny coverage.
on december,travelers retained attorney mark anesh,a partner with the insurance defense firm of wilson elser moskowitz edelman dicker,as outside counsel to advise it on its defense and coverage obligations with regard to post.anesh is a new york attorney not licensed to practice law in pennsylvania.despite the fact that spinelli general practice was to provide coverage counsel with anything and everything he had,he did not provide anesh with any information regarding the allegations that mercy made in october and november.spinelli did not even advise anesh of mercy letters.rather,spinelli sent anesh only the petition for sanctions and other documents relating to the bobbett case,and spinelli asked anesh only for his opinion on whether there was coverage in connection with the sanctions petition alone.thus,in forming his opinion,anesh was not aware that a claim for legal malpractice had been lodged beforehand by mercy,nor was he aware that the factual allegations in the sanctions petition were identical to the factual allegations underlying mercy malpractice claim.likewise,anesh was not aware that mercy had retained counsel to pursue its legal malpractice claim.
after anesh reviewed the materials given to him and determined travelers was not obligated to defend or indemnify post with respect to the allegations against him in the petition for sanctions,he informed bochetto by a december letter that this was travelers conclusion.anesh also told bochetto that travelers had received a draft of the sanctions petition on october,three weeks before it had been filed.anesh explained the declining of coverage as follows 
the sole and complete relief sought by the petition at issue is not for damages as they are defined in the policy,but for sanctions.since sanctions are not included in the definition of damages under the policy,no coverage,either for defense or indemnity,will be afforded for the above mentioned petition or any hearing subsequently scheduled to address the contents of the petition.furthermore,a claim is defined in the policy as a demand that seeks damages.therefore,your request for defense and indemnity of the sanctions petition is not a claim as defined in the policy.
travelers reserved its rights to deny coverage on several other bases,including the exclusion for loss that results from any criminal,dishonest,or fraudulent wrongful act or any knowing violation of rights or laws.nonetheless,anesh stated that travelers was willing to reconsider its decision if other information warranted it.
in a letter dated december,bochetto,on post behalf,requested that travelers reconsider its denial of coverage for the sanctions petition,arguing that travelers erred on each basis it denied coverage.travelers determined that a change in coverage position was not warranted,and again denied that it owed any defense or coverage obligation to post.
post schell took the same coverage position as post,notwithstanding that the sanctions petition did not even name the firm as a respondent.post schell contended that mercy claim for malpractice against it and post was so intertwined with the sanctions petition that post schell fees and costs incurred in the latter responding to a document subpoena and a potential claim by post for contribution in the event sanctions were imposed on him should be paid by travelers.travelers responded that the policy did not cover legal fees and costs that the firm incurred in connection with the sanctions proceedings.
mercy joins in the sanctions proceedings 
from the onset of the sanctions proceedings,mercy participated in conferences with judge olszewski,insisted on receiving copies of all discovery produced by post,and attended depositions relating to the sanctions petition.
on january,mercy sought to question post during his deposition.post counsel objected to the questioning on the basis that mercy was not a party to the petition for sanctions.the parties could not resolve this discovery dispute on their own and turned to judge olszewski to resolve it.he decided to permit mercy to participate in the sanctions proceedings on the condition that mercy file an answer to the sanctions petition.on january,bochetto wrote to travelers to inform it of mercy intervention in the sanctions proceedings.travelers did not respond.
mercy filed an answer to the petition on february.it joined in the sanctions proceedings because it was required to participate in the search,review and production of documents,and to produce witnesses for depositions.in addition,mercy had an important interest in the plaintiffs request for sanctions because it was the misconduct of mercy former counsel that was at issue.mercy answer admitted that post and reid had engaged in discovery violations without mercy participation and that those violations had prejudiced the plaintiffs.mercy alleged that post had withheld information that he knew or should have known was discoverable,and had produced incomplete copies of policies covered up discoverable information on policies it was in this context that mercy claimed it joined the plaintiffs request for sanctions.mercy prayer for relief request ed that th e court hold an evidentiary hearing and sanction post and reid for their conduct,and to enter any other relief that this court deem ed just and equitable under the unique and serious circumstances presented before it,and award costs,attorneys fees and expenses.
during his deposition in february,mercy chief executive officer james may confirmed that mercy was seeking money damages in the sanctions proceedings for,among other things,the amount of the settlement and the negative publicity on account of post alleged misconduct.
on february,bochetto again wrote to travelers,this time to notify it of mercy answer to and joinder in the sanctions petition,as well as may deposition testimony,all of which made clear that mercy was seeking money damages in the sanctions proceedings.post and reid sought a defense to mercy answer to the sanctions petition.
spinelli and anesh reviewed mercy answer and determined that,like the petition for sanctions itself,it did not trigger coverage because it did not allege a claim for damages as defined by the policy.anesh informed bochetto of travelers coverage decision.
f.the travelers post letter agreement 
despite concluding that it owed no defense or indemnity obligation to post,travelers attempted to reach an accommodation with post that would reimburse him for some portion of the defense costs related to the sanctions proceedings.travelers did so because,while expressly reserving its rights on the issue of coverage,it recognized that there was significant overlap between the sanctions proceedings and mercy threatened malpractice suit,and what transpired during the sanctions proceedings could have an effect on the future malpractice suit with regard to which travelers arguably would owe defense and indemnity obligations.
to that end,in the spring of anesh had two meetings with counsel for post,reid,and post schell to discuss travelers payment of some of their attorneys fees despite its denial of coverage.bochetto testified that,at the second meeting,anesh agreed that travelers would pay a very substantial amount of the legal fees incurred to date,an amount that bochetto understood to be in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars.however,bochetto admitted that anesh n ever promised an exact dollar amount and that a specific dollar amount was not mentioned.
on may,anesh wrote to bochetto and gary figore reid counsel offering to pay post and reid attorneys fees in connection with the sanctions proceedings as follows 
travelers would pay an hourly rate of for partners,for senior associates,and for junior associates 
travelers would only pay for legal services provided on or after december,
travelers would only reimburse for attorney time expended to defend potential legal malpractice claims and 
the deductible would have to be exhausted prior to reimbursement.
in consideration for this payment,post would have to waive any claim for payment of attorneys fees and expenses in the context of the sanctions proceedings except as payable under the letter agreement.
post agreed to the terms of the offer letter and submitted invoices to travelers for over in fees related to the sanctions proceedings,which amount included over in fees incurred in the sanctions proceedings prior to mercy filing its answer to the petition.
after reviewing the invoices,anesh wrote to bochetto on july,stating that travelers would pay the amount of.anesh explained that the reduction in fees from the more than in invoices submitted resulted from travelers implementation of the terms of the offer letter as it had interpreted them.
the next day bochetto wrote to anesh rejecting travelers offer of payment and stating that he was genuinely offended by the contents of the letter and that the suggestion that only out of over in fees and expenses are reimbursable is beyond ludicrous.
in august and september,the parties to the sanctions proceedings began discussing the possibility of a mediation that would encompass the sanctions matter and the potential legal malpractice action.in light of this development,anesh wrote to bochetto and figore stating that travelers agree d to pay for fifty per cent of reasonable preparation time and attendance at the mediation.the mediation was scheduled for late november.
g.the bobbetts withdraw the sanctions petition 
in the fall of,post filed a lawsuit against the bobbetts lawyer,joseph quinn,for defamation and tortious interference in order to create leverage to persuade quinn to withdraw the sanctions petition.post believed that,if this tactic succeeded and the bobbetts discontinued the sanctions proceedings,mercy would no longer be able to use the sanctions proceedings to obtain discovery against post in aid of its malpractice claim without the burdens and costs of filing a direct action for malpractice.post lawsuit achieved its purpose on march,the bobbetts withdrew their sanctions petition with prejudice.
mercy files a praecipe for writ of summons against post 
in late summer,mercy offered to mediate its malpractice claim against post without resorting to litigation.post agreed and demanded that travelers assume all legal fees incurred by him in connection therewith.travelers responded that it had no duty to represent post in the mediation nor to reimburse him for the legal fees incurred in connection with it.instead,travelers made a courtesy offer of as a good faith gesture.bochetto rejected this offer,describing it as an absurdity.it almost goes without saying that the mediation between mercy and post was unsuccessful.
on november,mercy filed a praecipe for writ of summons against post in the court of common pleas of luzerne county,pennsylvania.the following february,post filed a praecipe for writ of summons against mercy in philadelphia county.in november,final agreement was reached among all involved parties mercy,post schell,post,reid,and travelers for discontinuance,with prejudice,of these two actions.no money was paid to any person or entity by or on behalf of post or post schell in consideration for the mutual discontinuances.
i.this lawsuit 
on october,post filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against travelers,liberty surplus insurance company,and lexington insurance company.liberty surplus and lexington post schell excess insurers were dismissed from the case in january.
on february,post filed an amended complaint against travelers wherein he asserted five claims.count i was for breach of contract based on travelers alleged breach of the policy.count ii also was for breach of contract,but was based on travelers putative breach of an oral agreement between bochetto and anesh that travelers would pay the costs incurred by post in connection with the sanctions proceedings.count iii asserted a claim for insurance bad faith pursuant to.in count iv,post asserted promissory estoppel,contending that travelers promised to cover his defense costs in connection with the sanctions proceedings and that post reasonably relied on travelers promise to his detriment.finally,count v sought a declaratory judgment that post was entitled to coverage for defense costs he incurred in connection with the sanctions proceedings.
on june,travelers moved for partial summary judgment as to post claims for breach of contract,insurance bad faith and declaratory judgment counts i,ii,iii,and v,asserting that its duty to defend post was not triggered by the bobbetts sanctions petition or by mercy answer to it because these pleadings related only to sanctions,and sanctions are expressly excluded from coverage under the policy.
on july,post filed a for partial summary judgment as to his breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims counts i,ii,and v.he argued,among other things,that travelers was legally required to defend and indemnify him in connection with the sanctions proceedings because mercy malpractice claim,which predated the sanctions petition,triggered coverage,the malpractice claim and the sanctions proceedings involved the same facts and were interrelated,and mercy was using the sanctions proceedings to further its claim of legal malpractice.
on january,the district court entered an explanation and order denying travelers motion for partial summary judgment and granting in part post.specifically,the court denied travelers motion for summary judgment as to counts i and v with prejudice,and denied that motion as to counts ii and iii without prejudice.it granted post as to counts i and v,and de nied it as to count ii without prejudice.the court held that the policy covered the sanctions petition,and explained in pertinent part as follows 
first,mercy malpractice claim triggered a duty to defend that included the sanctions petition after mercy joined because that petition was involved in the covered claim.as long as mercy malpractice claim could have resulted in covered loss,travelers had a duty to defend all proceedings involved in that claim.
second,even if the sanctions petition were not part of mercy claim,the petition was not excluded by the liability policy after mercy joined the petition.the sanctions exclusion in the liability policy does not exclude sanctions petitions brought or joined by an attorney former client the term sanctions was undefined in the liability policy sanctions,particularly those for violations of discovery rules,are understood to be sought by the opposing party on motion,while a client remedy for his or her attorney errors is a malpractice suit.
the sanctions exclusion in the liability policy under the commonly understood definition of sanctions refers to sanctions motions brought by opposing counsel.this exclusion does not preclude from coverage a sanctions petition joined by a lawyer former client,particularly one brought in anticipation of a malpractice suit based on identical allegations of wrongdoing.the relationship between post and mercy indicates that the damages mercy requested in the sanctions petition were actually malpractice damages,though mercy termed them sanctions.as post former client,the facts alleged by mercy in the sanctions petition sound in malpractice,even though brought under a cause of action for sanctions.it is the facts in the complaint that dictate whether the exclusion in the liability policy applies,not the cause of action selected by mercy.if the sanctions petition were excluded from coverage,mercy could choose whether to proceed with an action where post was covered by his insurance carrier,or an action where post was not,and potentially be awarded similar relief in either action.
a professional liability insurance carrier should not be able to avoid coverage for what is essentially a malpractice claim simply because of how an attorney former client chooses to term the requested relief.because the sanctions exclusion in the liability policy was unclear,it must be construed in favor of the insured.therefore,the sanctions petition was not excluded from coverage under the liability policy after mercy joined the sanctions petition and travelers had a duty to defend post at that time.travelers breached its duty to defend post under the liability policy and is therefore liable for breach of contract.
on january,the district court entered an order expressly granting travelers permission to file a renewed summary judgment motion as to bad faith.travelers did so on february.it asserted that an insurer can not be held liable for bad faith when,as here,its denial of coverage rests on a reasonable foundation and is fairly debatable rather,an insurer can only be found to have acted in bad faith if its refusal to provide coverage was frivolous,unfounded,or based on a motive of or ill will.
on march,the district court entered an explanation and order granting travelers motion for summary judgment as to post bad faith claim.it reasoned 
post,though he makes many allegations of misconduct on the part of travelers,can not prove that travelers did not have a reasonable basis to deny coverage t hough i previously held that coverage of the sanctions petition was required,travelers had a reasonable basis to deny coverage.it denied coverage to post because the sanctions petition requested relief in the form of sanctions,which were excluded from the liability policy i find that travelers denial of coverage was not legally frivolous or unfounded.post can not maintain a claim for bad faith even if his allegations of improper conduct are true because the sanctions exclusion in the liability policy was a reasonable basis for denying coverage.
post filed a motion for reconsideration of this grant of summary judgment on his bad faith claim,which the court denied.
in may,post withdrew counts ii and iv of the amended complaint.thereafter,the district court presided over a bench trial to determine the amount of damages to award post on count i.it concluded that he was entitled to reimbursement in the amount of,which represented the work relating directly to mercy potential malpractice claim beginning on october,and the work done relating to the sanctions petition after november.
post now appeals the entry of summary judgment on his bad faith claim.travelers from the damage award on the breach of contract claim

overview of issues 
the central issue for both post appeal from the dismissal of his bad faith claim,and travelers of the damage award on post breach of contract claim,is whether travelers had a duty to defend post in the sanctions proceedings.in short,post asserts that travelers owed such a duty and denying its defense obligations constituted bad faith as such,he contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in travelers favor on the bad faith claim.conversely,travelers argues that the policy expressly excludes sanctions,and,thus,not only was the denial of coverage entirely reasonable and done in good faith,but the district court erred by awarding damages to post based on travelers supposed breach of the policy.
c.the parties arguments 
post appeal as to bad faith 
on appeal,post asserts that the district court erred by granting travelers motion for summary judgment on bad faith because post had demonstrated that there were numerous genuine disputes of material fact which mandated the case being submitted to a jury.post contends that he produced evidence establishing,among other things,that travelers 
ignored post multiple notifications of mercy legal malpractice claim 
loaded the dice in seeking a formal coverage opinion from its outside counsel,who was not a member of the pennsylvania bar and who was unfamiliar with pennsylvania insurance law,and worse,travelers concealed from its outside counsel the existence of mercy claim 
failed to investigate the mercy malpractice claim 
communicated freely with,and favored,post schell at the expense of post 
provided legal representation to post schell,but not to post,under the very same insurance policy 
never responded to post demand for coverage of the legal malpractice claim as a whole instead,it denied coverage based on the more narrow issue of the sanctions proceeding without regard to the pending mercy claim 
ignored that the sanctions proceeding and the mercy malpractice claim were inextricably intertwined,thus triggering coverage 
made a bad faith offer to compromise post coverage claim in exchange for his waiving his rights under the policy 
violated its own policies and procedures,as well as pennsylvania law,in its mishandling of post claim and 
concealed documents particularly,purported manuals during discovery in this case.
post argues that mistreatment by an insurer,quite apart from an unreasonable denial of coverage,can itself give rise to a claim of bad faith.as support for this proposition,he cites an unpublished decision of this court,gallatin fuels,westchester fire insurance,wherein we stated that a finding that the insure r d oes not ultimately have a duty to cover the plaintiff claim does not per se make the insure r actions reasonable.app x,cir citing frog,switch travelers ins,cir bad faith is a frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay,lack of investigation into the facts,or a failure to communicate with the insured.emphasis in gallatin fuels.
travelers disagrees with post interpretation of pennsylvania law.according to travelers,a bad faith claim must consist of the unreasonable and intentional or reckless denial of benefits.see upmc health metro life ins,cir.because it had a reasonable basis to deny coverage for the sanctions proceedings,travelers asserts that it did not act in bad faith as a matter of law.further,it disputes the evidence purportedly supporting the putative bad faith mishandling of post coverage claim,arguing,among other things,that spinelli first communicated with post counsel and had a lengthy discussion with him within days of receiving bochetto november,letter there is no evidence that post schell received more favorable treatment than did post,nor that travelers favored the firm at post expense travelers conducted a thorough investigation of post coverage claim spinelli reviewed the policy,the sanctions petition,mercy answer thereto once it had been filed,and two large binders containing documents from the bobbett case,and he then took the additional step of retaining counsel to provide a coverage opinion and this investigation continued well after travelers declined to provide a defense in december and three travelers employees submitted affidavits attesting that no manuals existed for the lawyer professional group within travelers the supposedly concealed documents about which post complains.
travelers cross appeal as to the contractual damages award 
in support of its,travelers asserts that it did not owe a duty to defend post in the sanctions proceedings,explaining that its duty to defend post is determined solely by the allegations in the sanctions petition and mercy answer to it,neither of which triggered the duty to defend because there was no statement of a claim for covered damages,but rather a request for sanctions,which are expressly excluded by the policy.
in response,post contends that a demand for damages was made by mercy in october,and the subsequently filed sanctions petition did not eliminate travelers duty to investigate and defend mercy malpractice claim.instead,
t he duty to cover mercy malpractice claim that arose in october was a single,unitary obligation,which encompassed the sanctions proceeding initiated on november,but was not defined by it.this is so because the sanctions proceeding was merely a vehicle by which mercy advanced its claim.
post also observes that the duty to defend is broader in scope than the duty to indemnify,and that coverage provisions are to be interpreted broadly while exclusions are to be construed narrowly and against the insurer.
because our resolution on the merits of the breach of contract issue,whether travelers owed a duty to defend post under the policy affects our determination as to the issue of bad faith,whether travelers unreasonably and intentionally or recklessly denied coverage,we shall analyze post breach of contract claim first.

the question whether a claim against an insured is potentially covered is answered by comparing the four corners of the insurance contract to the four corners of the complaint.id.at.an insurer may not justifiably refuse to defend a claim against its insured unless it is clear from an examination of the allegations in the complaint and the language of the policy that the claim does not potentially come within the coverage of the policy.id.in making this determination,the factual allegations of the underlying complaint against the insured are to be taken as true and liberally construed in favor of the insured.frog,switch,at.t o determine if there is coverage,we must look to the facts alleged in the underlying complaint,not the cause of action pled.qbe ins.m s landis,emphasis in original.the manner in which the complainant frames its request for relief does not control.mut.benefit ins.haver,t he particular cause of action that a complainant pleads is not determinative of whether coverage has been triggered.instead it is necessary to look at the factual allegations contained in the complaint.

travelers duty to defend post against mercy claim was triggered at least as of october,
under the policy,travelers had a duty to defend post against any claim or suit for covered loss.because the policy differentiates a claim from a suit,and because it defines a claim as simply a demand that seeks damages,travelers duty to defend could be triggered by something short of,and prior to,the filing of a complaint.see heffernan hartford ins.of,holding that insurer duty to defend was triggered by answers to interrogatories because they put insurer on notice that a claim for damage will probably be made.
the policy provides that a claim is considered to be first made or brought on the date that travelers or any protected person first receives written notice of such claim.we thus find no error in the district court conclusion that mercy malpractice claim was first made or brought on october,the date on which mercy faxed to post a letter blaming him for exposing it to the threat of uninsured punitive damages and forcing it to settle the bobbett case for full policy limits in order to avoid such exposure.as such,travelers duty to defend post in connection with mercy malpractice claim was triggered at least as of october.
while damages were not explicitly demanded in the october,letter,mercy asserted its malpractice claim in no uncertain terms.after learning of post alleged misconduct,mercy quickly terminated him as its counsel.mercy told post that it would sue him for malpractice.indeed,in the september,conversation between jim saxton of stevens lee and barton post post father,wherein saxton threatened that he,on behalf of mercy,was going to bring a lawsuit for malpractice against post,saxton also advised that post should make arrangements to report the claim to travelers,the insurance carrier.mercy quickly followed up on this conversation by letter,dated october,wherein mercy advised post that it had retained stevens lee as outside counsel to investigate and potentially prosecute a legal malpractice claim against him,directed post to preserve relevant documents and electronic data in connection with the threatened malpractice suit,and requested that post produce all such relevant documents and electronic data to stevens lee.all this laid the groundwork for the october letter,wherein mercy blamed post for placing it in a position that demanded settlement so as to limit its exposure and protect its charitable assets from the substantial potential of uninsured punitive exposure resulting from the actions of your firm.
considering the cumulative effect of all that transpired,post immediate termination as mercy counsel,the september,conversation between saxton and barton post,and the october and october letters it would be fantasy to believe as of october that mercy would not be seeking damages from post in the threatened malpractice suit to compensate it for the excessive settlement it believed post misconduct forced on it.as the threatened malpractice suit certainly would have the potential to result in a covered loss under the policy,travelers duty to defend post in connection with mercy malpractice claim was triggered at the latest on the date that travelers or post first receive d a written notice of mercy claim october.
travelers contention that mercy letters did not trigger a duty to defend because they indicated only a potential claim underwhelms.there was nothing potential about mercy threat to sue post for malpractice or its assertion that post misconduct caused it monetary loss.the definition of claim under the policy does not require anything more than a demand that seeks damages,which mercy made via its threats and letters.indeed,travelers itself viewed its duty to defend as having been triggered by mercy letters because it opened a claims file for post and assigned responsibility of the claim to spinelli,who then spent considerable time reviewing numerous documents and analyzing the claim.
ii.the scope of travelers duty to defend against the sanctions petition is limited to the defense costs incurred by post subsequent to mercy filing of its answer on february,
we part ways with the district court with regard to the scope of travelers defense obligation,as we disagree with its holding that travelers duty to defend post encompassed the entirety of the sanctions proceedings that is,from when they were begun by the bobbetts.
relying on the policy definition of defense expenses which includes t he cost of the proceedings involved in the suit,including court reporter,arbitrator,and mediator fees the district court explained as follows 
when mercy joined the sanctions petition,the proceedings surrounding the petition became involved in mercy previously asserted malpractice claim through the potential for collateral estoppel effect.mercy likely joined the sanctions petition,in part,to participate in developing the facts law that would directly impact their malpractice suit assuming the sanctions petition did not result in sufficient monetary compensation to eliminate mercy need to sue for malpractice.
we disagree for at least two reasons.first,the court holding is at odds with the very distinction it and we recognized between a claim and a suit.this distinction was critical to its and our conclusion that mercy had asserted a covered malpractice claim at least as of october.but the court then puts aside this distinction by relying on t he cost of the proceedings involved in the suit policy language to support its view that the sanctions proceedings became involved in mercy malpractice claim once mercy began participating in those proceedings.under the policy,however,defense expenses only include costs involved in the suit,and neither mercy answer to the sanctions petition february,nor its malpractice action against post november,had been filed when the bobbetts filed their petition for sanctions against post on november.thus,while the sanctions proceedings related to mercy claim,there was as yet no suit that those sanctions proceedings could be involved in.the district court therefore erred by concluding,based on mercy participation in conference calls with judge olszewski and its insisting on receiving copies of all discovery produced in the sanctions proceedings,that mercy became sufficiently involved in the sanctions p etition to have joined the proceedings from the day the p etition was filed,on november.no amount of participation by mercy in the sanctions proceedings would be sufficient prior to the filing of a suit which means under the policy a civil proceeding that seeks damages a prerequisite to travelers liability.as noted below,that prerequisite was satisfied on february,the date on which mercy filed its answer to the sanctions petition and sought damages against post.
second,the district court conclusion goes against two canons of contract interpretation.under the principle of ejusdem generis,i t is widely accepted that general expressions such as including,but not limited to that precede a specific list of included items should not be construed in their widest context,but apply only to persons or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned in the list of examples.mcclellan health maint.org.of.similarly,t he ancient maxim noscitur a sociis summarizes the rule that the meaning of words may be indicated or controlled by those words with which they are associated.words are known by the company they keep.northway vill,northway props.the cost of the proceedings involved in the suit includes court reporter,arbitrator,and mediator fees,not attorneys fees.attorneys fees traditionally are distinguished from costs.see.d differentiating between costs and attorney fees.the policy recognizes this distinction,addressing attorneys fees in a separate in the definition of defense expenses.
in this context,in the absence of a suit a civil proceeding that sought damages the policy involved in language can not apply.hence,travelers did not owe a duty to defend post in connection with the sanctions petition at the time the petition was filed by the bobbetts on november.
however,mercy answer to the sanctions petition,filed on february,and which included a prayer for relief requesting any other relief that this court deems just and equitable under the unique and serious circumstances presented before it,and award costs,attorneys fees and expenses,triggered coverage under the policy.while mercy did not explicitly request damages as an item of relief,the prayer in its answer did generally request any other just and equitable relief as well as costs,attorneys fees and expenses.it is debatable whether the general prayer for other relief rendered mercy answer a civil proceeding that seeks damages.compare meth meth,under the prayer for general relief,a decree which accords with the equities of the cause may be shaped and rendered the court may grant any appropriate relief that conforms to the case made by the pleadings although it is not exactly the relief which h as been asked for,with baird first.bank,wl,at holding that a request for such other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate is,by itself,no claim for relief at all,and requiring the plaintiff to amend the complaint.mercy specific request for costs,attorneys fees and expenses nonetheless was sufficient to do so because attorneys fees both amounts paid by the client to the negligent attorney as well as expenses incurred by the client to prosecute its malpractice claim against the attorney are an item of damages in a legal malpractice claim.see bailey tucker,holding that plaintiff in legal malpractice action could recover amounts paid to his attorney as damages feld and sons,pechner,dorfman,wolfee,rounick,and cabot,stating that clients could recover fees paid to their lawyer who violated professional obligations owed to clients ronald mallen jeffrey smith,legal malpractice,at attorneys fees incurred in legal malpractice action may be recoverable as consequential damages.because mercy requested its attorneys fees as an item of relief in its february,answer to the sanctions petition,the sanctions proceeding at that time became a civil proceeding that sought damages,and thus a suit,thereby triggering coverage under the policy.
in addition,mercy answer to the sanctions petition in reality,its joining with the bobbetts against post,reid,barton post,and post post admitted alleged facts potentially giving rise to a covered malpractice claim under the policy.mercy admitted alleged that post was its former counsel,that he failed to exercise ordinary skill or knowledge by unethically and improperly redacting withholding discoverable information,and that his failure to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge subjected him to sanctions and liability for attorneys fees in essence,stating the elements of a malpractice claim.see bailey,at explaining that,to state a claim for legal malpractice under pennsylvania law,an aggrieved client must allege that the parties were in an relationship the attorney failed to exercise ordinary skill or knowledge and the attorney failure to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge was the proximate cause of damage to the client.
moreover,because mercy sought damages in addition to sanctions,and the facts admitted and alleged by mercy in its answer to the sanctions petition stated a potentially covered malpractice claim,the policy sanctions exclusion does not shield travelers from its duty to defend post.see caplan,at under pennsylvania law,when an insured tenders multiple claims to an insurer for defense,the insurer is obligated to undertake defense of the entire suit as long as at least one claim is potentially covered by the policy.this exclusion would only excuse travelers duty to defend post if the possibility of mercy recovery could be confined solely to sanctions.see am.contract bridge,at the insurer is obligated to fully defend its insured until it can confine the possibility of recovery to claims outside the coverage of the policy.mercy potential recovery could not be so confined.
iii.the policy does not cover post mercy 
we believe also the district court should not have held that post suit against mercy filed in philadelphia county in february was covered under the policy on the basis that it was inextricably intertwined with mercy malpractice claim against post.
had post asserted counterclaims in mercy suit against him,no doubt the expenses incurred by him to prosecute the counterclaims would have been covered by the policy.see tig ins.nobel learning,no.civ,wl,at.june,holding that counterclaims that were inextricably intertwined with the defense of the initial claims were logically encompassed by duty to defend safeguard scientifics,liberty mut.ins,holding that the insurer duty to defend extended to counterclaims raised in the same proceeding because the pursuit of the counterclaims was inextricably intertwined with the defense and was necessary to the defense of the litigation as a strategic matter.
however,post did not simply assert counterclaims in the same proceeding rather,he filed a separate civil action in a different venue.while post new action in philadelphia county surely related to the case instituted by mercy in luzerne county,to hold that post separate action was covered by the policy simply because it related to mercy suit would condone,and perhaps even encourage,the multiplicity of litigation.such a holding also would place insurers in the difficult and unenviable situation of having to determine whether related cases are related enough,inextricably intertwined to trigger coverage for the insured counterclaims.both of these results are highly undesirable and,therefore,we can not adopt such a rule.
as judge savage persuasively stated in amquip admiral insurance,
i f courts were to consider the costs an insured incurred by instituting its own action for the purpose of bringing pressure on the other party under the guise of a litigation defense,it would encourage and endorse multiplicity of litigation.this is much different than requiring the insurer to reimburse the insured for the cost of prosecuting counterclaims raised in the same action.
no.civ,wl,at,savage.
rather than require insurers to decide whether they have a duty to cover an insured expenses in a separate action based on a highly contextual and subjective inquiry into whether it is sufficiently related to the underlying action the rule that the district court applied here,amquip provides a and sensible rule that an insurer has a duty to cover an insured expenses for prosecuting counterclaims in the initial proceeding,but that insurer has no duty to cover the expenses incurred by an insured in prosecuting an entirely new and separate action even if that action is related to the underlying case.while there certainly may be tactical reasons for an insured to file a related suit in a different venue,we believe that discouraging multiple litigation and providing clear coverage guidelines for insurers are more important considerations.the rule in amquip will provide clarity to insurers and insureds,as well as conserve their legal costs and expenses not to mention judicial resources,and thus will better serve insurance coverage litigants.because amquip provides a better rule of law,we hereby adopt it.
accordingly,travelers is not required to cover the expenses incurred by post in connection with the separate action he filed against mercy in philadelphia county.
conclusion re duty to defend 
travelers owed post a duty to defend against mercy malpractice claim from october,onward,and the sanctions petition subsequent to the filing of mercy answer on february.however,travelers is not liable for the expenses incurred by post in connection with the separate action he filed in philadelphia county.
insurance bad faith 
legal standard 
to recover for bad faith,a plaintiff must show by clear and convincing evidence that the insurer did not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy and knew or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.condio erie ins.exch.thus,an insurer may defeat a claim of bad faith by showing that it had a reasonable basis for its actions.amica mut.ins.fogel,cir.t he essence of a bad faith claim is the unreasonable and intentional or reckless denial of benefits.upmc health,at.
the superior court of pennsylvania has explained 
bad faith on the part of an insurer is any frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay proceeds of a policy it is not necessary that such refusal be fraudulent.for purposes of an action against an insurer for failure to pay a claim,such conduct imports a dishonest purpose and means a breach of a known duty,good faith and fair dealing,through some motive of or ill will mere negligence or bad judgment is not bad faith.
terletsky prudential prop.cas.ins,quoting black law dictionary ed.
a reasonable basis is all that is required to defeat a claim of bad faith.penney life ins.pilosi,cir.moreover,mere negligence or bad judgment does not constitute bad faith knowledge or reckless disregard of a lack of a basis for denial of coverage is necessary.frog,switch,at.
while an insurer has a duty to accord the interests of its insured the same consideration it gives its own interests,an insurer is not bound to submerge its own interest in order that the insured interests may be made paramount,and an insurer does not act in bad faith by investigating and litigating legitimate issues of coverage.penney,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
even questionable conduct giving the appearance of bad faith is not sufficient to establish it so long as the insurer had a reasonable basis to deny coverage.id.affirming summary judgment in insurer favor on bad faith claim because there was a reasonable basis to deny coverage,even though insurer took inconsistent coverage positions in other situations and made false statements in its marketing materials.see allstate ins,explaining that,while bad faith may also extend to the insurer investigative practices,in the absence of evidence of a dishonest purpose or ill will,it is not bad faith for an insurer to take a stand with a reasonable basis or to aggressively investigate and protect its interests.
bad faith must be proven by clear and convincing evidence and not merely insinuated.terletsky,at.this heightened standard requires evidence so clear,direct,weighty and convincing as to enable a clear conviction,without hesitation,about whether or not the defendants acted in bad faith.bostick itt hartford,d,citations omitted.thus,the plaintiff burden in opposing a summary judgment motion is commensurately high in light of the substantive evidentiary burden at trial.penney,at.in a bad faith case,summary judgment in favor of the insurer is appropriate when there is no clear and convincing evidence that its conduct was unreasonable and that it knew or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.bostick,d at.
the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of travelers on post insurance bad faith claim brought pursuant to.the sanctions exclusion in the policy provided travelers a reasonable basis for declining to provide a defense to post,and there is nothing in the record let alone clear and convincing evidence indicating that travelers purported mishandling of post claim was motivated by a dishonest purpose or ill will.
with his primary bad faith argument foreclosed by our and the district court conclusion that travelers had a reasonable basis for declining coverage,post asserts that travelers engaged in bad faith conduct by,among other things,ignoring communications from the insured,violating its own policies and procedures,agreeing to pay for defense counsel for post schell but not him,and keeping crucial information from anesh as he made his coverage determination.this mishandling of his claim,post contends,is a basis for finding bad faith,irrespective of the final decision on the issue of coverage.
in support of his contention,post principally relies on our case of gallatin fuels,westchester fire insurance,which he cites for the proposition that a finding that the insure r did not ultimately have a duty to cover the plaintiff claim does not per se make the insure r actions reasonable.app x at.while that statement is no doubt true,post reliance on gallatin fuels is misplaced.
as explained above,while under pennsylvania law bad faith may extend to an insurer investigation and other conduct in handling the claim,that conduct must import a dishonest purpose.brown progressive ins,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.invariably,this requires that the insurer lack a reasonable basis for denying coverage,as mere negligence or aggressive protection of an insurer interests is not bad faith.see frog,switch,at explaining that mere negligence or bad judgment does not constitute bad faith,at explaining that an insurer may aggressively investigate and protect its interests.
indeed,gallatin fuels underscores this rule.in that case,both the insurer and the insured mistakenly believed that the insurance policy remained in full force when,in fact,the policy had been canceled.app x at.before realizing that the policy had been canceled,however,the insurer denied the insured claim without a reasonable basis.id.at.the insurer also misrepresented the terms of the policy,dragged its feet in the investigation of the claim,hid information from the insured,and continued to shift its basis for denying the claims.id.at.based on these facts,we held that a jury could have found and,indeed,did find that the insurer acted in bad faith given its working assumption that the policy had not been canceled.id.because of the misrepresentations and dishonesty of the insurer in denying the claim without a reasonable basis for doing so though there was a reason about which the insurer did not yet know,we cautioned that gallatin fuels was one of the exceedingly rare cases in which an insurer can be liable for bad faith even though there was no duty to provide coverage.see id.
that is not the case here,where post assails largely benign conduct conduct that certainly does not import a dishonest purpose simply because he disagrees with travelers decision to deny coverage on the plausible basis that the sanctions exclusion precluded coverage.thus,gallatin fuels would not be helpful to post case even were it precedential.see generally cir.the court by tradition does not cite to its not precedential opinions as authority.such opinions are not regarded as precedents that bind the court because they do not circulate to the full court before filing.
