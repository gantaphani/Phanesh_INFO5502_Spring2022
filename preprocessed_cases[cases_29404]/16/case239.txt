sylvio baltodano says he was unjustly fired for minor infractions as a pretense for his supervisor discriminatory attitude toward ricans.he also claims he was discharged without just cause and in breach of contract,even if discriminatory animus toward ricans did not motivate his termination.on an incomplete record,the district court disagreed,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants merck,sharp,and dohme corporation and nilda vazquez,the allegedly discriminatory supervisor.baltodano asks that we find the district court grant of summary judgment premature due to merck failure to participate fully in the discovery process.after sifting through arguments and evidence,we agree that the case was not ripe for summary judgment and remand.
the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to baltodano,could support the following facts.see galera johanns,f d,cir.
employment with merck 
baltodano is not from puerto rico.after completing his studies at the university of california,in he began working for merck as a sales representative in nicaragua.the following year he was promoted to a position in costa rica next came a transfer to miami,florida and then in he was promoted again,this time to the position of sales administration and compliance manager in a suburb of san juan,puerto rico.
merck divides its business into regions,and baltodano departure from costa rica entailed a move from the candean to the caribbean region.these regions maintain different policies and particular,the candean region is not,but the caribbean region is.with unclear motivations,a merck supervisor specifically told baltodano and another rican of merck,francene matheus,that they would have to work harder than their puerto rican in order to advance.nevertheless,baltodano thrived at first in the caribbean region,earning another promotion in.
at the outset of the promotion,baltodano met with his supervisor,wendy perry they agreed that he would complete product certifications for the drugs vytorin,zetia,and fosamax by the end of june.but the certifications proved very.by september,baltodano had completed only two of the three he had agreed to do he completed the final certification a few days later.in december,perry issued him a final warning as a result of the late certifications.at the same time,baltodano learned that employees from puerto rico were given time off to complete the certification exams.he received no similar accommodation from merck.
in early,a new problem arose,this time regarding baltodano failure to submit timely expense reports.the details of this problem are spotty,but it is clear that in march he was suspended for three days.nonetheless,he earned a raise that very month.in june,his supervisor,vincent caballaro,issued a second final warning as a to the suspension.
in fall,defendant vazquez became baltodano supervisor.baltodano court filings paint vazquez as having lurked in the background up to this point,waiting all the time for a chance to exercise her xenophobic animus against him.as evidence of this animus baltodano points to a couple of interactions between the two of them around this time baltodano began seeking a transfer to merck miami office for reasons.these plans fell through after baltodano again submitted late expense in late october,and october in late november.this time,he was fired.a subsequent interview with a firm in in a job offer,which was revoked after a bad reference from merck.
suit against merck 
baltodano filed a diversity suit against merck and vazquez in the district court for the district of puerto rico.he alleged violations of puerto rico law employment discrimination,article ii of the puerto rico constitution essentially defamation,and puerto rico law termination without just cause,as well as violations of two puerto rico civil code,a breach of contract claim and a defamation claim.
procedural history is important here,so we will dwell on it a bit longer than usual,beginning.on may,while deposing vazquez,counsel for baltodano asked whether vazquez had disciplined other managers for the same misconduct that had been the basis for her warnings and firing of baltodano vazquez said she could not remember.the same day,baltodano requested this information from merck.merck objected.
only after merck had filed a motion for summary judgment did it agree to describe the disciplinary actions verbal,written,warnings,if any,taken by merck as to other business managers for failure to submit expense reports or follow scheduling for product certification.given this agreement,baltodano filed a rule f motion,requesting only that the court delay ruling on the summary judgment motion and that it allow baltodano to supplement his brief once merck provided the promised information.the court never acted on this motion,and merck repeatedly and unilaterally pushed back the date that,it said,it would finally comply with the agreement.
merck never provided the promised information.on august,baltodano filed a motion to compel or,in the alternative,to follow rule of the puerto rico rules of evidence and hold that merck created a presumption adverse to merck that no other managers were disciplined for misconduct comparable to baltodano.on august,merck renewed its objection and again refused to provide the information,responding vaguely that some business managers may have failed to comply with certification scheduling due dates if such were the case,generally,each situation is managed individually.merck added that there was no other situation quite like baltodano,and that a litany of supervisors could not recall whether any other business managers might have committed misconduct.
following this answer,baltodano sought an extension of time to file a to the summary judgment motion and,in short order,filed the renewing his argument under rule.eventually,the court denied baltodano motion to compel without comment and then granted merck motion for summary judgment.baltodano filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court promptly denied.
baltodano appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
summary judgment is inappropriate 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.museum of contemporary art,b√ºchel,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the record reflects no genuine issue of material fact and where,with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the party here,baltodano,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see collazo nicholson,cir.our law provides plainly that where a plaintiff case depends on his ability to secure evidence within the possession of defendants,courts should not render summary judgment because of gaps in a plaintiff proof without first determining that plaintiff has had a fair chance to obtain necessary and available evidence from the other party.carmona toledo,cir.any other rule would encourage defendants to stonewall during or covering up key information that is otherwise available to them through the exercise of reasonable diligence.id.against this backdrop,we will analyze each of baltodano claims.
puerto rico law requires employers to compensate employees who are discharged without just cause.laws ann.tit.just cause may be founded on,repeated violations of the employer published reasonable rules and regulations established for the operation of the establishment,id.c just cause may not be founded on the mere whim of the employer,id.in any event,a discharge is without good cause if its cause does not relate to the proper and normal operation of the employer.id.
law establishes a scheme.once an employee has shown only that he was discharged,it is up to the employer to prove that the discharge was justified.id.a see also pepsi cola of bottling,cir.law then allows the employee to rebut any showing of just cause.see,at.
there is no question that baltodano was discharged,so it is merck burden to demonstrate just cause.merck claims the discharge was the result of baltodano repeated violations of reasonable company rules and regulations.but here baltodano,who contends discriminatory animus drove his discharge,can not make such a rebuttal because he has not had a fair chance to obtain
