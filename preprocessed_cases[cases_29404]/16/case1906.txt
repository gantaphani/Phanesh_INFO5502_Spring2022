detroit diesel corporation and the union representing detroit diesel workers entered into a series of agreements purporting to cap detroit diesel contributions to retiree health care benefits for workers who retired between and.both detroit diesel and the union intended this agreement to reduce detroit diesel balance sheet liability after an accounting rule change in late the first detroit diesel account for retiree health care costs on an accrual basis.detroit diesel and the union did not renew the agreements capping benefits in the bargaining cycle,instead implementing a new retiree health care program for retirees.the parties dispute whether the caps continue to apply to retirees.interpreting the relevant agreements to provide for continued application of the caps is the most sensible reading of those agreements,is consistent with detroit diesel accounting obligations,and is consistent with our precedents.the agreed caps therefore continue to apply to retirees.
detroit diesel corporation designs and manufactures diesel engines at a plant in detroit,michigan.the international union,united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural workers of america local uaw represents the production and maintenance personnel employed by detroit diesel.operating under an agreement collectively bargained between detroit diesel and the uaw,detroit diesel provided health care insurance coverage to its retirees as of.in that year,detroit diesel and the uaw entered into the first of a series of cap agreements,which purported to limit the yearly expenditures by detroit diesel for the health care costs of workers who retired after the first cap agreement effective date.this case concerns the interpretation of those agreements.
the parties entered into the negotiations that eventually led to the first of the cap agreements as a result of an accounting by the financial accounting standards board in december.that rule required,for the first time,that publicly traded companies,including detroit diesel,account for retiree health care costs on an accrual basis.fas required companies to recognize a liability for the present value of all of their future payments for retiree health care expenditures immediately,rather than including these costs on the company balance sheet on a basis.see united steelworkers cooper tire rubber,cir.fas also required a presumption that companies would continue to provide the same level of health care benefits,even when those benefits were not vested.detroit diesel and ceo testified that detroit diesel had a capital base of approximately fifty to seventy million dollars in late and early,and that fas,if implemented without any change to detroit diesel collective bargaining agreements cbas,would have resulted in detroit diesel recognizing a one hundred million dollar liability.such a change,the testified,could have bankrupted the company by rendering it unable to obtain capital.
to avoid this outcome,as well as to protect the employees profit sharing and jobs,detroit diesel and the uaw entered into the first of the cap agreements on january.this cap agreement provided 
the parties agree to limit detroit diesel contribution toward retiree health benefit premiums.the contribution limit will be of cost per average hourly employee.the contribution limit will be of the limit or of the cost per average employee,whichever is greater.these limits are for retirees under the age of.post age contribution limits are of the amounts.
the above contribution limit is the maximum amount that detroit diesel will pay per year for health care premium values for each eligible retiree.
the above contribution limits apply to employees who have 
retirement dates effective on or after the signing date of this agreement.
the impact of fas transition obligation will not affect employee profit sharing.
the contribution limit proved to be,and the limit was.the cap agreement also provided that the parties would establish a voluntary employee benefit association veba trust.the agreement provided that the parties would utilize this veba trust to automatically pay any premiums in excess of the contribution limit for retiree health care costs and such other benefits as may be allowed under veba regulations and agreed to by the parties.detroit diesel agreed to contribute to the trust in and in.the parties also agreed that the detroit joint training fund would contribute to the trust in each of and.the cap agreement further provided that i f either party has an issue regarding benefits paid out of the veba t rust the amount or sources of funding into the trust that can not be resolved by the veba committee,then such issue will be collectively bargained among the parties.
contemporaneously with the signing of the cap agreement,detroit diesel senior paul walters signed a letter addressed to uaw region director robert king,which stated in part 
it is the purpose of this letter to state unequivocally that 
the cap agreement limits were established for the purpose of minimizing the financial impact of fas while still complying with the purpose and intent of such standard.
detroit diesel fully recognizes,acknowledges and hereby confirms that retiree health care benefits for detroit diesel uaw employees have been and will continue to be benefits and that establishment of contribution limits in no way modifies or negates this commitment.
the cba in effect in expired in.after collective bargaining,the parties entered into the second cap agreement,dated august,which was a companion to the master cba.this cap agreement provided,the current limit of detroit diesel contribution toward health care,of,will remain at that amount during the life of the detroit diesel uaw master agreement.the cap agreement also provided that the veba trust would receive per year from the following sources per year from the employee pool,per year from the detroit joint training fund,and per year from detroit diesel.
the cba expired in.the third cap agreement was signed around march,as a companion to the master cba,and it provided 
the current sic of detroit diesel contribution toward healthcare for those employees hired prior to august,of will remain at that amount during the life of the detroit diesel uaw master agreement.
annual contributions of will be made into the detroit diesel veba trust for the years from the detroit diesel uaw joint training fund account.
the master cba expired in.detroit diesel and the uaw entered into a new master cba in that implemented a new health care program for retirees.the parties did not enter into any additional agreements regarding detroit diesel contribution limits for retirees or regarding contributions to the veba trust.within the next two years,the funds in the veba trust were depleted.in august,detroit diesel notified retirees who had retired between and that they would be responsible for the costs of their health care beginning in january.for some retirees,such costs were more than eight hundred dollars per month.
plaintiffs,who are among the retirees notified that they would have to pay costs,sued detroit diesel in october under the relations act,and the employee retirement income security act,a b,arguing that they were entitled to fully funded,lifetime health care benefits.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction requiring detroit diesel to continue providing fully funded health care benefits to the retirees during the pendency of this action.wood detroit diesel,wl.the district court reasoned that because none of the agreements between detroit diesel and the uaw expressly stated that retirees would have to contribute to health care premiums,the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.id.at.we rejected this reasoning on appeal,holding that the lack of express provision for retiree contributions was not sufficient by itself to establish a likelihood of success because the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had vested rights to health care benefits.wood detroit diesel,app x,cir citing yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.but we nevertheless upheld the grant of a preliminary injunction,holding that based on the language in the paul walters letter that health care benefits for detroit diesel uaw employees have been and will continue to be benefits,the plaintiffs had some likelihood of success,though perhaps not a strong likelihood.id.at.
the parties conducted additional discovery before the district court and then filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied the defendant motion.wood detroit diesel,slip.op.at.the district court primarily relied on its conclusion that the cbas in effect from demonstrated an intent to vest fully funded,lifetime health care benefits to detroit diesel retirees.see id.at.the district court found that the cap agreements could not alter this vested obligation.id.at.the district court also found that the cap agreements were ambiguous and that the extrinsic evidence conclusively revealed that the cap agreements were never intended to have any substantive effect.id.at.detroit diesel now appeals,arguing that the cap agreements apply and that they unambiguously establish that retirees are entitled only to capped benefits.
detroit diesel is entitled to summary judgment because the only coherent reading of the cap agreements establishes that detroit diesel retirees are entitled to lifetime,capped health care benefits.for a detroit diesel employee who retired in a given year under one of the cap agreements,the cap amount applicable to that year both determined and limited the extent of detroit diesel vested obligation to that retiree.
the language of the cap agreements plainly determines this outcome for the years enumerated by those cap agreements.consistent with the arguments of the parties,we assume that the cba in effect before the signing of the cap agreement granted detroit diesel retirees fully funded,lifetime health care benefits under the rules announced by cole arvinmeritor,cir,and noe polyone,cir.in the cap agreement,detroit diesel and the uaw agree d to limit detroit diesel contribution toward retiree health benefit premiums.the cap agreement also provided for the creation of a veba trust and the funding of that trust,and the parties agreed to utilize this veba trust to automatically pay any premiums in excess of the contribution limit for retiree health care cost.detroit diesel employees who retired after the effective date of the cap agreement received their vested health care benefits subject to the limitations imposed by that agreement.thus,an employee retiring in did so knowing that detroit diesel would pay only the capped amount for that employee retirement benefits in,and that the veba trust would pay any excess costs to the extent that the trust had sufficient funds.detroit diesel was plainly not obligated to pay amounts above the cap levels,even if the veba trust had insufficient funds,as the cap agreement provided that the specified contribution limits were the maximum amount that detroit diesel will pay per year for health care premium values for each eligible retiree.the necessary implication of this contract provision is that retirees were responsible for costs to the extent that the veba trust was insufficient to pay those costs,even if the cap agreement did not directly state this fact.
the same cap continued to apply after the dates covered by a given cap agreement under the plainest reading of the cap agreements in light of this court vesting rules.under this circuit predate the cap agreements at issue in this care benefits vest at the point of retirement.winnett caterpillar,cir uaw,cir.in the cap agreement,the parties agreed to limit detroit diesel contribution toward retiree health benefit premiums without providing for an expiration date for the limitation.this indicates the broad shift made by the cap agreements,which was from an entitlement of a defined funded,lifetime health care a defined capped dollar amount.the vested rights of an employee who retired under one of the cap agreements were restricted by the parties agreement to limit detroit diesel contribution,and thus that employee could not have been the point of that employee vested,lifetime,unlimited health care benefits.
this conclusion is supported by the fact that a vested right to fully funded,lifetime health care benefits would be inconsistent with this court obligation to interpret the provisions of the cap agreements as part of the integrated whole and consistently with the entire document and the relative positions and purposes of the parties.yolton,at quoting,at.if the caps imposed by the cap agreements expired after the dates covered by a given cap agreement,this would render those agreements incoherent and would directly undermine the undisputed purpose of the cap agreements,which was,in the language of the paul walters letter,minimizing the financial impact of fas while still complying with the purpose and intent of such standard.taking the cap agreement as an example,it can not be that the caps imposed for workers retiring in expired in when that cap agreement no longer applied to newly retiring workers.in part,this is because it would not make any sense to impose a cap on retiree health care expenses only in the first year of retirement such an agreement would not be consistent with any applicable purpose.more specifically,it certainly would not be consistent with the parties clear purpose to reduce detroit diesel fas liability while still complying with the purpose and intent of fas.if the cap applicable to a retiree expired in,then the total expected liability for that retiree health care expenses would not be reduced for any year after.to achieve the purpose of the cap agreements,those agreements must have limited the vested rights of detroit diesel retirees both during and after the years covered by the cap agreements.
that fas requires employers to presume that current policies will be continued in the future does not mean that detroit diesel could have been obligated to provide fully funded lifetime health care benefits yet report a lower obligation to investors.fas generally provides that,a bsent evidence to the contrary,it shall be presumed that an employer that has provided postretirement benefits in the past or is currently promising those benefits to employees will continue to provide those future benefits.this prevents employers from falsely assuming that they will cease offering retirement benefits to workers who retire in future years merely because those workers are not yet entitled to vested benefits.fas similarly provides that a ll assumptions shall presume that the plan will continue in effect in the absence of evidence that it will not continue.fas does not allow companies to presume the impossible,for the presumption only applies in the absence of evidence to the contrary.if retirees had a vested right to fully funded,lifetime health care expenses after the years covered by a given cap agreement,then detroit diesel could not have presumed otherwise.
additionally,our precedents with respect to general durational clauses in cbas support the conclusion that the caps continued to apply after the years specifically covered by the cap agreements.the durational limits in the cap agreements were much like the general durational clauses in many cbas.we have repeatedly considered cbas that contain language which,for instance,states that the insurance provisions of a cba shall continue in effect until the termination of the cba of which this is a part.cole,at.even though this language would apparently imply that retiree health benefits would also expire at the termination of the cba,the rule in this circuit is that g eneral durational provisions only refer to the length of the cbas and not the period of time contemplated for retiree benefits.absent specific durational language referring to retiree benefits themselves,courts have held that the general durational language says nothing about those retiree benefits.id.quoting yolton,at.we apply this rule because while the retirement package available to someone contemplating retirement will change with the expiration and adoption of cbas,someone already retired under a particular cba continues to receive the benefits provided therein despite the expiration of the agreement itself.id.emphasis omitted quoting yolton,at.this rule applies to manage the tension between this court vesting rules,which contemplate fixed,benefits,and the contracts we are called upon to interpret,which are durationally limited.likewise,the cap agreements in this case impact the vested,rights of detroit diesel retirees even though the cap agreements themselves are limited to certain years.by analogy to general durational clauses,thus,the caps applicable to someone contemplating retirement will change with the expiration and adoption of cap agreements,but someone already retired under a particular cap agreement continues to receive the benefits provided therein despite the expiration of the agreement itself.id.
an interpretation of the cap agreements under which the caps applied only as long as they were renewed by the parties is also inconsistent with the policy considerations underlying our precedents regarding vested benefits.this court vesting precedents are based on the idea that it is unlikely that life and heath insurance benefits for retired workers,which are typically understood as a form of delayed compensation or reward for past services,would be left to the contingencies of future negotiations,at.thus,retiree health care benefits are vested at the point of retirement because the union owes no obligation to bargain for continued benefits for retirees and because it would be unfair to allow future agreements between the employer and the union to reduce the pension benefits of retirees when neither the union nor the employer is required to represent those retirees.see id.there is therefore no difference between saying that the union and the employer were able to continue the caps in future bargaining rounds and saying that any benefits were not vested.if the employees had a vested right to contributions from detroit diesel,then no agreement between detroit diesel and the uaw could have reduced that right.the cap agreements recognized this fact by explicitly exempting workers from the caps but workers who retired after the cap agreements were effective received vested rights subject to the cap.detroit diesel and the uaw might have altruistically agreed in later years to provide greater benefits to the they effectively did,by agreeing to veba trust the vested rights were only to the capped contributions.
because there is no textually plausible alternative interpretation of the cap agreements that is consistent with both detroit diesel accounting obligations and our precedents,the cap agreements unambiguously continue to limit the vested benefits to which detroit diesel retirees are entitled.detroit diesel is therefore entitled to summary judgment,and we need not consider any of the extrinsic evidence presented by the parties.see noe,at.
this conclusion withstands a number of arguments advanced,implicitly or explicitly,by the plaintiffs.the cap agreements can not be regarded as sham agreements intended only to disguise the nature of detroit diesel retiree obligations for accounting purposes.detroit diesel substantially reduced the financial liability it reported under fas on the basis of the cap agreements.if those agreements had no binding effect,then this was plainly deceptive accounting.as explained above,no creative reading of fas presumption rules could allow detroit diesel to report capped future liabilities if retirees were entitled to vested uncapped benefits.nor is it a sufficient response for the plaintiffs to argue that any reporting issues were the company responsibility alone.the parties entered into the agreement with the joint purpose of reducing detroit diesel reported liabilities under fas,and not only must we interpret the cap agreements consistently with the purposes of the parties,yolton,at,but we are loath to determine that the two sophisticated parties in this case entered into an agreement that was inconsistent with the applicable accounting standards.additionally,the interpretation of the cap agreements as meaningless finds no grounding in the text of that agreement,as that text both specifically delineates the caps for detroit diesel obligations and states that detroit diesel will not have to pay any amounts above those caps.
the fact that the veba trust was set up to pay costs does not answer the question of who is responsible for costs when that trust is depleted.there are three plausible parties that could contribute to retiree health care costs detroit diesel,the veba trust,and the retirees.detroit diesel is responsible for payments up to the capped amounts,but those capped amounts are the maximum amount that detroit diesel will pay per year for health care premium values for each eligible retiree.the veba trust was created to automatically pay any premiums in excess of the contribution limit for retiree health care costs,but it could only do so to the extent that it was not depleted.once the veba trust was depleted,the only parties remaining who could pay costs were the retirees.additionally,as discussed above,any implicit requirement that detroit diesel pay costs,even if limited to the case in which the veba trust was depleted,would have been inconsistent with the reporting position taken by detroit diesel.
as with the assumptions regarding the caps themselves,the assumptions required by fas with respect to the veba trust do not change this reality.detroit diesel would not be able to assume under fas that there would be future contributions to the veba trust and thus reduce its projected liability if its retirees had vested rights to fully funded,lifetime health care benefits.fas allows money placed in a trust for the payment of benefits to be considered an asset of the benefit plan and thus reduce the employer liability.but fas explicitly states that a ssets not segregated in a trust,or otherwise effectively restricted,so that they can not be used by the employer for other purposes are not plan assets for the purpose of this statement,even though the employer may intend that those assets be used to provide postretirement benefits.this prevents detroit diesel from assuming,for fas purposes,that additional contributions would be made to the veba trust from some unspecified source such that the veba trust would always pay for healthcare benefit costs above the capped amount.a natural reading of fas therefore prevents detroit diesel from assuming that its obligations to its retirees were capped unless its liability truly was limited.
the plaintiffs argue that cole and noe,as well as the paul walters letter,establish that detroit diesel employees had,as of,a vested right to fully funded,lifetime health care benefits,and that the paul walters letter promises that those benefits will not in any way be reduced.this argument conflicts with the language of that letter,which states only that retiree health care benefits have been and will continue to be benefits,and which does not comment upon whether the benefits are capped or uncapped.the plaintiffs respond that this reading renders the paul walters letter valueless,for it merely states that the retirees have lifetime benefits,and this was certain given the underlying cbas.this response relies upon an anachronistic view of the cap agreement negotiations although it might be clear now,after noe and cole,that the cba in effect in provided detroit diesel workers with vested benefits,this was not clear at the time.the plaintiffs cite what they call the line of cases for the proposition that the cbas in effect in provided for vested benefits.see golden,cir mccoy meridian auto,cir.but both golden and meridian the paul walters letter.further,when reviewing the preliminary injunction,this court held that it was unclear whether even golden and meridian provided a sufficient basis on which to hold that the cba in effect in provided vested benefits,wood,app x at,and the district court held that this uncertainty was only fully resolved in light of cole decided in,wood detroit diesel,slip.op.at.thus,because it was unclear in whether detroit diesel retirees were entitled to vested benefits,th
