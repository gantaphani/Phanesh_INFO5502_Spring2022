opinion of the court 
before us is an appeal from the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania granting summary judgment in favor of appellees united states postal service usps and national rural letter carrier association nrlca.before the district court,philip podobnik appellant alleged that usps violated both the age discrimination in employment act,et,and the collective bargaining agreement that existed between usps and nrlca he further alleged that nrlca breached its duty to fairly represent him.because we conclude that each of appellant claims are untimely,we affirm the report and recommendation adopted by the district court.
appellant was born on august,and he was employed as a rural letter carrier with usps monroeville,pennsylvania division from march,until his retirement on march.for the entire length of his employment with usps,appellant union representative was nrlca as he was a rural carrier,appellant was not paid for a traditional eight hour work day,as would a city letter carrier.rather,his compensation was based on the number of pieces of mail he delivered,the mailboxes he served,and the mileage he traveled.appellant was required to work as long as necessary to complete his daily rounds,which he contends required between and hours per week.
sometime in,the monroeville post office attempted to adjust appellant route downward by transferring approximately of his route to a younger city mail carrier.because this was a substantial adjustment downward,appellant compensation would have been dramatically reduced.he contacted his nrlca union steward,helen malarik,but did not file a grievance at any time.through malarik efforts,appellant was able to request that the smallest leg of his route be transferred to another rural letter carrier also represented by nrlca.ultimately,all parties agreed to the downward adjustment of appellant route,which he found to be a great relief.
on april,appellant immediate supervisor followed him on his route and observed him commit three vehicle safety violations driving in excess of the miles per hour speed limit changing lanes without using turn signals and dismounting from his vehicle without shutting off the engine.for these infractions,appellant was put on suspension and a suspension of his driving privileges.the next day,appellant filed a joint step grievance form disputing these charges.nrlca intervened on appellant behalf,and a step grievance settlement was reached which reduced his term of suspension to time already served 
on march,appellant was again followed and again charged with three safety violations unnecessary backing up of his vehicle leaving his vehicle engine running while it was parked and while he was inside various addresses delivering mail and leaving his vehicle unlocked and unsecured with mail in it.on march,appellant went to the pittsburgh branch of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to file an age discrimination claim.while filing out an eeoc intake form,an eeoc representative told him that he would have to pursue any discrimination claim through usps equal employment opportunities office.appellant did not ask for clarification,but claims to have thought that he had to file his complaint directly with his usps supervisors which he deemed futile instead of a usps employment counselor.in any event,he did not complete his eeoc intake form,and did not pursue his claim further with usps.
on march,appellant and malarik had a meeting with his usps supervisors at that meeting,the supervisors indicated their intent to terminate appellant,and he was given a letter entitled notice of proposed removal,proposing to discharge him within days for the vehicle safety violations that had been observed in and.this notice stated that appellant had the option,under the collective bargaining agreement,to file a grievance within days.also during the meeting,usps offered appellant the opportunity to retire in lieu of termination,thereby allowing him to keep his pension.on march,appellant officially retired.he never filed a grievance,nor did he request that nrlca do so.
on october,appellant met with his attorney in connection with a social security matter.at that meeting,appellant relayed the situation surrounding his route reduction and retirement.at that time he claims that,with the help of his attorney,he became aware that he had viable claims against usps and nrlca.he also concedes that,between his retirement and his october,meeting with his attorney,he undertook no independent investigation of his case and did not learn any new facts.on october,appellant filed a document with the eeoc entitled intent to sue pursuant to d.
on january,appellant filed a complaint against usps and nrlca,alleging,inter alia,various state law claims against nrlca.on march,nrlca sought to dismiss appellant claims as preempted under federal law.on october,united states magistrate judge ila jeanne sensenich granted,without prejudice,the nrlca motion to dismiss certain counts of the complaint not involving fraud or collusion.on november,appellant filed a amended complaint against usps and nrlca.count i alleged that usps discriminated against him on the basis of his age when it reduced his mail delivery route in and notified him in march that it intended to terminate his employment.count ii alleged that usps breached its agreement with the nrlca when it sought to terminate appellant employment.count iii alleged that nrlca breached its duty of fair representation.the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania referred the case to magistrate judge sensenich for consideration of all pretrial matters.appellant,usps and nrlca all moved for summary judgment.by report and recommendation,the magistrate judge denied appellant motion for summary judgment and granted usps and nrlca motion for summary judgment,finding that appellant claims were.by memorandum order,the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had original jurisdiction over appellant age discrimination in employment act adea claim and hybrid section claim pursuant to.our jurisdiction is grounded in,as the district court grant of appellees motion for summary judgment was a final and appealable order.

iii.discussion 
despite the lengthy record and briefs in this case,the questions before us are relatively narrow.as to his adea claim against usps,we must determine whether the accrual date was delayed by the discovery rule,or alternatively whether the limitations period was equitably tolled.as to his hybrid section claim against usps and nrlca,we must determine whether appellant failure to file a grievance with regard to his termination bars his recovery.we shall take each question in turn,remembering that title vii limitations provisions are part of a body of humanitarian legislation that must be interpreted in a humane and commonsensical manner,so as to prevent unnecessarily harsh results in particular cases.oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir.
appellant adea claim 
appellant first claims that his route reduction and his forced retirement constitute impermissible age discrimination.all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least years of age in the united states postal service and the postal rate commission shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.a.an employee covered by this provision has 
two alternative routes for pursuing a claim of age discrimination.an individual may invoke the eeoc administrative process and then file a civil action in federal district court if he is not satisfied with his administrative remedies.see b and c.a federal employee complaining of age discrimination,however,does not have to seek relief from his employing agency or the eeoc at all.he can decide to present the merits of his claim to a federal court in the first instance.see d.
stevens dep t of treasury,d.if an individual alleging age discrimination has not filed a complaint with the eeoc,he may not file a civil action under section until he has given the eeoc at least thirty days notice of an intent to file such action.d.this notice must be filed within days of the date when the alleged unlawful practice occurred.id.
it is undisputed that appellant submitted an intent to sue letter to the eeoc on october.because he retired on march,his retirement date is the latest possible date that usps could have engaged in any discriminatory behavior toward him.thus,appellant had until september,to file his intent to sue letter,and his letter of october,was therefore untimely.the district court concluded as such,and granted summary judgment in favor of usps.on appeal,appellant argues both that the discovery rule extended the date on which his injury accrued,and the doctrine of equitable tolling halted the limitations clock,thus making his intent to sue letter timely.as did the district court,we reject these two arguments.
discovery rule 
as a general rule,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff cause of action accrues the accrual date is not the date on which the wrong that injures the plaintiff occurs,but the date on which the plaintiff discovers that he or she has been injured.oshiver,at citing cada baxter healthcare,cir emphasis in original.that is not to say that the accrual date is when a plaintiff learns he has been the victim of a legal wrong.rather,a claim accrues as soon as a potential plaintiff either is aware,or should be aware after a sufficient degree of diligence,of the existence and source of an actual injury.keystone insurance houghton,cir see also cada,at.the discovery rule delays the initial running of the statute of limitations,but only until the plaintiff has discovered that he or she has been injured and that this injury has been caused by another party conduct.new castle county halliburton nus,cir.thus,the question is when did appellant suffer an actual injury.
while we understand appellant to be citing both his route reduction and his retirement as instances of age discrimination,we shall dispense with both concurrently.appellant had actual knowledge of his route reduction immediately,since he participated in and agreed to the reduction.furthermore,he had actual knowledge of usps intent to terminate him on march,appellant contends that usps route reduction and intent to terminate or retire him was on account of his age,that this was not apparent to him until october,the day he met with his attorney,and therefore the limitations period did not begin to run until then.specifically,he contends that he did not know he had a possible injury until then.brief of appellant at.we read this as meaning that appellant did not know he had a possible legal injury resulting from the or actions until after meeting with his attorney.however,the discovery rule is concerned with knowledge of actual injury,not legal injury.
appellant does not claim he was unaware that usps reduced his route in,or that it served him with a notice of proposed removal on march.these are the only dates when any alleged injury occurred.therefore,the latest date on which appellant claim could have possibly accrued was march,his last day of employment the discovery rule does not excuse his failure to file his intent to sue letter more than two years after the limitations period had expired.were we to extend the reach of the discovery rule to delay accrual until a plaintiff learned that a legal injury had occurred,as appellant requests,a statute of limitations would become effectively meaningless,as a plaintiff could,through ignorance or fraud,bring an age discrimination claim at any point in his lifetime,regardless of how long ago the underlying acts had occurred.we decline this invitation,and conclude that the discovery rule does not save appellant untimely adea claim.
equitable tolling 
because the time limitations set forth in title vii are not jurisdictional,they may be modified by equitable concerns,such as tolling.oshiver,at citing hart baker chemical,cir.the doctrine of equitable tolling stops a statute of limitations period from running after a claim has accrued,but should be applied sparingly.passenger morgan,d see also irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d we have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.appellant bears the burden of proving that the equitable tolling doctrine applies here.courtney la salle,cir.there are three principal situations in which equitable tolling is appropriate where the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff respecting the plaintiff cause of action,and that deception causes with an applicable limitations provision where the plaintiff in some extraordinary way has been prevented from asserting his rights or where the plaintiff has timely asserted his or her rights mistakenly in the wrong forum.oshiver,at citing sch.dist.of city of allentown marshall,cir.appellant makes four arguments in support of his contention that equitable tolling is appropriate here.he claims that he was fooled into believing that his route was reduced because he was overworked,and that the safety violations he had committed were the basis for his forced retirement he was misled by the advice of an employee of the eeoc pittsburgh office he timely filed a claim with the eeoc in pittsburgh and his local usps office failed to post an eeoc notice as required by law.our review leads us to agree with the district court that there is no basis to equitably toll the limitations period of appellant adea claim,which we have already concluded accrued no later than march.
moving to his first argument,we conclude,even assuming appellant route reduction and his retirement were pretext for age discrimination,his noncompliance with the statute of limitations period was not the result of being misled by usps.we find principal support for our conclusion in appellant own words.with regard to his route reduction,appellant stated at deposition that he first suspected that this action was caused by age discrimination while he was in the service.joint appendix at.reading this statement as generously as possible since appellant was unable at deposition to narrow the time frame to any degree,this means appellant suspected his age played an unlawful part in his route reduction between,and march.giving appellant every benefit of the doubt,this means that appellant was not deceived into believing his route reduction was the result of being overlooked as late as march.since appellant took no action with regard to the reduction within days of his retirement,tolling can not excuse his untimely complaint.appellant tolling argument with regard to his forced retirement fares little better.when asked why he went to the pittsburgh eeoc office on march,he replied 
the reason i went there was i felt that i was discriminated upon because of my age and that this eeoc was an organization set up by our government to mitigate or make easier or harder for employers to get rid of you because of age,and if i could prove that that was the case,i could go back to work.
id.at.appellant can not realistically argue that he was misled to believe that the safety infractions he committed were the basis for his forced retirement when it is undisputed that he went to the ee
