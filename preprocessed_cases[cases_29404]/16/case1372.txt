while attending james madison university in harrisonburg,virginia,jennifer fritz and sarah nelson signed a lease for apartment h of a apartment building owned by hunters ridge condominium owners association,hunters ridge or owner.in the early morning hours of may,during the term of the lease,a fire erupted on the wooden balcony of fritz and nelson apartment,causing over in property damage to apartment h and to the apartment building.
allstate insurance company,hunters ridge property insurer,paid the loss,and,as subrogee of hunters ridge,commenced this action against fritz,nelson,and clay pendleton,who had been fritz guest at apartment before the fire,pendleton had been refinishing the stock of his gun on the apartment balcony,using linseed oil,and officials believed that a spontaneous combustion of a linseed rag was the cause of the fire.in the suit,allstate contended that all three defendants were liable for negligence in causing the fire and that nelson and fritz were also liable under the terms of their lease.after discovery,pendleton settled with allstate,and nelson and fritz filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted their motions,reading the lease as absolving fritz and nelson of all negligence liability and concluding that,in any event,allstate had failed to present evidence sufficient to show that fritz and nelson were negligent.
on allstate appeal,we affirm the district court conclusion that the evidence in the record is insufficient to prove negligence on the part of fritz and nelson.but we conclude that the lease nonetheless imposes liability on fritz and nelson for damage to apartment h caused by any negligence of pendleton,their guest.accordingly,we reverse that portion of the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings on the tenants lease liability.
in early,fritz and nelson signed an month lease for apartment h at hunters road in harrisonburg,to commence on august,and continue until july.apartment h was a apartment and one of apartments in the building.the lease designates fritz and nelson collectively as the tenant and refers to apartment h as the property leased.thereafter,the lease refers to property and premises interchangeably.the lease provides,unremarkably,that tenant shall not remodel or make any structural changes,alterations or additions to the premises that tenant shall be responsible for general upkeep of the premises and that at the expiration of the lease term tenant shall surrender the premises in as good condition as they were at the commencement of this lease.if during the lease the premises were to be rendered totally unfit for occupancy by reason of a number of enumerated external forces,including fire and act of god,the lease provides that its term would immediately cease.during the term of the lease,however,the tenant was responsible for all costs for repairs resulting from negligent actions or omissions of tenant or tenant guests.as to that obligation,as well as every other obligation in the lease,paragraph provides that if two or more individuals shall execute this lease as tenant,the liability of each such individual to pay rent and perform all of tenant obligations hereunder shall be deemed to be joint and several.that paragraph was modified by an addendum,which provides that each tenant that signs a lease agreement for the above stated property apartment h during the term of this lease shall be jointly and equally responsible for any and all damages to the property.the lease provides that it is to be construed according to virginia law.
on may,during the term of the lease,pendleton asked fritz,who was his friend,if he could use apartment h to clean his civil war reenactment equipment,which he had been storing in fritz storage locker.even though neither fritz nor nelson was going to be at the apartment that day,fritz gave pendleton permission to use the apartment to clean his gear.during that day,pendleton washed his uniform,cleaned his utensils,and refinished the stock of his replica musket.to do the refinishing,pendleton stripped the varnish off the stock with a varnish stripper sprayed from an aerosol can,sanded it,and applied linseed oil to it.to remove the stripper from the stock and to apply the linseed oil,pendleton used rags made from a cotton tee shirt.when he had finished,at around,pendleton left the rags on the balcony,together with the aerosol can and the can of linseed oil.
between midnight and on may,both fritz and nelson returned to the apartment.before going to bed,nelson smoked a cigarette on the balcony,which she claims to have extinguished in a ashtray.at around,a smoke alarm woke nelson,and her screams woke fritz.when they discovered a fire on their balcony,they called and fled the building.the fire did substantial damage not only to apartment h but also to the apartment building before it was extinguished.
fire investigators concluded that the most likely cause of the fire was a spontaneous combustion of the linseed rag that pendleton had left on the wooden balcony.linseed oil releases heat as it oxidizes,and if rags soaked in the oil are not properly ventilated,the heat can increase to the ignition temperature of the rags.
after paying hunters ridge for the loss,allstate commenced this action against fritz,nelson,and pendleton,claiming that they were liable to hunters ridge for the loss.specifically,allstate alleged that pendleton was negligent in using and disposing of the linseed oil.it alleged that fritz and nelson were negligent in permitting pendleton to use the linseed oil in their apartment and in failing to supervise him and inspect his work area.allstate alleged that all three defendants should have known that linseed oil constitutes a fire hazard and that each could have prevented the fire.finally,allstate alleged that nelson and fritz were responsible for the property damage under the terms of their lease with hunters ridge.
after discovery,pendleton settled with allstate,and allstate dismissed its claims against pendleton.fritz and nelson filed motions for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the court concluded that the lease,taken as a whole,indicates that the parties intended that tenants should not be liable for fires caused by their own negligence.alternatively,the court concluded that if defendants were liable for fires created by their negligence,plaintiff case would not survive summary judgment because there is simply not sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that either fritz or nelson acted negligently.with respect to liability imposed by the lease on the tenants for the negligence of their guests,the court concluded that the relevant lease provision was inescapably aimed at the normal,maintenance that is necessary to keep the apartment functional,good looking,and clean this limited maintenance language is entirely silent upon more serious matters such as destruction of the premises by fire.
from the district court judgment in favor of fritz and nelson,allstate filed this appeal.
allstate contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in construing the lease to eliminate tenants liability for fires caused by their own negligence,and in concluding that the provision imposing liability on fritz and nelson for their guests negligence was not applicable here because it only applie d to negligence relating to minor maintenance and repairs.allstate argues that insofar as the district court reached those conclusions by implication from clauses in the lease that provide that the tenant need not obtain property insurance for the building and that destruction of the property by fire,act of god,or other external source ends the lease,the court simply misread those clauses.finally,allstate contends that the district court also misread the lease in limiting the tenants obligation for guests negligence to simple maintenance matters.
at the outset,we agree with the district court that virginia law applies and that,in particular,the principles of monterey hart,are directly relevant.in monterey,the tenant negligently burned down an apartment building,leading the landlord to sue the tenant estate for
