this appeal arises from an action to quiet title.the parties make competing claims of ownership to the gas rights underlying a acre plot of land located in northern west virginia known as blackshere.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.the defendant,eqt production company epc,appealed the district court decision on the merits,as well as several of its procedural rulings.epc also makes a new argument on appeal,challenging whether subject matter jurisdiction existed in the district court.
finding no error in any of the district court decisions,we affirm the judgment as to three of the four plaintiffs.however,in order to retain jurisdiction,we exercise our authority to dismiss plaintiff republic energy ventures,llc rev from the case,and we vacate the judgment with respect to that party.
in,john blackshere and south penn oil company south penn,which would later become pennzoil products company pennzoil,entered into an oil and gas lease covering the blackshere property the blackshere lease or lease.the transfer was recorded with the wetzel county clerk.in and,south penn entered into two indenture agreements with carnegie natural gas company and hope natural gas company hope.the indentures purported to sever south penn gas rights from its oil rights and allocate the gas rights to carnegie and hope it is undisputed that these indentures were never recorded.
in,hope conveyed all of its interests and rights to any property in wetzel county to consolidated gas supply corporation consolidated gas.the transfer,which was recorded,did not reference the blackshere lease.consolidated gas is a predecessor in title to epc as a result,the parties agree that epc alleged interest in blackshere gas rights derives from any right in the property that hope transferred to consolidated gas by way of this conveyance.
on october,pennzoil assigned its rights in the blackshere lease to cobham gas industries,cobham through an assignment and bill of sale the assignment.the assignment was recorded through a memorandum of assignment the memorandum filed with the wetzel county clerk.
on november,cobham conveyed its interest in the property the assignment to plaintiff prima oil company,prima by way of a recorded transfer the confirmatory assignment.prima is a subsidiary of plaintiff trans energy,trans energy.after the assignment,trans energy assigned half of its portion of the leasehold interest to plaintiff republic partners vi,lp republic partners.rev interest in the matter derives from an overriding royalty interest in whatever production republic partners obtains from the lease.
in,trans energy was granted a permit by the west virginia department of environmental protection to drill a new gas well on the property.prior to drilling the new well,prima discovered epc alleged interest in the lease resulting from the unrecorded hope indenture.the plaintiffs then filed this action,seeking to quiet title to the blackshere lease and requesting declarations that they have rightful title to the gas rights underlying the property,and that prima was a bona fide purchaser for value bfp with no actual or constructive knowledge of a competing interest in the property when it acquired cobham interest in.
epc answered and filed several counterclaims seeking a declaration that it held superior title to blackshere gas rights,as well as tort claims for trespass,conversion,and waste 
after significant discovery was undertaken by both sides,epc filed a motion for an extension of time to complete discovery and to defer consideration of the plaintiffs anticipated motion for summary judgment.the parties then filed for summary judgment.the plaintiffs also filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of punitive damages.
on october,the district court informed the parties by letter of its tentative rulings.the district court stated its intention to grant the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment deny the defendant motion for summary judgment deny the defendant motion for an extension of time to complete discovery and to defer consideration of the plaintiffs summary judgment motion and grant the plaintiffs motion in limine to exclude evidence of punitive damages.the court also advised the parties not to file any further motions or pleadings with respect to the rulings contained in the letter.
the next day,epc filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental memorandum in support of its summary judgment motion and against the plaintiffs summary judgment motion.
on november,the district court entered two memorandum opinions in accordance with its tentative letter rulings.in a thorough,opinion,the court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,denied the defendant motion for summary judgment,and denied the defendant motion for leave to supplement the record.the second opinion denied epc motion for an extension of time to complete discovery and to defer consideration of the summary judgment motions,and granted the plaintiffs motion to exclude punitive damages evidence.the court then entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,and this appeal followed.
although not raised below,epc challenges on appeal whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case.whether subject matter jurisdiction exists is a question of law that we review de novo.in re kirkland,cir.the plaintiffs relied on diversity of citizenship in filing the case in federal court.see a.the case was originally filed against eqt corporation by mutual agreement of the parties,eqt corporation was substituted as a defendant by epc,a pennsylvania company.it is undisputed that trans energy is a nevada corporation and prima is a delaware corporation.the complaint identified republic partners as a citizen of texas and rev as a citizen of delaware,thereby establishing complete diversity.however,the plaintiffs now acknowledge that they improperly alleged the citizenship of republic partners and rev by referring only to the states in which those entities are organized and do business.see carden arkoma,partnerships have citizenship of their partners tech.applications,exro ltda,cir limited liability companies have citizenship of their members.
a federal statute allows for the curing of jurisdictional pleading defects on appeal.see defective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended,upon terms,in the trial or appellate courts.in accordance with this,the plaintiffs filed a motion to supplement the record with an affidavit attesting to the texas citizenship of each member of republic partners.at oral argument,epc conceded the accuracy of this information.accordingly,we grant the plaintiffs motion to supplement the record,and we find no jurisdictional defect with respect to republic partners.
as to rev,the plaintiffs now concede that it includes members who are citizens of pennsylvania,the same as epc.to keep diversity of citizenship intact,the plaintiffs propose to have rev dismissed as a party under federal rule of civil procedure.see newman green,alfonzo larrain,holding that the courts of appeals have the authority to dismiss a dispensable nondiverse party by virtue of rule.epc argues,however,that rev is an indispensable party under rule and can not be dismissed.
under rule b,when joinder of parties is not feasible because of,among other things,nondiversity,a court must decide whether the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed because the absent party is indispensable.yashenko harrah nc casino,llc,cir quoting.b.in making this determination,a court must evaluate 
first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
as an initial matter,we have previously admonished that d ismissal of a case is a drastic remedy,which should be employed only sparingly.teamsters local union keal driveaway,cir.further,the supreme court has stated that,o nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court,considerations of finality,efficiency,and economy become overwhelming.caterpillar.lewis.both directives strongly caution against dismissing the case,which involved extensive discovery and was pending before the district court for over a year and a half.
as mentioned,rev stake in the matter results from its royalty interest in whatever production republic partners obtains from the lease.rev is seeking to be dismissed from the case,assured that its interests will be adequately represented by the remaining plaintiffs,all of whom are related entities seeking the same result.epc,on the other hand,argues that regardless of whether rev interests are protected,rule b concerns the interests of all the parties,not merely those of the party proposed to be dismissed.see rule civ.b asking to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties emphasis added.in its answer to the complaint,epc asserted several counterclaims that included rev as a defendant.it argues that it is entitled to have rev remain as a possible defendant for its counterclaims should this court reverse the overall merits determination of the district court.given our decision,explained below,to affirm the district court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs,this argument is functionally moot.in any event,we note that the defendant has failed to show or even suggest a single,tangible way in which it will be harmed by rev absence.see dore energy prospective inv.trading,cir the factors under rule b are concerned with whether actual harm to anyone interest will occur if the case proceeds absent certain parties.emphasis added.instead,epc merely states generally that it has a right to have rev remain as a party without addressing why the b factors weigh in favor of a finding of indispensability.having reviewed the parties arguments and the record,we are satisfied that there is no reason to believe that any party will be harmed by rev absence,or that the plaintiffs received an improper tactical advantage by including rev as a party.see parker centre group,cir unpublished table decision.additionally,to the extent epc is concerned about not being sued in a separate state action filed by rev,the plaintiffs have asked that rev be dismissed with prejudice.given these considerations,we deem this an appropriate case in which to exercise our power under rule to dismiss rev from the suit and preserve diversity among the remaining parties.
turning to the merits of the case,epc raises three main issues.first,it argues that the transfer from pennzoil to cobham conveyed only the oil rights to the blackshere lease and not the gas rights.second,epc contends that the district court lacked a factual basis on which to find that prima received title to the lease by virtue of the confirmatory assignment.third,epc argues that prima had notice of its competing claim at the time of the assignment and was therefore not a bfp.we address each issue in turn,utilizing a de novo standard of review.glynn edo,cir we review a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.
the defendant first argues that the language of the memorandum did not convey the gas rights to the blackshere lease.basic principles of west virginia property law guide our analysis on this issue.a valid written instrument which expresses the intent of the parties in plain and unambiguous language is not subject to judicial construction or interpretation but will be applied and enforced according to such intent.syl.pt,zimmerer romano.in construing a deed,will,or other written instrument,it is the duty of the court to construe it as a whole,taking and considering all the parts together,and giving effect to the intention of the parties wherever that is reasonably clear and free from doubt syl.pt,maddy maddy.
the memorandum states that pennzoil,through the assignment,did bargain,sell,transfer,assign and convey unto cobham,all right,title and interest it may have in and to certain oil and gas leases and wells more particularly described on exhibit a and exhibit b,attached t hereto and made a part t hereof.exhibit a is a list of leases associated with the conveyance,including the blackshere lease.exhibit b lists both the leases and wells being transferred as part of the sale.exhibit b includes a rights column for each of the wells,under which is indicated oil,gas,or oil and gas.the rights columns for all the blackshere lease wells indicate oil.epc contends that exhibit b lists not only the wells being transferred but also the ownership rights of each lease associated with those wells.thus,because oil is the only right associated with the blackshere lease wells,the conveyance must have been intended to transfer only the oil rights to cobham.
we disagree with this reading,and instead adopt the district court conclusion that the memorandum unambiguously establishes that pennzoil transferred both oil and gas rights to the oil and gas leases listed in exhibit a,and that exhibit b simply lists the wells being transferred and the rights utilized by those wells.first,the granting language of the memorandum plainly states that the leases being transferred were oil and gas leases.emphasis added.there is no indication that any of the leases were simply oil leases or simply gas leases.exhibit a lists the entire blackshere lease,as conveyed by john blackshere to south penn in.nothing in the granting language of the memorandum or the list of leases in exhibit a indicates that the oil and gas rights were severed at any point.
second,the memorandum states that pennzoil conveyed all of its interest in and to certain oil and gas leases and wells emphasis added.this indicates the transfer of two distinct types of pennzoil property leases and wells.exhibit a,which does not include reference to any wells,is clearly a list of the leases being transferred.exhibit b,on the other hand,offers particularized descriptions of each of the wells and is properly understood as a list of the wells being transferred and the type of production associated with each well.the fact that some wells produced only oil in no way limits the rights included in the leases.moreover,the defendant position requires reading exhibit b in isolation and ignoring the remaining language in the memorandum and exhibit when,as it must be,the instrument is construe d as a whole,taking and considering all the parts together,syl.pt,maddy,at,it is clear that pennzoil transferred to cobham all of its rights in a series of oil and gas leases,as listed in exhibit a including the unsevered blackshere lease as well as its rights to the accompanying wells,as listed in exhibit b.we therefore affirm the district court decision that the memorandum unambiguously conveyed to cobham the gas rights in the blackshere lease.
epc next contends that because the plaintiffs failed to offer the confirmatory assignment into the record the district court lacked a factual basis on which to find that prima ever received title to the blackshere lease.as noted,the confirmatory assignment recorded the sale of cobham interest in the lease to prima.in the proceedings below,the plaintiffs purported to attach this document to their motion for summary judgment however,it is now apparent that they mistakenly attached a different,unrelated instrument.epc avers that,without the confirmatory assignment,the district court simply had no evidentiary basis for concluding that prima held an unbroken,recorded chain of title to the blackshere lease.
this argument is easily rejected.epc own expert mentioned the assignment in testifying that the plaintiffs held an unbroken chain of title going back to the original lease.the witness,arnold schulberg,testified
