an mcs endorsement to an automotive insurance policy obligates an insurer to cover an insured negligence involving vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of the motor carrier act.the motor carrier act,in turn,creates minimum levels of financial responsibility for the transportation of property by motor carrier within the united states.canal insurance company seeks a declaratory judgment that the mcs endorsement does not cover an accident where the truck involved was not engaged in the transportation of property at the time of the accident.the district court granted summary judgment for canal.we affirm.we hold that the mcs covers only liability for the transportation of property.that said,we take no position as to whether the liability in this case was for the transportation of property,because the parties stipulated that it was not.
facts and procedural background 
this is an insurance dispute arising from a truck accident.the relevant facts are undisputed.timothy briggs,a trucker and employee of defendant transport,was backing a truck into his driveway when he collided with a toyota camry occupied by bernetta coleman and her husband glen.at the time of the accident,briggs was returning home from work.he was driving the truck bobtail when he collided with the colemans,meaning that the truck had no trailer attached the sole issue on this appeal is whether transport automotive insurance policy and more specifically,the policy federally mandated mcs endorsement covers the accident between briggs and the colemans.
the colemans sued briggs and transport in state court in mississippi.they assert claims against briggs for negligence,and they also seek to recover from transport under the doctrine of respondeat superior.in response to the lawsuit,canal filed this suit in the united states district court for the northern district of mississippi against briggs,transport,and the colemans.canal seeks a declaratory judgment that it is not required under the policy to indemnify transport for any judgment the colemans obtain 
the insurance policy at issue on this appeal is a basic automobile liability policy that canal issued in favor of transport the policy the policy provides 
section a basic automobile liability insurance 
coverage a bodily injury liability 
coverage b property damage liability 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of an owned automobile 
transport did not own the truck briggs was driving at the time of the accident.rather,the truck was under a agreement,meaning that briggs owned the truck but leased it to transport as part of his employment contract.accordingly,briggs truck was not an owned automobile within the meaning of the policy and did not fall within the plain terms of the policy coverage.
although the policy did not explicitly cover briggs truck,it did contain a federally mandated policy endorsement,the mcs.the purpose of the mcs endorsement is to assure compliance with federal minimum levels of financial responsibility for motor carriers.see illus.the mcs endorsement must be attached to any liability policy issued to motor carriers operating motor vehicles transporting property in interstate commerce.see.the endorsement creates a suretyship,which obligates an insurer to pay certain judgments against the insured arising from interstate commerce activities,even though the insurance contract would have otherwise excluded coverage.minter great am.ins.of,cir.
after canal filed this action,transport failed to respond,and the district court entered default judgment against it.both canal and coleman moved for summary judgment on various issues,including the one currently on appeal whether the mcs endorsement applies the district court granted canal motion and denied coleman.coleman appealed.she now asks this court to reverse the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of canal and order the district court to grant her motion for summary judgment.
ii.standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.in re egleston,cir quoting in re intelogic trace,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.murray earle,cir citation omitted.
iii.analysis 
the sole question the court must answer today is whether the mcs endorsement covers the briggs coleman accident.this is a question of federal law.lincoln ins.garcia,cir.we conclude that the answer is no because the mcs only covers liability for the transportation of property,and the parties stipulate that briggs was not engaged in the transportation of property at the time of the collision.
our analysis proceeds in four parts.first,in part,we consider the plain text of the mcs and the statute it effectuates and conclude that the mcs only provides coverage for the transportation of property.second,in part,we look to relevant precedent from this court and find that it supports our conclusion about the mcs scope.third,in part,we ask whether the mcs applies in this case in light of our determination that it only covers liability for the transportation of property.finally,in part,we consider and reject coleman alternative reading of the mcs.
in order to determine the scope of the mcs coverage,we look first to its plain terms.the endorsement provides 
in consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached,the insurer the company agrees to pay,within the limits of liability described herein,any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation,maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of sections and of the motor carrier act of regardless of whether or not each motor vehicle is specifically described in the policy and whether or not such negligence occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the insured or elsewhere.such insurance as is afforded,for public liability,does not apply to injury to or death of the insured employees while engaged in the course of their employment,or property transported by the insured,designated as cargo.it is understood and agreed that no condition,provision,stipulation,or limitation contained in the policy,this endorsement,or any other endorsement thereon,or violation thereof,shall relieve the company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment,within the limits of liability herein described,irrespective of the financial condition,insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured.however,all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.the insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment made by the company on account of any accident,claim,or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy,and for any payment that the company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.
illus.emphasis added.in short,the endorsement requires canal to pay any final judgment against transport for public liability resulting from the negligent use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of sections and of the motor carrier act of.id.because the parties do not make negligence an issue on this appeal,the issue before us today is simply whether briggs truck was subject to the financial responsibility requirements of sections and of the motor carrier act of.
we must next look to the relevant portion of the motor carrier act,to determine whether briggs vehicle was subject to its requirements it reads 
the secretary of transportation shall prescribe regulations to require minimum levels of financial responsibility sufficient to satisfy liability amounts established by the secretary covering public liability,property damage,and environmental restoration for the transportation of property by motor carrier or motor private carrier as such terms are defined in section of this title in the united states between a place in a state and 
a a place in another state 
b another place in the same state through a place outside of that state or 
c a place outside the united states.
b emphasis added.
after reading the plain text of the mcs and,we conclude that the endorsement covers vehicles only when they are presently engaged in the transportation of property in interstate commerce.we reason as follows the mcs applies to vehicles subject to of the motor carrier act.section requires minimum levels of financial responsibility,which must be sufficient to satisfy liability for the transportation of property in interstate commerce.thus,the mcs is a way of conforming with statutory requirements.and because those requirements exist to satisfy liability for the transportation of property,it follows that the mcs must cover liabilities for the transportation of property.nothing in the mcs text indicates that it covers other kinds of liabilities,liabilities incurred outside of the transportation of property.
in addition to the plain text of the endorsement,relevant precedent from this court supports our conclusion that the mcs does not apply here because briggs per the parties stipulation was not engaged in the transportation of property at the time of the accident.neither this court nor most federal courts have ever directly addressed the precise question before us however,we have considered whether the mcs covers accidents that fail to meet another statutory prerequisite transportation in the united states.see garcia,at see also canal indem.galindo.cir per curiam.our reasoning as to the in the united states limitation applies with equal force to the transportation of property limitation.
in lincoln general insurance garcia,we considered the scope of the mcs,which is identical to the mcs except that it applies to transportation of passengers rather than property garcia involved a bus accident that happened in mexico a tour bus collided with a vehicle carrying eight passengers,all of whom were either injured or killed.id.at.the insurance company sought a declaratory judgment that the mcs endorsement did not cover the accident.id.at.when the issue came before us,we began our inquiry by looking to the plain language of the endorsement,as we have done here.like the mcs,the mcs requires coverage for vehicles subject to statutory requirements for the transportation in the united states.see a illus.we analyzed the plain language of the mcs and the relevant statute,and we held that the mcs would not cover an accident that happened outside the united states 
reading the statute in conjunction with the mcs endorsement,the minimum levels of financial responsibility requirements apply to the transportation of passengers in the united states thus,the endorsement does not require an insurer to pay judgments recovered against the insured if the transportation of passengers by motor vehicle does not occur in the united states.accordingly,the endorsement does not cover the morquechos accident in mexico because the accident occurred in a place where the motor vehicle was not subject to the minimum financial responsibility requirements in.
several years later,we considered another accident that occurred outside the united states involving a motor carrier subject to federal regulations.see galindo.at.the only difference between garcia and galindo was that galindo involved an mcs endorsement rather than an mcs because the carrier was engaged in the transportation of property,not passengers.in galindo,we followed garcia and concluded that the mcs endorsement only covered transportation inside the united states.id.at.
our decision today follows the reasoning of garcia and our unpublished opinion in galindo.the commonality in our reasoning is this in all these cases,we determined the mcs applicability with reference to time of the loss.as discussed above,see supra part,we believe that the mcs text clearly compels this approach 
other courts have varied as to whether they determine the mcs application at the time of the loss,but ours appears to be the majority approach.see,century indem.carlson,cir agreeing with the determination that the grain in question in this case at the time of the accident traveled in interstate commerce emphasis added canal ins.perchak trucking,cv,wl,at,denying summary judgment because c onsideration of the important issues presented in this case should be made only in the context of a concrete determination as to whether the insured vehicle was involved in interstate or intrastate commerce at the time of the accident emphasis added canal ins.paul cox trucking,cv,wl,at,holding that a federal court has jurisdiction over the question of whether truck was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident emphasis added kolencik progressive preferred ins,cv,wl,at,based on the foregoing,the court concludes that endorsement mcs plays no role in the instant accident because it involved only intrastate commerce from cartersville,georgia to acworth,georgia with no intention of the dirt ever going beyond acworth.branson mga ins,so d declining to apply the mcs to purely intrastate transportation sec.ins.barrentine,so d,the issue is not whether a truck might be used for an interstate shipment in the future.that much could be said of nearly any rig.rather,the issue is whether the injury in question occurred while the truck was operating in interstate commerce.emphasis added.but see,royal indem.jacobsen,in the court view,royal trip specific reading of the holdens icc endorsement or any icc endorsement for that matter is incorrect.travelers indem.of il am.specialized transp,d,holding that the truck procurement or lease agreement,rather than the circumstances of the particular loss,determine the mcs application reliance ins.royal indem,civ,wl,at,same.
in sum,the weight of authority from this circuit and beyond supports our conclusion that the mcs does not cover vehicles when they are not presently transporting property in interstate commerce.
the next logical step,then,would be to ask whether the mcs covered the accident in question in this case.with respect to that question,the district court held 
congress empowered the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations to require minimum levels of financial responsibility sufficient to satisfy liability amounts covering public liability,property damage,and environmental restoration for the transportation of property by motor carrier b emphasis added.similarly,the regulations are applicable to motor carriers operating motor vehicles transporting property in interstate or foreign commerce.a emphasis added.in the present case,there is no dispute that briggs was not transporting property at the time of the accident.
canal ins.transport,cv,wl,at.
had coleman not explicitly conceded that briggs liability was not for the transportation of property,the district court would have needed to ask what that phrase means.the relevant statute,of the motor carrier act,indicates that its terms are to be read as defined in section of this title.b.section,in turn,defines transportation quite broadly 
transportation.the term transportation includes 
a a motor vehicle,vessel,warehouse,wharf,pier,dock,yard,property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property,or both,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use and 
b services related to that movement,including arranging for,receipt,delivery,elevation,transfer in transit,refrigeration,icing,ventilation,storage,handling,packing,unpacking,and interchange of passengers and property.
given the statute broad terms,it is at least arguable
