in order to determine whether entry of the judgment contravened our mandate in salt i,we must understand the procedural history of this litigation.this procedural history can be,for organizational purposes,divided into three period prior to may,the period the period between may,and the issuance of the salt i mandate on may,the period and the period following issuance of the salt i mandate the period.prior to reviewing this procedural history,we will briefly relate the relevant facts underlying this dispute.
in the,david riese and gary plichta the riese group joined efforts to develop a residential community,known as lexington apartments the lexington,near nashville,tennessee.in,in order to secure the capital necessary to develop the lexington,the riese group joined forces with stephen stroud,stroud wife grace ramsey,and steven simpson the stroud group.the stroud group and the riese group then formed a limited partnership,called south atlantic limited partnership of tennessee salt or the partnership,to develop real estate in the nashville area.the partnership was structured so that salt owned the lexington.the riese group owned percent of salt,and the other percent was controlled by the stroud group.
rather than retain a to oversee development of the lexington,the partnership authorized the riese group to form gibraltar companies of tennessee,incorporated gibraltar to serve as its general construction contractor.salt and gibraltar entered into a general contractor agreement in august,pursuant to which gibraltar was required,inter alia,to achieve substantial completion of the lexington within eighteen months of commencing construction.
the beginning of the lexington construction was delayed almost six weeks,and several additional delays occurred after construction commenced.in january,citing concerns stemming from construction quality and delays,salt replaced gibraltar with a new general contractor,and the lexington was completed in august.
meanwhile,in january,prudential insurance company executed a letter of intent to purchase the lexington.in may,stroud attorney notified the riese group that an audit reflected that the riese group and gibraltar had engaged in financial improprieties during construction of the lexington.stroud attorney also informed the riese group that,as a result of these improprieties,it would be expelled from salt on may.according to the stroud group,salt book value was less than zero at the end of may.pursuant to the partnership agreement,therefore,the riese group received nothing for its percent ownership interest in salt.on june,eleven days after the riese group was expelled from the partnership,prudential purchased the lexington from salt for,netting salt a profit of approximately.
the period 
in october,salt,along with its general partner south atlantic income properties,and its majority limited partner south atlantic management company collectively,the salt group,filed suit against the riese group and gibraltar in the eastern district of north carolina.the riese group and gibraltar responded with counterclaims against the salt group and with claims against the stroud group.the various claims in the lawsuit included breaches of contract,breaches of fiduciary duties,and violations of north carolina unfair trade practices act the utpa.salt i at.
a jury trial was conducted in the eastern district of north carolina in november.upon its conclusion,the jury rendered its verdict,finding that the riese group had breached its fiduciary duties to salt that gibraltar had breached its contractual obligations to salt and that the salt group,the stroud group,the riese group,and gibraltar had each engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices.on november,the court entered judgment on the verdict on december,the riese group and gibraltar moved the court,pursuant to rules and a of the federal rules of civil procedure,to correct certain clerical errors in the judgment.specifically,they sought to amend the judgment to reflect that the breach of contract aspect of the verdict related only to gibraltar,rather than to all defendants,and that the riese group and gibraltar utpa award was against the stroud group as well as the salt group.on march,in conformity with those requests,the court entered an amended judgment.
on march,the salt and stroud groups sought,pursuant to rule a,to amend the judgment a second time.they sought to remove gibraltar companies,incorporated,as a and plaintiff in the amended judgment of march.they also sought to have the judgment reflect that they the salt and stroud groups were jointly and severally liable for their utpa violations,and that the riese group and gibraltar were jointly and severally liable for their utpa violations.finally,the salt and stroud groups requested the court to aggregate the salt group total recovery in the judgment,aggregate its recovery of costs with its recovery for gibraltar breach of contract and the riese group and gibraltar utpa violations.
on march,the riese group and gibraltar filed a,pursuant to rule a,also seeking to amend the judgment for a second time.although they agreed with certain of the amendments proposed by the salt and stroud groups,they opposed the aggregation of the salt group total recovery.the riese group and gibraltar noted that the salt group various awards were not rendered against the same parties.see infra note.they contended,therefore,that aggregating the claims could be potentially confusing for court personnel including state court personnel attempting to deal with the judgment 
while the rule a motions were pending,the parties proceeded to appeal various aspects of the amended judgment.the salt and stroud groups filed their notice of appeal on april,and the riese group and gibraltar filed a notice of appeal on april.on may,we consolidated these two appeals l and,respectively.
the period 
on may,while the two consolidated appeals were pending in this court,the district court amended the judgment for a second time,entering its second amended judgment.despite the riese group and gibraltar objection to aggregation of the salt group total recovery,the second amended judgment provided that the salt group collectively shall have a total recovery,exclusive of interest,of.
on may,eight days after entry of the second amended judgment the judgment,the salt and stroud groups moved the district court,pursuant to rule d,to stay the judgment without requiring bond the bond motion.on june,the riese group and gibraltar filed a motion to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal.in support of the bond motion,the salt and stroud groups asserted that the two motions raised the issue of how properly to treat the riese group and gibraltar recovery on their counterclaim to offset the salt group recovery on its claims,for purposes of execution.they contended that the court should amend the judgment again to adopt a net recovery approach to the various awards,that is,by aggregating the salt group recovery with the stroud group recovery aggregating the riese group recovery with gibraltar recovery and setting off the riese group and gibraltar total recovery against the salt and stroud groups total recovery the net recovery approach.
the salt and stroud groups sponsored the net recovery approach because,pursuant thereto,the recoveries of all parties other than the salt group would be eliminated by the awards rendered against them,and the salt group would receive a net recovery,exclusive of interest,of the riese group and gibraltar responded to the bond motion by asserting that the court,in resolving the salt group earlier rule a motion,had already declined to adopt the aggregation proposal of the net recovery approach.they contended that the salt and stroud groups inclusion of the allocation and setoff issue in the bond motion was simply an effort to relitigate an issue the court had already resolved.concerned that the salt and stroud groups would continue to pursue a net recovery theory,the riese group and gibraltar requested the court to issue an order that makes clear once and for all that plaintiffs are not entitled to a net recovery against riese and plichta.
on july,while the two consolidated appeals were pending in salt i,the district court entered an order rejecting the net recovery approach.south atl.of riese,july,hereinafter,the rejection order.in the rejection order,the court observed that it had awarded a judgment for riese,plichta and gibraltar companies of tennessee against stroud,ramsey,simpson and salt.the court also noted that t here can be no net recovery because separate defendants must pay the judgments of,and.the rejection order provided that t he only true net recovery would be on the unfair and deceptive trade practices between defendants sic riese,plichta and gibraltar and defendants stroud,ramsey,simpson and salt.the court noted,however,that such a net recovery would favor the riese group and gibraltar rather than the salt and stroud groups.
on july,the salt and stroud groups filed a notice of appeal from the rejection order.on july,they filed their docketing statement in salt i,listing the issues they would raise on appeal.these issues included 
whether the offset for purposes of execution,as proposed by appellants and disallowed by the district court,the net recovery approach,is appropriate 
if not,how should the judgment be applied for purposes of execution 
emphasis added.on august,we consolidated the salt and stroud groups appeal of the rejection order with the consolidated appeals in salt 
on september,the salt and stroud groups filed their brief in salt although their docketing statement asserted that they would raise the issue of how the judgment should be applied for purposes of execution,that issue was not addressed.on october,when we heard argument in salt i,the salt and stroud groups did not raise or address the issue of how the judgment should be applied for purposes of execution.on march,we issued our opinion in salt i,affirming the judgment in all respects.salt i at.
on april,the salt and stroud groups filed a petition for rehearing with rehearing en banc the petition.in the petition,they asserted that the jury awarded to the riese group,and that the result of the utpa determination in salt i is that the riese group stands to recover from the stroud group,plus interest.on may,we denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.on may,we issued our mandate in salt i,affirming the judgment 
the period 
on may,the riese group recorded its judgment against the stroud group in wake county,north carolina.as the sole shareholders,directors,and principal officers of gibraltar,however,the riese group did not record the judgment on gibraltar behalf.the following day,the salt and stroud groups returned to the district court and sought relief pursuant to rule c requesting the court to adopt a net recovery approach to the utpa awards by making the following allocations and setoffs 
allocate of the liability of salt and the stroud group to gibraltar and allocate the other to riese and plichta and 
order that gibraltar entitlement to is more than offset by its million liability to salt and order that riese and plichta entitlement to is offset by their liability of to salt 
the utpa net recovery approach.
on september,during a hearing on the rule c motion,the salt and stroud groups maintained that the riese group recording of the judgment in wake county was contrary to the judgment and our mandate.they noted that,although the judgment provided that the riese group and collectively recover from plaintiffs and defendants,the riese group had not recorded the judgment on behalf of gibraltar.counsel for the salt and stroud groups contended that the award made collectively to riese,plichta,and gibraltar should be allocated among those parties.in response,the riese group maintained that the court was precluded by the mandate rule from amending the judgment in addition,the riese group contended that the court lacked authority under rule c to amend the judgment.
on october,the district court granted the rule c motion and entered its judgment the judgment.the court therein allocated half of the utpa award to gibraltar and half of that award to the riese group.the court then applied the utpa net recovery approach,offsetting the riese group utpa award against its utpa liability to salt,and offsetting gibraltar utpa award against its million liability to salt.utilizing the utpa net recovery approach,the judgment provided for the following 
judgment against gibraltar and in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of judgment against riese and plichta,jointly and severally,in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of and judgment against riese,plichta,and gibraltar,jointly and severally,in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of.

the salt and stroud groups maintain that,for two reasons,the judgment did not contravene the mandate rule.first,they contend that the judgment did not alter the judgment,but rather that it was the judgment,simply clarified.second,the salt and stroud groups maintain that the clarifications in the judgment were consistent with,rather than contrary to,our mandate in salt i.in assessing whether the judgment contravened the mandate rule,therefore,we must answer the following inquiries.first,we must decide whether the judgment altered,or merely clarified,the judgment.second,if the judgment altered the judgment,we must determine whether the alteration was consistent with our mandate.we address these issues in turn.
