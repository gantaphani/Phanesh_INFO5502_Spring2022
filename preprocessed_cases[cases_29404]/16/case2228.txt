in,quivox systems granted solutions,a license to certain copyrighted software,called edoc,that is used to process insurance claims.quivox later fell on hard times and sold its assets to safelite group,which continues to own the copyright for the edoc software.eventually,safelite granted rights in the edoc program to hyperquest when it did so,the parties acknowledged the continued existence of the license and they agreed that safelite itself would retain certain rights to use and develop the software.
this case had its origins in a dispute between and hyperquest over the terms of these licenses.to make matters worse,at least from hyperquest vantage point,sold the source code to its modified software to unitrin direct insurance company in.hyperquest filed suit on january,against both and unitrin,asserting that each had infringed the copyrighted software.the district court concluded that hyperquest held only a license and thus lacked statutory standing to sue it therefore dismissed hyperquest case with prejudice.later,the court awarded attorneys fees and costs to and unitrin in the amount of.hyperquest has appealed,challenging both the conclusion that it was not an exclusive licensee and thus not entitled to assert a claim for copyright infringement and the attorneys fee award.unitrin from the district court decision to reduce the amount of the fees it had requested.we conclude that the district court made no error either in interpreting the license or in its fee decisions,and we thus affirm its judgment.
we begin by taking a closer look at hyperquest interest in the copyright for edoc.initially,as we have already noted,quivox,safelite predecessor in interest,granted a license for edoc to.under that agreement was entitled to use the software only within its own facilities the license conferred no rights to modify the software or to sell it to others.apparently after safelite purchased quivox assets,it saw further opportunities for profit in edoc.in the summer of,safelite entered into a licensing agreement with hyperquest then called hq,but essentially the same company for edoc.the operative language appears in paragraph of the agreement,which spells out the grant of the license and its scope.subpart a says 
subject to all limitations and obligations set forth in this license agreement,safelite grants to hq a perpetual subject to termination only as provided in section,worldwide,exclusive except as set forth in section b license i to use the edoc software,in source code form,to support the development and commercialization of hq services,and ii to develop,modify and enhance the edoc software as hq in its sole discretion determines provided,that such modifications and enhancements are solely related to the development and commercialization of hq services.the agreement then defines the term use and addresses sublicensing rights.this section then concludes notwithstanding the foregoing,hq may not,without the prior written consent of safelite,which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,rent,sell,lease,transfer or sublicense the edoc software to any person or entity that competes with safelite in the manufacture,distribution,or sale of automotive glass or related services,including but not limited to,those competitors set forth on schedule a.
subpart b expressly addresses exclusivity.it says 
except as otherwise provided in this section b,hq license to the edoc software is exclusive in the territory.such exclusivity shall terminate if a sale of of sic hq as defined in the master agreement occurs prior to july.safelite shall have the right to use the edoc software and may license the edoc software to third parties solely for purposes of testing or development.
further down,this subpart addresses the license 
notwithstanding the foregoing,hq acknowledges the edoc software is licensed license to solutions.hq further acknowledges safelite and are presently negotiating the terms of a revised license revised license regarding use of the edoc software.
from there,the paragraph includes promises by safelite to keep hq apprised of the status of its negotiations with.it ends with the following promise in the event the revised license is modified to include terms substantially different than the revised license provided to hq,safelite will advise and include hq in the determination of the final terms of the revised license.finally,paragraph a of the agreement provides that all right,title and interest in and to the edoc software including,but not limited to,all intellectual property rights will remain the exclusive property of safelite,and all right,title and interest in and to the hq modifications shall vest in safelite upon creation.
in the end,safelite and did not succeed in their efforts to renegotiate their agreement.another part of the contract between safelite and hq required safelite to notify by april,that safelite was terminating the license or revised license with.before that date,however,had undertaken a number of steps that hyperquest believed were unauthorized.
on june,safelite notified that it had acquired the quivox assets,including quivox interest in the edoc copyright and the licensing agreement.in october,safelite notified that the latter had breached the licensing agreement because had failed to pay certain licensing fees to safelite.that notification led to the negotiations in the spring of that are mentioned in the hyperquest agreement.shortly before those talks broke down,told safelite that it was not using the edoc software for any purpose,because the software was obsolete and inadequate.
hyperquest also points to numerous other acts that took that it says were inconsistent either with the terms of own license or with hyperquest understanding of its own license.its list of grievances includes at least the following four installed the edoc software at locations other than its own facility did not restrict its use of the edoc software to its immediate organization,its own use,or for the purpose of electronic collection,storage,and transfer of claims modified and created derivative works from the edoc software and marketed and sold either the edoc software itself or the derivative works to third parties.for example,says,sold the source code of its software to unitrin in the summer of for more than.in,released a new version of called claimhub,which it continues to market and sell.hyperquest asserts that all of these products were derivative works based upon edoc.
in november,safelite filed an application in the copyright office for registration of edoc it was promptly registered,and on january,hyperquest recorded the license with the copyright office.as we noted,this lawsuit followed less than a month later.
the copyright act restricts the set of people who are entitled to bring a civil action for infringement to those who qualify as t he legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright b.some courts including this one in years past,see,moran london records,cir have seen this as a limitation derived from article iii standing requirement which is discussed in lujan defenders of wildlife,among other cases,but we believe that it is preferable to be more precise in our language.many parties who have not crossed the t and dotted the i in their copyright licenses would have no trouble demonstrating injury in fact,causation,and three indispensable requirements for constitutional standing,id.at,but their efforts to sue will nonetheless be thwarted by the statutory requirement.another possibility,closer to the mark,is that the copyright act establishes criteria for the real party in interest,as that term is used by federal rule of civil procedure a.see generally william patry,patry on copyright.or one could keep it simple and say that the copyright act spells out who has enforceable rights under the statute someone who does may sue,and someone who does not has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.our understanding of the law as it now stands,particularly in light of the supreme court decision in reed elsevier,muchnick,is that the last of these approaches is the correct one.in essence,it reflects the way that the district court approached this case.had its dismissal of hyperquest suit really been on the basis of article iii standing,the dismissal would have been without prejudice.see,in re slave descendants litigation,cir.instead,the court correctly realized that its ruling was one with other words,the kind of ruling one would expect in response to a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b.
the central question in hyperquest appeal is thus whether safelite conveyed enough rights to it to make it t he legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under the copyright act.importantly,hyperquest does not have the burden of showing that it is the owner of all exclusive rights even one will suffice.the act entitles a copyright owner to a bundle of six different exclusive rights 
to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords 
to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work 
to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending 
in the case of literary,musical,dramatic,and choreographic works,pantomimes,and motion pictures and other audiovisual works,to perform the copyrighted work publicly 
in the case of literary,musical,dramatic,and choreographic works,pantomimes,and pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works,including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,to display the copyrighted work publicly and 
in the case of sound recordings,to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.
the three rights that are at issue in this case are the right to reproduce the copyrighted work,the right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work,and the right to distribute copies of the work to the public.these rights are divisible,meaning that the owner may convey each one of them to a different person.see d any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,including any subdivision of any of the rights specified in section,may be transferred and owned separately.thus,if the exclusive right to reproduce meaning exclusive of the grantor as well as all third parties were transferred to a,the exclusive right to prepare derivative works were given to b,and the exclusive right to distribute copies to the public were granted to c,each transferee would be entitled to sue for infringement of its particular right.the corollary to this rule is that a person holding a license is not entitled to complain about any alleged infringement of the copyright.see,shaver,cir defining a transfer of copyright ownership id.b providing that only the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right may institute an action.
hyperquest right to recover for alleged infringement therefore hinges on its ability to prove that it was an exclusive licensee of at least one of the divisible rights recognized by the act.although unitrin argues that hyperquest never showed that it obtained the license from its predecessor in interest,hq,we see no need to dwell on this point.the easy response is that unitrin waited too long to raise the argument,since it introduced it only in its reply brief in the district court.india breweries,miller brewing,cir.even if we were inclined to forgive the forfeiture,we see nothing of substance here.hyperquest specified in its complaint that it was formerly known as hq.on appeal,it has provided corporate records confirming that all of hq contract rights passed to hyperquest when hq entered into a migratory merger that shifted its status from an illinois to a delaware corporation.that is more than enough.and we do find that unitrin forfeited the new argument that it has tossed into the case for the first time on appeal,namely,that hyperquest may have owned only the rights to edoc and not to the separately copyrighted edocexpress software.the license refers generally to the software commonly referred to as edoc.it appears that the parties drew no distinction between edoc and edocexpress,since the license agreement acknowledged that the edoc software was licensed to,even though the site license spoke only of edocexpress.these kinds of tactics are an unfortunate waste of everyone time.
this part of the case turns entirely on the language of the license.we must read that agreement,however,as a whole.the fact that it uses the phrase exclusive license or its equivalent from time to time is something of which we take note,but it is not dispositive.it is the substance of the agreement,not the labels that it uses,that controls our analysis.see generally in re isbell records,cir stressing the importance of viewing the copyright agreement as a whole sco group,novell,cir applying california law and holding that agreements transferring copyrights must be read as a whole kennedy national juvenile detention ass n,cir noting that normal rules of contract construction govern copyright agreements and applying principles of wisconsin law,including the rule that every term of the agreement must be given meaning.we must decide whether hyperquest can prove that it received one or more divisible rights,and if so,whether it is entitled to enforce them.
at first blush,it seems apparent that hyperquest has never been the sole holder of any of the three exclusive rights that it has,derivative works,or distribution.under the agreement safelite explicitly reserved a limited right to use the edoc software and to distribute it to third parties for development.but,hyperquest responds,each of the three rights it has identified can themselves be subdivided into smaller bundles of rights.although one would reach the point of absurdity going too far down that line,it does not follow that any subdivision is too much.to the contrary,hyperquest is correct to observe that subdivision is possible.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a hereinafter nimmer t here would appear to be no limit on how narrow the scope of licensed rights may be and still constitute a transfer of ownership,as long as the rights thus licensed are exclusive.the typical example is that of the author of a novel who gives an exclusive license for the hardcover edition to one person and an exclusive license for the movie version to a second.see silvers sony pictures entertainment,cir noting that the legislative history of the copyright act supports allowing parties to subdivide exclusive rights.but it appears that these subdivisions must be done cleanly,so that the limits of each holder rights can be defined.see kepnertregoe,vroom,cir.perhaps for that reason,rights are usually subdivided along geographical lines or distinctions among forms of production.see generally nimmer,supra,a.
it may be easiest,by comparing what rights other parties had in the software,to see if there is anything left over that hyperquest held exclusively.beginning with,we know that its interest in edoc is defined solely by the site agreement.that agreement imposed a geographical limitation on it could use the software only in its own facilities.it was not entitled otherwise to reproduce,distribute,or create any derivative works.since hyperquest has not asserted that any of internal activities amounted to copyright infringement,that takes out of the picture.putting the licensor itself to one side,the agreement gave hyperquest the right to engage in the relevant activities in all settings not defined by the license.
matters become more complicated when we look at the remainder of the agreement.safelite retained a significant package of rights,including the right to use edoc in a manner that did not compete directly with hyperquest,and to license edoc software to third parties solely for testing and development.hyperquest urges us to read the latter narrowly,so that it covers only safelite ability to add modifications to fix bugs in the program.see krause titleserv,cir.but we see nothing in the language of this agreement to signal that such a limited right was reserved.the use of the term development naturally suggests a more looking to new generations of the software,or new applications,for example.
our case is more complicated than the one the second c
