this is an appeal from a jury verdict in favor of berkshire medical center,berkshire,against its former general contractor,marx,marx,over problems in the renovation and expansion of berkshire hospital facilities in pittsfield,massachusetts.
what happened is largely but not entirely undisputed.in,berkshire began a significant overhaul of its facility.the project aimed to renovate square feet of existing hospital space and construct square feet of new space,including an entirely new set of eight surgical operating rooms.the surgical suite accounted for approximately square feet of the new construction.
berkshire engaged marx,a new york based construction company,as the general contractor for the entire project.berkshire also hired bovis land lease bovis to serve as its expert manager for the construction and cannon design to serve as its architect.berkshire and marx signed a comprehensive contract the trade contractor agreement that set forth,among other things,marx warranty obligation.in substance,marx promised to repair at no cost to berkshire any defects due to faulty workmanship or materials that appeared within one year of the completion of the work.
as general contractor,marx was responsible for the flooring installed throughout the project.in the operating rooms,the flooring was to consist of vinyl tiles on top of concrete slabs.marx laid the concrete slabs,but it subcontracted with a commercial flooring contractor,rochester flooring resource rochester,to install the vinyl tiles.prior to installing the vinyl in the operating rooms,rochester advised marx that the base layer of concrete had noticeable waves.
a finished floor product like vinyl should be directly glued to the base layer of concrete only when the surface of the concrete is smooth and level vinyl installed on an uneven or wavy surface will itself be visibly uneven and,under heavy wear,may come loose from the concrete.after rochester warning,marx undertook to smooth the concrete surface by applying flash patch a powder mixed with water or another additive to fill in the imperfections.
applying flash patch is a standard fix,and the resulting intermediate layer between the concrete and finished floor is commonly called an underlayment.rochester remained concerned about installing the vinyl tiles in the operating rooms even after marx attempted the flash patch fix and went so far as to request a release of liability from marx.a less formal understanding was worked about between the two contractors.
berkshire noticed problems with the floor in the new operating rooms as early as december,even before the rooms were occupied.the hospital was especially concerned about ruptures in the seams between vinyl tiles which could harbor dangerous bacteria and with the numerous air bubbles that had formed underneath the vinyl tiles which could themselves rupture,creating more cracks for bacteria and a tripping hazard for hospital personnel working in surgical suites.
marx apparently addressed these problems with individual repairs,and berkshire architect certified in january that the construction of the new operating rooms was substantially complete triggering the start of marx warranty period.berkshire took control of the operating rooms that same month.contemporaneous records show some flooring issues in the rooms at the time but no waves or bubbles.
however,new bubbles and split seams appeared in the operating rooms flooring within the first three months of berkshire occupancy.berkshire informed marx of the problems,and marx paid rochester to fix them.one berkshire representative estimated that more than fifty bubbles appeared at some point after the january that some were quite substantial,including one four or five feet long and that marx had to send workers to fix the floors more than ten times.but marx and rochester never refused to address the problems.
in the repair process,the offending piece of vinyl would be cut out,the underlayment beneath it scraped up,new flash patch laid down,and new vinyl installed on top.rochester onsite project manager,thomas urbano,noticed that the underlayment itself had crumbled into something resembling dust,which could cause the vinyl to come loose and form a bubble.in his experience,the crumbling could result from installing the vinyl flooring before the flash patch had properly dried out.crumbling underlayment could also cause the seam to split between tiles.
records from january show eighteen split seams and three bubbles in the floors of the operating rooms.the date is significant because marx warranty expired that month.other language in the warranty might have been read to extend it further,but berkshire has not pressed that broader reading.by march,all of the individual problems documented in january were apparently fixed by marx and rochester.
in marx view,this represented satisfactory completion of all the outstanding flooring issues covered by the warranty.nevertheless,marx and rochester continued without charge to berkshire to patch defects in the operating room floors including new split seams and bubbling as the problems persisted in and early.marx principal,peter marx,claimed at trial that marx performed these repairs or,more precisely,paid rochester to perform them because it wanted to maintain its reputation for quality workmanship and thought it would be wrong to run away from the problem.
berkshire,however,was becoming increasingly concerned that the persistent flooring problem presented a serious threat to its operations.in june,the hospital instructed its new director of facility management,joseph laroche,to investigate the bubbles and split seams.after removing the offending vinyl,in several instances he discovered problems with the consistency of the underlayment sometimes liquified and oozing rather than dry,sometimes broken up and chalky,sometimes stuck to the vinyl but not the concrete.
laroche report convinced berkshire to hire david cowen,an architect employed by an firm,to further investigate the flooring problems.cowen confirmed that the operating room floors were beset with split seams and bubbles and recommended that the entire floor be replaced.in the summer of berkshire contacted vinyl flooring manufacturers and a contractor and,by the end of,committed itself to replacing the floor,albeit without a conclusive explanation for the cause of the observed problems.
just when marx came to know that its further services would not be required is unclear.in late,bovis expressed concern that berkshire aimed to replace the floor without marx involvement.john rogers,general counsel to the hospital,replied that there was no other choice,given the failure of previous repair efforts and his concern that continued bubbles and split seams in the operating room floors could imperil the hospital in upcoming accreditation inspections.by the end of december,marx had been officially told.
berkshire ultimately had the floor replaced by other companies at a cost of a higher figure than the total amount marx paid rochester to install all the floors in the initial square feet project.the steep price was largely due to need to construct and remove containment systems so the floors could be renovated one part at a time while medical procedures continued.after replacing the floors,berkshire observed no split seams or bubbles in the operating rooms.
in may,berkshire brought the present lawsuit against marx to recover the cost of replacing the operating room floors.the complaint,invoking diversity jurisdiction,included a claim for breach of the express warranty given in the trade contractor agreement.by mutual consent,the case was tried before a magistrate judge.c.the jury awarded berkshire in damages on the express warranty count,and the district court entered judgment in that amount,plus prejudgment interest 
marx now appeals,having preserved various claims by moving for judgment as a matter of law at trial and again after the verdict.its appeal covers multiple topics the time limit on the warranty the warranty requirement of written notice to the contractor and an opportunity to cure the problem an alleged failure of berkshire to show that t
