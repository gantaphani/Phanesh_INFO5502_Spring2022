plaintiff william ríos piñeiro appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states in this federal tort claims act ftca action.the united states postal service usps terminated ríos employment contract after concluding that he had stolen mail containing money.ríos sued the united states in the district court of puerto rico over the events relating to that contract termination.after careful review of the summary judgment record,we affirm.
background 
we assess the record that was before the district court on the motion for summary judgment drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party,ríos.see roman potter,cir.
ríos was a contract employee with the usps for over years,responsible for sorting mail and delivering it along an established route in florida,puerto rico.he was one of five letter carriers in the florida post office.in may,ríos had a falling out with carrier mark nieves over nieves conduct.ríos began reporting nieves misdeeds to postmaster albert gonzalez.this led to confrontations between nieves and ríos,once nearly culminating in a fistfight.
in june,nieves reported to lucydali rivera,the postal inspector responsible for the florida post office,that he had seen ríos take mail from the hot case the container for misaddressed mail and remove money from an envelope.on the basis of this report,the inspection service coordinated an investigative operation designed to catch ríos in the act of theft.
on july,postal inspectors prepared three test envelopes,each containing a greeting card,united states currency and fluorescent powder.the inspectors marked the bills and recorded their serial numbers,and sealed the envelopes.the envelopes contained destination and return addresses in the state of florida,which would ordinarily lead to their placement in the hot case for proper delivery.
rivera requested that nieves meet her and other postal inspectors before going to work in the morning.at this meeting,they provided nieves with the envelopes and asked him to place them around the florida post office.the inspectors determined that nieves should perform this task because they worried that their presence would arouse suspicion in the small office.nieves drove from this meeting to the post office,with the inspectors following behind.shortly after arriving,nieves telephoned the inspectors to inform them that he had set the bait.in calls,he reported that the envelopes were not where he had placed them and that ríos had left to purchase breakfast for some of the postal employees.the postal inspectors decided to wait until after ríos completed his delivery route to confront him about the missing envelopes.
once ríos had returned to the post office from his daily deliveries,inspectors summoned him into the postmaster office.once inside,the inspectors asked him to empty his pockets.he was in possession of several banknotes,including a bill whose serial number matched a bill from one of the envelopes and which bore the inspectors mark.screening with an ultraviolet light revealed that ríos had fluorescent powder on his hands and the pocket area of his pants.the inspectors then explained to ríos that they would take him to the men bathroom to search him for additional money.two male inspectors escorted him to the bathroom.they asked him to remove his shoes and lower his pants,and he complied.one of the inspectors pulled the band of ríos underwear away from his body and looked at his genital area.this search yielded no other evidence,and none of the envelopes or the greeting cards were ever found.based on this incident,usps terminated ríos contract.postal inspectors subsequently persuaded local authorities to bring criminal charges against ríos,which were all dismissed.
ríos initiated an administrative appeal to the postal service board of contract appeals psbca,which convened a evidentiary hearing to determine whether the usps breached ríos contract.both parties had the opportunity to present witnesses and subject opposing witnesses to.ríos denied the allegation of theft,claiming that he had received the bill from nieves that morning while he was collecting money to purchase breakfast.according to ríos,when he and nieves shook hands that morning,additional powder transferred onto him.the psbca was unconvinced by this theory.based on the evidence collected during the postal inspectors investigation,the psbca determined that ríos was in possession of the bill and that the fluorescent powder on his hands and trousers indicated that he was the person who opened at least one of the prepared envelopes.the psbca held that this serious breach of his employment contract justified the decision to terminate ríos contract.ríos did not appeal this decision to the federal circuit.
meanwhile,ríos had initiated a ftca suit against the united states for the actions of usps employees on the date of the sting,alleging six torts.on the government motion,a magistrate judge recommended dismissing three of the six claims and the district court adopted the magistrate reasoning without any objection from ríos.
the government then sought summary judgment on the remaining claims,which were for negligent supervision,invasion of privacy,and malicious prosecution.the government submitted a record containing,among other exhibits,the proceedings before the psbca and its decision.in response,ríos requested that the court strike the psbca factual findings from the record.declining to do so,the district court instead incorporated those findings,and granted judgment to the government.in his appeal,ríos pays particular attention to the district court decision to give the psbca findings preclusive effect over factual matters.
ii.discussion 
review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.henry united bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in this case,the existence or of factual disputes hinges upon whether the psbca order precludes relitigating these issues in the district court.the applicability vel non of preclusion principles is a question of law.monarch life ins.ropes gray.
collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,is a doctrine of judicial economy that grants preclusive effect to final adjudications of fact or law in subsequent litigation.see parklane hosiery shore,d.its basic application is straightforward when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties,whether on the same or a different claim.mihos swift,cir quoting restatement second of judgments.
as a threshold matter,we must decide whether collateral estoppel applies to the administrative decision of the psbca.the supreme court has stated its preference for applying issue preclusion to those determinations of administrative bodies that have attained finality.astoria fed.sav.loans ass solimino,d.if the administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.united states utah const.min,d see also bath iron works director,office of workers comp.programs,dep t of labor,cir granting preclusive effect to the factual findings of a state administrative agency.
we see no reason not to apply this general rule to the psbca.congress created the psbca as part of its comprehensive approach to resolving public contract disputes.the psbca,along with parallel boards in other government agencies,provides an alternative to the federal court of claims for adjudicating these disputes.id.b.its procedures,which include limited discovery and examination of witnesses at a hearing,are set forth in regulations.such an adjudicative scheme is sufficient to trigger the doctrine of collateral estoppel.emiabata united states,c ollateral estoppel may apply to decisions of a board of contract appeals that are deemed final.
