this complex commercial case presents a gordian knot of issues arising from multiple,interrelated contract disputes between the scotts company,a manufacturer of lawn and garden products,and central garden pet company,a distributor of lawn and garden products.in june of,scotts brought suit against central,alleging that central owed scotts million on accounts arising from multiple transactions in which central distributed lawn and products for scotts.central responded with a counterclaim that alleged separate causes of action relating to these transactions,and sought million in damages.the majority of the issues to be resolved on appeal pertain to central counterclaims.
in a series of partial judgments,including the dismissal of central contract and claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the granting of summary judgment against central on its fraud claim,and the dismissal during trial of central claim,the district court limited or dismissed the majority of central claims before they reached the jury.the jury rendered verdicts of million in favor of scotts and million in favor of central.a portion of the jury verdict relating to incentive compensation was later stricken by the district court pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,reducing central award by.in a further string of rulings,the district court set the rates of prejudgment and postjudgment interest,and determined that the transition from the former to the latter occurred when the jury verdict was entered by the court as a judgment on may.
central appeals the entire series of judgments against it,ranging from the rule b determinations to the award of prejudgment interest to scotts.scotts raises several issues involving the court calculation of prejudgment and postjudgment interest,and contests the court denial of attorney fees.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the final judgment of the district court,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual.central,and claims 
from july of until october of,central was party to an exclusive agency and distributor agreement referred to by the parties as the alliance agreement with a division of the monsanto company called the solaris group.the alliance agreement allowed central to act as the exclusive distributor of the solaris group ortho and roundup garden products.in its counterclaim to scotts lawsuit,central alleged that monsanto began exploring the sale of the solaris group in,and that both scotts and central began independently negotiating for the purchase.
central claimed that william brown,its chairman and ceo,and glenn novotny,its president,traveled to scotts corporate headquarters in marysville,ohio in april of to negotiate the purchase of the brands.according to central,the parties reached a meeting of the minds and formed an agreement relating to the solaris group sale of its ortho and roundup product lines.this acquisition sharing agreement allegedly provided that,if either scotts or central was successful in purchasing the solaris group,the benefits and liabilities of the new entity would be split between them.the specific percentages that each company would have of each brand would depend on which company succeeded in purchasing the solaris group.
although the benefits and liabilities created by this purported agreement potentially involved millions of dollars,it was never reduced to writing.instead,it was allegedly an oral agreement,with the particulars memorialized by the parties on a series of enlarged pages which were part of an easel display.central claimed that it had requested copies of these pages during discovery,but that they were never produced.
in august of,scotts reached a tentative agreement with monsanto to integrate its business with the solaris group product line.specifically,scotts would acquire the ortho line and would be monsanto partner in the sales and marketing of roundup.central claims that,when it reminded scotts of the purported acquisition sharing agreement,scotts refused to comply on the ground that the deal scotts had reached with monsanto was different from the one contemplated by the parties during their prior discussions.
as part of scotts deal with monsanto,scotts acquired all of the rights that monsanto had under the alliance agreement with central.the alliance agreement came to an end in september of.central counterclaim alleged that the failure of scotts to comply with the acquisition sharing agreement constituted a breach of the oral contract,that scotts statements at the april meeting were fraudulent misrepresentations,and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel required scotts to comply with the acquisition sharing agreement.
central claims 
although the alliance agreement terminated at the end of september of,central continued to distribute scotts products in the period between october,and september,program year.according to central,the distribution was allegedly regulated by an oral agency agreement,under which 
the parties agreed that central would serve as scotts s distribution agent for certain customers and certain products during the program year scotts agreed to pay central agency compensation in exchange for central distribution and delivery of scotts s products to customers during the program year.
central claimed that,during program year,it had accumulated an excess inventory of scotts lawn,garden,and horticulture products,as well as ortho and roundup products.according to central,the oral agency agreement gave it two options with regard to the excess inventory central could return the inventory to scotts and get a refund,or it could keep the inventory for distribution the following year.the district court correctly found that the second option was not feasible since scotts had notified central that it would not enter into any future distribution agreement at the end of program year.central claims that it attempted to return the inventory,but that scotts refused.
in its counterclaim,central contended that scotts had breached the oral agency agreement by refusing to take back the scotts,ortho,and roundup inventory.but central did not formally tender this excess inventory back to scotts until the filing of its counterclaim.
central also contends that it had attempted to return certain miracle gro products to scotts during program year.this claim was treated separately from the program year claims.
the jury verdict included an award of to central for scotts purported breach of contract with regard to an incentive program.this claim derived from an incentive program for sales of ortho and roundup products to distributors such as central titled distributor trade program.the program,which applied to sales made in program year,set out three separate incentives for sales made by distributors in that time frame.although it contained a caveat that the incentive program should not be interpreted as an price reduction,the effect of the incentive program was to reduce the price that distributors paid for ortho and roundup products that they timely sold.the amount of an award for scotts violation of this agreement would therefore depend on the amount of central sales of ortho and roundup products during program year.
one of scotts witnesses testified that central had not given scotts any sales information for program year.according to the district court,the only evidence pertaining to central sales for py was a conclusory statement by brown that he believed central sales were about million.
procedural background including prejudgment and postjudgment interest issues 
central,and claims 
through a series of partial judgments,the district court addressed the claims discussed above,as well as the subsequent disputes over prejudgment interest,postjudgment interest,and attorney fees.in january of,the court ruled on a motion by scotts to dismiss the,and claims under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.it held that,even assuming as true the terms of the acquisition sharing agreement as pled by defendant central garden,no enforceable obligation resulted.for that reason,it dismissed the claim and the claim.because central pled its claim with greater specificity,the court held that this claim could not be resolved at the rule b stage.
scotts later moved for partial summary judgment on the claim.the district court granted the motion in april of,holding that the evidence presented by central d id not give rise to a genuine issue of material fact on the alleged falsity of the representation to enter into a joint venture on the solaris line with central.
central claims 
after the close of central,scotts moved for judgment as a matter of law on the claims.noting that central had waited seven months after the end of program year before attempting to return the excess inventory,and that central had sold at least a portion of the inventory without giving notice to scotts,the district court granted scotts motion with respect to the program year inventory.central claim based on the miracle gro products left over from program year was initially allowed to proceed to the jury because central was still in possession of the inventory,but the claim was subsequently dismissed in part because central had failed to give seasonable notice with regard to some of the miracle gro products.
the jury verdict 
in may of,the jury returned a verdict in favor of scotts for million and a verdict in favor of central for million.the former was based entirely on scotts original claim,but the latter was based on four separate awards for breach of contract for the payment of agency fees,for excess shipments,for breach of contract on the issue,and for the miracle gro products from program year that were subject to return.
after the jury verdict was entered,scotts filed a motion pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure to alter the verdict with regard to the incentive award.because of the lack of evidence as to central actual sales for program year,the district court set aside this portion of the jury verdict.
prejudgment interest and attorney fees scotts 
scotts also moved to amend the verdict to add prejudgment interest on its claims for program year,and sought attorney fees.the claims involved accounts from four business units gardens,lawns,growing,and horticulture.
scotts claimed that the allowance of prejudgment interest for the gardens business unit was controlled by specific language contained in the distributor price list.this language,appearing in a section titled terms about halfway through the document,provided that a service charge of per month will be added to the unpaid balance of past due accounts.holding that the price list constituted a written contract between the parties,the district court ruled that the specified interest amounted to per be the rate for the portion of the verdict arising from the gardens unit.
although the price list governing the lawns business for program year was silent as to the interest rate for accounts,scotts argued that the court should look to the service charges specified on each individual lawns invoice issued during program year.a terms conditions section appears on the reverse side of the sample invoice submitted by scotts,and a section titled credit specifies that a monthly service charge of one and percent or up to the maximum permitted by law if less,will be payable on any past due portions of the purchase price after the due date.distinguishing a term on the back of an invoice from a term in the price list for future transactions,the district court held that the interest rate was unenforceable and that scotts was limited to the statutory rate of per annum on lawns accounts.
growing and horticulture 
the documents governing the growing media and horticulture business programs did not specify any interest rate for accounts.accordingly,the district court awarded scotts the statutory interest rate on these balances due from central.
attorney fees 
the district court denied scotts motion for attorney fees.noting that provisions on preprinted commercial contracts are generally held unenforceable by the ohio courts,the district court found no reason to depart from the general rule.
prejudgment interest central 
unlike scotts detailed request for prejudgment interest,central simply moved for any prejudgment interest to which it might be entitled,without presenting a method for calculating the amount.the court directed the parties to confer as to the net amount of prejudgment interest that they owed each other.after doing so,they agreed that is the net amount of prejudgment interest that has accrued in favor of plaintiff scotts through may.
the district court also considered,and rejected,a request by central for in additional prejudgment interest resulting from additional amounts allegedly due and owing to central from scotts for shipments made during program year.these additional amounts were not part of the jury award,and were unrelated to any evidence that was put before the jury.
transition between prejudgment and postjudgment interest 
the parties also disagreed as to the date through which prejudgment interest ran.central argued that it stopped at the date of entry of judgment on the jury verdict may,whereas scotts claimed that it accrued until a final appealable order was entered by the district court september.holding without explanation that there is only one judgment in this rule b judgment entered on may,the district court held that prejudgment interest would end,and postjudgment interest begin,on that date.
