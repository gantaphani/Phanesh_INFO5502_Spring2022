this is an appeal from two orders of the district court an order granting a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to.b filed by safetech international,safetech and gaylen davenport davenport collectively,defendants and an order denying a motion for reconsideration filed by air products and controls,air products.in this lawsuit,air products alleges,inter alia,that defendants engaged in a fraudulent transfer of assets to avoid a debt owed to air products.the debt accrued from several years of purchases on credit by safetech,and was reduced to a judgment award following litigation between the parties.the primary issue in this appeal is whether safetech,a kansas corporation,and davenport,an individual residing in kansas,are subject to personal jurisdiction in michigan,where air products has its principal place of business.the district court found that it lacked personal jurisdiction over safetech and davenport because the causes of action did not arise out of defendants contacts with michigan,and,accordingly,the district court dismissed the case.for the reasons stated herein,we reverse the district court decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand this action for further proceedings.we do not address the order denying air products motion for reconsideration,as our decision as to the first order renders that issue moot.
background 
air products is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in pontiac,michigan.from its michigan headquarters,it manufactures and distributes life safety products,such as smoke detectors and various electronic relays.safetech is a kansas corporation with its principal place of business in lenexa,kansas.safetech is a former customer of air products that,between and,purchased a series of goods from air products for resale to safetech customers.davenport is an individual who resides in lenexa,kansas.at all times relevant to this lawsuit,davenport was the president and owner of safetech.
in august,safetech opened a credit account with air products and purchased goods on credit from air products over the course of almost nine years,until march.air products alleges that,over the course of those years,davenport contacted air products in michigan on several hundred occasions through telephone,email,fax,and ordinary mail,and that the cumulative value of the goods purchased exceeded several hundred thousand dollars.the goods purchased by safetech were manufactured in michigan and sent to safetech in kansas or directly to safetech customers.
between and,safetech failed to make payments to air products for goods purchased,and,in,their business relationship ceased.litigation ensued in the united states district court for the district of kansas,initiated by safetech,in which both parties asserted claims against each other,primarily for breach of contract,the result of which was a jury verdict in favor of air products in the amount of,plus in costs.on june,the district court in kansas entered judgment in favor of air products and against safetech in that amount.
air products alleges that,throughout the trial,safetech and its counsel represented to air products that safetech was no longer in business and was without funds to pay past due amounts or,presumably,any judgment.air products claims to have later learned,however,that,in december,safetech and davenport sold assets to a company named in the amount of million.air products alleges that the sale of assets to was a fraudulent transfer,primarily because it included a bill of sale for to davenport personally for an asset that air products believes either does not exist or properly belongs to safetech,not davenport.air products contends that the paid to davenport should have been paid to safetech and,as a result,would have been available to satisfy the judgment award of owed by safetech to air products air products further alleges that,around the time of the sale of assets,davenport was aware of safetech debt to air products because he acknowledged the debt during a deposition taken in connection with the kansas litigation on august,and,therefore,that the transfer was undertaken with an intent to injure air products.
on july,air products filed this action in michigan state court,asserting seven causes of action two counts for fraudulent transfer or obligation under a and b,respectively a count for transfer by debtor as fraud under a count only against davenport for unjust enrichment a count only against davenport for illegal dividend a count for attorneys fees and a count for equitable relief.on august,safetech and davenport removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan and moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.after the district court granted the motion,air products filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the district court did not adequately consider that its claim for attorneys fees was based on the contract between the parties and,thus,arose from defendants contacts with michigan.the district court denied that motion on the basis that it was untimely and,in any event,that it was not well taken.air products filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews de novo a district court dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to.b.in the context of a rule b motion,a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the existence of jurisdiction.serras first.bank ass n,cir.where,as here,the district court relies solely on written submissions and affidavits to resolve a rule b motion,rather than resolving the motion after either an evidentiary hearing or limited discovery,the burden on the plaintiff is relatively slight,am.greetings cohn,cir,and the plaintiff must make only a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists in order to defeat dismissal,theunissen matthews,cir.in that instance,the pleadings and affidavits submitted must be viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,and the district court should not weigh the controverting assertions of the party seeking dismissal.id.at.
personal jurisdiction over an defendant arises from certain minimum contacts with the forum such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.depending on the type of minimum contacts in a case,personal jurisdiction can either be specific or general.reynolds int l amateur athletic fed n,cir.in this case,air products asserts that both specific jurisdiction and general jurisdiction are present.because we ultimately conclude that the district court had specific jurisdiction over defendants,we focus only on that question and do not reach the question of general jurisdiction.
in analyzing personal jurisdiction in diversity actions such as this,federal courts must look to the law of the forum state to determine the reach of the district court personal jurisdiction over parties,subject to constitutional due process requirements.lanier am.bd.of endodontics,cir.this court,therefore,must engage in a process first,the court must determine whether any of michigan relevant statutes authorize the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants and,if so,the court must determine whether exercise of that jurisdiction comports with constitutional due process.
as to the due process inquiry for specific jurisdiction the only type of personal jurisdiction we address here,our court has established a three part test for determining whether such jurisdiction may be exercised 
first,the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state.second,the cause of action must arise from the defendant activities there.finally,the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant reasonable.

discussion 
in this case,the district court concluded that two michigan statutes one that applies to individuals and one that applies to corporations authorized the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants,but that the exercise of jurisdiction in this case would run afoul of the limits of constitutional due process.specifically,the district court found that defendants had purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in that state,but determined that air products causes of action did not arise from those activities and,thus,that exercise of jurisdiction in this case would not be reasonable.
because we agree with the district court that michigan law authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants,we do not address that aspect of the district court decision.we focus only on the due process requirements for the exercise of specific jurisdiction over defendants,analyzing the three prongs of the southern machine test.although the district court correctly concluded that the first prong of that satisfied here,we augment the district court analysis in certain respects because that prong is arguably the most important,and because it colors our discussion of the other prongs of the test.
purposeful availment 
as indicated above,in order to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over an defendant,that defendant must have purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state,at.this purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous or attenuated contacts or of the unilateral activity of another party or third person.burger king rudzewicz,d internal citations omitted.jurisdiction is proper,however,where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum state.id.citation omitted and emphasis in original.in particular,where a defendant has created continuing obligations between himself and the residents of the forum,he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there.id.at.internal citation omitted.in addition,physical presence in a forum state is not required,and the supreme court has consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.id.citations omitted.
the facts of this case satisfy the purposeful availment requirement for several reasons.first,defendants had a business relationship with air products lasting almost nine years in which they purchased goods cumulatively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.defendants mailed an application to open a credit account to air products in michigan and sent purchase orders to michigan,some or all of which presumably formed the basis of contracts on which the parties ultimately based their breach of contract claims in the initial kansas litigation.with respect to interstate contractual obligations,the supreme court has emphasized that parties who reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state are subject to regulation and sanctions for the consequences of their activities.burger king,at.quoting travelers health ass virginia.although entering into a contract with an party alone does not automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts,the presence of certain factors in addition to the contract will be found to constitute purposeful availment.id.at.factors to consider are prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,along with the terms of the contract and the parties actual course of dealing.id.at.in this case,the parties did not engage in a transaction,but in a continuing business relationship that lasted a period of many years.defendants reached out beyond kansas borders to conduct business with a company whose principal place of business it knew to be in michigan.such contacts are not random,fortuitous,or attenuated,but are the result of deliberate conduct that amounts to purposeful availment.
in addition,safetech does not dispute that davenport contacted air products in michigan on approximately several hundred occasions through telephone,email,facsimile,and ordinary mail correspondence for purposes of discussing and placing orders for goods.although these contacts are certainly numerous,a numerical count of the calls and letters has no talismanic significance.lak,deer creek,cir.rather,t he quality of the contacts as demonstrating purposeful availment is the issue,not their number or their status as communications.id.quoting stuart spademan,cir.this court has found that contacts lack quality when they are initiated by the plaintiff rather than the defendant,in part because t he unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a defendant can not satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum.id.quoting helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.in this case,defendants contacts are not only numerous,they are also the type of contacts that demonstrate purposeful availment.many of them were initiated by defendants themselves and,therefore,are not simply the result of unilateral activity on the part of air products.in addition,they were made for purposes of placing purchase orders and,therefore,continuing the parties business relationship.
as the district court pointed out,finding that the purposeful availment prong is satisfied in this case is consistent with prior sixth circuit case law.see devices,at finding purposeful availment where the defendant negotiated a substantial business contract for the manufacture of goods with a firm it knew to be in the forum state cole,at cir finding purposeful availment where a nonresident defendant transacts business by negotiating and executing a contract via telephone calls and letters to a resident of the forum state.
in addition,evidence that relates specifically to the transfer of assets supports air products assertion that defendants conduct was directed at or aimed at air products,such that this case would fall under the effects test enunciated by the supreme court in calder jones,d.in calder,the supreme court held that two florida residents,a writer and editor for the national enquirer magazine,were subject to personal jurisdiction in california court because they intentionally aimed their tortious conduct an allegedly defamatory article at a california resident,entertainer shirley jones.calder,at.even though the article was written and edited in florida and one of the defendants had only been to california twice,the court explained that the defendants knew that the focal point of the article as well as the brunt of the harm would be in california,and,therefore,jurisdiction was proper based on the effects of their florida conduct in california.id.at.
the sixth circuit,as well as other circuits,have narrowed the application of the calder effects test,such that the mere allegation of intentional tortious conduct which has injured a forum resident does not,by itself,always satisfy the purposeful availment prong.see scotts aventis,cir w e have applied calder narrowly by evaluating whether a defendant contacts with the forum may be enhanced if the defendant expressly aimed its tortious conduct at the forum and plaintiff forum state was the focus of the activities of the defendant out of which the suit arises.reynolds,at distinguishing calder and making a particularized inquiry of the relations and dealings between the parties to find that an allegedly defamatory article did not establish sufficient minimum contacts see also far west capital,towne,cir our review of these decisions indicates that the mere allegation that an defendant has tortiously interfered with contractual rights or has committed other business torts that have allegedly injured a forum res
