opinion of the court 
previous litigation between appellant,allied erecting and dismantling,and appellee,usx corporation,was settled on the eve of trial.in this suit,allied claims that usx violated several provisions of that settlement agreement.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of usx,and allied appeals.many facts are contested,but we have isolated those that are germane to the three issues reaching us on appeal.as fully explained below,we will reverse the district court judgment in two respects,affirm the balance,and remand the cause to the district court.
background 
on the eve of trial for the first action brought by allied against usx corporation,the two entities entered into a settlement agreement.allied claimed that it suffered million dollars in damages as a result of contracts it entered into with usx to dismantle several of usx steelmaking facilities.the settlement agreement,which is at the heart of this controversy,provided usx would pay allied eight million dollars allied would be granted all dismantling projects at usx fairless works plant allied could bid in good faith as a primary bidder on usx subsequent dismantling projects allied would be granted last look rights for a period of seven years to equal or better the most acceptable bid received by usx for any dismantling projects allied would be awarded dismantling contracts at usx ambridge works,saxonburg works,and mcdonald works.
allied section v claim 
allied first two claims arise from section v of the settlement agreement,which reads 
except as to any dismantling work at usx south works facility in chicago,illinois,allied shall be invited to bid in good faith as one of steel groups primary bidders on any dismantling work,of whatever nature or type at any steelmaking facilities,or former steelmaking facilities,owned by the steel group consistent with and pursuant to specification and performance standards developed and issued by steel group for such work and,for a period of seven years from the date of this settlement agreement and general release,allied shall be offered an opportunity to equal to better the most acceptable bid received by the steel group for any such further dismantling activity.if,within ten days of receipt of bids,allied offers in writing to per form such work on such terms which are equal to or better than the bid otherwise most acceptable to the steel group,then,in such event,the work shall be awarded to allied,provided,however,that allied is then able to meet steel group performance standards then in effect and,further,that allied has not been adjudicated to be in default under any dismantling contract with steel group then in effect at the time of such bidding.
under this last look provision,usx issued allied and other dismantlers specifications for projects up for bid.the third parties then bid on the projects subject to the condition that purchaser usx reserves the right to reject any or all bids.no third party was told that allied held the right to review and match their final bids.for the first few sessions,allied formulated and submitted earnest bids on the projects.formulating a bid for projects such as these can be cost and labor intensive,and allied later determined that instead of participating in the bidding process it would merely review the best bid offered to usx and decide if it wanted to take the job at that price.
allied claims that usx violated the terms of section v through its relationship with allied,brandenburg industrial services company.because the litigation soured allied and usx working relationship,usx awarded most of its dismantling projects thereafter to brandenburg.as a result of this close working relationship,brandenburg prepared most of the specifications for the projects on which allied held the last look right.because brandenburg prepared these specifications,allied argued,it held an unquestioned and substantial advantage over the other bidders for this work.within one bid,brandenburg offered to forgive that usx owed for developing the project specifications if usx granted the project to brandenburg.allied was unable to compete with an offer that included debt forgiveness,and therefore claims that such dealings between usx and brandenburg materially varied the terms of the project specifications and violated allied last look rights.
allied fraudulent inducement claim 
allied next claims that it was fraudulently induced into accepting section v of the settlement agreement.allied claims that usx stated during the settlement bar gaining process that usx would be preparing the specifications for the projects on which allied would bid pursuant to section v.this statement led allied to believe that its last look rights would not be undercut by a competitor who prepared the specifications and could therefore offer a discount by including the price of the preparations in the bid.at the time usx allegedly made these statements to allied,usx had already retained brandenburg to prepare specifications for two of the projects on which allied intended to bid.
brandenburg subsequently used this leverage to outbid allied on one of the projects.
allied saxonburg claim 
allied expected to quickly raze the saxonburg works plant,liquidate its materials for a substantial profit,and thereby recoup some of its losses associated with the litigation.section iv of the settlement agreement reads,in part 
that all dismantling by allied shall be per formed at no cost to usx 
that the dismantling specification will not include the provision for any environmental remediation including any remediation removal of asbestos by allied,it being understood and agreed that any environmental remediation shall be for usx account 
all ferrous and scrap produced at the dismantling projects shall belong to allied.
the project,however,became complicated by a steel manufacturing byproduct known as sinter dust.according to allied,
work in and around the dust was far more difficult than anticipated because the sinter dust impacted the way facilities were dropped,the dust had to be cleaned from the scrap generated during the dismantling before the scrap could be dismantled and processed,and,when the dust was dry it became airborne and impacted visibility,and while it was wet,it congealed into a soupy mush that significantly slowed the work.
in addition to the general difficulties allied experienced in dismantling a plant full of beams,girders,and equipment caked with the dust,allied discovered that some of the dust contained lead and therefore posed health risks to its employees working amidst more than tons of the material.allied notified usx of the hazard and reminded usx of the relevant terms governing the saxonburg work 
if during the course of the demolition project an environmental condition is discovered that requires remediation,other than asbestos,the contractor shall notify the purchaser and the purchaser shall be responsible for any necessary remediation.the contractor shall not be entitled to any additional compensation resulting from any delays due to the remediation process.
to protect its workers,allied outfitted them with protective clothing,respirators,and decontamination showers.the cost of these safety measures diminished allied anticipated profit,and the cumbersome gear rendered the workers less productive.usx instructed allied to remove the lead infected dust surrounding the sinter machines,and allied loaded and hauled the dust to an hazardous dump.usx paid allied for this service.allied also offered to load and haul the remaining sinter dust for per ton.usx agreed to the price and ultimately paid allied to move tons of the dust to a dump site.
allied,however,claims that it performed remedial work beyond and distinct from loading and hauling.allied contends that section iv of the settlement agreement protected it from having to perform environmental remediation,and thus seeks to recover the additional unanticipated costs it incurred in remediating the saxonburg facility of this sinter dust in the form of delay and disruption damages.
ii.discussion 
a.the enforceability of section v 
the district court declared section v a nullity and unenforceable as against public policy as practiced to date.allied contends that section v does not offend the common law consensus and therefore can not be voided as against public policy.we agree.
it has long been settled,the district court stated,that a court will not become an aid in the enforcement of contractual provisions where to do so would violate public policy.the court recited and early century caselaw,beginning with veazey allen,
there are phases of public policy which are as enduring and immutable as the law of gravity.one of them is that,as applied to the law of contracts,courts of justice will never recognize or uphold any transaction which in its object,operation,or tendency is calculated to be prejudicial to the public welfare.that sound morality and civic honesty are cornerstones of the social edifice is a truism which needs no reinforcement by argument.it may therefore be taken for granted that whenever our courts are called upon to scrutinize a contract which is clearly repugnant to sound morality and civic honesty,they need not look for a well fitting definition of public policy,nor hesitate in its practical application in the law on contracts.
the rule is,the court continued as it cited the pennsylvania supreme court in kuhn buhl,that courts having in their view public interests,will not lend their aid to the enforcement of an unlawful contract.the court drew its direct authority from pittsburgh dredging and constr.monongahela and western dredging,which stated that v iewed from that standpoint of morals,square dealing,and commercial integrity,combinations for collusive,misleading,biddings,wherever made,can not be approved yet to enforce rights based on an agreement to make such bids is to make the law an active agent to accomplish such deceptive purposes.
regarding section v of the settlement agreement,the court found that the evil tendency of the contract was or would be to perpetrate a fraud on the bidders and to deny one bidder on each project the natural consequence of the bidder endeavors this potential fraud has been and would continue to be perpetrated on innocent third parties by using the court and the confidentiality of the settlement agreement to keep this practice undisclosed as to both the victims and the public.the injury to competition may not be immediate in any particular project,but if this arrangement were to be carried into effect repetitively,over the period,it is clear that it would have an injurious effect on competition by denying certain of those third parties what should otherwise have been awarded to them for their honest work and labor in formulating the bids.
stating that section v contains the tendency to work fraud on the innocent third party bidders,repugnantly distorts the natural consequences of bona fide competition,and uses the court to shelter this state of affairs from detection,the court held that the provision is,indeed,void as against public policy.further,the court refused to shift the blame for the illegality of section v to usx because allied could have genuinely participated in the bidding process and demanded that usx disclose allied last look right to the other bidders.the court was unwilling to find that allied was victimized by this provision because it concluded that allied chose not to participate in the bidding process on several of the projects,unfairly benefitted from having others shoulder the expense of drafting the specifications,and unscrupulously viewed the bids of its rivals without their consent.the court also refused to allow its supervisory approval of the settlement agreement to validate section v,concluding that it was allied failure to genuinely participate in the bidding and inform other bidders of its last look rights that rendered it infirm.
when ruling on the grounds of public policy,a court must speak for a virtual unanimity that can be found in definite indications in the law.muschany united states.mamlin genoe.we can not find such a consensus.to the contrary,the state of the law on this issue is entirely unclear,as last look and first refusal rights are typically found unproblematic in a variety of contexts.see crivelli general motors,cir permitting right of first refusal for automobile franchisor transmission access policy group federal energy regulatory comm n,permitting right of first refusal for utilities costumers handelsman bedford village,cir permitting right of first refusal granted to real estate partnership pursuant to settlement agreement prudential real estate affiliates,ppr realty,cir cochran,cir finding the failure to disclose last look in securities bidding not fraudulent oregon rsa,castle rock cellular of oregon,cir finding implied covenant of good faith violated by agreement to purchase shell company in attempt to avoid first refusal provisions of partnership agreement pincus pabst brewing,cir schultze chevron oil,cir cbs,capital cities,sun oil of bellone.considering the wide acceptance of last look rights,the district court policy analysis contradicts common law consensus and is therefore unsupportable.in addition,section v was an element of the agreement to settle the previous litigation.the principles of this agreement were met with approval by the trial judge presiding over that litigation,and this authorization further militates against the argument that there exist a virtual anonymity against rights.
the district court reliance on pittsburgh dredging was misplaced.in that case,the plaintiff and defendant both were bidders on a dredging project let by a.see pittsburgh dredging,at.the two bidders agreed to submit bids within a few cents of one another and to split the work regardless of which bidder received the contract.see id.at.the company letting the project,which was not informed of this arrangement,rejected both bids.one bidder then submitted a new bid and received the dredging project,but did not share the work.see id.the other bidder sued to enforce the sharing agreement,but the district court found it void as against public policy,holding that combinations for collusive,misleading biddings,wherever made,can not be approved.id.at.
pittsburgh dredging is distinguishable from the instant case,which involves not an agreement between two bidders without notice to the company letting the project,but rather an agreement between the party letting the project and one bidder.there was no collusive or misleading bidding.the bidding process remained competitive in that every bidder made its best bid and usx expressly reserved to itself the unfettered right and discretion to select the most acceptable bid from the most acceptable bidder and to reject any and all bids for any reason.although allied did perhaps have some advantage by being able to match the best bid,it by no means was guaranteed the project over other bidders.unlike the agreement in pittsburgh dredging,section v does not involve collusive price fixing by bidders and therefore does not provide a basis for rejection as against public policy.
the district court loosely referred to antitrust principles in its opinion,and allied argues on appeal that because section v constitutes neither a per se nor a rule of reason violation of the sherman act,it can not violate public policy.allied relies primarily on sitkin smelting refining fmc,cir.
because we have already held that,irrespective of the sherman act,section v does not violate general principles of public policy,we need not discuss allied sherman act argument.we note in passing,however,that we do not believe that section v violates the sherman act.we ruled in sitkin,a case involving a similar last look right exercised by a dismantling company,that the parties desired to find the market price rather than influence the market price,and that,therefore,the contract did not violate the sherman act.sitkin,at.we believe that allied and usx had similar intentions in drafting section v,and,therefore,we are confident that there has been no sherman act violation.
in sum,we conclude that the district court erred by finding section v unenforceable as contrary to public policy.we will remand for the district court to determine if usx must pay damages to allied for breach of contractual obligations under section 
fraudulent inducement 
the fraudulent inducement claim contains three.first,does nocito lanuitti,provide the controlling standard or was nocito subsequently modified by tilghman dollenberg,second,if nocito requires parties to return consideration in order to bring their fraudulent inducement claim,then is allied entitled to an exception to this rule akin to that afforded in greenan ernst,third,is allied fraudulent inducement claim barred because the statements made by usx prior to formalizing the settlement agreement pertain to future promises and thus are not actionable under a theory of fraudulent inducement 
following the pennsylvania supreme court decision in nocito,the district court held that to maintain an action for fraud based on the settlement agreement,allied must either elect to disaffirm the contract and offer to return the consideration for the release or to affirm the voidable contract and waive the fraud.nocito,at.allied did not return the consideration.the district court therefore considered allied failure to tender all consideration it received under the settlement agreement an affirmation of the contract and a waiver of its fraudulent inducement claim.we agree.
allied argues,however,that the rule set out in nocito was sharpened by the pennsylvania supreme court four years later in tilghman dollenberg.regarding the allegedly fraudulent sale of stocks,tilghman stated 
a party who has been induced by fraud to purchase stock may,if he does so promptly,rescind the contract and sue for the entire purchase price of the stock.where,however,as is in the instant case,the plaintiff does not rescind the contract but elects to stand on it,he may not recover the entire purchase price,but only the difference between the real value of the property purchased at the time of the sale and what was paid for it the affirmance of a contract induced by fraud of the seller does not extinguish the right of the purchaser,and is not a waiver of the fraud,nor does it bar the right of the purchaser to recover damages for the fraud.
at,at.according to this more recent ruling by pennsylvania highest court,allied argues that affirmation of a contract only bars a party from rescinding the contract and does not preclude it from pursuing its allegation of fraud.although this interpretation appears to be at odds with nocito,allied claims it merely clarifies the rule by distinguishing attempts to rescind fraudulent contracts from attempts to enforce them.allied argues that because it does not seek to rescind the settlement agreement,it has not waived its fraudulent inducement claim by failing to return the consideration it received.we are not convinced.
as tilghman indicates,a party can affirm a contract over a period of time without waiving a claim to fraudulent inducement.the affirmance will,however,bar rescission of the contract.see emery third bank of pittsburgh,an affirmance of the contract by the vendee,with such knowledge,merely extinguishes his right to rescind the sale.his other remedies remain unimpaired.the vendor can never complain that the vendee has not rescinded.miller central trust savings,affirmance of the contract is not a waiver of the fraud nor does it bar the right to recover it does bar a subsequent rescission.
not rescinding a contract and failing to return consideration are distinct legal matters from the affirmance issue addressed in tilghman,and,as nocito indicates,failing to return consideration does waive the right to pursue a fraudulent inducement claim.thus,a party can affirm a contract and perform according to its terms for a period of time,but once fraudulent inducement is alleged the party must either return consideration or abandon the claim.see dempsey associated aviation underwriters,aff,cir hess evans,stating that plaintiffs can not proceed in this matter by alleging that the release was obtained as the result of fraud and misrepresentation and at the same time retain the consideration that was paid to them.allied attempts to conflate the permission tilghman grants to parties to pursue fraudulent inducement claims even if they have at some point affirmed the contract with the distinct proposition that a party needs only to return consideration if it wishes to rescind the contract through the fraudulent inducement claim.affirming a contract at some point in its history is not the equivalent of not seeking to rescind a contract in light of a fraudulent inducement claim.
alternatively,allied claims that if parties are required to return consideration in order to bring fraudulent inducement claims,then it is entitled to an exception under greenan ernst.the greenan court allowed a party in an insecure financial condition to retain the consideration while maintaining a claim for fraudulent inducement.there is a considerable difference,the greenan court wrote,between cases seeking to set aside a conveyance of real estate or the sale of a business and the present case in which plaintiff seeks an accounting which may find the defendant owing her additional funds.at,at.greenan,therefore,provides a rare exception in an equitable proceeding where the refund of consideration was merely a matter of accounting.
the district court refused allied request for two reasons.first,allied failed to demonstrate that it was in an insecure financial condition.second,the district court considered the situation in greenan,where returning consideration would prohibit the plaintiff from maintaining herself and pursuing an action,to be distinct from allied predicament.we agree with the district court.although allied arguments reasonably demonstrate that returning consideration would be difficult and perhaps imprudent,it would not leave allied in the insecure financial condition required by greenan.we are bound by pennsylvania law,and although returning consideration may cause allied a substantial difficulty,it has not established that it would cause it to fall into an insecure financial condition.
in conclusion,the district court properly granted usx motion for summary judgment on allied fraudulent inducement claim.thus,we need not reach usx argument that allied fraudulent inducement claim is barred because the statements made by usx before formalizing the settlement agreement pertain to future promises.in the event allied does return consideration and continues to press its fraudulent inducement claim,the district court will address usx contention.
c.the saxonburg claim 
section iv of the settlement agreement states,in part,that the dismantling specification will not include the provision for any environmental remediation including any remediation removal of asbestos by allied,it being understood and agreed that any environmental remediation shall be for usx account the terms governing the dismantling of the saxonburg plant specifically provide that if during the course of the demolition project an environmental condition is discovered that requires remediation,other than asbestos,then the purchaser shall be responsible for any necessary remediation.
allied argues that any handling of the sinter dust should be considered a form of environmental remediation.although usx paid allied to load and haul the dust,allied argues that it should be paid for the distinct service of vacuuming,cleaning,and otherwise removing the dust from the materials at the plant.allied thus seeks to recover the additional unanticipated costs it incurred in remediating the saxonburg facility of this sinter dust allied argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment against it on this claim because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether allied performed environmental remediation beyond the loading and hauling for which it was paid.we agree.
as we have held,the fundamental object in interpreting a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties.compass,tseng,cir see also fineman armstrong world,cir stating that the task of the court must be to interpret the language of the settlement agreement in accordance with the intention of the parties
