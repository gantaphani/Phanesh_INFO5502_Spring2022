this appeal comes to this court on petition from the sara lee bakery group,and its wholly owned subsidiary,the earthgrains company the company seeking review of an order of the national labor relations board the board issued against the company.the board has also filed a,seeking enforcement of its order.we grant the company petition for review,and enforce the board order in part and deny in part.
factual and procedural background 
the sara lee bakery group,operates approximately fifty bakeries across the united states,including one located in owensboro,kentucky,belonging to its wholly owned subsidiary,the earthgrains company at all times relevant for this appeal,the owensboro bakery used two types of drivers to deliver its product route sales drivers who drove baked goods to retail establishments or transport drivers who drove trucks and transported baked goods to other bakeries and depots owned by sara lee.chauffeurs,teamsters,and helpers local union the union has served as the representative for both the route sales and transport drivers larry murray was the union business agent responsible for contract enforcement at the facility while billy ballard was the drivers steward.the union negotiated a collective bargaining agreement cba that was in effect from may,to may,which provided,inter alia,a grievance procedure culminating in arbitration.
sara lee also operates a bakery in london,kentucky,approximately miles southeast of owensboro.the transport drivers at the london bakery are employed by an unaffiliated company,worldwide logistics worldwide.the worldwide drivers are not members of the owensboro bargaining unit and are not represented by the union in this case.
in,the general manager of the london bakery,william baird implemented a system for the owensboro and london bakeries to deliver products to each other.under this system,transport drivers from london and owensboro would meet at the louisville,kentucky depot,unhook and trade their trailers,and then return to their respective bakeries with the necessary product.served as a felicitous means of streamlining the delivery process it was also convenient because at the time the system was implemented,both bakeries were already servicing the louisville depot.before the system was implemented,the exclusive method for delivering product between london and owensboro was via a transport driver who originated in london the transport driver would deliver product by making a direct run from london to owensboro.on the return trip,the driver would backhaul products to the london bakery.it is undisputed that the owensboro transport drivers have never directly delivered product to the london bakery.
while there was a period in where there was no truck making the direct run,eventually scheduling problems and market changes required of direct runs between the two bakeries.specifically,the company introduced a new cottage loaf bread product that was only baked in london,and as a result five days a week a london transport driver needed to make a run to owensboro.additionally,there were occasions when the owensboro bakery would not meet the output requirement by the time the transport driver had to leave to at louisville.in those situations,london drivers would backhaul the product to the london bakery.the amount of backhauling increased substantially during the summer of,when the company introduced another new product,wholegrain white bread,that was only baked at owensboro and had to be delivered to the london bakery.
throughout this time,murray,ballard,and other union officials complained to the company about its backhauling practice.finally,on july,the union filed a grievance on the matter.the grievance cited an incident that had happened a few days earlier when a worldwide driver accidently drove a trailer from owensboro to london that was supposed to have been driven by an owensboro transport driver to louisville.that incident violated specific provisions of the cba.on august,the parties met to discuss the grievance and the company backhauling policy more generally.baird informed murray and ballard that the direct london to owensboro run would end soon,thus significantly limiting the amount of backhauling that would occur the company also stated that it,nevertheless,had the right to backhaul products under the terms of the cba.
despite this meeting,the union continued to have concerns about backhauling,and accordingly filed another grievance on september.the parties met again on october,and baird explained that the practice of backhauling was being curtailed and would end completely once the owensboro bakery gained certification to produce additional products.at this meeting,murray presented baird with a written request for information regarding worldwide,based on the union belief that the company had misled it about the extent of its backhauling practice.murray requested that the company provide the following information 
the name,address,and phone number of the subcontracting company worldwide paragraph one 
the number of baskets hauled in to date by that entity,stating the date and amount hauled for each date paragraph two 
the price paid to the entity for the loads and the total amount paid to date paragraph three 
the total miles to date driven by each driver performing subcontracting work,for each day performed paragraph four 
copies of any letters of agreement,contracts,or anything else reflecting the agreement between the company and the subcontractor paragraph five.
the letter also stated that baird should further consider this our demand to bargain on this new round of subcontracting work.
after this meeting,murray wrote a letter to the company advising it that the union was advancing its grievance to arbitration.the company responded to the union information request six weeks later on november.in its response,the company denied that the union had lost any work due to the backhauling,highlighting that the company had actually hired an additional owensboro transport driver during the relevant period.the company also declined to provide the requested information.on november,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the board alleging,inter alia,that the company violated sections a and of the national labor relations act the act a,by failing to provide information sought by the union.in response,the company argued that the information sought by the union is irrelevant to the grievances,and that the company did not have records which specified the amount of product moved from the owensboro plant via backhaul by london trucks 
on february,the company supplemented its response to the union request for information.in this response,the company provided the information requested in paragraph one of the union original request,but refused to provide any other information.the company disputed the union categorization of the backhauling practice as subcontracting,and maintained that the act of backhauling,which had been a longstanding practice,did not violate the cba.further,the company explained that it could not provide the requested mileage data since it does not keep that information the company also stated that the union request for cost and contract information had no bearing on any legitimate union interest.
two weeks later,the regional director of the board filed a complaint and a notice of hearing,alleging that the company had unreasonably delayed its response to the information requested in paragraph one,and that the company had unlawfully refused to provide the other information sought by the union.in its answer,the company denied the material allegations and asserted the defenses of confidentiality and waiver by the union.the administrative law judge alj rejected the company defenses,and concluded that the company had violated sections a and of the act because it failed to provide relevant information requested by the union,and it unreasonably delayed providing other relevant information requested by the union.the alj ordered the company to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively with the union,and ordered it to provide the union with the information that was requested in paragraphs two,three,four,and five.the company was also ordered to make a reasonable effort to secure any unavailable information,and if such information remained unavailable,it was required to explain and document the reasons for its unavailability the company filed exceptions to the judge decision,but a three member panel of the board affirmed the alj rulings,findings,and conclusions,and adopted the recommended order.the company filed a petition for review before this court on march,the board filed a for enforcement of its order on march.
ii.standard of review 
we review the board factual findings under a substantial evidence standard.selkirk metalbestos,north,eljer,nlrb,cir.the supreme court has defined substantial evidence as more than a scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion.id.internal citation omitted.we review the nlrb legal conclusions de novo however if the nlrb gives a reasonably defensible construction of a statute,we will affirm that decision.asarco,nlrb,cir.in agreement with other circuits,we have explained that the nlrb determination of the relevance of the information sought in a particular case must be given great weight by the courts,if only because it is a finding on a mixed question of law and fact which is within the particular expertise of the board.nlrb brazos power,cir see also nlrb champion,cir.
iii.discussion 
uncontested findings 
the board first contends that before this court,the company has only contested the following portions of the its order that it produce the number of baskets backhauled by worldwide drivers paragraph two,that the company produce its contract with worldwide paragraph five,and that it produce the costs associated with that contract paragraph three.therefore,the board seeks summary enforcement of the two findings that the company has not challenged on appeal that the company unreasonably delayed providing worldwide contact information paragraph one,and that it must produce the total number of miles driven by worldwide drivers paragraph four.
case law has established that when an employer does not challenge a finding of the board,the unchallenged issue is waived on appeal,entitling the board to summary enforcement.see nlrb brookshire grocery,cir montgomery ward nlrb,cir.similarly,the sixth circuit has explained that a n employer failure to address or take issue with the board findings and conclusions with regard to violations of the act effectively results in abandonment of the right to object to those determinations.nlrb talsol,cir.here,the company has never,in its briefs or during oral argument,taken issue with the board findings regarding paragraphs one and four.since the company has wholly failed to contest these findings,the board is entitled to summary enforcement.see id.at.
unavailable information 
the board next argues that the company failed to show that information relating to the number of baskets hauled in by worldwide drivers paragraph two is unavailable.it argues that the company only engaged in a cursory search for the information,and it did not conduct a reasonable inquiry to determine whether the information is available from other,obvious sources,such as its parent company,its sister bakeries,or worldwide itself.in response,the company argues that it can not be held liable for violating sections a and of the act for failing to provide information it does not have.it explains that it does not keep records reflecting the data the union sought in paragraph two,and even though that data could be extrapolated from its load and transport sheets,it destroys those documents after seven days.
case law has consistently held that an employer can not be held liable under the act for failing to produce information it does not have.see vanguard fire supply,enforced,cir see also in re kathleen bakeshop,llc,enforced,wl cir explaining than an employer can not be expected to provide information that it does not have.but employers do have an obligation to make reasonable efforts to secure any unavailable information.congreso de uniones industriales de puerto rico nlrb,cir writing that an employer duty to supply relevant information also extends to situations where the information is not in the employer possession,but where the information can likely be obtained from a third party with whom the employer has a business relationship that is directly implicated in the alleged breach of the agreement.
after reviewing the record,we find the company arguments unavailing.even though it is unquestionable that the company did not keep records about the amount of product that was backhauled from owensboro by worldwide drivers,we agree with the alj finding that the company utterly failed to conduct a good faith inquiry to determine whether the information was available from any other sources.while the company responded that such attempts would be futile,it does not seem implausible that some other source,particularly worldwide,may in fact have some information that could provide insight on how much product was backhauled from owensboro to london.it may very well be that such information simply no longer exists,but the company is required to show that it could not obtain the requested information from other sources.
contract and cost information 
finally,the board contends that substantial evidence supports its decision that the company is obligated under the act to turn over the remaining information requested by the union,specifically its contract with worldwide paragraph five and the costs associated with that contract paragraph three.without that information,the board argues,the union is unable to effectively police the cba,decide whether to pursue and arbitrate potential grievances,and decide whether to bargain over subcontracting work.the company asserts that not only did the union fail to articulate a purpose for why it was seeking this information,but also that the board erroneously concluded that the company contracting cost and contract with worldwide is relevant to the underlying dispute.according to the company,the underlying grievance it has with the union involves whether the practice of backhauling violates the cba,and the company contracting cost and contract with worldwide are irrelevant to that ultimate determination.
section a of the act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees.a.an employer is obligated to furnish,upon request,information that is relevant and necessary to the union performance of its duties as the employees bargaining representative,including information concerning contract administration,negotiations,and grievance processing.nlrb acme indus,d the duty to bargain unquestionably extends beyond the period of contract negotiations and applies to relations during the terms of an agreement detroit edison nlrb,d.the key question in determining whether information must be produced is one of relevance.emeryville research ctr.nlrb,cir.while a union request for bargaining unit data,such as wage and benefit information,is considered presumptively relevant,when a union requests unit data,such as subcontracting costs,that information is not considered presumptively relevant.nlrb leonard hebert,cir,cert.denied,d.rather,the union has the initial burden of establishing relevancy before the employer must comply with the information request.id.the supreme court has adopted a liberal,standard by which relevancy of requested information is to be judged.id.citing acme indus,at.in acme,the court explained the union need only be acting upon the probability that the desired information was relevant and that it would be of use to the union in carrying out its statutory duties and responsibilities.at.
case law also explains that in order for a union to prove that an employer has violated sections a and the union is required to make two showings before the alj.first,the union must show,at the time of the information request,that it articulated a legitimate purpose for seeking the information.motor lines,nlrb,cir.second,the union has to sh
