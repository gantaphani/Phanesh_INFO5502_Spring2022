the main question raised by this appeal is when borrowers may seek a remedy after their creditors violate the repossession notice requirements in maryland credit grantor closed end credit provisions clec,com.law et.because we conclude that clec requires borrowers to have repaid more than the original principal amount of their loans before they are entitled to relief,we affirm.
gladys gardner and randolph scott each entered into a retail installment sale contract with gmac,now ally financial,or its subsidiary,respectively,to finance the purchase of a car.both contracts were forms drafted by gmac that designated clec as the applicable law.relevant to this appeal,clec establishes rules,including notice requirements,for creditors that repossess tangible personal property securing a loan after the borrower defaults on that loan,com.law.creditors who violate clec may collect only the principal amount of the loan and may not collect any interest,costs,fees,or other charges with respect to the loan.id.a.
after making some payments,gardner and scott defaulted on their loans and gmac repossessed their cars.gmac sent the borrowers notices that the cars would be sold at public sales.gmac sold them for less than the amount owed under the contracts and issued notices explaining that deficiency.
gardner and scott filed separate class action complaints against gmac,alleging counts for clec violations breach of contract declaratory and injunctive relief enrichment and violation of maryland consumer protection act,com.law et.the complaints allege that gmac notices mischaracterized the sales as public,when in fact they were private,due to a refundable cash entrance fee required to view the sale.they further contend that,because of that mischaracterization,gmac notices lacked certain statutorily required disclosures for private sales.see,com.law j.
the district court found that the sales were public and granted summary judgment to gmac on that basis.on appeal,we certified the question to the court of appeals of maryland,which held that the sales were private.gardner ally fin.we therefore reversed the district court judgment and remanded the cases.gardner ally fin,app x,cir.
on remand,the district court again granted summary judgment to gmac.this time,the court reasoned that neither gardner nor scott had sustained any damages under clec because,based on this court decision in bediako american honda finance,app x cir,an unpaid principal balance remained on their loans and gmac had,in a binding judicial admission,abandoned any claim for deficiency judgments against them.scott.nuvell fin,nos.jfm,jfm,wl,at.gardner and scott appeal,contending that those rulings are in error and raising other issues.we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment.triton marine fuels,pacific chukotka,cir.
two clec provisions are at issue in this appeal.first,clec civil remedies section provides,except for a bona fide error of computation,if a credit grantor violates any provision of this subtitle the credit grantor may collect only the principal amount of the loan and may not collect any interest,costs,fees,or other charges with respect to the loan,com.law a.second,clec repossession section states,if the provisions of this section,including the requirement of furnishing a notice following repossession,are not followed,the credit grantor shall not be entitled to any deficiency judgment to which he would be entitled under the loan agreement.id.k.
we have previously interpreted section a plain language as limiting a debtor relief under clec to any amounts paid in excess of the principal amount of the loan.bediako,app x at.we have also explained that,unlike statutes such as the federal fair debt collection practices act,clec does not establish a fixed statutory damages award.id.to add an example from maryland,a statute prohibiting unwanted commercial email provides for damages in an amount equal to the greater of or the recipient actual damages,com.law emphasis added.the absence of a parallel provision in clec is telling.
gardner and scott do not say that bediako was wrongly decided they instead attempt to distinguish it by claiming that the creditor in bediako fully complied with clec.but our holding in bediako was premised on the assumption that the creditor violated clec e ven if bediako has adequately alleged a violation of clec notice provisions,she is unable to state a claim because she has suffered no actual damages that are compensable under clec.app x at emphasis added.turning that assumption into an actual violation does not alter the damages analysis.
because gardner and scott have given us no good reason to depart from bediako,we will follow it and like the borrower there,the borrowers here have not paid anything in excess of the principal.in bediako,we recharacterized all of the borrower payments during the life of the loan as payments toward principal and then subtracted that total and the sale proceeds from the original principal amount of the loan.id.at.applying that same calculation,gardner and scott each still owe roughly in principal on their loans.
despite the fact that neither gardner nor scott has paid anything in excess of the principal,they nonetheless insist that they are entitled under clec to a refund of the funds they claim gmac collected after repossessing their and their payments to gmac during the life of their loans to cover interest,costs,fees,or other charges.that is not correct.
gardner and scott build their first argument on a misreading of two cases from the court of appeals of maryland.they say that gmac is now limited to the proceeds of the sale as satisfaction of the debt because it violated clec.appellants br.at quoting gardner,at,and citing patton wells fargo fin.but the full sentence from gardner gives important context if the debtor can show that the creditor failed to abide by the requirements of clec in selling the collateral,the creditor may be barred from a deficiency judgment and limited to the proceeds of the sale as satisfaction of the debt.at emphasis added.contrary to gardner and scott view,the court was merely acknowledging the practical reality that a creditor who violates clec will likely be unable to collect anything beyond the proceeds of the sale because clec bars violators from obtaining a deficiency judgment.nowhere does the court opinion or clec itself say that creditors who violate clec can not try to collect the deficiency by means other than a judgment,or apply toward the outstanding principal any funds they receive after the repossession sale.
gardner and scott would have us read judgment out of section k and ignore the fact that section a expressly permits creditors who violate clec to collect the principal amount of the loan.we decline to do so.see mid atlantic power supply ass pub.serv.comm of,a d,it long has been the law of maryland and well settled,that statutes are to be read to give meaning to every word used and to do otherwise contravenes this cardinal rule of statutory construction.kaczorowski mayor city council of,s tatutes dealing with the same subject matter should,when possible,be read together and harmonized.
as to the second refund claim,gardner and scott argument relies solely on a decision by the commissioner of financial regulation interpreting maryland mortgage law.comm r of fin.regulation ward,no.cfr,aff,no.c.similar to clec section a,violators of the maryland mortgage lender law may collect only the principal amount of the loan and may not collect any interest,costs,finder fees,broker fees,or other charges with respect to the loan,fin.inst.b.gardner and scott posit that because the commissioner in ward awarded a reimbursement of all amounts collected other than principal,clec commands the same result.
we are unpersuaded.ward is easily distinguishable.the lender there violated maryland mortgage law at the time the loan was originated by operating without a license.ward,no.cfr,at.as a result,the lender collected the reimbursed interest,after the violation.here,by contrast,gmac collection of interest,occurred before any violation.this difference in timing renders ward inapposite
