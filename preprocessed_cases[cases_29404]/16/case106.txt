this is a dispute between a group of union employees over certain banked hour benefits which their union pension trust wants to eliminate,and the trust,which is in distress and trying to find sources of funding to meet its obligations to its larger group of plan participants.the trustees agreed not to impose the cuts until a court had finally determined whether these cuts,effectuated through plan amendment nine,violated the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,which protects accrued benefits against reduction by amendment.id.g.
this case raises a question of first impression in this circuit as to whether a retroactively conferred benefit during the course of employment constitutes a benefit attributable to service and so an accrued benefit for purposes of erisa rule.on for summary judgment,the district court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs.while the trustees arguments to the contrary are far from frivolous,we find the plaintiffs benefits are in fact accrued and that amendment nine would violate the provisions.we affirm the district court on this basis.
the plumbers and pipefitters local union the union is a labor organization situated in east providence,rhode island.the union represents pipefitters and plumbers in rhode island and southeast massachusetts.the union came to be on september,through the merger of four former local unions.after the merger,the local unions employee benefits plans and related plans and funds also merged.the result was the plumbers and pipefitters local union pension plan post merger plan,dated september.this is the plan which concerns us.the plans no longer exist.
among the pension benefits promised under both the post merger plans were banked hour benefits.banked hours are hours of service worked in covered employment or otherwise accrued by plan participants within a given year in excess of the minimum number of hours required to earn a full year of service for pension credit under the applicable plan.such hours are banked for a variety of uses,including filling in of hours of service for years in which the participant fell short of the minimum required for a full year of credit and cash ing in as additional pension credits upon retirement.
one problem the post merger plan had to deal with was that the banked hour provisions were different in each of the four plans.indeed,the provisions contained in the various plan documents had different accrual,use,and value of banked hours.for example,under the plans,the minimum number of hours of service needed for the receipt of a full year of pension credit ranged from in one plan to hours in another.the post merger plan document eliminated those variations and chose to use as to each banked hour provision among the most generous benefit terms from the earlier provisions.for example,under the post merger plan,the minimum number of hours of service required for the receipt of a full year of pension credit was only hours for all participants the post merger plan document more generous banked hour provisions had both prospective and retrospective effect.as a result,a number of plan participants,the plaintiffs among them,received retrospectively increased levels of banked hour pension credits and increased pension benefit levels immediately after the merger pursuant to those more generous provisions.this case involves only those retrospective benefits.
over the past several years,the trust has experienced funding deficiencies caused by a number of factors,including stock market fluctuations and decreased pension contributions resulting from unemployment and lack of work opportunities for plan participants the trustees explored and adopted various measures intended to improve the plan financial health 
in august,after discussions with the plan actuarial consultant,the trustees voted upon and enacted amendment nine to the post merger plan document.amendment nine purports to reduce plan participants retrospective banked hour pension benefits for hours accumulated prior to september,the date of the post merger plan,back to the lower levels promised under plan participants respective plan document.the trustees say amendment nine would reduce the plan liability by several million dollars.on or about october,the trustees sent a notice to all participants in the post merger plan alerting them to the retroactive benefit reductions that would result from amendment nine.
on november,the plaintiffs filed this action against the trustees in the district of rhode island.the plaintiffs alleged that the implementation of amendment nine would conflict with erisa rule,which prohibits the decrease by amendment of any accrued benefit of a participant in an erisa plan.g.the plaintiffs maintained that all of their,banked hour benefits,whether prospective from september or retrospective,had accrued.they relied on,which defines the term accrued benefit for purposes of erisa.the trustees agreed to suspend the implementation of amendment nine pending the result of this action.
on april,the district court orally granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied the trustees for summary judgment.the district court held that the plaintiffs,banked hour benefits did constitute accrued benefits under erisa.the district court noted that,at the time of the merger and the bestowing of uniform banked hour benefits in the plan,the plaintiffs were active employees as opposed to retirees.the plan was also unchanged at their retirement date.indeed,they had received the very benefits after retirement that the trustees now seek to cut.as such,the district court reasoned,w hen the plaintiffs retired,their expectations of receiving the benefits in the post merger plan were justified.on this basis,the district court concluded that the implementation of amendment nine would result in the decrease by amendment of the plaintiffs accrued benefits in violation of g.
on appeal,the trustees argue that the district court erred in holding that the plaintiffs,banked hour retrospective benefits are accrued benefits under erisa.

the trustees core argument is that the plaintiffs did not earn these retrospective benefits by working the retrospective benefits were a gratuity resulting from a prior merger of benefit plans the term earned appears nowhere in the statute,although it does in some case law as a shorthand term and we do not adopt it as a substitute term for the statutory language.the trustees argue,based on the concept of earned benefits,that the plaintiffs,banked hour benefits were conferred retroactively,and that retroactively conferred benefits are unearned gratuities and as a result can not accrue.we disagree.the trustees position is not irrational as a matter of policy,but congress chose otherwise.the trustees position has no basis in the statutory text.
the trustees position is that in order for a benefit to accrue under section g,the promise of the relevant benefit must necessarily predate the service to which that benefit corresponds.the trustees argue that an employee can only earn a benefit through service if she has been promised that benefit in advance.this is based on the reasoning that any benefit not promised beforehand is by definition unexpected,and that any unexpected benefit constitutes a mere gratuity.in other words,according to the trustees,a benefit can only be earned through service if the promise of a benefit could have provided incentives to perform that service.erisa does require that the promise of a benefit provide incentives to continue employment in order for that benefit to accrue.but that condition is satisfied here.
section g explains that the rule applies only to benefits attributable to service prior to the amendment at issue.g.and in this sense,accrued benefits are contrasted with mere gratuit ies.bd.of trs.of sheet metal workers pension fund comm r,cir.in addition,contrasted with other statutory language the restriction on benefits attributable to service means that accrued benefits must be attributable to service already performed.see cinotto delta air lines,cir observing the distinction between accrued benefits and anticipated benefits based on future years of service.here,however,the plaintiffs,banked hour benefits are clearly attributable to the plaintiffs,service.that those benefits were conferred retroactively does not defeat that point.
other than through section g,the text of erisa provides few clues as to the interpretation of accrued benefit.section of title defines accrued benefit as follows 
the term accrued benefit means 
a in the case of a defined benefit plan,the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan and,except as provided in section c of this title,expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,or 
b in the case of a plan which is an individual account plan,the balance of the individual account.
the accrued benefit of an employee shall not be less than the amount determined under section c b of this title with respect to the employee accumulated contribution.
accord a a.because the post merger plan is a defined benefit plan,most relevant here is section a.under that provision,an accrued benefit is the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan and expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.a.as the supreme court has observed,section a rather circular definition provides little guidance.cent.laborers pension fund,at.indeed,t he only apparent textual limit is that an accrued benefit must be expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.bd.of trustees of sheet metal workers pension fund,at discussing the parallel provision in the internal revenue code.the parties agree that limit is satisfied in this case.apart from that limit,section a appears to be nothing more than a signpost directing us to look to the terms of the plan at issue.id.at 
section does explain that t he accrued benefit of an employee shall not be less than the amount determined under section c b of this title with respect to the employee accumulated contribution.accord.a d.for present purposes,the substance of this requirement is of no matter.what is relevant is the provision use of the term employee as well as its tethering of accrued benefits to the employee accumulated contribution.there is no doubt that the plaintiffs were employees at the time they were promised the benefits this benefit scheme also applied at the time they retired 
section of title defines employee as any individual employed by an employer.under erisa,an employee thus contrasts with a participant.participant is in turn defined by section as 
any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
that there is a relevant distinction between employees and mere participants as to accrual is reinforced by the contrasting language of section g.under that provision,t he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.g emphasis added accord d.section g refers to participant s rather than employee s for good reason if erisa purpose is to mak e sure that a worker actually receive s the defined pension benefit promised to her upon retirement,nachman pension benefit guaranty,it would be nonsensical for protection to cease the moment employment ends and retirement begins.
taken together,sections and g outline the following scheme a retirement benefit may be accrued only by an employee,but,once accrued,the benefit is protected from diminution as long as the individual who accrued the benefit is a participant in the plan,whether as an employee or as a retiree.thornton,at discussing parallel internal revenue code provisions quoting bd.of trs.of the sheet metal workers pension fund comm r.under this scheme,a promised benefit must provide incentives for future employment in order for that benefit to accrue,just in the sense that the promise of a benefit must predate an individual retirement or termination.see,williams rohm haase pension plan,cir holding that cost of living adjustment cola was an accrued benefit where promise of cola predated plaintiffs retirement bd.of trs.of sheet metal workers pension fund comm r,cir holding that cola was a gratuitous benefit where promise of cola postdated plaintiffs retirement.once an individual continues employment in exchange for a promised benefit,that is enough,other things being the same,to generate the sort of justified expectation the rule is designed to protect.cent.laborers pension fund,at.
we sum up.the trustees properly concede that under the terms of the post merger plan prior to amendment nine,the plaintiffs,service entitles them to at least their prospective banked hour benefits.the trustees concede further that the plaintiffs were employee s under the post merger plan when that plan went into effect.finally,the trustees concede that the plaintiffs are still plan participant s.we conclude that the plaintiffs,banked hour benefits,prospective and retrospective,are accrued benefits for purposes of section g and,so,that amendment nine is inconsistent with the requirements of erisa rule.the trustees real argument is that the plaintiffs did not earn their retrospective banked hour benefits that they were a gift of sorts.but erisa rule does not ask whether benefits were earned.rather,it asks whether benefits have accrued.we decline the trustees invitation to amend the statute.
the district court is affirmed.
this benefit provision was subsequently amended and prospectively reduced.that amendment is not at issue here.
in and again in the post merger plan was declared to be in critical status under the pension protection act of ppa,stat.the trustees do not argue that either the fact that the plan was in critical status under ppa or the fact that they were required as a result to formulate a rehabilitation plan in any way alters the law on the rule does permit the decrease by amendment of accrued benefits in cases where a plan faces a substantial business hardship,d,and in cases involving terminated plans,id.neither exception applies here.
should the post merger plan ultimately become insolvent,the federal pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc,which insures pension plans such as this one,will be required to intervene.see sun capital partners iii,lp new eng.teamsters trucking indus.pension fund,cir.
we have no reason to reach an argument made by the plaintiffs that the initial provision of benefits to them upon retirement somehow estops the trustees from denying the benefits were accrued.
the parties agree that amendment nine would result in the decrease of the plaintiffs retrospective,banked hour benefits under their erisa plan.
