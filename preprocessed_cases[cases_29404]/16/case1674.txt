cytec industries cytec closed its ammonia unit in june.cytec and its union agreed on the of employees after the closing based on the collective bargaining agreement cba and seniority rights.in july,the final bumping sheet was posted by cytec on bulletin boards at the relevant facility.david lee,kevin dugas,wayne carbo,cesha johnson,and christopher victoriano sued on november,alleging breach of contract claims against cytec,breach of fair representation claims against the union,and several other claims based on their displacement recall rights.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.we affirm.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that the statute of limitations in a hybrid section lawsuit starts to run when the employees knew or should have known of the union breach plaintiffs contend instead that the statute runs from when they knew or should have known that the union would no longer process their grievances.this oversimplification of the district court decisions is misleading.
that court did note,with respect to plaintiffs displacement claims,that under the law of this circuit,limitations started running when plaintiffs knew or should have known of the union breach of their rights,namely with the publication of the july bumping orders according to which plaintiffs were to be displaced,an event akin to the adoption of a new seniority system but the court acknowledged,with respect to claims arising in the context,such as the claim challenging the adoption of the bumping sheet as opposed to claims challenging how the union processed a particular grievance,courts have held that the statute was equitably tolled for the duration of the grievance proceedings until the employees knew or should have known that the union would no longer process their grievances.see adkins int l union of,radio machine workers,cir holding that the employees attempt to exhaust their internal contractual remedies through the grievance process will prevent the accrual of their action 
the district court observed,however,that those cases are distinguishable because they involved situations in which a grievance was filed with the union within six months of the breach of the cba.the court held that these cases are inapplicable here,because plaintiffs have not filed grievances with the union regarding their displacements within six months of july,when the violation of the cba occurred.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred,nonetheless,because for tolling to apply,there is no requirement that a grievance must be filed with the union within six months of the breach.the courts are split on the issue,however,and this appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit 
we agree with the district court and the other courts that have held that to invoke equitable tolling,an employee must file a grievance with the union within six months of the adoption of a new seniority system.equitable tolling is an exception to the general rule that an employee has six months to sue from the discovery of the breach of the duty of fair representation.the rationale for it is that because some plaintiffs must exhaust internal contractual remedies the grievance process before suing,it would be unfair to say that the plaintiffs claim is barred by limitations if,while the grievance is pending,the federal statute of limitations expires we conclude,however,that this exception to the general accrual rule could not confer more rights than those that plaintiffs would have if they were not entitled to this exception,that is if plaintiffs did not have to exhaust internal remedies.
in other words,plaintiffs can not wait until the statute of limitations for a federal lawsuit has passed and then file a grievance to circumvent the applicable statute.this is especially so given that the limitations period under federal law is an extension of the time period provided by many state statutes 
furthermore,because federal law favors early resolution of labor disputes,delcostello int l of teamsters,d,tolling is applicable only for a good faith attempt to pursue remedies,adkins,at t he employees attempt to exhaust their contractual remedies will prevent the accrual of their action.here,the lack of good faith is demonstrated by the fact that the grievance was not filed within the period required by the cba but even if the cba allowed eight months to file such a grievance,a plaintiff who waits until the seventh month to bring such a grievance waives his right to the federal action,which must be brought within six months.
we also reject plaintiffs contention that events that occurred after june changed the announced displacements and the limitations period.as the district court explained,there is no evidence that plaintiffs were told in june that the announced displacements were tentative.to the extent that a claim for the failure to account for resignations in the implementation of the bumping sheet did accrue later,that claim fails because it does not represent a breach of the duty of fair representation,as we will explain in part,infra.
with respect to the recall claims,the district court found that only johnson and victoriano were not barred by the statute of limitations.it held that plaintiff carbo recall claim was barred by limitations because he did not sue within six months of november,when he received notice that his grievance was denied thus he knew or should have known that the union would not take any further action on his grievance without some action on his part.plaintiffs challenge the finding that carbo claim was untimely,arguing that the union had notice of his claim.we do not see how this affects in any way the fact that under the law,carbo had to sue within six months of the time it became obvious that the union had rejected his claim.
plaintiffs also urge that the union could not have rejected carbo claim without a vote of the membership.but,once a grievance is rejected at an early stage,the grievant must that issue for it to reach a vote of the membership.as the district court indicated,there was no evidence that carbo attempted to reach the voting stage on his own after november.therefore,the district court correctly held that carbo recall claim was barred because he did not sue within six months of november.
the court also found that lee recall claims were barred because he did not sue within six months of december,when wade gilbeau the group chairman told him that a grievance already in existence would not benefit lee.plaintiffs claim nonetheless that this grievance does benefit lee.
but,if the grievance benefits lee,and is currently in arbitration,then lee can not file this lawsuit until the arbitration ends,because he is not complaining about the arbitration proceedings.only if the grievance does not benefit him can lee claim a breach of the duty of fair representation,but in that case,he is barred by limitations,as found by the district court.carbo claim about grievance fails for the same reasons.
plaintiffs dispute the district court finding that the union did not act arbitrarily or in a discriminatory or bad faith manner against johnson and victoriano.they had argued in the district court that the union breached its duty of fair representation by delaying processing their grievances.that court held that no breach had occurred,finding that such delay was common and that the union has taken steps to pursue plaintiffs grievances and will continue to do so.
plaintiffs aver that whether the delay was common is a disputed issue of material fact for the jury and that the district court weighed evidence and made impermissible credibility determinations.they insist the court erred in relying on gilbeau testimony that the delay was common and a result of the policy of giving priority to grievances over those that did not involve termination.they also claim that the record included evidence that contradicted gilbeau testimony.in support of the contradiction they cite only the fact that grievance reached a meeting in less than ten months.
this fact does not contradict gilbeau testimony.as the district court explained,the union asserted that t
