east texas medical center sued its insurer,lexington insurance company,for failure to cover a claim filed against it by a patient.a jury found for the medical center.the district court then granted lexington a judgment as a matter of law.the medical center appeals.for reasons we will explain,we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.
this case concerns lexington denial of the medical center claim for coverage under a liability insurance policy it purchased from lexington.the dispute centers on the notice and reporting requirements of the policy.the specific issue is whether the medical center properly gave notice of the claim and of a subsequent lawsuit to lexington.
a.the policy 
lexington issued a,million medical malpractice liability policy to the medical center.the policy period was from june,to june.the policy provided excess liability insurance coverage to the medical center,covering claims above a retention of million per claim.the medical center also purchased excess coverage policies from other insurers to cover claims exceeding the policy million coverage layer.
under the medical center arrangement with its insurers,the medical center was the first link in its risk management chain.the medical center had responsibility for processing claims and monitoring all incidents potentially giving rise to medical malpractice claims medical incidents.the medical center had discretion to resolve any claim within its million retention.if a lawsuit was filed on any claim,the medical center could retain counsel of its own choosing for its defense.when lexington was notified of a claim by the medical center,lexington had discretion to decide which claims it would investigate or otherwise pursue.
the pertinent parts of the policy in dispute relate to the medical center notice responsibilities.if the medical center wanted coverage,it was required to provide written notice to lexington of three different matters medical incidents,claims,and lawsuits.the issues at trial concerned notice of claim and notice of lawsuit.no questions have been raised about notice of a medical incident.
in addition to being required to give notice of claims and lawsuits,the medical center also had to provide relevant documents.it was to send immediately to lexington copies of any demands,notices,summonses,or legal papers received in connection with a claim or lawsuit.
b.the underlying claim 
in march,the medical center received a medical malpractice claim that was in the form of what is called a letter the claim was on behalf of david wayne cornelius.this is the claim that has generated the present lawsuit.the letter indicated that cornelius had suffered unspecified personal injuries at the medical center athens,texas facility.in april,the medical center entered information about the cornelius claim on a spreadsheet,which is referred to as a loss run.each loss run document that is in the record contains entries for about claimants.
a key dispute at trial was whether lexington accepted loss runs as claim notice.there was evidence that lexington acknowledged receipt of three other claims submitted on loss runs.lexington did not acknowledge receipt of the cornelius claim when it appeared on a loss run.the cornelius claim was included on three different loss runs provided to lexington before the policy period ended,each of which noted that there was a letter at the end of the policy period,the loss run remained the only notice given lexington.
c.the underlying lawsuit 
on may,cornelius mother filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on his behalf in state court against the medical center.the medical center assigned defense of the case to an attorney.the suit was timely answered on behalf of the medical center.less than two weeks later,on june,the policy period expired.at the time,the medical center did not consider the cornelius lawsuit to be one with a high risk of exposure,nor did it believe that its liability for the claim would exceed its retention or impact the lexington policy coverage layer and those of other excess insurers.
notice of claim and lawsuit 
following depositions in the cornelius lawsuit in december,the medical center realized for the first time that its liability for the lawsuit was likely to exceed the medical center million retention.
in january,very soon after the depositions but about seven months after both the lawsuit was filed and the policy period expired,the medical center first gave written notice of the cornelius lawsuit to lexington.it also sent copies of the claim and suit papers.later that month,lexington denied the claim,asserting that the medical center had failed to comply with the lexington policy notice provisions.
procedural history 
the medical center brought this lawsuit against lexington and other,alleging causes of action arising from lexington denial of its claim in connection with the cornelius lawsuit.the medical center claims against lexington included breach of contract,violation of the texas insurance code,and negligent misrepresentation.lexington,alleging breach of contract,asking for a declaration of noncoverage under the lexington policy,and seeking reimbursement for settlement of the underlying cornelius lawsuit.before this coverage suit was tried,the cornelius lawsuit was settled.
the parties proceeded to trial.before the case went to the jury,lexington abandoned its request for a declaratory judgment.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the medical center on all claims.awarded were approximately million in damages.lexington moved for a judgment as a matter of law.it asserted that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings on any of the claims.the district court granted the motion,rendering judgment in favor of lexington and against the medical center on all claims.

the medical center claims several defects in the grant of a jmol.first,though,we must address an argument that would moot all the medical center issues.this leads to a total of five issues to be decided in this appeal.to start,we consider lexington argument that loss runs are not a sufficient notice of claim under the policy.we end up not accepting that argument.
we therefore address four other arguments the policy does not require that lexington receive separate notice of a suit,if notice of a claim on the same incident had previously been given texas law requires lexington to demonstrate prejudice from any failure to provide notice of the suit,and further,lexington waived the claim of a failure to give notice the jury erred in finding that lexington waived its right to enforcement of another policy provision requiring the immediate forwarding of claim and suit papers and the district court improperly denied the medical center claims.
loss runs as notices of claims 
lexington argues that loss runs are,by their nature,insufficient to satisfy the policy requirement for a written notice of claim.therefore,as a legal matter,lexington had no notice of the underlying claim until seven months after the policy expired.
the point was contested and made into an issue for the jury.the jury was asked whether the medical center failed to provide lexington with written notice of the david cornelius claim as soon as possible.the jury answer was no.the district court upheld this portion of the verdict.
the loss runs offered in evidence were spreadsheets containing relatively scant information about multiple patients claims.as an excess insurer,lexington concerned itself with the total on the loss runs,in order to gauge,to a rough degree,how close the medical center was to its million limit.the loss run estimated the value of the cornelius claim at only.after the suit was filed,the medical center estimated its value to be in excess of.it would be unreasonable,it says,to interpret written notice of a claim to include a document so lacking in the relevant particulars as the loss run.those points are relevant,but they are not conclusive to the result.
the medical center relies on letters sent by lexington to the medical center regarding three unrelated claims that had been reported through loss runs.the first line of each letter from lexington states that the letter is an acknowledgment of receipt of the notice of claim on the above captioned patient.lexington suggests a distinction between acknowledging coverage and acknowledging receipt of information.according to lexington,the letters it sent did only the latter.no doubt there are distinctions between the two,but we are examining the policy provision requiring written notice of the claim or suit.lexington sent letters,in response to loss runs,acknowledging receipt of the notice of claim.a jury did not need to find that loss runs were accepted by lexington as written notices of claims,but these letters are evidence of that.
to be clear,we are not saying that lexington waived a provision of the policy and accepted less notice than that to which it was entitled.there is no language in the policy that limits written notice to a particular format.lexington presented testimony of various insurance company employees and experts about the inappropriateness of loss runs as claim notices.its conclusion was that even if the loss run somehow contained all of the necessary information,it would still not qualify as an individual and official report of a claim.that too was evidence for jurors to consider,giving it such weight as they thought proper.
in texas,as elsewhere,ambiguities in insurance contracts must be interpreted to favor the insured.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,hudson energy.we do not find that the bare requirement for a written notice of any claim has sufficiently clear meaning so as to avoid the interpretive principle.no level of detail is specifically required.of some relevance,perhaps,is that a separate,subsequent policy provision that we will discuss requires immediate forwarding of all papers related to the claim.that requirement suggests that the notice of the claim was not designed to bear the entire informational burden.lexington letters accepting loss runs as notice of claims in the other cases supports that the jury finding was reasonable.a jury issue existed,and a valid answer was given,that loss runs could provide the notice of claims.
separate notice of claim and suit 
the district court interpreted the policy language as requiring separate notice of both a claim and a suit arising from the same incident in order to preserve coverage.subsection.of the policy states that the medical center was to send lexington written notice of claim or a suit as soon as practicable.this is important because,at most,the loss runs gave notice of the claim.there was no notice of the suit until seven months after the policy expired.that expiration was within a few weeks of when the suit was filed.
the district court found the policy provision established three duties recording the specifics of the claim or suit,giving written notice of the claim or suit,and sending claims or suit papers.each of these duties was set forth in its own subsection,with the word and linking each.we agree with the district court that the three subsections,linked as they are,set forth requirements that must each be met by the insured.what still needs to be resolved are the form of the notice and the effect of any delay.
the medical center argues that the disjunctive construction of the phrase notice of the claim or suit indicates that only one or the other is required for a given medical incident.it also points to the definitions of claim and suit given earlier in the policy.a claim is defined to include a suit,while a suit is a civil action for damages arising from,among other things,a claim.these definitions suggest,it argues,that notice of claim by definition includes any subsequently filed suit on that claim.accordingly,no additional notice of the cornelius lawsuit was required.
the medical center interpretation of the use of the word or is unreasonable.if the insured had an option of which of the two events to report for any given medical incident,it would mean,as here,that the medical center was not required to report a suit subsequent to a claim so long as it had reported the claim.but it would also mean that an insured would have no duty to report a claim,so long as it planned to report the eventual filing of a suit,perhaps months later there apparently would be no duty ever to report anything were a suit not actually filed.it is not clear how this view would interact,under the medical center theory,with the vital importance of reporting claims under a policy,a topic discussed in the next section.we find the policy required separate notice of claim and of suit.
the medical center reliance on the policy definitions is equally unavailing.the fact that a claim is defined to include a suit does not mean that all claims are thereby converted into suits,such that only one notice is required.if the first notice of claim a hospital received was the claim in a lawsuit,then it would make sense for the hospital to provide only one notice to its insurer,both as a matter of the policy definitions and of common sense.
but this does not work in reverse,because all claims are not suits,as the facts of this case demonstrate.the initial claim made to the medical center came not in the form of a lawsuit,but rather in the form of the letter regarding cornelius injuries.it is not consistent with logic or the ordinary use of language to regard the suit filed in late may as somehow already having been reported to lexington by notice of a simple claim filed two months earlier.the making of a claim in march gave rise to a duty to notify lexington about it.the filing of the lawsuit in may gave rise to a new duty to report the suit.texas law is not to the contrary.see members mut.ins.cutaia.we cite cutaia not for its discussion of prejudice,which has been superceded by subsequent developments in texas insurance law.rather,the case illustrates that requiring notice of the filing of suit even when an insurer has actual notice of the underlying incident is by no means an unprecedented or inexplicable requirement in an insurance contract.
because notice of the suit was required,it is important that the district court found notification of the suit seven months after it was filed was not,as a matter of law,notification as soon as practicable.we agree.
necessity of showing prejudice 
we have concluded that the district court was correct to find that the medical center violated the policy requirement to give separate written notice of the filing of the cornelius lawsuit as soon as practicable.we now turn to whether lexington should have been required to show it was prejudiced by the lack of prompt notice.
at trial,the medical center proposed a jury instruction to require a finding that lexington was prejudiced by a failure to be notified as soon as practicable of a lawsuit or to be sent documents immediately received about any suit.the district court refused to submit the instruction.it found that on this issue of prejudice,texas law distinguishes between two kinds of policies.the contract here was a policy.the district court found that under texas law,no showing of prejudice is needed before late notice bars coverage.for occurrence policies,though,prejudice must be shown before inadequacies of notice will bar a claim.matador petroleum paul surplus lines ins,cir applying texas law.
