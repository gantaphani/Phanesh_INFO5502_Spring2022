prior to closing on a loan to refinance their principal residence,rita and barry weintraub attempted to exercise the right to rescind given by the truth in lending act,a,and demanded a refund of their deposit.the lender,quicken loans,refunded the balance of the deposit after deducting the costs of a credit report and an appraisal but refused to refund the entire.
the weintraubs commenced this action,seeking a declaratory judgment that quicken loans violated the truth in lending act,injunctive relief,compensatory and statutory damages,and attorneys fees.on quicken loans motion,the district court granted it summary judgment,holding that the right to rescind given by a is available only to rescind a consummated credit transaction.the court concluded that because the weintraubs elected not to go through with the loan before closing,they were not entitled to any relief under the truth in lending act.
we agree and affirm.
on february,rita and barry weintraub applied by telephone to quicken loans for a loan,payable over years at a fixed rate of interest,to refinance their principal residence,a townhouse in stafford county,virginia.on the same day,quicken loans electronically transmitted to the weintraubs two documents a good faith estimate,based on an estimated interest rate of and the weintraubs estimated house value of and an interest rate disclosure not locked and deposit agreement.the interest rate disclosure portion of this document provided 
you have chosen not to lock the interest rate on the above loan program.this means that your interest rate is not guaranteed for any period of time and is subject to change without advance notice.
this document also included a deposit agreement requiring the weintraubs,as part of their application,to pay quicken loans a deposit for expenses.the deposit agreement provided 
if your application is approved at the closing,lender will credit the amount of your deposit on your closing statement toward your closing costs.if your application is denied lender will refund the deposit less the actual amount of costs incurred on your behalf for,among other items,the cost of an appraisal credit report.a conditional approval or request for additional information is not a denial.the deposit will not be refunded if you do fully cooperate in or complete the application process including submitting all required documentation in a timely manner,choose to withdraw your application,or choose not to close the transaction for any reason including changing interest rates.
three days later,on february,barry weintraub electronically signed the two documents.he also paid the deposit by credit card.
quicken loans conditionally approved the loan that the weintraubs requested.among the conditions was quicken loans receipt of a satisfactory home appraisal.
an independent appraiser conducted an appraisal of the weintraubs home on february,and estimated its value to be.this amount was below the estimate that the weintraubs had provided to quicken loans for use in its good faith estimate.because this appraisal meant that the loan amount was greater than of the townhouse estimated value,quicken loans added a discount fee to the closing costs for the loan.on february,quicken loans provided the weintraubs with the closing documents,which reflected the adjustment and which included a federal statement and notices of right to cancel,and it scheduled closing for february.the notices of right to cancel provided 
you are entering into a transaction that will result in a interest your home.you have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction,without cost,within three business days from whichever of the following events occurs last 
the date of the transaction,which is february,or 
the date you received your truth in lending disclosures or 
the date you received this notice of your right to cancel.
if you cancel the transaction,the interest is also cancelled.within calendar days after we receive your notice,we must take the steps necessary to reflect the fact that the interest your home has been cancelled,and we must return to you any money or property you have given to us or to anyone else in connection with this transaction.
because quicken loans added the discount fee to the closing costs,the weintraubs decided not to go through with the loan,and on february they advised quicken loans of their decision by sending it executed notices of right to cancel and a cover letter requesting a return of the deposit.
quicken loans refused to return the full deposit,referring to the deposit agreement,which provided that t he deposit will not be refunded if you choose to withdraw your application,or choose not to close the transaction for any reason including changing interest rates.despite this contractual language,quicken loans refunded to the weintraubs,after deducting for the cost of the appraisal and for the cost of obtaining a credit report.
the weintraubs commenced this action against quicken loans,alleging that quicken loans failure to provide them with a full refund of their deposit within days of receiving an executed notice to cancel violated b of the truth in lending act tila,et.on quicken loans motion,the district court granted it summary judgment,holding that because the weintraubs withdrew their loan application prior to closing,the loan between the weintraubs and quicken loans was never consummated and there was no consumer credit transaction that could give rise to the right to rescind.from the district court judgment,the weintraubs filed this appeal,presenting the single question of whether the weintraubs could rescind a loan transaction before its closing and receive back their entire application deposit.
the right to rescind,on which the weintraubs rely,is contained in a of tila,which provides 
i n the case of any consumer credit transaction in which a security interest is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended,the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter,whichever is later,by notifying the creditor,in accordance with regulations of the board,of his intention to do so.
a emphasis added.if the lender does not deliver the disclosures to the debtor,this right of rescission expires three years after the date of the consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property,whichever occurs first.id.f.once the right to rescind is properly exercised,the creditor must return to the debtor any money or property given as earnest money,downpayment,or otherwise within days.id.b.
because the right to rescind only applies i n the case of any consumer credit transaction,the issue in this case is whether there can be a consumer credit transaction giving rise to the right to rescind before the transaction is consummated or closed.
in concluding that no consumer credit transaction occurred in this case to trigger tila right to rescind,the district court noted that even though tila does not define the term transaction,it does define the terms residential mortgage transaction and reverse mortgage transaction,which treat transaction as a consummated event.focusing on the effect of a rescission on the legal obligations of the parties,the court concluded that only a completed credit transaction could be eligible for rescission.see b.in addition,the court relied on our cases,which hold in the context of an automobile loan that liability for improper disclosures under of tila does not attach until after consummation of a consumer credit transaction.see nigh koons buick pontiac gmc,cir,rev on other grounds,baxter sparks oldsmobile,cir.finally,the court referred to the applicable provision of the federal reserve board regulation z,a,as well as the official staff interpretations,pt,supp.i,and rescission model form general.pt,app,to conclude that all three conditions listed in a
