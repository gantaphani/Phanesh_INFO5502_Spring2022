vonda aloisi was employed as a security police officer for lockheed martin energy systems.after working for lockheed martin for a number of years,she began to suffer from severe headaches,which prohibited her from performing the duties of her job.she accordingly applied for disability benefits pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement cba between aloisi union and lockheed martin.
aloisi was found to be entitled to disability benefits,but the union and lockheed martin disagreed about the extent to which she was entitled to disability benefits.this caused the union to invoke the cba medical arbitration procedure for resolving such disputes.at the conclusion of the arbitration procedure,aloisi was informed that she was not entitled to the continuation of disability benefits.she then filed the present action in the district court to overturn the adverse decision by the arbitrators.
the district court denied lockheed martin motion for summary judgment and remanded the action for further arbitration.it subsequently denied lockheed martin motion to alter or amend the order denying the motion for summary judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the action with instructions to dismiss the complaint.
background 
factual background 
aloisi had been employed by lockheed martin and its predecessor as a security police officer since and,as such,was a member of the international guards union of america the union.she began suffering from severe headaches in the early,which gradually worsened until she became unable to perform the duties of her job.accordingly,aloisi filed a claim for disability benefits pursuant to the cba.
aloisi claim was approved,and she received the disability benefits allowed by the cba for six months.at the end of this period,aloisi applied for disability benefits.these benefits are available under the cba to an employee who has exhausted her disability benefits and who is totally disabled.for the first months of disability,an employee is considered totally disabled if she is unable to perform the duties of her regular job with the company.after the expiration of this period,an employee is considered totally disabled,and thus eligible for disability benefits,only if she is unable to work at any job for which she might be qualified based on her education,training and experience.
metropolitan life insurance company metlife,which administers the disability plan for lockheed martin,granted aloisi disability benefits under phase one of the plan for the period from november,to november.these benefits constitute approximately of an employee monthly pay.but metlife subsequently determined that aloisi was not qualified for disability benefits thereafter based on its conclusion that she was not totally disabled under phase two of the disability plan.
aloisi requested that metlife reconsider its determination.after conducting the requested review,metlife upheld its finding that aloisi was not totally disabled under the definition of total disability.it therefore terminated her disability benefits after november.
contesting metlife determination that aloisi was not totally disabled,the union invoked the cba medical arbitration procedure to resolve the dispute.the cba provides in pertinent part that,
i f a dispute arises as a result of an employee claim that he or she is totally and permanently disabled,the dispute shall be resolved in the following manner upon the filing with the company of a written request for review by such employee not more than days after receipt of denial 
the employee shall be examined by a physician appointed for the purpose by the company and by a physician appointed for the purpose by the union.if they disagree concerning whether the employee is totally and permanently disabled,the question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by such two physicians.
the medical opinion of the third physician,after examination by him or her of the employee and consultation with the other two physicians,shall be final and binding on the company,the union,and the employee.
pursuant to this procedure,the union appointed david ricche to conduct the examination of aloisi,and metlife and lockheed martin appointed robert petrie to examine her.ricche examined aloisi and concluded that she was totally disabled under the cba.petrie consulted other doctors prior medical reports concerning aloisi,but did not personally examine her,before concluding that aloisi was not totally disabled.
jeffrey uzzle was then selected as the third physician to determine whether aloisi was totally disabled.after examining aloisi,consulting with ricche but not petrie,and reviewing aloisi medical records,uzzle determined that aloisi was not totally disabled.he detailed his findings in a letter,concluding that i do not find evidence of a physical or a psychological impairment that would limit her from being able to function at sedentary to light physical demand level work.
lockheed martin apprised aloisi of uzzle determination and asked her whether she intended to return to work.aloisi responded with a letter claiming that the medical arbitration procedure had not been properly followed.she did not state whether she would return to work at lockheed martin.after lockheed martin and the union determined that the cba was properly followed,lockheed martin notified aloisi on february,that her employment would be terminated as of february.
procedural background 
although the cba provides for a grievance procedure that must be initiated by the aggrieved employee within ten days after the occurrence of the allegedly wrongful conduct,aloisi took no further action until she filed the present lawsuit.on july,approximately months after lockheed martin notified aloisi of uzzle determination and months after lockheed martin told aloisi that she would be terminated from her employment,aloisi filed a complaint in tennessee state court against lockheed martin.
the complaint was for breach of contract and to declare the rights,status and other legal relations of the parties arising out of the collective bargaining contract.aloisi alleged that lockheed martin breached the cba because the company doctor never examined her personally.she therefore sought a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under the cba,as well as an order that lockheed martin provide her with phase two disability benefits unless and until she was found not to be totally disabled following strict compliance with the medical arbitration procedure.
lockheed martin removed the complaint to federal court pursuant to and b,contending that of the labor management relations act lmra,and of the employee retirement income security act erisa,preempted aloisi claims.after removal,lockheed martin moved for summary judgment on the grounds that tennessee statute of limitations barred the claims,and aloisi lacked standing to maintain the action under of the lmra.
the district court denied lockheed martin motion after finding that the company had not followed the medical arbitration procedure as set forth in the cba.because petrie did not personally examine aloisi,the court concluded that no final and binding arbitration award was ever entered.without ruling on lockheed martin statute of limitations and standing arguments,the court remanded the action for medical arbitration in conformity with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in order to determine whether aloisi was totally disabled within the meaning of the cba.
lockheed martin reiterated its statute of limitations and standing arguments in its subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment.the district court denied the motion without a substantive discussion of the issues raised by the company.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
although lockheed martin appeals both the district court order denying the motion for summary judgment and the district court order denying the motion to alter or amend the same,it is,in effect,appealing solely the order denying the motion for summary judgment.the substance of lockheed martin briefs on appeal and the standard
