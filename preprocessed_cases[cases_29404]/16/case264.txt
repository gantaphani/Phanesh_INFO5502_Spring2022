global naps,gnaps appeals from entry against it of a judgment for for access charges that gnaps owed but failed to pay verizon new england verizon for services verizon provided between and.concerned that gnaps could not pay a judgment,verizon also successfully brought counterclaims alleging alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form against gnaps its owner,frank gangi and several gnaps affiliates.these defendants appeal from the district court assertion of federal jurisdiction and grant of default judgment,which holds gangi and the affiliates jointly liable for the sum gnaps owes.we affirm.
in an issue of first impression for this court,we hold that u,enacted in,gives federal courts supplemental jurisdiction over both compulsory and at least some permissive counterclaims.this alters this circuit former rule,adopted before the enactment of,that required permissive counterclaims to have an independent basis for jurisdiction.see mccaffrey rex motor,cir.our ruling brings us into line with the second and seventh circuits,as we describe below.jones ford motor credit,cir channell citicorp,cir.
in the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte ruled that gnaps must pay access charges to verizon whenever isp traffic is actually routed outside the caller local area,regardless of the phone number the internet user dialed.gnaps fought that ruling and did not pay any of those charges.verizon terminated its service to gnaps in.
this is gnaps fourth appeal in a series of disputes between gnaps and verizon,which arose from gnaps efforts to avoid the dte ruling.see global naps,verizon new england,gnaps iv,cir affirming release of security gnaps posted to obtain an injunction pending appeal after the injunction was vacated global naps,verizon new england,gnaps iii,cir holding a fcc order did not preempt the state dte authority global naps.dep t of telecomm.energy,gnaps ii,cir holding the massachusetts dte was not bound under the full faith and credit clause to a rhode island agency interpretation of the effect of an fcc order on gnaps and verizon rhode island agreement global naps,verizon new england,gnaps i,cir holding gnaps could not opt to use an agreement it had with verizon in a different state after undergoing arbitration before the dte.
gnaps has appealed here again on a number of arguments,which challenge federal jurisdiction,the liability finding,and the amount of the damages assessed.we reject gnaps first argument,that it can not be liable for any charges imposed pursuant to the dte order because a federal communications commission fcc order preempts the dte decision.the order is not materially different on this preemption issue from an earlier order,which we held did not preempt the dte.gnaps iii,at.
we also reject gnaps challenges to judgments against it on two of verizon counterclaims,one to enforce the dte order and recover access charges and the other to pierce gnaps corporate veil and hold gangi and gnaps affiliates jointly liable.we reject the argument of all defendants that the district court lacked jurisdiction over these counterclaims.there is subject matter jurisdiction over both claims because a gives courts supplemental jurisdiction over compulsory and at least some permissive counterclaims.verizon counterclaims are sufficiently related to the underlying litigation within the test set forth in a to fall under federal courts supplemental jurisdiction.we also reject gnaps argument that verizon first had to ask the dte to enforce its order before suing in federal court because gnaps waived this exhaustion argument.
finally,we affirm judgment on both counterclaims.we affirm the district court calculation of damages gnaps owes verizon for failing to pay access charges under the dte order.we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting default judgment on the claim to pierce gnaps corporate veil as a discovery sanction against gnaps,gangi,and three gnaps affiliates global naps networks,gnaps networks,global naps realty gnaps realty,and global naps new hampshire gnaps new hampshire collectively,the gnaps companies.evidence these defendants committed misconduct and spoliation was compelling.and we affirm that collateral estoppel barred gnaps holding company,ferrous miner holdings,ferrous,from challenging these findings.
some pertinent background information,setting up the issues in this appeal,may be helpful.our prior decisions give further background,and we assume familiarity with them.
a.the telecommunications act and interconnection agreements 
the telecommunications act of tca,now over a decade old,has promoted greater competition in the telecommunications industry.see gnaps ii,at.it requires local carriers to interconnect with each other networks,pursuant to interconnection agreements icas.id.at see also a.carriers can voluntarily negotiate terms and,after an impasse,can ask state commissions to set terms in binding arbitration.a b.
those icas must specify how the carriers will share fees from local calls.id.a.section b requires carriers to pay reciprocal compensation for local calls,in which the carrier for the customer making the call shares fees with the carrier that terminates the call.for calls known as interexchange traffic,in contrast,the carrier pays access charges to the carriers that originated and terminated the call.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of local competition order,distinguishing local and interexchange fees 
the tca sets some federal requirements for all icas,b c,but leaves some room for state regulation.for example,carriers must submit all those negotiated state commissions,which can require that icas meet local regulations.see id.e.if parties undergo arbitration,the tca somewhat limits state commissions discretion to set terms.see id.b d.carriers may ask a federal court to review whether a state commission decision under conforms to the tca.id.e.
factual background 
at issue in this case is what charges verizon and gnaps owe each other from internet traffic between some of their customers.for our purposes,verizon customers were internet users gnaps customers were the isps that connected verizon customers to the internet.because service uses telephone lines,these calls were networked like a phone call.a verizon customer modem dialed a phone number belonging to gnaps isp customer.the isp server equipment answered that call and connected the user to websites.in early,gnaps and verizon began renegotiating a new ica for calls from verizon massachusetts customers to these isps.
isp calls do not fit the traditional scheme and can produce windfall profits for isps carriers,like gnaps.isps receive many,long calls,entitling their providers to large fees from the internet customer carrier here,verizon.but isps do not make calls,defeating the reciprocal arrangement.the fcc has long sought a solution to this problem.see core commc ns,fcc,describing that history.
gnaps further exploited this imbalance by giving its isp customers virtual nxx vnxx phone numbers.unlike normal numbers,vnxx numbers do not reflect the actual location of the number owner gnaps gave its isp customers vnxx numbers that would appear local to the internet user,verizon customers.but the isp was often in fact located out of the internet user calling area.in other words,apparently local calls were often networked as calls.
gnaps has argued to the and in court that vnxx numbers that appear if the isp is actually located subject to reciprocal compensation.verizon has argued that it should be able to charge access charges and not have to pay reciprocal compensation to any calls that are routed to an isp outside a verizon customer local area.
on december,after arbitration,the massachusetts dte sided with verizon it ordered the parties to adopt an ica requiring them to pay reciprocal fees for genuinely local calls and gnaps to pay access charges when an isp was actually located outside the internet customer local area.the dte ordered gnaps to inform verizon where its isp customers were located so verizon could properly bill gnaps.
this ica went into effect on january,and verizon began billing gnaps.for three years,gnaps fought the dte ruling and did not pay access charges.it also did not give verizon information about its isp customers locations.verizon terminated its service to gnaps in april.this appeal concerns verizon efforts to collect three years of overdue access charges.
gnaps sued verizon in federal district court in massachusetts on december.after gnaps litigated and lost an argument in that it could opt into a different ica and avoid the dte order,see gnaps i,at,the parties turned to the meat of gnaps lawsuit.gnaps claimed that a fcc order preempted the dte authority to decide rates for all isp traffic,including vnxx interexchange traffic,relying on in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of isp remand order.
on april,this court disagreed with gnaps and held that the isp remand order only clearly regulated local traffic.gnaps iii,at.applying the presumption against preemption,we ruled the isp remand order did not govern interexchange vnxx traffic and upheld the dte order.id.
earlier,on january,gnaps had filed a separate lawsuit to obtain payment from verizon for charges gnaps said verizon owed it.gnaps claimed that the isp remand order and another,related fcc imposed reciprocal rates of on all isp traffic.gnaps sought its purported share of reciprocal fees from verizon.the district court consolidated this suit with gnaps lawsuit claiming preemption.
verizon responded to gnaps lawsuit by counterclaiming for the access charges gnaps owed under the dte order.verizon claimed breach of contract,specifically of the ica.in september,after gnaps had litigated and lost its preemption claim,the district court granted verizon motion for judgment on the pleadings on gnaps complaint.
that left verizon counterclaim for breach of the ica.the parties began conducting discovery on gnaps liability and potential damages on that claim in late.it was not until june,however,that gnaps argued for the first time that verizon had to bring its claim to enforce the ica to the state commission here,the dte before suing in federal court.the district court rejected that argument.
on november,the fcc issued a new order addressing its authority to regulate isp traffic,in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime,intercarrier compensation for traffic second remand order,f.that order did not arise out of this dispute but addressed different issues.the district court,on november,rejected gnaps argument that the second remand order made the clear statement of preemption that the isp remand order had lacked earlier and preempted the dte order.
by late,the district court was also ready to resolve verizon counterclaim to enforce the ica.it concluded that this court decision rejecting gnaps original preemption claim established verizon right to collect access charges and that the only question wa s the amount due.as we explain in more detail below,to determine that amount,the court had to resolve how many minutes of vnxx calls were subject to the dte order that gnaps pay access the court had to exclude any local calls subject to reciprocal compensation and any calls made to gnaps customers outside massachusetts and not under the dte order.the court then had to decide what rate per minute gnaps owed for access charges and any interest.
the parties agreed how many total minutes of vnxx traffic were at issue.the court applied judicial estoppel against gnaps on two key issues,the rate per minute of access charges and the percentage of gnaps customers that were in massachusetts and subject to the dte order.the court held gnaps was bound to representations it had made on both issues when seeking an injunction while litigating its preemption claim in.
the district court resolved the final two percentage of calls that were local and the amount of summary judgment.the parties experts had originally agreed on the percentage of local traffic.the court rejected gnaps expert tardy revised report,filed one week before trial,which estimated a higher percentage of local traffic,as well as a verizon employee that gnaps insisted created an issue of fact.the court held the ica set interest rates for overdue charges.it granted judgment for verizon for.
well before obtaining judgment,verizon feared that gnaps would not pay any judgment it owed.by it began to suspect that gnaps was transferring its assets to avoid paying a judgment.the district court permitted verizon to attach gnaps assets in september.verizon says it discovered there was less than million in gnaps name.
verizon amended its counterclaim on december,alleging that gnaps commingled and hid its assets.the amended counterclaim added to count one,which again claimed breach of the ica,two new counts count two claimed fraudulent transfer of assets and count three claimed alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form.
the counterclaim added new defendants whom verizon alleged should share gnaps liability.three gnaps affiliates became defendants gnaps new hampshire,which acts as the banker for all gnaps companies,receiving and disbursing their money so they can pay their bills gnaps networks,which manages gnaps infrastructure and gnaps realty,which holds gnaps property and leases.the amended counterclaim also added as defendants ferrous,a holding company that owns all of these entities,and frank gangi,founder and sole shareholder of ferrous all of these companies,including gnaps,are entities that pay their income to their shareholder,frank gangi,who pays their taxes.
the defendants unsuccessfully moved to dismiss counts two and three as permissive counterclaims that needed,and lacked,an independent basis for federal jurisdiction.meanwhile,the defendants resisted verizon requests for discovery of their financial records.beginning on december,the district court issued a series of orders rejecting gnaps repeated efforts to block discovery.
evidently gnaps and the other defendants were resisting discovery orders in a connecticut district court as well.on july,that court granted default judgment against gnaps,the gnaps companies,and ferrous for willful discovery violations.new england.global naps,snet.the snet court found substantial evidence the defendants had concealed and destroyed evidence.id.at.
in october,verizon moved for entry of default judgment as a sanction for discovery violations by all defendants.after a evidentiary hearing in december,the district court granted default judgment on count three,which alleged alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form,against gnaps,gangi,and the gnaps companies.it also held ferrous was collaterally estopped from disputing the findings in the snet decision and granted default judgment on count three against ferrous as well.the court held all counterclaim defendants jointly and severally liable with gnaps for the full judgment amount.
the defendants appeal.
a.the fcc second remand order does not preempt or establish that the fcc order preempted the dte authority to impose rates for interexchange isp traffic 
gnaps argues that the fcc second remand establishes that the isp remand order preempted intercarrier compensation for all traffic and so preempts the dte decision that gnaps must pay access charges for interexchange vnxx traffic.we review that preemption claim de novo.gnaps iii,at.
in gnaps iii we held that the fcc,in the isp remand order,exercised only its authority to regulate local isp traffic and did not preempt state authority to regulate interexchange isp traffic.id.at.we distinguished between the fcc assertion of regulatory authority and its exercise of that authority.id.at.even if the fcc had authority to regulate all isp traffic,the isp remand order was intended to resolve problems with reciprocal compensation for local traffic.id.at.we explained that the fcc had to clearly state its intent to preempt state authority to regulate access charges for interexchange traffic as well,which the isp remand order did not explicitly do.id.at.we ruled the isp remand order therefore did not preempt the dte decision.id.at.
gnaps argues that the fcc second remand order made it clear that its order had preempted the dte order.not so.the second remand order is not materially different from the isp remand order on the issues of concern to us,and our holding in gnaps iii applies to this case as well.gnaps argument to the contrary misreads the order language.
the second remand order simply clarified the legal basis for the authority the fcc had asserted in earlier orders to regulate local isp traffic and prevent regulatory arbitrage.see second remand order,at.the order was a response to a ruling of the circuit court of appeals that a legal basis for the isp remand order assertion of jurisdiction likely existed,but that order had rested on the wrong jurisdictional ground id.thus,the issues the fcc addressed in the order did not go to regulation of intercarrier compensation for interexchange isp traffic.
the second remand order did not change the isp remand order rate regime or preemptive effect,as the circuit has recognized.to the contrary,that order instituted substantially the same rate cap system as the isp remand order.core commc ns,at see also second remand order,at continuing the rate system in the isp remand order.as the fcc told the circuit in core communications,that rate system applies when two carriers collaborate to deliver calls to an isp within a local calling area.brief of fcc at,core commc ns,emphasis added.the second remand order did not revisit or mention preemption of traffic at all.
the second remand order express purpose was to particular rate system.we held,in gnaps iii,that system applied only to local isp traffic.gnaps contrary argument takes language in the second remand order out of context and ignores the purpose of the order 
gnaps notes that the order concluded that b scheme does not apply only to local traffic.the fcc was merely ruling that b is not limited to traditional telephone local traffic but to all forms of telecommunications,including isp traffic.id.at.the fcc was rejecting its prior interpretation that b did not include isp traffic at all id.it was not,however,distinguishing local and interexchange isp traffic,which is the pertinent question for us 
the second remand order did describe traffic as interstate and interexchange.at.but that does not mean the fcc was preempting interexchange fees,as gnaps urges.the fcc was explaining why it had jurisdiction to regulate isp traffic under of the tca,which permits the fcc to impose rates and regulations that further the tca goals on interstate telecommunications traffic.see see also core commc ns,at.gnaps argument misses the point that a matter may be subject to fcc jurisdiction,without the fcc having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state regulation.gnaps iii,at.here,the fcc has not exercised jurisdiction over interexchange traffic.our conclusion that the fcc preempted only state regulation of local isp traffic remains unaffected.
gnaps also observes the order discusses intercarrier compensation rather than reciprocal compensation and urges us to conclude that the order intended to reach reciprocal fees as well as access charges.the second remand order does not assign such significance to this language or even mention access charges.instead,it expressly preserved the rate scheme in the isp remand order that we have held governs only local isp traffic.isolated words can not overcome the second remand order text or the presumption against preemption.see gnaps iii,at.
gnaps argument fails.we turn to gnaps arguments that the federal courts could not hear verizon counterclaims for payment of access charges.
jurisdictional issues 
gnaps argues no federal jurisdiction exists over verizon two successful counterclaims,count one to enforce the ica and count three alleging alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form.gnaps also argues that verizon failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by not first seeking to enforce the ica in the dte.
we reject gnaps argument that there is no federal jurisdiction and hold that confers jurisdiction over compulsory and at least some permissive counterclaims.we also hold gnaps waived its exhaustion argument and do not reach the merits.
federal jurisdiction over count one,verizon counterclaim to enforce the ica 
gnaps first argues that verizon improperly enforced the ica in federal court rather than first asking the dte to interpret and enforce the agreement.although of the tca details how parties,states,and federal courts can draft and approve icas,it is silent on how and in what fora parties can enforce icas.among other issues,courts remain uncertain whether state commissions can enforce icas whether state commissions ever must or should first interpret and enforce icas and when federal courts have jurisdiction over actions we need not decide these issues here,but they undergird the parties disputes.
gnaps argues that even if federal courts hypothetically have jurisdiction over claims to enforce icas,the proper procedure is for state,the first interpret and enforce an ica,after which federal courts may review that decision under e.it concludes that verizon claim is premature.
verizon rejects gnaps prematurity argument as based on two questionable assumptions first,that state commissions have the authority under the tca to enforce interconnection agreements,and second,that any implicit authority in state commissions is meant to be exclusive and prevents federal courts from hearing claims otherwise properly before them.verizon contends that its claim is properly in federal court,either because there is federal question jurisdiction over the claim under or,at a minimum,there is supplemental jurisdiction under.
we need not decide the first point,whether state commissions can hear claims,because we conclude verizon counterclaim is properly in federal court.we think it is clear that,at a minimum,there is supplemental jurisdiction under over verizon counterclaim to enforce the ica.we agree with verizon that congress did not withdraw that jurisdiction to hear this counterclaim in the tca.see verizon.pub.serv.comm n,d holding that of the tca at least does not divest the district courts of their authority under see also united states lahey clinic,cir noting that a strong presumption against implied repeals of federal statutes is even stronger when the federal statute in question confers federal jurisdiction.
verizon counterclaim is more than sufficiently related to gnaps complaint.both parties claims ultimately arise from a dispute over the same agreement and involve the same basic factual question what fees the carriers owe each other.see,bell,town of palm beach,cir reviewing a claim seeking declaratory judgment that an ordinance was preempted and a counterclaim to enforce the ordinance see also wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,at,noting that courts generally find claims that are logically related arise from the same transaction and reporting that courts have held that some claims based on the same contract are sufficiently related.
given the existence of jurisdiction,we treat gnaps prematurity argument as a type of argument arguments that a party failed to exhaust its administrative remedies are waivable unless an exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional.see dep t of natural envtl,cir.and exhaustion requirements are not jurisdictional unless congress has explicitly designated them as such.see arbaugh y h,d.the tca does not mention an exhaustion requirement,let alone limit subject matter jurisdiction.
without suggesting that there would be,on these facts,any merit to the argument,we hold gnaps has waived it.gnaps did not raise this argument until nearly two years after verizon filed its counterclaim,and only after gnaps other arguments had been rejected.it would be inequitable to allow gnaps to sandbag its opponent at this late stage,and it would disserve judicial economy 
jurisdiction over verizon counterclaim for alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form 
gnaps makes a different and more complicated argument that there is no federal jurisdiction over count three,which alleged alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form against gnaps and the other defendants.gnaps argues that at most this counterclaim is permissive,not compulsory.as such,gnaps concludes,the counterclaim is outside federal courts supplemental jurisdiction and requires an independent basis for jurisdiction.we hold that we have supplemental jurisdiction over this counterclaim,regardless of whether it is compulsory or permissive.
this court has not before considered the scope of statutory supplemental jurisdiction over counterclaims.the supplemental jurisdiction statute,was enacted in.some decisions before the enactment of adopted a rule that federal courts could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over compulsory but not permissive counterclaims,mccaffrey,at see also wright et,supra,at.permissive counterclaims needed to have an independent federal jurisdictional basis.mccaffrey,at wright et,supra,at.
this distinction arose from law of jurisdiction over what are now called supplemental that lack an independent basis for federal which evolved in the absence of explicit congressional authorization.put simply,courts distinguished jurisdiction over pendent brought by the ancillary brought by third parties pendent claims had to arise from the same common nucleus of operative fact as the underlying claim having a basis for federal jurisdiction.united mine workers gibbs,d.lower courts held that ancillary claims,such as counterclaims,had to arise from the same transaction or occurrence.see fletcher,common nucleus of operative fact and defensive beyond the gibbs test,wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the supreme court never reconciled these lines of cases.see generally wright et,supra,at tracing this history perdue,finley united states unstringing pendent jurisdiction,same.
courts drew the line for ancillary jurisdiction at the test for practical reasons.some counterclaims needed to be raised to avoid preclusion in a later proceeding.courts,hesitant to expand federal judicial power,limited supplemental jurisdiction to counterclaims which had to be raised or waived that is,compulsory counterclaims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the underlying suit.see channell,at wright et,supra,at.
not all courts agreed.judge friendly rejected the conventional view.see united states v.the,cir friendly,concurring.so did judge becker.abromovage united mine workers of,cir.they and some commentators criticized this rule as historically and legally unsound and unwise.see jones,at describing that debate.
in congress enacted a supplemental jurisdiction statute.the statute does not use the terminology of permissive or compulsory.it gives federal courts supplemental jurisdiction over all claims that are part of the same article iii case or controversy 
except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.
a.this language confers jurisdiction over all claims that are part of the same article iii case,subject to two exceptions,listed in subsections b and c,which do not apply here 
by its plain text,then,a governs supplemental jurisdiction over counterclaims.see exxon mobile allapattah,d interpreting a s plain text,which confers a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction.we join two circuits and virtually all commentators in holding that article iii standard is the jurisdictional limit for counterclaims.jones,at channell,at see also,floyd,three faces of supplemental jurisdiction after the demise of united mine workers gibbs.
in so doing,we hold that supersedes case law on supplemental jurisdiction that had distinguished between compulsory and permissive counterclaims.accord jones,at channell,at.the statute plain text does not distinguish or limit jurisdiction over counterclaims,though it imposes other limits.see a b.and as the supreme court observed,nothing in indicates a congressional intent to recognize,preserve,or create some meaningful,substantive distinction between the jurisdictional categories we have historically labeled pendent and ancillary.allapattah,at.thus abolishes the conceptual framework underpinning the old counterclaim distinction.
we need not define the outer boundary of the phrase so related that the claims form part of the same case or controversy under article iii to decide this case,and we will not do so here.much scholarly commentary has debated the meaning of case and controversy in article iii,as well as in a,and the question is a difficult one 
in this case we need only decide that supplemental jurisdiction is somewhat broader than the test.no supreme court case had ever established the same test as the boundary of article iii requirement.gibbs,the court only decision deciding the scope of an article iii case,instead looked to whether the claims arose from a common nucleus of operative fact.id.at.
verizon counterclaim is sufficiently related to the underlying litigation to fall within article iii jurisdiction.this litigation disputes what fees the parties owe each other and involves efforts by both parties to collect claimed fees from a discrete and common body of calls.count three was part of verizon effort to collect those fees when gnaps attempted to avoid payment.other courts have accepted supplemental jurisdiction over claims to pierce the corporate veil and similar claims.see,bd.of,sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir.
this is not a situation in which there could be any due process constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction.in this case,it was sensible for the district court to try verizon claim to pierce the corporate veil with the rest of the litigation,rather than sending count three to state court.the case had already consumed years of litigation.the district court was familiar with,and had developed expertise on,the complicated claims at issue.it was also thoroughly familiar with gnaps many efforts to avoid paying access information for a court assessing gnaps conduct.finally,there was nothing unfair about trying this claim with the rest of the litigation.
judgment for verizon on its counterclaims was proper 
we turn to the district court resolution of verizon two counterclaims on the merits.our rejection of gnaps preemption argument removes gnaps only argument as to liability.what is left is a dispute over the amount of damages gnaps and the other defendants owe verizon.
verizon counterclaim to enforce the ica 
gnaps first challenges the district court method for calculating that gnaps owed verizon in damages.we review the district court application of judicial estoppel in support of that conclusion for abuse of discretion,alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir,and its grant of summary judgment in verizon favor on the amount of damages de novo,thore howe,cir.
to calculate the amount of damages,the district court first had to decide how many minutes of traffic were subject to access charges.that calculation involved three issues how many minutes of calls occurred between and,what percentage of that traffic was intrastate and subject to the dte order,and what percentage of traffic was local and therefore subject to reciprocal compensation rather than access charges.the court then needed to decide what rate per minute gnaps had to pay verizon for access charges and the interest rate.
the court found gnaps had admitted that verizon had sent gnaps more than billion minutes of calls for delivery to its vnxx customers.applying judicial estoppel,it held that percent of gnaps traffic was interstate.
this left the question of how of those minutes were delivered to local isps and therefore were subject to reciprocal compensation rather than access charges.the court held that percent of calls were to local isps.
that gave a total of over billion minutes subject to access charges.the court multiplied that figure by the rate per minute.as to the rate per minute,the court held gnaps was judicially estopped from contesting that rate was.it added percent annual prejudgment interest per.laws ch.after reducing the total owed by the amount of security for an injunction the court had already released to verizon,the district court entered judgment for.
a.the judicial estoppel ruling was not error 
the court application of estoppel is well supported in the record.verizon began billing gnaps in early.gnaps made no payments for two years,so verizon tried to terminate its service to gnaps in march,which led to the litigation discussed in gnaps iii.in june,the district court granted gnaps motion for a temporary restraining order tro in the pending litigation while gnaps argued that the dte decision was preempted.after hearing evidence,the court rejected gnaps claim and refused to grant an injunction pending appeal.in light of gnaps claim that its very existence was threatened,this court granted an injunction while we decided gnaps iii,which we lifted in april.the injunction was conditioned on gnaps posting security of million in addition to the million gnaps had already posted.
in order to obtain the tro from the district court and the injunction,pending appeal,from this court,gnaps presented an argument if the dte order was not preempted,then gnaps admittedly owed access charges to verizon.gnaps represented to both courts that those access charges were so high that gnaps could not afford to continue providing service in could fail it had to pay them.it argued the balance of harms to gnaps and its customers meant verizon should be required to continue service,despite gnaps failure to pay for that service.
gnaps made this argument in its briefs and at oral argument.in its motion for the tro,gnaps represented to the district court that verizon charged per minute and relied on that fee in its claims about irreparable injury.in fact,by april,verizon had for a year been billing gnaps at a rate of at least per minute.the district court,for purposes of this case,permissibly found that it was gnaps that had suggested the lower rate and stipulated it a s a number satisfactory to it.
further,in this court,gnaps represented a willingness to post security in the sum of almost million to satisfy any harm to verizon,a figure consistent with the stipulated rate.yet it now asserts that verizon billing rate should be adjusted downward to,a rate that would have significantly weakened the irreparable harm argument gnaps presented at the time.
gnaps made one other critical representation.when moving the district court for an injunction pending appeal,gnaps submitted an employee affidavit asserting that of global revenue is derived from its isp customers in massachusetts.gnaps repeatedly made other claims that similarly suggested a the overwhelming majority of its customers were in massachusetts.now,gnaps tries to walk away from both of these representations,on which the courts have relied.
this court ruled that gnaps owed access charges to verizon in april,gnaps iii,at,and dissolved the injunction.in may,in opposition to verizon motion to release the security gnaps had posted,gnaps first suggested that the verizon billing rate was too high and argued that the proper rate was either or.in,however,this court affirmed the district court order releasing that security.gnaps iv,at.we expressly rejected gnaps belated argument that verizon was overcharging it and held gnaps to its prior,higher estimate of the amount of access charges it owed.id.
in,concluding that gnaps iii clearly established that gnaps owed access charges,the district court turned to considering damages.as trial approached,gnaps filed a motion in limine regarding potential damages it owed.it attached an expert report concluding that verizon was overcharging gnaps and that at least percent of its customers were located outside massachusetts.on december,the district court held a pretrial hearing to resolve several issues.after the hearing,the court held gnaps was judicially estopped from disputing that it owed per minute or that percent of its customers were in massachusetts.
judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that prevents litigants from taking inconsistent positions in the same or a related case.new hampshire maine,d alternative.concepts,at.its purpose is to protect the integrity of the judicial system from litigants playing fast and loose with the courts to obtain an unfair advantage.patriot cinemas,cinema,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also new hampshire,at.our review is limited to abuse of discretion.
there is no doubt that gnaps deliberately played fast and loose with the courts in an effort to gain an unfair advantage.the district court that gnaps should be held to its tactical choice.
gnaps argues that its recent positions were not really inconsistent with its prior positions.it says that it was only telling the district court that verizon charged per minute,not espousing that figure.and it offers a variety of reasons why it did not really mean that percent of its isp customers were in massachusetts.gnaps also urges it was entitled to contest and conduct discovery on the amount of charges it owed after losing its preemption argument.
as to the first two points,gnaps did adopt the only that it did not qualify the percent figure as it now attempts to do.if those figures were not accurate,gnaps certainly misled the courts.see cadle schlictmann,conway,crowly hugo,cir our focus is on the impression the estopped party statements reasonably created in the district court.
the final assertion does not hold because gnaps had plenty of time and every incentive to investigate verizon billing rate by when it made these representations.see alternative.concepts,at holding that a party could not avoid judicial estoppel by failing to discover readily available information.it was not entitled to wait until it lost on all its other claims.one term for that strategy is sandbagging,and the district court was right to prevent gnaps from executing it.
b.the district court properly granted summary judgment on the issue of excludable local minutes 
gnaps argues that the district court erred by concluding,on summary judgment,that about percent of traffic between the parties was local and not subject to access charges.the district court reasoned that gnaps had not proffer ed any countervailing admissible data regarding the location of its customers and that this was information gnaps could have provided.
gnaps argues that two proffers created genuine issues of material fact.one was excluded from evidence a late supplemental declaration by gnaps expert,which gnaps filed one week before trial,without leave,and which presented a new theory that differed from the expert earlier affidavit.the court also held that a verizon employee did not create a genuine issue of fact.
we will not overturn the court enforcement of its timetable for expert reports.see macaulay anas,cir see also levin dalva,cir.gnaps claims it had to submit this report quickly and tardily because the district court made a sudden bench ruling.that ruling did not discuss the percentage of local traffic indeed the court acknowledged that issue remained open.
without that excluded report,the court had before it gnaps expert original report and verizon report,which agreed that percent was the proper figure.no factual dispute remained 
gnaps next argues the district court could not infer,on summary judgment,that a verizon employee overestimated the number of local minutes of traffic between gnaps and verizon.that expressly gave data from a verizon system called traffic track.verizon submitted undisputed evidence that traffic track overestimated minutes for vnxx traffic 
gnaps argues the district court applied the wrong standard for summary judgment by assum ing that this relied only on traffic track data.the district court was required only to draw all reasonable inferences in gnaps favor.mosher nelson,cir.the relied only on traffic track data and did not hint at any other basis for its calculation of local traffic.absent evidence from gnaps that some other source other than traffic track for the figures existed,the district court properly held the did not raise a genuine factual issue.
gnaps has not shown the district court erred in its damages calculations 
gnaps raises three objections to the court damages calculation,which we reject.
gnaps first argues verizon improperly failed to exclude from the calculation transit traffic,which is traffic that did not originate from a verizon customer.the parties agree verizon used the number of minutes of use gnaps supplied when gnaps sent verizon invoices for reciprocal compensation in discovery,gnaps admitted its invoices correctly reported the number of minutes of traffic between verizon and gnaps customers.that admission conclusively established that verizon invoices did not bill gnaps for transit traffic.see.b.
gnaps next argues that the district court should have subtracted the percentage of local calls from all the minutes of use,not just from the number of intrastate minutes percent of the total.gnaps does not explain why.this argument is waived.see,day staples,cir.
gnaps finally argues that there was an interest rate error it says that the district court should have applied percent rather than percent interest.massachusetts law imposes prejudgment interest either at the contract rate or at percent per annum.laws ch,gnaps says that verizon agreed to percent interest.but verizon proposed using that rate if gnaps would settle and not go to trial and gnaps did not settle.when gnaps did not settle,the district court properly applied the undisputed interest rate the ica imposes,percent.
there was no error in the award to verizon on its counterclaim for alter ego liability and disregard of the corporate form 
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting default judgment as a discovery sanction 
the district court granted default judgment on count three of verizon counterclaim as a sanction for willful discovery misconduct against gnaps,the gnaps companies,and frank gangi.the court ruled these defendants had violated the court past discovery orders and the rules of discovery.to reach this conclusion,the court made a number of factual findings that are well supported in the record.
first,the court found that janet lima,the gnaps companies bookkeeper,and frank gangi,their owner,lied to the court about the records gnaps kept.lima and gangi insisted that the companies did not keep a general ledger or any financial documents.they recorded financial transactions in one computer accounting program,called peachtree.otherwise,they claimed to rely on the bank to keep records,which they could request as needed.gangi and lima also both repeatedly claimed ignorance of basic information about how the companies processed their finances,even though lima kept the companies books and wrote their checks and gangi owned the companies and paid their taxes 
the district court could easily find that lima and gangi description of the accounting practices of the gnaps companies,ferrous,and gangi was inherently incredible and ma de no sense.that conclusion was also supported by verizon forensic accountant,who testified that the companies claimed accounting and practices were irregular.
as the district court also found,evidence suggested the defendants actually had kept general ledgers and similar records.gnaps chief financial officer testified that gangi regularly gave her the company bank statements.gangi accountant,edward taylor,testified that he prepared gangi and ferrous tax return in march using information from peachtree,bank statements,and a general ledger.
second,the court supportably found that the defendants had withheld and destroyed financial records.lima testified that information in the one place the companies kept financial lost in december,when she dropped her computer down a flight of stairs.then,on june,she suffered another mishap with her new computer she deleted files using a program called windows washer,lima said to avoid having family information produced during discovery.
the court could conclude that lima stories were wholly incredible.both of her alleged computer mishaps were suspiciously timed.lima dropped the first computer just as the court was beginning to scrutinize the defendants finances.and the accidental computer wipe occurred just minutes before gnaps attorneys arrived to collect discovery records,which lima knew.
instead,the court supportably indeed,logically credited testimony by a computer expert that someone intentionally wiped relevant evidence from lima computer hard drive and then defragmented the drive to make recovery even more difficult.lima admitted using a computer program,windows washer,to delete personal files.but the expert testified that windows washer was run in a with bleach setting that is not a default,that must be intentionally activated,and that more thoroughly wipes the computer.
moreover,the expert testified that only some programs were destroyed,while as microsoft unharmed.most destroyed files and programs appeared to relate to financial records.peachtree,conveniently,was destroyed,as were files named accounting,billing,janet,and peach and shortcuts named with words like check and cash.the district court could conclude that this file destruction was intentional and targeted at relevant financial records.
third,the court supportably determined that the defendants lied to the court about when they lost their financial records.as the court explained,gangi accountant,taylor,testified that he was able to prepare gangi and ferrous tax return in march,which included the gnaps companies taxes.taylor prepared those taxes months after lima said she dropped her computer down stairs and at the same time the defendants were stonewalling efforts to discover their financial records.
on appeal,the defendants argue that the district court should have credited their insistence that they were guilty only of poor record keeping and accidents.that story was contradicted by evidence and common sense.the court certainly could conclude the better explanation was that the defendants had willfully concealed and destroyed evidence.
aside from their factual challenges,the defendants raise one further argument against default judgment.they urge that the district court discovery orders were directed at gnaps,not them.we will defer to the district court contrary interpretation of its own orders.lefkowitz fair,cir.the court issued several such orders after the counterclaim defendants were added those orders compelled production of evidence in the possession of all defendants,including evidence of their finances and evidence they produced in the snet case.
in sum,significant evidence supported the district court conclusion that gnaps,the gnaps companies,and frank gangi violated its orders and committed willful discovery misconduct.there was certainly no abuse of discretion.
b.the district court properly collaterally estopped ferrous from disputing its misconduct 
the district court held gnaps holding company,ferrous,was collaterally estopped from challenging the snet court ruling that ferrous and other defendants in this appeal committed willful discovery misconduct by withholding and destroying evidence.at.the court found that the defendants lied about what financial records they kept and destroyed computer files in bad faith removed evidence from the home of richard gangi,the gnaps companies chief financial officer,after his death and did not cooperate fairly with discovery.id.at.
federal common law governs claims that a party is precluded from relitigating an issue already decided in a federal court.see ups supply chain solutions,cir.issue preclusion requires that both proceedings involved the same issue of law or fact,the parties actually litigated that issue,the prior court decided that issue in a final judgment,and resolution of that issue was essential to judgment on the merits.gnaps ii,at.
ferrous argues that a default judgment is not a judgment on the merits for issue preclusion purposes and that,in any event,the issues litigated in this case were not similar to those in snet.
ferrous misunderstands the issues
