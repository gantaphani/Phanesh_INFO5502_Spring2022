in december,while a student at the university of north carolina,robert quinn entered into a standard representation agreement with carl carey,founder of champion pro consulting group.carey thereby became quinn sports agent and maintained hopes to obtain lucrative opportunities for quinn with the national football league nfl.eight months later,quinn terminated his agreement with carey and hired impact sports football to represent him instead.shortly thereafter,quinn signed a contract with the louis rams for over his first four seasons,with a signing bonus of.
after filing two related actions in other jurisdictions plaintiffs filed the instant action against impact sports,mitchell frankel,tony fleming,and marvin austin alleging principally that impact sports engaged in deceptive and unfair practices in violation of the north carolina unfair and deceptive practices act udtpa by their recruitment of quinn.following discovery,plaintiffs moved to sanction defendants for their alleged spoliation of evidence.after a hearing,the district court denied in part plaintiffs motion for sanctions and granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs claims.because the court finds that defendants actions fall outside the scope of the udtpa,we affirm.
carey is a associate professor at lonestar college in kingwood,texas.he is also a national football league players association nflpa contract advisor and the founder of champion pro consulting group,located in houston,texas.in november,quinn contacted carey about serving as his contract advisor,after being introduced to carey by a mutual friend.carey eventually met with quinn and his family in north carolina,and they signed a standard representation agreement sra on december.at the time carey entered into the sra with quinn,he represented one other nfl player quinn was the first rookie whom he represented.
in addition to the sra,quinn and his father also entered a financial assistance agreement faa with carey.the faa provided for carey paying quinn his father in five equal installments beginning december,and ending on june.the initial payment was made in the form of in cash to quinn and in a check to his father at the time of signing the sra.the sra did not mention the faa and a copy of the faa was not filed with the nflpa.
the nfl locked out its players from march to july.during the lockout,the teams did not communicate with players and were not negotiating nfl player contracts.in addition,the nflpa discontinued its agent regulation system,making it possible for agents to contact and communicate with players under existing contracts with other agents,something that is normally prohibited by the nflpa.defendants admit that they met with quinn twice during the lockout,in and of,and that they had wanted to represent quinn since at least may of.
the parties dispute the extent to which defendants interacted with quinn through intermediaries,specifically,todd stewart stewart,marvin austin austin,and christina quinn christina quinn.defendants admit that stewart worked for defendants on a trial basis from through and acted as an intermediary between quinn and impact sports beginning in june.however,they dispute the extent to which stewart was compensated for his efforts.while stewart claims he does not remember receiving money from impact sports,a former impact sports employee,sean kiernan,testified in his deposition that he recalls seeing advances paid to stewart through western union during and,in amounts as high as per month.
defendants further deny that any interaction between quinn and austin,or between quinn and christina quinn,occurred at defendants behest.austin plays in the nfl for the denver broncos and previously played football with quinn at the university of north carolina.christina quinn began dating quinn in and they are now married.plaintiffs point to an email defendant fleming sent on july,in which he states that he and austin are making a hard push at quinn today.they also cite a number of calls that occurred between fleming,austin,stewart,and christina quinn.the calls between fleming,stewart,and austin date back as early as november,and the evidence shows christina quinn being on calls with fleming and stewart starting june.
the nfl held a draft in april,in which quinn was drafted fourteenth in the first round by the louis rams.according to carey,after the nfl draft,he negotiated various promotional deals on quinn behalf and arranged for quinn to travel to louis to look for a home in july.on july,quinn terminated his sra with carey by fax.the nfl lockout then ended,and on july,quinn entered into an sra with tony fleming,an nflpa certified contract advisor who is affiliated with impact sports football based in boca raton,florida.along with the sra,fleming and quinn entered into a marketing advance agreement,wherein fleming advanced quinn to be repaid out of any future marketing income that fleming generated for him.according to defendants,the advance was disclosed to and accepted by the nflpa.on august,quinn signed a contract with the louis rams for over his first four seasons with a signing bonus of.
on january,carey filed a grievance with the nflpa,alleging that quinn breached their sra and claiming he was entitled to quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services.the arbitrator found that carey was entitled to an award of,which compensated carey for hours of work as a contract advisor at an hourly rate of.
plaintiffs filed suit in federal court on january,asserting five claims unfair methods of competition tortious interference slander per se civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.the district court dismissed three of the claims after defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,leaving only the claims for unfair methods of competition and civil conspiracy.following discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.plaintiffs then filed a motion for sanctions in the form of default judgment or an adverse jury instruction directed against defendants,alleging that the defendants lost or deleted critical evidence,namely,text messages.on july,the district court denied in part and granted in part plaintiffs motion for sanctions and granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims.

plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their claim that defendants violated the udtpa.the district court found that even if defendants acted in the manner alleged by plaintiffs,such conduct would not violate the udtpa as a matter of law.plaintiffs disagree,arguing that defendants committed unfair and deceptive acts or practices by illegally using runners to recruit quinn as a client paying a large amount of money to quinn in the form of a marketing advance as a means of inducing him to terminate his sra with plaintiffs and committing these acts as a means of retaliating against plaintiffs.defendants deny these allegations and assert that there was nothing nefarious in giving quinn a marketing advance,a type of transaction typical in the industry.in defendants view,the conduct alleged by plaintiffs,even if taken to be true,can not establish any unfair or deceptive practices within the scope of the udtpa.they contend that carey has already arbitrated his grievance in the proper forum through the nflpa,and that the udtpa was not meant to address perceived wrongs in recruitment practices by contract advisors.
