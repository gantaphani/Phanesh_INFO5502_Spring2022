scott schneider was injured while exiting the best buy store located on the centre property.at the time of the incident,schneider was confined to a wheelchair.he alleged that he went to best buy to have speakers in his van repaired or replaced,and that while the work was underway,he was directed to exit the best buy store through a door located next to the installation bays.he asserted that immediately after he exited the store in his wheelchair,he turned his wheelchair to the left to begin down the sidewalk and was thrown off the curb and out of the wheelchair seriously injuring his femur and his hips.schneider,his wife,and his daughter sued the centre,best buy,and others in texas state court alleging that the defendants negligence and defects in the exit ramp,sidewalk,and curb outside the store caused his accident and subsequent injuries.

the district court granted travelers motion but denied pacific.specifically,the district court held that the centre was an additional insured under the pacific policy the pacific policy was primary and travelers was entitled as subrogee to recover from pacific the settlement costs travelers paid and travelers as subrogee was entitled to recover its attorneys fees and expenses incurred while defending the centre in the underlying action.pacific appealed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and apply the same legal standards as the district court summary judgment is appropriate when the record discloses that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law additionally,the district court interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law subject to de novo review 
the parties agree that the applicable contracts are governed by texas law.under texas law,insurance policies and indemnity agreements are contracts,and the general rules of contract interpretation apply an insurance policy terms are unambiguous if they have definite and certain legal meaning if the terms are unambiguous,the court must enforce the policy according to its plain meaning the parties disagreement regarding the extent of coverage does not create an ambiguity 
pacific argues that the centre is not an additional insured under the policy that it issued to best buy.the pacific policy additional insured endorsement provides coverage for an additional insured only w here best buy is required to provide such coverage by written contract before the date of loss.section of the lease agreement required best buy,as tenant,to obtain insurance and name the centre as an additional insured or,if best buy maintains a net worth of at least,permits best buy to all or part of this requirement.to determine whether best buy has a valid contractual obligation to name the centre as an additional insured,we must examine what is known under texas law as the express negligence rule 
a party may not obtain contractual indemnity for its own negligence under texas law unless fair notice requirements are satisfied,which include the express negligence doctrine and the conspicuousness requirement indemnity agreements must meet these requirements to ensure that the intent of the parties is clear and that the provisions are conspicuous the indemnity provision in the lease between best buy and the centre is broad and would require best buy to indemnify the centre from the centre own negligence.the parties agree that this aspect of the indemnity provision is void under texas law because it does not satisfy the fair notice requirements.
pacific contends that the lease requirements regarding insurance for the centre as an additional insured are similarly void because,pacific argues,the requirement that best buy name the centre as an additional insured solely supports the lease indemnity provision.the supreme court of texas has recognized that the express negligence doctrine in texas has been applied only to indemnity provisions,not provisions.insurance procurement,or additional insured,provisions are subject to the express negligence doctrine only if they directly support indemnity agreements.a contract provision that extends direct insured status as an additional insured is deemed to be separate and independent from the indemnity agreement 
the texas supreme court has considered an additional insured provision similar to the one contained in best buy lease with the centre in evanston insurance atofina petrochemicals,a service contract provided that triple s was to procure insurance i ncluding coverage for contractual liability insuring the indemnity agreement,and that triple s was to furnish certificates of insurance showing atofina as an additional insured the texas court held that this brief statement requiring triple s to include atofina as an additional insured was clear enough and sufficient to extend insured status to atofina for its own negligence.the lease between best buy and the centre similarly required best buy to name landlord the centre as additional insured.
it is also instructive that the texas supreme court in evanston insurance expressly disapproved of a lower court decision in another case,emery air freight general transport systems,in which the lower court had refused to enforce a contractual provision requiring one party to include the other as an additional insured the contractual provisi
