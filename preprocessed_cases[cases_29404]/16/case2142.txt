in this diversity contract action governed by the substantive law of tennessee,baptist alleges that humana,a private government contractor administering the managed healthcare program in regions and for the department of defense,underpaid baptist for separate claims for a total underpayment of over million.the humana baptist contract defines a reimbursement scheme that is the center of the controversy.humana has raised a defense to payment based on federal regulations limiting amounts that the government itself will pay to humana as reimbursement on individual medical claims,and the question is whether these regulations place a limit on the amount humana must pay baptist.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of humana.we conclude that the federal regulations incorporated by reference into the agreement between baptist and humana regulate only the amount the government can contract to pay humana and not the amount humana as an independent contractor can promise to pay baptist.because these regulations do not prohibit the reimbursement provisions in the network provider agreement,we reverse.
background 
pursuant to authority delegated to it by congress,the department of defense established the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services,called champus,in.champus beneficiaries include retired armed forces personnel and dependents of both active and retired military personnel.in,the department of defense established tricare,a managed health care program operating as a supplement to champus and involving the competitive selection of private contractors to financially underwrite the delivery of health care services under champus.the overall goal of the tricare program is to improve the quality,cost,and accessibility of healthcare to the nation military through the mechanism of a managed care program,and one aspect of the new tricare program was the establishment of civilian preferred provider networks.see p.tricare management activity,which was previously known as office of champus,is the government office charged with the responsibility of administering.
in january,humana military healthcare services,was awarded the tricare contract for regions and,which covers seven states and includes the state of tennessee.under the contract,humana became the managed care support contractor charged with the responsibility of establishing and managing a civilian preferred provider network throughout the seven state area.humana established the preferred provider network by entering into contractual arrangements with individual champus participating providers of medical services,one of which was baptist.broadly speaking,tricare preferred network providers agreed to accept from a managed care support contractor lower reimbursement rates than those authorized under the champus reimbursement system,with the understanding that in exchange they would see an increase in directed volume.these discounted rates might be expressed as discounts from the maximum allowable rate under the champus diagnostic grouping system drg or as a fixed per diem rate,or as some other rate of reimbursement.
in the early spring of,baptist physician hospital organization,and baptist hospital of east tennessee,or more simply baptist,entered into negotiations with humana to become a tricare preferred network provider.in the course of negotiations,baptist offered a system of discounted reimbursement from the champus rates depending on the number of other tricare providers in the area.on august,the parties entered into a by which humana agreed to the system,the hospital payment arrangement,which was expressed as a percentage discount off the champus drg reimbursement rate with a stop loss provision in the italicized language below consisting of an increased rate of payment for certain inpatient claims as an alternative to a percentage discount from standard government rates.the purpose of the provision is to reduce the risk of losses to baptist in large individual cases that baptist believed the percentage discount off champus drg rates would create.the contractual provision was expressed as follows 
baptist health system as exclusive provider 
discount from champus drg rates 
any case with provider charges greater than reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
baptist health system additional provider 
discount from champus drg rates 
any case with provider charges greater than reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
baptist health system additional providers 
discount from champus drg rates 
any case with provider charges greater than reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
emphasis added.under each tier,baptist and humana agreed to the stop loss language which increased reimbursement to baptist when a particular inpatient hospital stay exceeded a certain dollar amount.in such cases,the reimbursement rate would not be a percentage discount off the champus drg rate,but rather would revert to a percentage discount off the provider charges,which are the charges the hospital would otherwise charge for the services rendered.
an example illustrates how the stop loss provision would work.suppose a certain hospital stay resulted in provider charges of,but the maximum champus drg reimbursement rate for this particular stay is only.without the stop loss provision,baptist as the exclusive tricare provider under the above agreement would receive,which represents a discount from the champus drg rate and an effective discount from provider charges.under the stop loss provision,however,baptist would receive,or a discount from the provider charges.in effect,the stop loss provision operates to increase the net overall discount for the business associated with the tricare program.
as illustrated above,for certain claims the reimbursement amount calculated as a percentage of provider charges was greater than of the champus drg rate.for each of these claims,humana unilaterally capped the reimbursement amount at of the champus drg rate.after discovering in that humana was not paying these claims in full according to the terms of the stop loss provision,baptist demanded payment of the difference.according to baptist,humana refused to honor the provision,insisting instead on renegotiating the contract.attempts to renegotiate were unsuccessful,and humana exercised its right to terminate the agreement.on december,baptist filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and seeking just over million in damages.on may,humana filed a motion for summary judgment.on that same day,baptist filed a motion to amend its complaint to add claims for promissory fraud,promissory estoppel and violations of the tennessee consumer protection act.baptist moved for partial summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.the district court granted humana motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim,and in a separate opinion and order,dismissed the remaining claims as having been filed out of time under the applicable limitations periods.
baptist appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of humana on the breach of contract claim and the dismissal of the promissory estoppel claim for failure to file within three years of accrual.we review de novo the district court order granting summary judgment de novo,see peters lincoln,cir,as well as the the district court order dismissing baptist claim based on promissory estoppel,see valassis communications aetna cas.sur,cir.
discussion 
under tennessee law,in reviewing a contract for ambiguities,the court considers the contract as a whole.williamson county broad.intermedia partners,gredig tennessee farmers mut.ins.a contract is ambiguous only when it is of uncertain meaning and may fairly be understood in more ways than one.a strained construction may not be placed on the language used to find ambiguity where none exists.bank clemmer.however,a contract is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties disagree as to the interpretation of one or more of its provisio
