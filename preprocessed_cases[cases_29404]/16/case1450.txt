background 
in august,richards suffered damage to her residence as a result of hurricane katrina.dissatisfied with the amount of the initial settlement offer from her insurance company,richards retained schoenberger to pursue her claims for an increased insurance settlement amount.in so doing,she entered into a contingency fee contract with schoenberger whereby he would receive of any recovery by richards from her insurer above the initial settlement amount.
schoenberger successfully obtained an increased recovery from the insurance company on behalf of richards in the amount of.the insurance company issued settlement checks payable to richards,schoenberger,and american home because richards insurance policy dictated that the loss was also payable to american home as an additional payee.american home currently holds a mortgage on richards property.schoenberger requested that american home endorse the check.american home refused to do so and sought the full insurance proceeds on the grounds that its mortgage balance exceeds that sum.
eventually,the entirety of the settlement funds were deposited into the registry of the court.schoenberger then intervened in richards suit against the insurance company and interpleaded american home to determine his right to withdraw of any additional recovery above the initial settlement amount originally offered,in accordance with his contingency fee agreement with richards.schoenberger moved for summary judgment seeking judgment in his favor totaling in fees in court costs,plus interest.the district court granted his motion,awarding schoenberger the amount of attorney fees provided by his contingency agreement with richards.american home timely appealed.thus,the central substantive question on appeal is,under louisiana law,does the statutory privilege accorded to attorneys to recover their fees from amounts obtained in settlement of their client claim rank as a first privilege in preference to other creditors 
american home says no and contends that summary judgment was improper because its rights as a payee are superior to schoenberger privilege for his attorney fees.consequently,american home contends that any interest that schoenberger may have in the settlement proceeds attaches only to richards recovery and not to the portion that is owed to american home lastly,american home contends that it is not bound by schoenberger contingency fee contract because it was not recorded before execution of the settlement.
meanwhile,schoenberger argues that louisiana law provides him a statutory privilege which entitles him to a first cut of the settlement proceeds in accordance with his continency fee agreement.schoenberger also argues that there is no need for attorneys to record their continency fee agreement in order to affect a client creditor when the funds have not been disbursed.schoenberger stresses that he is only seeking a privilege on insurance proceeds he is not seeking to prime american home mortgage on the property.
