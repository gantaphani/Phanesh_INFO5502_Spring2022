in this interlocutory appeal,the insurance approximately homeowner insurance claims brought by the state of louisiana based upon policyholders purported assignments of policy rights to the state.because no controlling louisiana supreme court precedent has determined whether an insurance contract clause prohibits assignments of policy rights,because this issue is,and because either the state or the insurers stand to lose billions of dollars in claims,we certify the assignment question to the louisiana supreme court.
factual background and procedural history 
to provide relief in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita,congress appropriated federal funds,administered by the department of housing and urban development hud,to affected states.louisiana distributed some of those funds via the road home program,which provided grants of up to dollars to louisiana homeowners to repair uninsured or property damage.purporting to fulfill an obligation under federal law to prevent recipients from receiving any duplication of benefits,the state required road home grant recipients to execute a limited agreement.it stated,in pertinent part 
hereby assign to the state of louisiana to the extent of the grant proceeds awarded or to be awarded to me under the road home program,all of claims and future rights to reimbursement and all payments hereafter received or to be received by a under any policy of casualty or property damage insurance or flood insurance on the residence,excluding contents residence described in for homeowner assistance under the program policies b from fema,small business administration,and any other federal agency,arising out of physical damage to the residence caused by hurricane katrina hurricane rita.
according to the state,the road home program created perverse incentives for insurance companies and insured insurers inadequately adjusted and paid homeowners claims,and some homeowners had little motivation to file claims or challenge low insurance settlements.consequently,road home applications and grant amounts drastically increased,creating a one billion dollar projected shortfall in the program.
to remedy this situation,and pursuant to the assignment agreements,the state sued the all of the insurers who wrote property insurance in louisiana at the time of the state court in orleans parish.the state sought to recover the funds expended and anticipated to be expended under the road home program and a declaration of the insurers duties under the all risk policies they had issued to road home applicants.
the defendants successfully removed the case to federal district court under the class action fairness act cafa according to the defendants,the insurance industry has paid more than billion dollars to homeowners as a result of katrina and rita losses.the insurers argue that the state suit is an attempt to obtain yet more money from the insurers,even in situations where the homeowner was satisfied with the amount paid,had already filed a lawsuit against the insurer,or had reached a settlement agreement.moreover,the state brought suit without investigating whether the defendants had actually failed to make sufficient payment on individual homeowners claims.
the defendants subsequently filed a rule b motion to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the state claims failed as a matter of law because clauses in the homeowner policies invalidated the purported assignments to the state and the state claims are by the contractual suit limitation period in the policies if the insured did not sue the insurer or the state did not obtain an assignment within two years of the loss.
making an erie guess the district court denied the motion to dismiss,holding that the contractual provisions did not bar assignments under louisiana law and that the state filing of the putative class action lawsuit tolled the contractual suit limitation periods in the policies.the district court also denied the defendants motion for reconsideration,but certified that order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
the parties have not moved this court to certify the assignment question to the louisiana supreme court,but the state did not object to certification when questioned at oral argument.moreover,louisiana supreme court rule xii,section,provides that certification may be invoked by any circuit court of appeal of the united states upon its own motion we are acutely aware that c ertification is not a panacea for resolution of those complex or difficult state law questions which have not been answered by the highest court of the state,transcon.gas pipeline transp.ins,cir,but certification may be advisable where important state interests are at stake and the state courts have not provided clear guidance on how to proceed.free abbott,cir citing,at.certification is advisable here.
louisiana civil code article 
when faced with unsettled questions of louisiana law,federal courts adhere to louisiana civilian process,by first examining primary sources of law the constitution,codes,and statutes.moore state farm fire cas,cir.to determine whether the insurance contracts clauses bar assignments to the state,the defendants contend that louisiana civil code article is the beginning and end of the matter.article provides that a right can not be assigned when the contract from which it arises prohibits assignment of that right.because the policies clauses broadly prohibit any assignment without the insurers consent,the insurers argue that the assignments to the state are invalid.
the state responds,and we agree,that article begs the question presented in this case whether louisiana courts would interpret the clauses in these homeowner insurance policies as prohibiting assignments.louisiana interpretive rules provide that w hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.ann.the clauses at issue here are broadly worded and clearly do not exclude assignments from the prohibition,but,like article,article does not end the inquiry because even unambiguous insurance contract provisions can not conflict with statutory law or public policy.see william shelby mckenzie alston johnson,iii.civ.treatise,insurance law and practice ed.thus,the issue before this court is whether the louisiana supreme court would hold that a contractual prohibition on assignments violates public policy.
the louisiana supreme court has not answered this question,so we look to the decisions of intermediate state courts for guidance,terrebonne parish sch.bd.columbia gulf transmission,cir citations omitted.unfortunately,the louisiana appellate decisions conflict.
geddes moss,lucien tile,and the majority rule 
the state points to a louisiana appellate court case,geddes moss undertaking embalming metro.life ins,so,which invalidated an clause as applied to a assignment of the right to life insurance proceeds.geddes moss cited the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions and reflected in leading treatises that clauses are contrary to public policy when applied to assignments.id.at.indeed,the general majority rule supports the geddes moss conclusion.see d insurance general stipulations in policies prohibiting their assignment except with the insurer consent apply only to assignments before loss,and accordingly do not prevent an assignment of a claim or an interest in insurance money then due a provision against an assignment after loss is generally held unenforceable,as inconsistent with the covenant of indemnity or the right to assign a claim for money due,and as contrary to public policy.couch on ins.the great majority of courts adhere to the rule that general stipulations in policies prohibiting assignments thereof except with the consent of the insurer apply only to assignments before loss the assignment before loss involves a transfer of a contractual relationship while the assignment after loss is the transfer of a right to a money claim.according to the cases,the predominant purpose of a clause is to protect the insurer from unanticipated underwriting exposure,but aft
