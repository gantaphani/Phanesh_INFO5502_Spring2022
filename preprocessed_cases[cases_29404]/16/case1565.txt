citibank texas,citibank sued progressive casualty insurance progressive as the issuer of a financial institution bond the bond,claiming progressive should cover a loss citibank sustained in a prior state court action filed against it by a depositor on a claim of unauthorized endorsement.both citibank and progressive filed motions for summary judgment.the district court agreed with citibank on its breach of contract claim and held progressive liable for citibank loss.as we now disagree with the district court holdings that progressive is collaterally estopped from contesting the state court determination and the endorsements were unauthorized within the intendment of the bond,we reverse the district court and render a judgment against citibank.
facts and proceedings 
goldenlife was a texas limited partnership formed by todd lindley to develop and operate a skilled nursing facility in richardson,texas.lindley was also the president and owner of pilatus company,goldenlife general partner.the limited partners of goldenlife invested in the partnership.between february and september of,citibank allowed lindley,an authorized signatory on goldenlife account as well as on another citibank account in the name of lindley properties,to endorse and deposit into his personal lindley properties account sixteen checks payable to goldenlife totaling.lindley used these goldenlife funds in an unauthorized manner,inconsistent with the intent of the goldenlife partnership 
in,after goldenlife discovered lindley misuse of the funds,it accused citibank of conversion for allowing lindley to misdeposit the sixteen checks into his own account and filed a suit for damages against citibank in texas state court.progressive was citibank insurer under the bond,which provided up to in coverage for losses resulting from counterfeiting,forgeries,unauthorized signatures,and other dishonest or fraudulent acts.under the bond,progressive had the right but not the obligation to join in citibank defense of the state court action but,at its election,declined to do so.the state court bifurcated the trial,first addressing liability and eventually entering partial summary judgment in favor of goldenlife on that facet of the claim.the court reasoned that,as citibank had accepted and paid checks belonging to goldenlife with lindley unauthorized endorsements,citibank had taken the checks with notice of lindley breach of fiduciary duty and thus was not a holder in due course.the state court held citibank responsible for misdepositing goldenlife checks.subsequent to this liability determination,and prior to the court determination of the amount of goldenlife loss,citibank and goldenlife settled their dispute for.
citibank then sought reimbursement from progressive for the settlement payment.insuring agreement d of the bond indemnified citibank for l oss resulting directly from f orgery or alteration of,on or in any negotiable instrument under the bond unauthorized signature rider the rider,insuring agreement d was modified as follows accepting,paying or cashing any negotiable instruments or withdrawal orders that bear unauthorized signatures or endorsements shall be deemed to be a forgery under this insuring agreement.as the state court had held that lindley endorsements of the goldenlife checks were unauthorized,citibank contended that these checks were unauthorized endorsements,and thus forgeries for purposes of insuring agreement d,as modified by the rider,making citibank underlying state court loss to its depositor recoverable under the bond.
when progressive refused payment,citibank sued in federal court for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in violation of the texas insurance code.citibank sought to recover the amount of its settlement less the bond deductible attorneys fees incurred in defending the goldenlife case in state court and damages for its breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim.progressive took the position that the bond did not cover any part of the sum for which citibank had been held liable to goldenlife in state court.
the district court held for citibank on its breach of contract claim but denied recovery on its claims for attorneys fees incurred in defending the goldenlife case in state court and bad faith violations of the texas insurance code.the court stated two alternative bases for its holding that citibank settlement payment was a loss covered by the bond.first,the court credited citibank reliance on the doctrine of collateral estoppel,rejecting progressive contention that it was not bound by the state court judgment and could contest the bond coverage of citibank loss by relitigating the issue of citibank liability to goldenlife for honoring purportedly unauthorized endorsements.the court ruled,in the alternative,that even if progressive were not collaterally estopped from relitigating whether lindley endorsements were unauthorized for the purpose of the bond,the district court would hold,as had the state court on the merits,that lindley endorsements were unauthorized under the bond.the district court held progressive liable for the settlement amount less the bond deductible,plus and interest,and attorneys fees incurred in federal court,awarding citibank approximately progressive timely filed a notice of appeal.

iii.analysis 
collateral estoppel 
the fourth paragraph general agreement f of the bond stipulates that if the underwriter elects not to defend any causes of action,neither a judgment against the insured,nor a settlement of any legal proceeding by the insured,shall determine the existence,extent or amount of coverage under this bond for loss sustained by the insured progressive interprets this language to mean that citibank is required to prove that lindley endorsements were unauthorized under the bond,independently of the state court judgment,the bond bars the state court decision from having collateral estoppel effect.citibank counters that general agreement f prevents a judgment or settlement from determining the bond coverage,but not progressive liability if an insurer elects not to participate in the defense of such a action,collateral estoppel may still apply to the issue of liability.agreeing with citibank interpretation,the district court held that progressive is collaterally estopped from attacking the state court holding that lindley endorsement were unauthorized.the district court reasoned that general agreement f explicitly gave progressive the right to conduct or support citibank state court defense and that progressive had notice of the goldenlife suit,yet progressive declined to participate in it.this,concluded the district court,bound progressive to the state court determination.
the district court appeared to follow precedent,as an insurer who has the duty to defend a suit against an insured but fails to do so is generally bound by the liability judgment in that suit the court failed to distinguish,however,between the ubiquitous general liability policy,under which an insurer is duty bound to defend as well as to indemnify the insured,but may do so under a reservation of rights and the financial institution bond issued in the instant case,under which progressive had the option but not the duty to defend,and if opting not to defend,would do so without waiving its defenses.the third paragraph of general agreement f of the bond specifies that,i f the underwriter elects to defend the insured,a judgment or settlement of any claim,and all fees and costs,shall be a loss covered by the bond thus,under the bond,progressive had no legal ability to defend citibank in state court under a reservation of rights if progressive had opted to defend citibank,it would have committed itself not only to pay citibank defense costs but also to pay the full amount of any judgmen
