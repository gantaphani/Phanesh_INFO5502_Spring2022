on the morning of august,hurricane katrina struck along the coast of the gulf of mexico,devastating portions of louisiana and mississippi.in the city of new orleans,some of the most significant damage occurred when levees along three major street canal,the industrial canal,and the london avenue,permitting water from the flooded canals to inundate the city.at one point in katrina aftermath,approximately eighty percent of the city was submerged in water.
each plaintiff in this case is a policyholder with homeowners,renters,or insurance whose property was damaged during the new orleans flooding.despite exclusions in their policies providing that damage caused by flood is not covered,the plaintiffs seek recovery of their losses from their insurers.their primary contention is that the massive inundation of water into the city was the result of the negligent design,construction,and maintenance of the levees and that the policies flood exclusions in this context are ambiguous because they do not clearly exclude coverage for an inundation of water induced by negligence.the plaintiffs maintain that because their policies are ambiguous,we must construe them in their favor to effect coverage for their losses.
we conclude,however,that even if the plaintiffs can prove that the levees were negligently designed,constructed,or maintained and that the breaches were due to this negligence,the flood exclusions in the plaintiffs policies unambiguously preclude their recovery.regardless of what caused the failure of the structures that were put in place to prevent such a catastrophe,their failure resulted in a widespread flood that damaged the plaintiffs property.this event was excluded from coverage under the plaintiffs insurance policies,and under louisiana law,we are bound to enforce the unambiguous terms of their insurance contracts as written.accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover under their policies.
factual background and procedural history 
the cases in this appeal are a handful of the more than forty currently pending cases related to hurricane katrina that have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the eastern district of louisiana.in several of the consolidated cases,property owners are suing their insurers to obtain recovery under homeowners,renters,and policies for the damage their property sustained during the inundation of water into the city that accompanied the hurricane.this appeal involves four such cases richard vanderbrook et unitrin preferred insurance company et the vanderbrook action,xavier university of louisiana travelers property casualty company of america the xavier action,gladys chehardy et state farm fire casualty company et the chehardy action,and kelly humphreys encompass indemnity company the humphreys action the detailed factual and procedural background of each of these cases follows.
a.the vanderbrook action 
in the vanderbrook action,eight individuals the vanderbrook plaintiffs filed a petition for damages in louisiana state court against their insurers the vanderbrook plaintiffs allege that s ometime between and on august,before the full force of hurricane katrina reached the city of new orleans,a small section of the concrete outfall canal wall known as the street canal,suddenly broke,causing water to enter the streets of the c ity,resulting in damage to their insured property.they assert that the water damage was not the result of flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,tsunami,seiche,overflow of a body of water,seepage under or over the outfall canal wall or spray from any of the above but was water intrusion,caused simply from a broken levee wall.
the vanderbrook plaintiffs allege that their insurers have refused to adjust or pay for their losses,despite a sudden break in the concrete wall of the levee outfall canal not being described in any of their policies as an excluded loss.they assert that their insurance policies are contracts of adhesion and are unduly and unreasonably complex,resulting in their lack of understanding of the policies provisions.and they allege that the policies exclusions are so oppressive to them and unreasonably favorable to the insurers that the exclusions are unconscionable and void.the vanderbrook plaintiffs seek compensatory damages,additional damages for the insurers arbitrary and capricious conduct,interest,expert fees,and attorney fees.
james capella and madeline grenier were insured through hanover insurance company hanover,peter ascani iii and gregory jackson were insured through standard fire insurance company standard fire,and richard vanderbrook was insured through unitrin preferred insurance company unitrin.the hanover standard fire,and unitrin policies provide coverage for risk of direct physical loss to structures on the property as well as for certain risks of loss to personal property,as long as the loss is not an excluded peril.the policies contain the following flood exclusion 
we do not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.
water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind 
mary jane silva and robert harvey were insured through state farm fire and casualty company state farm.the state farm policies insured against loss to the dwelling and for certain losses to personal property except as excluded by the policy.the policies contained the following flood exclusion 
we do not insure under any coverage for any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.we do not insure for such loss regardless of a the cause of the excluded event or b other causes of the loss or c whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss or d whether the event occurs suddenly or gradually,involves isolated or widespread damage,arises from natural or external forces,or occurs as a result of any combination of these 
water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,all whether driven by wind or not 
the vanderbrook action was removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.hanover,standard fire,unitrin,and state farm filed rule c motions for judgment on the pleadings,contending that the vanderbrook plaintiffs losses were excluded under their respective policies.in a single order issued on november,the district court addressed the availability of coverage under the policies at issue in all four cases in this appeal,first addressing the vanderbrook action.with respect to hanover,standard fire,and unitrin,the district court denied their motions and ruled that the plaintiffs policies insured them against loss from water damage resulting from levee breaches where the breaches were induced by negligence.the court determined that the policies flood exclusions were ambiguous because the term flood was susceptible to two reasonable definitions one that relates to floods resulting from natural causes only and one that relates to floods resulting from both natural causes and negligent or intentional acts.
the district court reached this conclusion based on several sources.first,the court discussed dictionary definitions of the term flood and opined that the definitions contemplated a natural event caused by rain or tide.second,the court looked to cases interpreting water damage exclusions in the context of ruptured water mains,as well as earth movement exclusions,wherein courts have applied a distinction between naturally and occurring events.finally,the court considered but rejected cases that interpreted flood exclusions as extending to inundations of water caused by the rupture of a dam or dike.
having concluded that the term flood as used in the exclusions was ambiguous,the district court construed the hanover,standard fire,and unitrin policies in the insureds favor and concluded that the policies covered water damage caused by a ruptured levee where the rupture was due to the levee inadequate design,construction,or maintenance.because the plaintiffs alleged that the inundation of water into the city of new orleans was caused by negligent design,construction,and maintenance of the levees alongside the city canals,the court decided that if the plaintiffs could prove their allegations,they could prevail.accordingly,the district court denied hanover,standard fire,and unitrin motions.
with respect to state farm policies,however,the district court concluded that the flood exclusion clause removed any ambiguity and clearly excluded coverage for all floods,whether natural or not.the language on which the district court relied provides in part we do not insure for such loss,loss resulting from flood regardless of the cause of the excluded event or whether the event arises from natural or external forces.the court granted state farm motions and dismissed the actions against it.
b.the xavier action 
xavier university of louisiana xavier filed suit against its insurer,travelers property casualty company of america travelers,in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.in its complaint,xavier alleged that hurricane katrina caused in excess of million in damage to insured structures on its campus.the complaint itself does not allege how the damage was,by water inundation from failed levees or otherwise.xavier avers that it has filed a claim with travelers and that despite lengthy communication,the insurer has failed to pay for the damage to xavier campus.xavier brings claims for breach of contract and for violations of various provisions of title of the louisiana revised statutes,seeking compensatory damages,attorney fees,and statutory penalties.
xavier commercial policy with travelers provided coverage for direct physical loss to buildings and personal property,subject to policy limitations and exclusions.the policy contained the following flood exclusion 
we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.
flood,surface water,waves,tides,tidal waves,overflow of any body of water,or their spray,all whether driven by wind or not 
xavier filed a motion for partial summary judgment,seeking a ruling that as a matter of law the damage to xavier campus was caused by ground water which came from the collapses of the street canal and the london avenue canal levees as a result of causes and such damage was covered under xavier policy with travelers.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.for the same reasons that the court denied hanover,unitrin,and standard fire motions in the vanderbrook action,the court granted partial summary judgment in xavier favor on the second issue,determining that water damage resulting from a failed levee due to negligence would be covered under the insurance policy.but the court denied xavier motion on the question whether the damage to the campus was in fact caused by the collapses of the levees,concluding that there were material questions of fact as to the cause of xavier water damage.
c.the chehardy action 
in the chehardy action,a group of thirty individuals and one corporation the chehardy plaintiffs allege that their real and personal property was damaged or destroyed by the inundation of water into the city of new orleans that followed hurricane katrina.they bring a putative class against their insurers,asserting that their losses were covered by their respective insurance policies.
the defendants in the chehardy action are thirteen insurance companies.among them is a group of insurers hereinafter called the iso defendants,so named because these insurers used policy forms provided by insurance services office.the iso defendants are lafayette insurance company lafayette,liberty mutual fire insurance company liberty mutual,american insurance company american,auto club family insurance company auto club,standard fire,lexington insurance company lexington,aegis security insurance company aegis,and hanover.the remaining chehardy defendants are allstate indemnity company and allstate insurance company collectively,allstate,louisiana citizens property insurance corporation louisiana citizens,encompass insurance company of america encompass insurance,and great northern insurance company great northern,as well as state farm.
in their amended complaint,the chehardy plaintiffs allege that after hurricane katrina made landfall on august,the new levee system was breached in at least eight places,causing water to be released into the city and adjoining parishes.according to the amended complaint,by on august,approximately three hours after the hurricane landfall,there was six to eight feet of water in the lower ninth ward area of new orleans,and approximately eighty percent of orleans parish ultimately became submerged.the plaintiffs aver their properties sustained damage as a result of these events.
the chehardy plaintiffs also allege that any damages attributable to the levee failures are the result of improper negligent design,construction,or maintenance of the levees by various third parties and or third party negligence.the complaint refers to engineering reports concluding that the vast amounts of the water that entered the city of new orleans and the surrounding parishes came about as the result of levee failures caused by negligent design,negligent maintenance inadequate materials and not by topping of the levees.the complaint also summarizes the testimony of the chief of the army corps of engineers that the corps neglected to consider the possibility that the levee walls atop the street canal levee would lurch away from their footings under significant water pressure and eat away at the earthen barriers below and that t he levees simply failed to work the way they were supposed to work.additionally,the complaint alleges that the levee breach of the industrial canal to the lower ninth ward side was caused by an inadequately moored barge that crashed into the levee wall,rupturing the levee and compromising its ability to hold water back.
the chehardy plaintiffs assert in their complaint that each was insured under an insurance policy and that their losses are covered perils under their policies.they allege that they timely filed claims with their insurers but their insurers denied coverage and have refused to indemnify them.the chehardy plaintiffs acknowledge that their policies contained flood exclusions,but they assert that these exclusions should not be read so broadly as to disallow coverage for their damages because to do so would contravene the very purpose of policies.they posit that the reasonable expectations of louisiana policyholders would be that flood would encompass overflowing of the mississippi river,accumulation of water due to heavy rainfalls,or similar phenomena,but not the failing of the levees due to negligent conduct beyond their control.additionally,they opine in their complaint that they should not be deprived of coverage where the insurers have drafted vague,ambiguous and unclear limitations on coverage they allege that although other policies on the market clearly exclude harm caused by the failure of levees,theirs do not.
the chehardy plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the efficient proximate causes of their damage were windstorm,acts of negligence,and storm surge,all of which were covered perils that t he breaking or failure of boundaries of lakes,reservoirs,rivers,streams,or other bodies of water was a peril not specifically excluded by any of the policies and that t he damage caused by water entering the city of new orleans due to the breaches in the levees neither falls within the regular definition of flood,nor within any of the subject insurance policies exclusions of flood.the chehardy plaintiffs also bring claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and insurance bad faith under section of the louisiana revised statutes.additionally,the plaintiffs bring claims for breach of fiduciary duty against state farm,allstate,liberty mutual,and other insurers who sell their homeowners insurance policies directly to their customers.
the chehardy plaintiffs did not include in their complaint the pertinent language from their insurance policies,nor did they attach the policies or identify which plaintiff was insured through which defendant.instead,copies of the policies were attached to the defendants motions seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs claims 
the policies of american,auto club,hanover,lafayette,lexington,liberty mutual,standard fire,and louisiana citizens are nearly identical in every respect relevant to this appeal.all of these policies provide coverage for risk of direct physical loss to structures on the property as long as the risk is not an excluded peril.they also provide coverage for direct physical loss to personal property but only if the loss is caused by an enumerated peril and not by an excluded peril.with respect to both structures and personal property,the policies contain a list of exclusions that are not insured them,flood.the flood exclusions provide 
we do not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.
water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind 
the aegis policy is identical in all relevant respects to the above policies,with the exception of the clause before the flood exclusion.aegis policy contains an endorsement deleting the clause that excludes coverage for loss caused directly or indirectly by water damage regardless of any other cause and replacing it with the following we do not insure for loss caused by any of the following.the effect is that aegis flood exclusion reads as follows 
we do not insure for loss caused by any of the following.
water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind 
the great northern policies provide coverage for risk of physical loss to the home and its contents except where provided otherwise or excluded by a policy exclusion.the policies contain a surface water exclusion,which provides 
surface water.we do not cover any loss caused by 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,or water borne material from any of these 
overflow of water or water borne material from a body of water 
from any source,even if driven by wind.
the policies also define caused by as any loss that is contributed to,made worse by,or in any way results from that peril.
the allstate policies provide coverage for losses to the dwelling and other structures on the insured property except as limited or excluded in the policies,as well as coverage for losses to personal property caused by certain enumerated causes and subject to exclusions.the policies contain the following flood exclusion 
we do not cover loss to insured property consisting of or caused by 
flood,including,but not limited to surface water,waves,tidal water or overflow of any body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind.
the state farm policies in the chehardy action are identical in every relevant respect to the state farm policies in the vanderbrook action.
each of the defendants in the chehardy action filed a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the iso defendants filed a consolidated motion to dismiss.the district court addressed only the claims for breach of contract and the request for declaratory relief.with respect to all defendants except state farm,the court denied the motions to dismiss for the same reasons it denied the motions for judgment on the pleadings in the vanderbrook action.with respect to state farm,however,the district court granted the motion to dismiss for the same reason it granted state farm motion in the vanderbrook action.as to the claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,insurance bad faith,and breach of fiduciary duty,the district court denied the motions to dismiss without prejudice to their being at a later time,after the resolution of this appeal.
d.the humphreys action 
in the humphreys action,kelly humphreys filed suit against her insurer,encompass indemnity company encompass indemnity,in louisiana state court humphreys alleges that as hurricane katrina passed through new orleans,the city began pumping storm water runoff through various feeder canals into and through the street and london avenue drainage canals into lake pontchartrain.as a result of a sudden and accidental event storm water drainage exerted pressure against the storm wall and levee erected along the canals,causing the levee and storm wall to collapse and result ing in storm waters being distributed over large portions of new orleans.humphreys alleges that the cause of the collapse was inadequate maintenance of the levee and storm wall on the part of the orleans levee district.she avers that as a result of these events,her residence was inundated with approximately inches of storm water causing major damage to building and contents.she asserts that the efficient proximate cause of her loss was the levee and collapse,not flood and surface water.humphreys states that encompass indemnity has failed to pay for her losses,which she asserts were covered under her policy.she brings claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and she seeks compensatory damages,attorney fees,and treble damages under various provisions of title of the louisiana revised statutes.
humphreys homeowners policy with encompass indemnity covers direct physical loss to real property,as well as direct physical loss to personal property if caused by an enumerated peril.both the coverage and the coverage are subject to exclusions,including the following exclusion 
we do not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.
real property and tangible personal property.we do not insure for loss 
caused by water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind 
the policy also contains the following hurricane deductible endorsement 
we will pay only that part of the total of the loss for all property coverages that exceeds the hurricane deductible stated on the coverage summary.the hurricane deductible shown on the coverage summary applies to all covered property for direct physical loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by a hurricane as defined below.such deductible applies regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.no other deductible provision in the policy applies to direct physical loss caused by a hurricane.in no event will the deductible applied for a hurricane loss be less than the property deductible shown on the coverage summary.
hurricane means wind,wind gust,hail,rain,tornado,cyclone or hurricane which results in direct physical loss or damage to property by a storm system that has been declared to be a hurricane by the national weather service 
all other provisions of this policy apply.
the humphreys action was removed to federal court.on june,humphreys and encompass indemnity settled and agreed to dismiss with prejudice pursuant to rule the portion of humphreys claims as well as the entirety of her claim.the parties stipulation of partial dismissal specified that the remaining claim was the claim to seek recovery for water damage under the policy.
the next day,humphreys moved for partial summary judgment,asking the district court to rule that her policy provided coverage for flood damage to her residence pursuant to the policy endorsement.at oral argument before the district court,according to the district court order,humphreys counsel also adopted the chehardy,vanderbrook,and xavier plaintiffs arguments concerning the ambiguity of the flood exclusion,and the district court therefore construed humphreys motion as also extending to the issue of the flood exclusion applicability 
the district court granted in part and denied in part humpreys motion.the court concluded that the endorsement did not itself create or extend coverage and denied humphreys motion on this issue.but for the same reasons that the court construed most of the policies in the vanderbrook,xavier,and chehardy actions as providing coverage,the court concluded that humphreys alleged damage was covered under her policy and granted partial summary judgment in her favor on this issue.
the district court certified that its orders involved a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion and that appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.all appellants and timely sought leave from this court to appeal from the district court interlocutory order pursuant to b,and we granted their requests.
all defendants except state farm now appeal the district court order concluding that the water damage resulting from the levee breaches was not excluded by their policies flood exclusions.the chehardy plaintiffs and the vanderbrook plaintiffs cross appeal the district court grant of state farm motions to dismiss.and humphreys cross appeals the district court denial of her motion for partial summary judgment on the issue whether her policy endorsement provides coverage for her losses.

flood exclusions 
the plaintiffs contend that their policies flood exclusions do not unambiguously exclude coverage for losses caused by an inundation of water resulting from a breached levee where the breach occurred in part because the levee was negligently designed,constructed,or maintained.the plaintiffs urge us to conclude that the term flood is ambiguous in this context and that the policies must be construed in favor of coverage.by contrast,the insurers maintain that the policies unambiguously exclude coverage for the inundation of water resulting from the breached levees.
the louisiana supreme court has not interpreted a flood exclusion in the context of breached levees.we must therefore make an erie guess and determine,in our best judgment,how that court would resolve the issue if presented with this case am.int l specialty lines ins,at.
the plaintiffs first contend that because the term flood is not defined in the policies,it is,the chehardy plaintiffs say that the term undefined status makes it per se us to construe the term in favor of coverage.but the fact that a term used in an exclusion is not defined in the policy itself alone does not make the exclusion ambiguous instead,the court will give the term its generally prevailing meaning.am.deposit ins,so d at citing.see also hendricks am.employers ins,so d,accord bay cities paving grading,lawyers mut.ins,cal th,d,rejecting rule that absence of definition makes term ambiguous even where term has generally accepted meaning and stating a ny rule that rigidly presumed ambiguity from the absence of a definition would be illogical and unworkable.to avoid the ambiguity perceived,an insurer would have to define every word in its policy,the defining words would themselves then have to be defined,their defining words would have to be defined,and the process would continue to replicate itself until the result became so cumbersome as to create impenetrable ambiguity.
the plaintiffs also maintain that because the insurers could have more explicitly excluded floods that are caused in part by negligence,their failure to do so in these policies makes the flood exclusions ambiguous.specifically,the chehardy plaintiffs point to evidence that before hurricane katrina struck,the insurer defendants knew about the availability of policy forms that more explicitly excluded floods caused in part by man but that they elected not to amend their policies language accordingly.xavier,which was insured through travelers,also points to its policy earth movement exclusion,which excludes earth movements whether natural or man made xavier asserts that travelers thus knew how to clearly exclude floods but did not do so.similarly,the district court compared the flood exclusions in most of the policies with those in the policies of state farm and hartford insurance company of the midwest remarking that those insurers succeeded with little effort in clearly excluding water damage resulting from negligent acts and that the other insurers could have done so as well.
but the fact that an exclusion could have been worded more explicitly does not necessarily make it ambiguous.see.ins.guar.ass n,so d at t hough the interstate policy could have more clearly delineated its payment obligation,that fact does not mandate the conclusion that the policy was legally ambiguous.quoting garmany mission ins,cir.nor does the fact that other policies have more explicitly defined the scope of similar exclusions.as the louisiana supreme court stated in cadwallader when interpreting the term relative 
the appellate court further erred in reaching a conclusion that because some insurance policies specifically include foster children in their policy definition of relative or family member,the term relative is somehow rendered ambiguous in the policy at issue.in making this assumption,the appellate court ignored the fundamental precept that it was required to interpret the term using its plain,ordinary and generally prevailing meaning as set forth in the policy at hand it is the particular insurance policy of the insured that establishes the limits of liability and it is well established that this contract of insurance is the law between the parties.when we find the contract of insurance is clear and unambiguous we must enforce the policy as written.
so d at.we therefore reject the plaintiffs arguments that the flood exclusions in the policies before us are ambiguous in light of more specific language used in other policies 
furthermore,even where the scope of an exclusion is not readily apparent,we do not immediately construe that exclusion in favor of coverage.instead,we first apply the general rules of contract construction set forth in the civil code.ins.guar.ass n,so d at.under those rules,we give the words of a contract their generally prevailing meaning.ann.dictionaries,treatises,and jurisprudence are helpful resources in ascertaining a term generally prevailing meaning.see gregor argenot great cent.ins,so d,dictionaries are a valuable source for determining the common and approved usage of words.cadwallader,so d at looking to dictionaries,treatises,and jurisprudence to interpret the term relative.when the words of a policy provision are clear and unambiguous in the context of the facts of the case and do not lead to an absurd result,we apply the provision as written without any further interpretation.see cloud auto.ins,so d.ann.
to ascertain the generally prevailing meaning of the term flood,we begin by considering dictionary definitions of the term.each of the dictionaries we have accessed lists more than one definition of flood,but the existence of more than one definition of a term does not itself make the term ambiguous.citation ins.gomez,see also webster third new international dictionary explanatory notes at explaining that when a word has multiple definitions,the best definition is the one that most aptly fits the context of an actual genuine utterance.likewise,when a word has two meanings,one broad and one more restrictive included within the broader meaning,it does not follow that the narrower meaning was intended.comm.union ins.advance coating,so d,see also falgout walter jester,hampton,so d.
the oxford english dictionary has two pertinent definitions of flood a n overflowing or irruption of a great body of water over land not usually submerged an inundation,a deluge and a profuse and violent outpouring of water a swollen stream,a torrent a violent downpour of rain,threatening an inundation.oxford english dictionary ed.webster dictionary defines flood as a rising and overflowing of a body of water that covers land not usu ally under water an outpouring of considerable extent a great downpour.webster third new international dictionary.the sixth edition of black law dictionary defines flood as follows an inundation of water over land not usually covered by it.water which inundates area of surface of earth where it ordinarily would not be expected to be.black law dictionary ed.flood itself is not defined in the current eighth edition of black law dictionary,but floodwater is defined as w ater that escapes from a watercourse in large volumes and flows over adjoining property in no regular channel.black law dictionary ed.the most straightforward definition comes from the american heritage dictionary an overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry.american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.finally,of particular interest is the discussion of flood in the columbia encyclopedia,which specifically includes in the definition the inundation of water resulting from the bursting of a levee 
i nundation of land by the rise and overflow of a body of water.floods occur most commonly when water from heavy rainfall,from melting ice and snow,or from a combination of these exceeds the carrying capacity of the river system,lake,or ocean into which it runs 
less predictable are floods resulting from the bursting of a natural or dam or levee.
in the united states the johnstown,flood of,in which thousands of lives were lost,was caused by the breaking of an earth dam above the city.
columbia encyclopedia ed emphasis added.
we also consider the definitions of flood in treatises.appleman insurance law and practice defines flood waters as those waters above the highest line of the ordinary flow of a stream,and generally speaking they have overflowed a river,stream,or natural water course and have formed a continuous body with the water flowing in the ordinary channel.john alan appleman jean appleman,insurance law and practice.and couch on insurance defines flood as the overflow of some body of water that inundates land not usually covered with water.steven plitt et,couch on insurance ed hereinafter couch.couch also states that the term flood is generally unambiguous.id.
additionally,we look to jurisprudence,both from louisiana courts and from courts outside louisiana.in riche state farm fire casualty,an intermediate louisiana court interpreted a policy exclusion for flood,surface water,tidal water or tidal wave,overflow of streams or other bodies of water,or spray from any of the foregoing,all whether driven by wind or not.so d.the plaintiff in riche was fishing in a boat on a lake when a windstorm caused the boat to sink,id.at,and he sought recovery under his homeowners insurance policy for the loss of his fishing gear,which was on the boat when it sank,id.at.the court held that the exclusion did not preclude the plaintiff recovery,reasoning that the exclusion,when read as a whole,contemplates only such damage caused by water which has risen over and covered areas not ordinarily covered by water and does not extend to damage caused by windstorm or resulting waves over a body of water,such as a lake or reservoir.id.at.riche,however,is of limited value in this case because its determination was simply that a exclusion applied only to losses that occurred on areas not normally covered by water,dry land and not to a loss occurring on a body of water.see id.at see also couch,supra,at citing riche for the proposition that b ecause a flood is generally understood to mean the inundation of land,claims by insurers that the inundation of a boat on the water is an excluded flood are generally unsuccessful.unlike in riche,the losses in this case occurred on land that is normally dry.
where courts outside louisiana have considered whether a flood exclusion similar to the ones here unambiguously precludes coverage for water damage resulting from the failure of a structure such as a dam or dike,they have uniformly declared that the inundation of water falls within the language of the exclusion.russell donaldson,annotation,what is flood within exclusionary clause of property damage policy,supp citing kane royal ins.of,bartlett cont l divide ins,and metal rubber,fed.ins,
the most prominent such case is kane,which arose in the context of the failure of the lawn lake dam in colorado.see at.as a result of the dam failure,water swept into the fall river and inundated the plaintiffs insured property,causing extensive damage.id.the plaintiffs argued that their policies provided coverage for the damage,even though the policies contained flood exclusions id.at.the colorado supreme court rejected this argument and construed the term flood as extending to the water damage resulting from the dam failure.the court relied in part on dictionary definitions and the definition of flood in appleman treatise and observed that t he inundation of insureds normally dry land falls squarely within these generally accepted definitions of the term flood.id.at.concluding that the term was unambiguous in light of its generally accepted meaning and in the context of the facts of the case,the court declared that there is no doubt that this inundation of water was a flood.id 
in wallis country mutual insurance,an illinois intermediate court stated that the plain and ordinary meaning of flood is water that escapes from a watercourse in large volumes and flows over adjoining property in no regular channel ending up in an area where it would not normally be expected.d.the court held that it was immaterial that a particular watercourse was originally as long as it had a defined bed,visible banks,and a recurrent water flow.see id.indeed,the court observed that a permanent watercourse with these characteristics is considered a natural watercourse.see id.at see also black law dictionary ed.if a watercourse is of a permanent character and has been maintained for a sufficient length of time,it may be considered a natural watercourse.accordingly,the wallis court held that water that had overflowed a creek banks and damaged the plaintiff house was a flood within the plain and ordinary meaning of the term,id.at,and that the plaintiff loss was excluded by his insurance policy flood exclusion,id.at.
in light of these definitions,we conclude that the flood exclusions are unambiguous in the context of this case and that what occurred here fits squarely within the generally prevailing meaning of the term flood.when a body of water its normal boundaries and inundates an area of land that is normally dry,the event is a flood.this is precisely what occurred in new orleans in the aftermath of hurricane katrina.three street,industrial,and london avenue their normal channels,and the levees built alongside the canals to hold back their floodwaters failed to do so.as a result,an enormous volume of water inundated the city.in common parlance,this event is known as a flood.
additionally,a levee is a structure its very purpose is to prevent the floodwaters of a watercourse from overflowing onto certain land areas,to prevent floods from becoming more widespread.see d levees and flood control defining levee as an embankment constructed along the edge of a river to prevent flooding and describing levees as one of three principal means of flood prevention and control webster third new international dictionary defining levee as an embankment designed to prevent flooding.by definition,whenever a levee ruptures and fails to hold back floodwaters,the result is a more widespread flood.that a levee failure is due to its negligent design,construction,or maintenance does not change the character of the water escaping through the levee breach the waters are still floodwaters,and the result is a flood.
the plaintiffs,however,attempt to inject ambiguity into the term flood by asserting that a reasonable interpretation of the term is that it refers only to inundations of water with natural causes,not those with a cause.the plaintiffs rely primarily on cases interpreting flood exclusions in the context of broken water mains.they also assert,applying two canons of construction,noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,that a flood includes only natural events because the other terms in the exclusions are natural phenomena.additionally,they contend that a reasonable policyholder would expect that only naturally occurring floods would be excluded.
before we address these contentions,we first question the notion that the flood in this case was.the plaintiffs focus on the alleged negligent design,construction,or maintenance of the levees as being the cause of the flood,and we accept as true for the purpose of assessing the motions to dismiss their allegation that the canals floodwaters would not have reached their property had the negligence not occurred.this focus,however,ignores the sizeable natural component to the disaster a catastrophic hurricane and the excess water associated with it.the component is simply that in certain areas,man efforts to mitigate the effect of the natural disaster failed,with devastating consequences.but if man failure to adequately prepare for a natural disaster could alone transform the disaster into a event outside the scope of a policy exclusion,it is difficult to conceive how an insurer could ever exclude the resulting loss any natural event could be recharacterized as either because man preventative measures were inadequate or because man failed to take preventative measures at all.
even if we accept the plaintiffs characterization of the flood in this case as,we disagree that the term flood in this context is limited to natural events.the plaintiffs first maintain that dictionary definitions support their interpretation,but the dictionaries we have reviewed make no distinction between floods with natural causes and those with causes indeed,the columbia encyclopedia specifically states that a flood may result from the bursting of a levee.see columbia encyclopedia.similarly,appleman treatise states a flood,contemplated by the exclusion,can result from either natural or artificial causes.john alan appleman jean appleman,supra,at supp citing kane.
the plaintiffs next rely heavily on a line of cases,arising in the context of broken water mains,holding that the term flood in a policy exclusion was ambiguous based on a distinction between natural and events.for example,in ferndale development great american insurance,a colorado intermediate court observed that s everal cases have held that flood appl ies only in cases where natural water sources are involved,and it concluded that the term was ambiguous and thus did not extend to water from a burst water main,see also ebbing state farm fire cas,following ferndale and concluding that the term flood is unambiguous but that its common usage applies to water occasioned from natural events rather than a burst water main.similarly,a new york intermediate court held that a flood exclusion did not apply in the context of a broken water main because the term flood connotes an inundation a deluge.popkin sec.mut.ins.of.that court also opined that even if the term flood is to be read broadly so as to include any great quantity of water,the term should be construed in light of the other terms in the exclusion surface water,waves,tidal water,tidal wave,which it stated relate to natural phenomena.see also ender fire ins.of hartford,following popkin and concluding that flood exclusion did not bar recovery for damage resulting from break because the exclusion preclude d only recovery for damages arising from natural causes,not from artificial devices mellon hingham mut.fire ins,concluding that exclusion for water below the surface of the ground did not exclude damage from drainage pipe rupture because the loss was caused by an accidental break rather than a natural occurrence and,as a fortuity,was the kind of risk an all risk policy is designed to cover 
although we do not quibble with the results reached in the cases,we do not believe that a distinction between natural and causes is applicable in this context.first,unlike a canal,a water main is not a body of water or watercourse.many although not all dictionary definitions define flood as an overflow or inundation of a body of water or watercourse likewise,appleman treatise observes that flood waters generally come from a river,stream,or natural water course.john alan appleman jean appleman,supra,at.so where a break is involved,it is less clear that the flow of water is within the generally prevailing meaning of flood.see kane,at reasoning that in the context of a ruptured water main,the term flood is ambiguous in part because a water main is not so clearly a body of water quotation marks omitted wallis,at distinguishing between rupture of water main and overflow of watercourse,regardless of whether the watercourse was originally or forged from nature.couch on insurance recognizes a distinction between breaks and the overflow of a body of water and opines that the delineation is more useful than the distinction in determining whether an event is a flood 
some jurisdictions attempt to distinguish naturally occurring floods from inundations from artificial or causes such as dams or water mains.such distinctions lead to apparent inconsistencies.for example,an inundation from the failure of a dam is considered a flood,while water pouring from a broken water main is not a flood.therefore,distinguishing events based on whether the inundation had a natural or artificial cause may be unhelpful,especially if the policy itself does not make such a distinction.instead,the key to reconciling these cases lies in the common definition of a flood as an overflow from a body of water.thus,when the inundation results from the overflow of a body of water,whether natural or artificial,the event is a flood.conversely,if the inundation does not arise from the overflow of a body of water,as when a water main breaks,the event is not a flood.
couch,supra,at footnotes omitted 
second,the amount of water generally released from a broken water main is not comparable to the massive inundation of water that occurred when the levees in new orleans ruptured.kane,at distinguishing cases on the basis that the amount of water released from a broken water main is less clearly an inundation or deluge quotation marks omitted.a broken water main or other pipe would generally be expected to produce more localized water damage and lacks the same potential to inundate large swaths of land that a breached levee or a failed dam would have.although the plaintiffs argue that the quantity of water involved should make no difference and that the key inquiry instead should be the cause of the water damage,inherent in the definition of flood is the concept of inundation or deluge,and it seems apparent that the greater the inundation involved in an event,the more clearly that event is a flood.see popkin,at,concluding that flood exclusion does not encompass break because the term flood connotes an inundation a deluge.
third,and most important,unlike water mains,levees are structures,which by definition means that they interact with floodwaters.because levees are,one could point to man influence nearly any time a levee fails.if a levee fails despite not being overtopped by the floodwaters,it is because the levee was not adequately designed,constructed,or maintained.if a levee fails due to the floodwaters overtopping it or loosening its footings,it is because the levee was not built high enough or the footings were not established strongly or deeply enough.even where a levee does not fail,one could find a flood where a properly designed and constructed levee causes floodwaters to be diverted downstream to another area of land,the resulting flood downstream occurs because the levee performs as designed.any time a flooded watercourse encounters a levee,a component is injected into the flood,but that does not cause the floodwaters to cease being floodwaters.smith union auto.indem,d,concluding that surface water does not lose its characterization as surface water simply because it is touched or affected by structures.the distinction between natural and causes in this context would therefore lead to absurd results and would essentially eviscerate flood exclusions whenever a levee is involved.consequently,we decline to follow this approach in this case.see.ann.directing the court to interpret a term with a meaning that renders that term effective.
the plaintiffs additionally contend that the canons of construction known as noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis support the proposition that the term flood is limited to purely natural events although we have concluded that the distinction between natural and events in this context is unworkable and would lead to absurd results,we will nonetheless engage the plaintiffs arguments about these canons.under the canon of noscitur a sociis,a term is interpreted by considering the meaning of the terms associated with it.see united states golding,cir per curiam black law dictionary ed.a canon of construction holding that the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.under the canon of ejusdem generis,where general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of persons or things,the general words will be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those enumerated.first am.title ins.first trust ass in re biloxi casino belle,cir see also black law dictionary ed.the plaintiffs assert that under these canons,the term flood includes only naturally occurring events because the other terms in the,surface water,waves,tidal water,and overflow of a body of water are events that occur naturally.
we disagree that the other terms in the exclusion necessarily refer to natural events.for example,a surface water exclusion has been held to bar coverage where the inadequate design of a drainage system caused water to accumulate rather than drain away,resulting in water damage.see front row theatre,am.mfr.ins,cir applying ohio law.and the term waves has been held to encompass both those waves which are motivated by natural forces and those motivated by artificial forces such as passing motorboats.see am.states ins.since at least some of the terms immediately surrounding flood in the exclusions also relate to both natural and events,the canon of noscitur a sociis does not support the plaintiffs proposed limitation of the term flood.and ejusdem generis is not at all applicable in interpreting flood in the exclusions before us.this canon is used to interpret general terms,and the like following a list of specific terms.see first am.title ins,at.but flood is not a general term it is one of the specific terms listed in the definition of water damage.moreover,if we were to employ these canons to justify a distinction between natural and floods in the context of the facts before us,we would be injecting ambiguity into an otherwise unambiguous term.we decline to do so.see tourdot rockford health plans,cir stating that ejusdem generis applies only where a term is ambiguous,that it may not be used both to create and to resolve the ambiguity,and that it may not be used to defeat the obvious purpose or plain meaning of the text schenkel shultz,homestead ins,cir we can not use the doctrine of noscitur a sociis to create uncertainty in an otherwise unambiguous term.
the plaintiffs finally contend that the reasonable expectations of homeowners insurance policyholders would be that damage resulting from floods would be covered.a scertaining how a reasonable insurance policy purchaser would construe the clause at the time the insurance contract was entered is one way that ambiguity in an exclusion clause may be resolved.ins.guar.ass n,so d at.but louisiana law precludes use of the reasonable expectations doctrine to recast policy language when such language is clear and unambiguous.coleman sch.bd.of richland parish,cir.as we have explained,the flood exclusions in the policies are unambiguous in the context of the specific facts of this case thus,we need not resort to ascertaining a reasonable policyholder expectations.for the sake of thoroughness,however,we will briefly address a few of the parties arguments.
first,the plaintiffs assert that because their policies are policies,they have a heightened expectation of coverage and that a reasonable policyholder thus would not expect water damage resulting from negligence to be excluded.although a few courts have stated that insureds with policies have heightened expectations of coverage,see,murray state farm fire cas,we are not aware of any louisiana court that has so held.and although policies do generally extend to all fortuitous losses,this is true only to the extent that the policy does not expressly exclude the loss from coverage.see alton ochsner med,at.each policy in this case contains a specific provision expressly excluding damage caused by flood,and none of the exclusions indicates that whether a particular flood is excluded depends on whether its cause is purely natural.given the generally prevailing use of the term flood,we believe a reasonable policyholder would expect a massive inundation of water from a breached levee to be excluded,notwithstanding the nature of the policies.
second,the plaintiffs assert that because many of the policies contained a hurricane deductible endorsement,reasonable policyholders would expect those policies to cover damage resulting from a hurricane.many of the policies contained an endorsement materially similar to the following,from humphreys policy with encompass indemnity 
we will pay only that part of the total of the loss for all property coverages that exceeds the hurricane deductible stated on the coverage summary.the hurricane deductible shown on the coverage summary applies to all covered property for direct physical loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by a hurricane as defined below.such deductible applies regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.no other deductible provision in the policy applies to direct physical loss caused by a hurricane.in no event will the deductible applied for a hurricane loss be less than the property deductible shown on the coverage summary.
hurricane means wind,wind gust,hail,rain,tornado,cyclone or hurricane which results in direct physical loss or damage to property by a storm system that has been declared to be a hurricane by the national weather service 
all other provisions of this policy apply.
the plaintiffs assert that in light of this language,a reasonable policyholder would have expected the water damage in this case to be covered.humphreys goes a step further and argues that the endorsement in her policy actually expands coverage to extend to any property damage caused by a hurricane.
but the plain language of the endorsements indicates that they do nothing more than alter the deductible for damage caused by a hurricane.nothing in the language of the endorsements purports to extend coverage for floods or to restrict flood exclusions indeed they do not even include flood or water other than rain in the definition of hurricane.further,the endorsements state that all other provisions of the policies apply,indicating that the flood exclusions remain in effect.the endorsements therefore would not give a reasonable policyholder the impression that flood resulting from a breached levee would be covered.
finally,several argue that in light of flood insurance available though the national flood insurance program nfip,a reasonable policyholder would not expect homeowners policies to cover the flooding in this case.the defendants assert that we may consider the nfip in interpreting flood because custom and industry usage is relevant under article of the civil code.they contend that the nfip existence over many years has made it clear to property owners that standard policies do not cover flood damage,regardless of whether the cause of the flood is natural or,and that property owners who want flood coverage must purchase it through the nfip a reasonable policyholder thus would not expect the inundation of water in this case to be covered under a standard homeowners,renters,or insurance policy.
the plaintiffs,in contrast,urge us not to consider the nfip,contending that it has no bearing on this appeal.and to the extent the nfip may be relevant,the plaintiffs argue that a reasonable policyholder would expect the nfip to provide coverage for naturally occurring floods but that floods induced by negligence would be covered under standard policies.
we do not rely upon the nfip to decide this appeal.our decision is based instead upon our determination that the flood exclusions in the policies before us unambiguously preclude the plaintiffs recovery.but to the extent that the nfip definition of flood is further evidence of the term generally prevailing meaning,we note that it is consistent with our interpretation.standard insurance policies issued under the nfip define flood as follows 
a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties one of which is the policyholder property from 
overflow of inland or tidal waters,
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source,
pt,app.a,app.a,app.a see also federal emergency management agency,what is a flood,http www.floodsmart.gov floodsmart pages whatflood.jsp last visited july.the nfip makes no distinction between inundations of water caused by natural levee ruptures and those caused by ruptures even if such a distinction were workable.the canals overflowing into the city of new orleans due to the levee ruptures was certainly an overflow of inland waters as used in the nfip definition,and it may also have been an unusual and rapid runoff of surface waters.
in sum,we conclude that the flood exclusions in the plaintiffs policies are unambiguous in the context of the facts of this case.in the midst of a hurricane,three canals running through the city of new orleans overflowed their normal boundaries.the measures,levees,that man had put in place to prevent the canals floodwaters from reaching the city failed.the result was an enormous and devastating inundation of water into the city,damaging the plaintiffs property.this event was a flood within that term generally prevailing meaning as used in common parlance,and our interpretation of the exclusions ends there.the flood is unambiguously excluded from coverage under the plaintiffs policies,and the district court conclusion to the contrary was erroneous 
efficient proximate cause and clauses 
lastly we turn to the doctrine of efficient proximate cause.under this doctrine,as it is applied in many jurisdictions,where a loss is caused by a combination of a covered risk and an excluded risk,the loss is covered if the covered risk was the efficient proximate cause of the loss see,chadwick fire ins,th,d,kish ins.of,see also couch,supra,at.the efficient proximate cause of the loss is the dominant,fundamental cause or the cause that set the chain of events in motion.see couch,supra,at.
many of the insurance policies at issue in this appeal excluded loss caused directly or indirectly by flood regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.this language,which the district court referred to as an clause,has been recognized as demonstrating an insurer intent to contract around the operation of the rule.see,tnt speed sport,am.states ins,cir.
the district court considered the clauses in this case and concluded that they are inapplicable here because there were not two separate causes of the plaintiffs damage.the court remarked that this case does not present a combination of forces that caused damage and that it therefore is not analogous to cases where hurricane katrina may have damaged property through both wind and water.tuepker state farm fire cas,wl,dist.lexis.may,unpublished opinion hurricane katrina case involving alleged damage from wind,rain,and storm surge,appeal docketed,cir.instead,the court stated that in this case the cause conflates to the flood,meaning that the alleged negligent design,construction,or maintenance of the levees and the resulting flood were not separate causes of the plaintiffs losses.consequently,the court concluded that the clauses needed not be addressed at that time but stated that they may need to be addressed at later stages in the litigation.
on appeal,several insurers rely in part on the language in their clauses to demonstrate that floods are excluded regardless of the cause.the chehardy plaintiffs respond that the district court correctly determined that the causation clauses were inapplicable,contending that the cause of their damage inundation of water or inundation resulting from negligent acts was a covered peril xavier responds that the district court correctly noted that the clause is inapplicable because there is no separate or other cause of damage.
we agree with the district court determination that we need not address whether insurers may contract around the rule under louisiana law,nor need we address the operation of the rule itself in this case.the doctrine applies only where two or more distinct actions,events,or forces combined to create the loss.see pieper commercial underwriters ins,th,d,for the efficient proximate cause theory to apply,there must be two separate or distinct perils kish,at the efficient proximate cause rule applies only where two or more independent forces operate to cause the loss.but here,on these pleadings,there are not two independent causes of the plaintiffs damages at play the only force that damaged the plaintiffs properties was flood.to the extent that negligent design,construction,or maintenance of the levees contributed to the plaintiffs losses,it was only one factor in bringing about the flood the peril of negligence did not act,apart from flood,to bring about damage to the insureds properties.consequently,as the plaintiffs argue and as the district court held,the doctrine is inapplicable.see chadwick,th at,d when,however,the evidence shows the loss was in fact occasioned by only a single cause,albeit one susceptible to various characterizations,the efficient proximate cause analysis has no application.see also cornhusker cas.farmers mut.ins,kish,at.
moreover,to the extent that the plaintiffs do attempt to recharacterize the cause of their losses by focusing on negligence as the cause rather than water damage,their argument fails.an insured may not avoid a contractual exclusion merely by affixing an additional label or separate characterization to the act or event causing the loss.kish,at chadwick,d at.if every possible characterization of an action or event were counted an additional peril,the exclusions in insurance contracts would be largely meaningless.chadwick,d at.thus,in pieper commercial underwriters insurance,where a policy covered loss caused by arson but excluded loss caused by brush fire,a brush fire caused by arson was excluded.d at.the pieper court determined that the cause of the brush fire was irrelevant the plaintiffs property was damaged by one cause alone,brush fire,and thus,the rule was inapplicable.id.and in kish insurance of north america,where a policy covered loss caused by rain but excluded loss caused by flood,the court held that the insured could not avoid the operation of the flood exclusion by merely recharacterizing the flood as rain.at.the court held that there was one cause of the plaintiffs was excluded,and concluded that the rule was inapplicable.id.we similarly reject any attempt on the plaintiffs part to avoid the operation of the flood exclusion by recharacterizing the flood as negligence the sole cause of the losses for which they seek coverage in this litigation,flood,was excluded from coverage regardless of what factors contributed to its development.
in sum,we need not address the applicability of clauses or the rule because,as pleaded,there was not more than one separate cause of the plaintiffs losses.as the district court recognized,there are other cases arising in the context of hurricane katrina where these issues may come into play,but this is not the case for their resolution.
iv.conclusion 
with respect to the vanderbrook action,the district court grant of state farm motion for judgment on the pleadings is affirmed.the denial of the motions for judgment on the pleadings filed by hanover and standard fire is vacated and remanded.
with respect to the xavier action,the motion to certify questions to the louisiana supreme court is denied.the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of xavier is vacated and remanded.
with respect to the chehardy action,the motion to certify questions to the louisiana supreme court is denied.the district court grant in part of state farm motion to dismiss is affirmed.and the denial of the motions to dismiss filed by lafayette,liberty mutual,american,auto club,standard fire,lexington,aegis,hanover,allstate,louisiana citizens,encompass insurance,and great northern pertaining to the claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract is vacated and remanded.
with respect to the humphreys action,the district court denial of humphreys motion on the question of coverage under the policy endorsement is affirmed.the grant of partial summary judgment in humphreys favor on the question of the interpretation of the policy flood exclusion is vacated and remanded.
motions denied affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.the appellees shall bear the cost of this appeal.
the humphreys action was initially consolidated with the remaining cases,but on encompass indemnity company motion,the district court severed it from the consolidated case.
the vanderbrook plaintiffs also sued the board of commissioners for the orleans levee district for the parish of orleans,but the claim against that defendant is not at issue in this appeal.
at oral argument before the district court,a copy of madeline grenier policy with hanover that contains only the pages was inserted into the record.because the copy of the policy in the record is incomplete,we can not adequately review it.consequently,we leave it to the district court on remand to obtain a copy of the entire policy and to interpret it consistently with this opinion.
the chehardy plaintiffs comprise gladys chehardy daniel and jacquelyn fontanez larry and glendy forster kenneth and judy maier randy and lori gervais andre and marlin mauberret debbie and dave strawn stephanie and brad boyd new orleans flooring supply,shawn and angelina burst patricia brown marie fatheree katrina daniels lionel and edna jones karen lewis shane sylvester austra zapata sabrina perkins eldridge pollard michael peterson wendell glation and mack barham.
the amended complaint defines the class of policyholders asall owners in the parishes of orleans,bernard,and jefferson,state of louisiana,who own immovable property with improvements,principally houses or related residential structures,as well as personal property located there,which was destroyed or damaged by winds generated by hurricane katrina in excess of their respective policy deductibles and not reimbursed by their insurance companies,but excluding members of the judiciary,their administrative staff and any other personnel who may cause a member of the louisiana bench to be unable to preside over this action.
in its order,the district court stated that it was unable to identify with certainty which chehardy plaintiffs were insured through which defendants the court has attempted to ascertain this information for purposes of specificity with respect to its ensuing orders herein however,there is some confusion which prevents the court from doing so.in addition to which,the information provided is not in the record.however,it has been represented to the court by counsel that all insurers herein have provided at least one policy to one plaintiff,thus the court will enter its orders with respect to the insurers and will not be able to identify the specific plaintiff who is a ffected by such examined the record on appeal and identified what appear to be insurance policies corresponding with each named chehardy plaintiff except wendell glation and andre and marilyn mauberret.with respect to those plaintiffs,we granted unopposed motions to supplement the record on appeal with copies of their policies.nevertheless,we leave it to the district court on remand to identify with certainty which plaintiff was insured under which policy or policies for the purposes of orders to be entered subsequent to this appeal.
the only variations in language between these policies are immaterial to this appeal.for example,american and hanover substitute the words loss or damage for loss,hanover inserts any before body of water,and hanover names its exclusion water rather than water damage.
humphreys amended her petition to add the orleans levee district as a defendant.her claims against the orleans levee district are not at issue in this appeal.
encompass indemnity disputes that humphreys properly asserted the issue of the flood exclusion applicability in her motion for partial summary judgment.encompass indemnity characterizes the district court grant of partial summary judgment in humphreys favor on this issue as sua sponte and contends that it did not receive rule c requisite notice.because we conclude that even if encompass indemnity did have notice,the grant of partial summary judgment was nonetheless erroneous,we need not address whether encompass indemnity received the required notice.
