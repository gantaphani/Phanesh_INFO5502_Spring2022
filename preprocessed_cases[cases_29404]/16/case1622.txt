this homeowner policy coverage dispute arose from the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina along the mississippi gulf coast.we affirm the judgment of the district court,but to do so we must work through some erroneous reasoning that led to its conclusion.
background 
the leonards home lies twelve feet above sea level on the southmost edge of pascagoula,mississippi,less than two hundred yards from the mississippi sound.hurricane katrina battered pascagoula with torrential rain and sustained winds in excess of one hundred miles per hour.by midday,the storm had driven ashore a formidable tidal called a storm or tidal flooded the ground floor of the leonards home.
a.the policy 
the leonards purchased their first nationwide homeowner policy from nationwide agent,jay fletcher,in.although nationwide twice revised its standard homeowner policy language between and,the leonards form policy that was in force when the storm made landfall was substantially indistinguishable from the elite ii policy they originally purchased.
like almost all homeowner policies,nationwide form is a comprehensive,or,policy pursuant to which all damage to dwellings and personal property not otherwise excluded is covered.also,like almost all homeowner policies,nationwide policy covers only damage caused by certain perils and excludes damage caused by others.relevant to this appeal are the policy provisions that define the scope of coverage for damage caused by wind water and concurrent action of wind and water.
wind damage both to a dwelling and to personal property is a peril insured against under section i,clause the clause,which along with pertinent prefatory language states 
coverage and 
coverage structures 
coverage property 
we cover accidental direct physical loss to property described in coverage c caused by the following perils except for losses excluded under section exclusions 
windstorm or hail.
direct loss caused by rain driven through roof or wall openings made by direct action of wind,hail,or other insured peril is covered 
the policy thus covers losses caused by rain blown through a hole in a roof,wall,or window.exclusively damage,like a roof,or a window damaged by a projectile,is also covered.
like most homeowner policies,the leonards policy unambiguously excludes damage caused by a broadly worded exemption clause the exclusion 
property exclusions 
b water or damage caused by material.loss resulting from water or material damage described below is not covered even if other perils contributed,directly or indirectly,to cause the loss.water and material damage means 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal waves,overflow of a body of water,spray from these,whether or not driven by wind 
when the leonards annually renewed their policy,they received the following notice from nationwide informing them that flood losses would not be covered,but that additional flood coverage was available upon request 
important information 
a message from your nationwide agent 
your policy does not cover flood loss.you can get protection through the national flood insurance program.if you wish to find out more about this protection,please contact your nationwide agent.
the leonards never purchased additional flood coverage under the federally subsidized national flood insurance program nfip.see.
concurrent action by wind and water 
the prefatory language introducing the exclusion addresses situations in which damage arises from the synergistic action of a covered peril,wind,and an excluded peril,water 
we do not cover loss to any property resulting directly or indirectly from any of the following.such a loss is excluded even if another peril or event contributed concurrently or in any sequence to cause the loss 
commonly referred to as an clause,or acc clause,this prefatory language denies coverage whenever an excluded peril and a covered peril combine to damage a dwelling or personal property.the inundation of the leonards home was caused by a concurrently caused peril,a tidal wave,or storm a massive wall of ashore by hurricane katrina winds.accordingly,argues nationwide,losses attributable to storm flooding are excluded under the acc clause.the validity of the acc clause is the key interpretive battleground of this appeal.
paul leonard conversations with fletcher 
paul leonard testified that when he first bought his policy in,he asked nationwide agent jay fletcher whether the nationwide policy covered losses.according to leonard,fletcher responded that all hurricane damage was covered.fletcher stated in his deposition testimony that he did not recall this conversation the district court deemed it irrelevant to the case.
leonard claims he spoke again with fletcher ten years later to discuss a proposed increase in the deductible that nationwide was instituting on its homeowner policies.leonard called fletcher after seeing advertisements for additional nfip coverage in the wake of hurricane georges,which struck the mississippi coast in.fletcher allegedly assured leonard that he did not need additional flood coverage because leonard did not live in an area classified zone a for flood risk by the federal emergency management agency fema.fletcher purportedly added that his own property was not insured under the nfip.leonard does not allege that fletcher told him the nationwide policy covered flooding caused by a hurricane leonard merely inferred from fletcher comments that such coverage existed.
at the bench trial,the district court admitted under federal rule of evidence what it characterized as evidence that fletcher as a matter of habit and routine,expressed his opinion that customers in pascagoula should not purchase flood insurance unless they lived in a flood prone area flood zone a where flood insurance was required in connection with mortgage loans.leonard nationwide mut.ins,d.trial evidence demonstrated that between and katrina landfall in late august,fletcher sold approximately one hundred nfip policies to customers,twelve of whom lived in the leonards waterfront neighborhood.
hurricane damage 
inspection of the leonards residence following the storm revealed modest wind damage.the roof suffered broken shingles and loss of ceramic granules,but its integrity was not compromised.the walls of the garage and the garage door were severely damaged doors in the house and garage had been blown open.finally,a sized hole in a window was likely caused by a projectile.
water damage,in contrast,was extensive.the leonards neighborhood had suffered a storm surge,causing the entire ground floor of their residence to become inundated under five feet of water blown ashore from the mississippi sound.walls,floors,fixtures,and personal property sustained extensive damage.the second floor of the house remained unscathed.
nationwide adjuster evaluated the storm damage and,after applying the leonards five hundred dollar deductible,tendered a check for amount determined attributable solely to wind.nationwide informed the leonards that damages caused by water and the storm surge concurrent action were barred,respectively,by the exclusion and the acc clause.
at trial,the leonards offered expert testimony that the total damages actually exceeded,but this figure did not apportion damages caused by different perils.the leonards assessment claimed,including costs for roof replacement and structural repairs to the garage.
procedural history 
before trial,nationwide moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that the acc clause and exclusion unambiguously precluded coverage for any damage not solely attributable to wind,and fletcher purported oral statements to paul leonard could not modify the policy scope of coverage under mississippi agency law.additionally,nationwide moved in limine to exclude evidence of any statements made by fletcher to nationwide policyholders other than the leonards under federal evidence rule.the district court carried nationwide motions with the case.
following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for the leonards in the amount of determined to have been caused solely by wind.the court held that the exclusion was enforceable and precluded coverage for any damages occasioned by water.see leonard,d at.significantly,however,the court struck down the acc clause as ambiguous and unenforceable under applicable mississippi law,in a situation such as this,where the insured property sustains damage from both wind a covered loss and water an excluded loss,the insured may recover that portion of the loss which he can prove to have been caused by wind.id.at citation omitted.the district court maintained that wind damage was recoverable even if it occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.id.at emphasis added.
the court denied nationwide partial summary judgment motion regarding fletcher oral statements,but nonetheless held that fletcher did not materially misrepresent the policy terms,nor did he make any statements which could be reasonably understood to alter the policy terms.id.at.

ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
shortly before this court was scheduled to hear oral argument,the leonards moved to dismiss their and contended that,as a result,nationwide appeal must be dismissed for mootness and lack of standing.they are incorrect.nationwide appeal alone continues to present a live article iii controversy over which we are obliged to exercise appellate jurisdiction.see.
the leonards major premise is that the money judgment below represents the entirety of the ruling inflicted on nationwide by the district court decision.because nationwide does not challenge the amount awarded,nationwide suffered no injury or prejudice at trial,and this appeal no longer presents a case or controversy.their minor premise is that the district court dual findings that the acc clause is ambiguous and an agent negligent misrepresentations can be used to challenge the enforceability of the nationwide policy are unappealable dicta which do not vest nationwide with a cognizable article iii injury.
ordinarily,only a party aggrieved by a judgment or order of a district court may exercise the statutory right to appeal therefrom.deposit guar.bank roper,d.although roper discussion of an aggrieved party right to appeal occurred in the context,its core holding in regard to standing obtains here if redressable on appeal,collateral injury inflicted by a lower court ruling renders the injured party aggrieved for purposes of article iii.even the roper dissenters recognized the fundamental principle that a party may appeal any aspect of a generally favorable judgment that affects him adversely,so long as the party can satisfy the requirement of article iii.see roper,at.at powell,dissenting article iii jurisdiction on appeal requires a personal stake in the outcome of an action 
based on roper and electrical fittings,nationwide retains its aggrieved party status with respect to the rulings on the acc clause and the negligent misrepresentation issues.the district court left nationwide with a ruling that invalidates a key provision of its homeowner policy as a matter of mississippi law superimposes an entirely different causal matrix for the determination of covered damages than the policy contemplated and allows the introduction of extrinsic oral statements to clarify the meaning of nationwide policy terms and potentially to affect the coverage available.it stretches credulity to suggest that these rulings,which were integral to the district court decisionmaking process,do not adversely affect nationwide rights or render it an aggrieved party in this appeal.
the district court found the acc clause ambiguous,leading it to conclude thus,the acc language does not exclude coverage for different damage,the damage caused by wind,a covered peril,even if the wind damage occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.the wind damage is covered the water damage is not.see leonard,d at.the court applied established mississippi law dating from the hurricane camille cases and explicitly held that a mississippi policyholder could parse out and recover for loss due to covered wind damage that combined with excluded water damage in a concurrently caused peril.consequently,as a matter of mississippi law,nationwide acc clause is invalid.that such rulings vitally affect nationwide rights in subsequent litigation involving its homeowner policy would seem to be emphasized by the leonards determination to render the rulings unassailable on appeal.
the district court resolution of factual concurrent causation,as of the negligent misrepresentation issue,did not affect the damages nationwide must pay in this case,but that is immaterial for purposes of the article iii standing inquiry we undertake here.a party may be aggrieved by a district court decision that adversely affects its legal rights or position other parties in the case or other potential litigants.custer sweeney,cir the acc clause and negligent misrepresentation issues are currently being litigated by nationwide in hundreds of cases in the trial courts,causing nationwide to incur considerable litigation expense and potential enormous liability to other policyholders.the threat of additional claims for denial of coverage based on the court rulings in this case also looms large for nationwide.in sum,the district court resolution of both the acc clause and negligent misrepresentation issues renders nationwide sufficiently aggrieved by the judgment below that it retains a stake in appealing the district court damages methodology,as well as the collateral issue of the validity of nationwide homeowner policy in the presence of allegedly contradictory oral representations by its agents.

general principles of mississippi insurance law 
the initial question of whether the contract is ambiguous is a matter of law.benchmark health care,cain,so d,citation omitted.mississippi courts give effect to the plain meaning of an insurance policy clear and unambiguous language.robley blue shield of,so d.no rule of construction requires or permits mississippi courts to make a contract differing from that made by the parties themselves,or to enlarge an insurance company obligations where the provisions of its policy are clear.state auto.mut.ins.of columbus glover,so d.nor will a court resort to extrinsic evidence or rules of contract construction if policy provisions are unambiguous.jackson daley,so d.
if a court determines that ambiguity inheres in the policy language,the familiar maxim omnia praesumuntur contra proferentem requires the court to construe ambiguous terms in favor of the policyholder.foods state farm mut.auto.ins,so d.ambiguity arises when a term or provision is susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning,but can also result from internal conflict between policy provisions that renders uncertain the meaning of the policy as a whole.see.farm bureau mut.ins.walters,so d.the court must then select the interpretation which gives the greater indemnity to the insured.state farm mut.auto.ins.scitzs,so d.nonetheless,t he mere fact that the parties disagree about the meaning of a provision of a contract does not make the contract ambiguous as a matter of law.delta pride catfish,home ins,so d,citing cherry anthony,gibbs,sage,so d,
the burden of proving that coverage exists for a peril under an insurance policy rests with the policyholder.lunday lititz mut.ins,so d.the insurer bears the burden of proving that a particular peril falls within a policy exclusion the insurer must plead and prove the applicability of an exclusion as an affirmative defense.commercial union ins.byrne,so d.mississippi courts strictly construe policy exclusions against the insurer.scitzs,so d at.
d.the causation clause 
although the district court granted the leonards only a meager monetary recovery for losses proven to have been caused by wind,it also summarily invalidated the acc clause,stating that t he provisions of the nationwide policy that purport to exclude coverage entirely for damages caused by a combination of the effects of water an excluded loss and damage caused by the effects of wind a covered loss are ambiguous.leonard,d at contrary to the district court ruling,nationwide acc clause is not ambiguous,nor does mississippi law preempt the causation regime the clause applies to hurricane claims.
eschewing a analysis,the district court opines that the clause 
does not affect the coverage for other losses covered losses,damage caused by wind,that occur at or near the same time.thus,the acc clause does not exclude coverage for different damage,the damage caused by wind,a covered peril,even if the wind damage occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.the wind damage is covered the water damage is not.
id.at emphasis added.this conclusion is unjustifiable when read against the clause plain language 
we do not cover loss to any property resulting directly or indirectly from any of the following.such a loss is excluded even if another peril or event contributed concurrently or in any sequence to cause the loss.
water or damage caused by material 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal waves,overflow of a body of water,spray from these,whether or not driven by wind.
the clause unambiguously excludes coverage for water damage even if another peril,wind contributed concurrently or in any sequence to cause the loss.the plain language of the policy leaves the district court no interpretive leeway to conclude that recovery can be obtained for wind damage that occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.leonard,d at.moreover,in the past we have not deemed similar policy language ambiguous.see,arjen motor hotel accident fire life assurance,cir affirming denial of recovery when evidence conclusively establish ed that wave action,an excluded peril,at the very least contributed to the collapse of the restaurant building.nationwide assertion that the district court simply read the clause out of the contract,is not at all wide of the mark.the clause is not ambiguous.
the fatal flaw in the district court rationale is its failure to recognize the three discrete categories of damage at issue in this litigation damage caused exclusively by wind damage caused exclusively by water and damage caused by wind concurrently or in any sequence with water.the classic example of such a concurrent peril is the flooding that follows on the heels of a hurricane landfall.the only species of damage covered under the policy is damage caused exclusively by wind.but if wind and water synergistically caused the same damage,such damage is excluded.thus,the leonards money judgment was based on their roof damages solely caused by wind.contrary to the court damage matrix,however,had they also proved that a portion of their property damage was caused by the concurrent or sequential action of any number of other enumerated policy clearly disallows recovery.
the district court seemed to fear that enforcement of the policy concurrent causation exclusion would render any recovery for hurricane damage illusory.observing that the policy denies coverage whenever a windstorm combined with an excluded cause of loss,flooding,the court hypothesized that an insured whose dwelling lost its roof in high winds and at the same time suffered an incursion of even an inch of water could recover nothing leonard,d at discussing the exclusion.that fear is unfounded,with regard to the policy clause,which clearly preempts the court scenario 
we cover accidental direct physical loss to property caused by the following perils 
windstorm or hail.
direct loss caused by rain driven through roof or wall openings made by direct action of wind 
if,for example,a policyholder roof is blown off in a storm,and rain enters through the opening,the damage is covered.only if excluded inundates the same area that the rain damaged is the ensuing loss excluded because the loss was caused concurrently or in sequence by the action of a covered and an excluded peril.the district court unsupported conclusions that the acc clause is ambiguous and that the policyholder can parse out the portion of the concurrently caused damage that is attributable to wind contradict the policy language.
like the district court,the leonards provide no support for their argument that the acc clause is ambiguous.instead,they adopt the district court reliance on venerable mississippi authorities regarding proximate causation of damage caused by hurricanes.see leonard,d at citing cases reflecting mississippi law.because the acc clause is unambiguous,the leonards can prevail only if they can demonstrate that the clause is prohibited by mississippi caselaw,statutory law,or public policy.none of these sources of state law restricts nationwide use of the acc clause to preclude recovery for concurrently caused hurricane losses.
contrary to the leonards contention,mississippi courts have not conclusively resolved whether an insurance policy may preclude recovery for damages caused by the concurrent action of the wind and water of a hurricane.accordingly,this court,applying state substantive law,must make an educated erie guess as to how the mississippi supreme court would resolve the issue.see jackson sales,cir citing erie tompkins.
mississippi default rule efficient proximate causation 
the default causation rule in mississippi regarding damages caused concurrently by a covered and an excluded peril under an insurance policy is that the insured may recover if the covered peril was the dominant and efficient cause of the loss.evana plantation,yorkshire ins,so d.this rule is typically referred to as the doctrine of efficient proximate cause to recover under the doctrine in the context of a homeowner policy that covers wind damage but excludes damage by water,it is sufficient to show that wind,the covered peril was the proximate or efficient cause of the loss notwithstanding other factors,excluded perils like water contributed lititz mut.ins.boatner,so d,quoting kemp am.universal ins,cir.
the mississippi supreme court frequently employed this default rule in the welter of insurance coverage cases that surfaced in the aftermath of hurricane camille.it is also the rule the district court and the leonards contend must apply here.see leonard,d at collecting cases.however,although the mississippi supreme court often premised recovery for policyholders on the application of the efficient proximate cause rule,in actuality,in many of the camille cases the court did little more than uphold jury findings that the damages suffered by policyholders were caused exclusively by wind,not by concurrent action such cases thus do not support the leonards argument that the mississippi default rule in hurricane cases is always to allow recovery for covered damages even if they are concurrent with excluded damages and irrespective of contrary policy language.in fact,the mississippi supreme court intimated in one case that even if a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of damage,a concurrently contributing cause that is excluded under a homeowner policy may preclude recovery.see grain dealers mut.ins.belk,so d.
whatever the effect of the efficient proximate cause doctrine in the hurricane camille cases,those decisions do not control the current case because none of the policies they involve contain acc clauses similar to the one at issue here nor do those cases purport to enshrine efficient proximate causation as an immutable rule of mississippi insurance policy interpretation.the fifth circuit long ago explicitly recognized that efficient proximate causation does not necessarily control mississippi contracts for hurricane damage.see kemp,at i n order to recover on a windstorm insurance policy,not otherwise limited or defined,it is sufficient to show that wind was the proximate or efficient cause of loss or damage emphasis added.as discussed below,we reach the same conclusion here as well.
b.the cases eaker,rhoden boteler 
recent decisions involving the effect of acc clauses and exclusions under mississippi law all upheld acc clauses that abrogated the default efficient proximate causation rule and excluded damage occasioned by the synergistic action of a covered and an excluded peril the cases reflect the general mississippi contract principle that where a clause in a contract does not violate any statute,or public policy,and is unambiguous and certain in its provisions,it is enforced as written.am.bankers ins.white,so,see also blue cross blue shield of,larson,so d,explaining parties privileged right to contract,assuming such is not against public policy,by expressing their intentions through the language of their choice couch on ins.ins.law prac.
rhoden and boteler are particularly instructive on this score.in rhoden,state farm excluded losses from earth movement the excluded peril under an acc provision that barred coverage whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss.d at.the federal district court held that the exclusion,when read with the acc provision,was unambiguously designed to preclude recovery for any loss involving earth movement,irrespective of the causal matrix that occasioned the loss.id.at.the court upheld the acc clause,noting that mississippi courts have not adopted the efficient proximate causation doctrine.id.at boteler,so d at.boteler and eaker echo rhoden holding that acc clauses are enforceable,absolute bars to recovery w hen a loss is caused by a combination of a covered and specifically excluded risks.see eaker,d at quoting rhoden,d at see also boteler,so d at the leading mississippi insurance law treatise states that the cases are indicative of the clear trend in mississippi state and federal courts to treat the issue of causation in this context as one controlled by the insurance policy,and not by public policy or common law.ins.law prac.
c.other jurisdictions 
two federal appellate courts and many state and district courts have endorsed using acc clauses to circumvent default causation rules like efficient proximate cause.for instance,in tnt speed sport center,american states insurance,cir,a vandal removed sandbags from a levee protecting a track from the waters of the mississippi river.as a result,the levee collapsed and river water damaged tnt buildings.the insurance policy covered losses caused by vandalism,but excluded flood losses,and contained an acc clause that excluded coverage for damage arising concurrently from a covered and an excluded peril.after a review of missouri cases,the eighth circuit held that state law did not bar application of the acc clause,and that the plain meaning of the acc clause exclusionary language was to directly address,and contract out of,the efficient proximate cause doctrine.at see id.collecting state supreme court decisions upholding acc clauses.see also front row theatre,am.mfrs.mut.ins.companies,cir upholding an acc clause barring coverage for concurrently caused water losses citing schroeder state farm fire cas.a majority of states that have considered the matter enforce acc exclusion clauses.see david leitner et,law and practice of insurance coverage litigation couch on ins.joseph ziemianski et,emerging property and cgl insurance claims trends,practising law institute litigation and administrative practice course handbook series.only washington and west virginia do not allow abrogation of the default rule via an acc clause california and north dakota require efficient proximate causation by statute 
public policy 
a general background principle of mississippi contract law holds that parties may decline to adopt causation rules so long as the contract provisions do not offend public policy.see.farm bureau cas.ins.britt,so d,we must give effect here to a valid,clear and unambiguous contract term where there is no statutory or public policy prohibition nullifying it.see also couch on ins.as mississippi has not adopted the efficient proximate cause doctrine as a matter of public policy,there is no bar to nationwide use of the acc clause here.most jurisdictions concur that acc clauses comport with state public policy.the alabama supreme court recent decision in state farm fire casualty slade,so d,is representative of this trend.
slade involved an improbable set of events in which a lightning bolt caused the collapse of a retaining wall near the policyholders swimming pool.months later,cracks were observed in the interior and exterior walls of the adjacent dwelling.state farm refused to cover the structural damage,asserting that lightning a covered peril,caused subsequent earth movement an excluded peril,resulting in the observed damage.the homeowner policy contained an acc clause substantively indistinguishable from the one contested here.slade held that the occasional citation of the efficient proximate cause rule in alabama caselaw did not require the court to invalidate the disputed acc clause because the rule is not a principle of public policy.so d at.instead,the court adhered to alabama rule against rewriting unambiguous insurance policies so long as they do not contravene public policy.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as eaker,rhoden,and boteler suggest,we believe that the mississippi supreme court,if squarely confronted with the issue,would follow slade.
statutory law 
nor does any mississippi statute mandate that insurance policies reflect the efficient proximate causation doctrine.mississippi insurance law,in fact,lends some support to nationwide.under state law,all insurance providers are required to file all rates,supplementary rate information,policy forms and endorsements with the mississippi department of insurance.see ann.the state insurance commissioner must reject any rate or policy form that contains inconsistent,ambiguous,or misleading clauses or exceptions.id.b.nationwide acc clause was approved by the department.
the mississippi supreme court has recently noted the import of this approval process.see united states fid.guar.knight,so d,i nsurance companies must be able to rely on their statements of coverage,exclusions,disclaimers,definitions,and other provisions,in order to receive the benefit of their bargain and to ensure that rates have been properly calculated.see also couch on ins.causes that fall within the policy coverage may be considered to be those that the insurer has assessed in setting its premium or that the insured would have derived from the language of the contract.moreover,the judicial elevation of the efficient proximate cause doctrine to a rule of contract construction after contrary policies had been approved by the state insurance commissioner would essentially usurp the legislature authority to delegate authority to an agency.see slade,so d at.by analogy,it seems most likely that the mississippi supreme court would regard insurance policy regulation as a matter better suited for the legislature to address rather than the state judiciary.wooten.farm bureau ins,so d.
the leonards object to nationwide citation of the doctrine,contending that it has never been held to be an absolute bar to litigation and would constitute an encroachment by regulatory agencies into the court system and would deprive plaintiffs of their right to a trial by jury.this argument assumes that the insurance policy is ambiguous,since mississippi courts will refrain from tinkering with policy language if the meaning of a policy is clear on its face.see state auto.mut.ins.of columbus glover,so d.since the acc clause is unambiguous and consistent with state public policy,the leonards argument misses the mark.
for all these reasons,we conclude that use of an acc clause to supplant the default causation regime is not forbidden by mississippi caselaw including the camille cases which antedate such clauses,statutory law,or public policy.because the acc clause is unambiguous and not otherwise voidable under state law,it must stand.
the leonards only textual argument that their policy is ambiguous focuses on the exclusion,not the acc clause.they assert that the water damage their house sustained was caused not by explicitly excluded by storm surge,which they characterize as a separate,discrete peril unique to hurricanes and as a term commonly understood among residents of pascagoula as distinct from a flood thus,the argument goes,because t he literal wording of the water damage exclusion does not contemplate the exclusion of damage from storm surge,recovery is available.see couch on ins.because exclusions are read narrowly,a policy excluding damage from some natural perils may cover damage from other natural water phenomena.this argument is unpersuasive.
courts have interpreted exclusions like the one found in the leonards policy to encompass the peril of inundation by water,or storm surge,for ages mississippi courts have upheld such exclusions before and after hurricane katrina.see leonard,d at collecting cases bilbe belsom,wl,at.july,holding on the basis of a exclusion that plaintiff argument that hurricane waters or storm surge do not fit within the terms set forth in the water damage exclusion is without merit.the damage to plaintiff home was caused by the inundation of her home by what was clearly tidal water from lake pontchartrain further,this court most recent consideration of the term flood also supports nationwide contention that the term is unambiguous and has a concrete meaning,whether or not used in the context of an insurance policy.see in re katrina canal breaches litigation,wl,at cir,considering the term in the context of water damage resulting from the failure of a structure such as a dam or dike.no decision of this court or any other of which we are aware endorses the leonards view that storm surge is a unique meteorological phenomenon not contemplated by exclusions like nationwide.
the provision explicitly exempts from coverage damage caused by flood waves,tidal waves,and overflow of a body of water whether or not driven by wind.emphasis added.the phrase storm surge is little more than a synonym for a tidal wave or flood,both of which are excluded perils the omission of the specific term storm surge does not create ambiguity in the policy regarding coverage available in a hurricane and does not entitle the leonards to recovery for their damages.see in re katrina canal breaches,wl,at cir,stating in the context of an acc clause that an insured may not avoid a contractual exclusion merely by affixing an additional label or separate characterization to the act or event causing the loss.citation omitted couch on ins.
neither party briefed or argued the applicability of the in the district court,nor has nationwide alleged that the exclusion bars recovery.the district court raised the issue sua sponte in its memorandum opinion,finding the provision ambiguous and unenforceable.see leonard,d at.both parties agree that the district court exceeded the scope of the inquiry necessary to resolve this case by ruling on the exclusion.we accordingly do not consider that provision and vacate that portion of the district court opinion.
negligent misrepresentation claim 
finally,the leonards claim that misrepresentations fletcher made during two conversations in and effected an oral modification of their policy,enabling recovery for all losses.the district court allowed litigation of the question whether fletcher negligently misrepresented the policy terms,but found that none of fletcher statements could be reasonably understood to alter the terms of the nationwide policy,and that any inferences that paul leonard drew from the conversations were inconsistent with the policy exclusion for water damage.leonard,d at.
background principles 
under mississippi law,a party reliance on representations by an insurance agent that contradict the policy language is unreasonable.ross citifinancial,cir.the insured has an affirmative duty to read the policy.smith union life ins,d,gulf guar.life ins.kelley,so d.whether the policy was read or not,however,constructive knowledge of its contents is imputed to the policyholder.ross,at quoting godfrey,bassett kuykendall architects,huntington lumber supply,so d.an agent oral representations can modify the policy only if it is ambiguous when the contractual language is plain,there can be no modification.am.states ins.natchez steam laundry,cir.
general agency law controls the relationship between insurance companies and their agents.barhonovich am.ins,cir.under mississippi law,an agent representations that purport to modify the insurance contract can bind an insurer only if the statements were made pursuant to actual or apparent authority.id.because nationwide does not authorize its agents to orally modify contracts,only apparent authority is pertinent here.
somewhat tautologically,the mississippi supreme court has explained that a pparent authority exists when a reasonably prudent person,having knowledge of the nature and usages of the business involved,would be justified in supposing,based on the character of the duties entrusted to the agent,that the agent has the power he is assumed to have.ford lamar life ins,so d.a policyholder seeking to recover based on an agent apparent authority must show three things acts or conduct on the part of the principal indicating the agent authority reasonable reliance on those acts and a detrimental change in position as a result of such reliance.see barhonovich,at citing andrew jackson life ins.williams,so d.the insured is bound by policy language that would put a reasonable person on notice of limitations to the agent authority.see union,d at.
fletcher conversations with paul leonard 
upon purchase of the policy in,paul leonard alleges that fletcher assured him that all hurricane damage was covered in,fletcher allegedly assured leonard that he did not need to purchase additional flood insurance.the leonards argue that these oral misrepresentations modified their insurance coverage.
as a threshold matter,it is not at all clear whether the leonards are proceeding under a tort or a contract theory.they contend in their opening brief that the district court failed to adjudicate their contractual oral modification claim.the leonards pled,however,only equitable fraud count eight and fraud claims sounding in tort counts nine and ten.the complaint contains no contract claims at all.
the leonards attempt to obscure this discrepancy by explaining that the allegations of their detrimental reliance on fletcher statements,when coupled with their equitable estoppel claim count two,amount to what may more broadly be termed a claim based on oral modification of an insurance contract.they argue this without ever intoning the word oral or modification in their pleadings.even were we to credit this explanation,the leonards further allegation that the district court failed to adjudicate their modification claim is wrong the court explicitly stated that fletcher did not materially misrepresent the terms of the nationwide homeowners policy to the leonards,and fletcher did not make any statements which could be reasonably understood to alter the terms of the nationwide policy.leonard,d at emphasis added.the oral modification claim was addressed and rejected,assuming it was ever presented in the first place.nonetheless,whether they proceed under a misrepresentation theory or a theory,the leonards lose on both scores.the district court should never have considered the argument because fletcher statements are irrelevant to interpreting this policy as a matter of mississippi insurance law.
negligent misrepresentation theory 
the leonards fail to present an actionable claim of negligent misrepresentation because they can not prove two of the elements required to show apparent authority.first,nationwide conduct in no way indicated that fletcher was authorized to orally modify policies he sold.the form has an integration clause specifically disclaiming the agent ability to do so 
how your policy may be changed 
c a waiver or change of a part of this policy must be in writing by use to be valid.our request for an appraisal or examination does not waive our rights.
paul leonard admits to having read the policy.even had he not,knowledge of the integration clause is imputed to him under state law only t hose dealing with agents without notice of restrictions upon the agent authority have a right to presume that their authority is there.hollins,so d at citation omitted.
second,the leonards reliance on fletcher statements was objectively unreasonable in light of the policy language clearly excluding water damage,including damage caused by a flood.see supra section.
and even if the leonards can satisfy the third element of apparent change in misrepresentation claim is stale.the most recent statements the leonards cite were uttered six years ago in.the statute of limitations for negligent misrepresentation in mississippi is three years.see ann.because the policy terms are unambiguous,the leonards claim accrued at the time the misrepresentation was made.see oaks sellers,so d,action for misrepresentation of policy terms accrues at execution carter citigroup,so d,watts horace mann life ins,so d,claim that ambiguous policy tolled statute of limitations rejected because policy language was plain.the claim is.
oral modification theory 
there are at least two reasons why the leonards claim fails as well.first,the policy integration clause pretermits the claim as a matter of law see stephens equitable life assurance soc y,so d,any alleged oral agreement does not have any effect on the written insurance contract that had a general provision that unambiguously prohibited any oral modification.the leonards do not allege that the provision permitting only written modification of the policy has itself been modified.see,eastline marion apartments,so d,dispositive issue whether or not the parties waived the stipulation that all modifications be in writing instead,they argue that their pleading of equitable estoppel obviates entirely the need to resort to the integration clause.that claim ignores the rule that doctrines like equitable estoppel that allow insureds to procure rights at variance with a written insurance policy can not be used to extend coverage not otherwise provided by the policy.see kubow hartford cas.ins,cir paul fire marine ins.vest transp,cir c onditions going to coverage or scope of policy of insurance,as distinguished from those furnishing a ground for forfeiture,may not be waived by implication from conduct or action.morris am.fidelity fire ins,so d.
second,mississippi law requires that oral modification correspond to general rules of contract formation,like the requirement.see,rotenberry hooker,so d.the leonards do not contend that fletcher said that the policy covered all hurricane damage instead,they contend that fletcher stated they did not need additional hurricane coverage because they did not live in an area classified flood zone a by fema.from this,paul leonard inferred that the policy covered hurricane damage.see leonard,d at.that inference does not provide the mutual assent necessary to modify the contract.the leonards additional claim that equitable estoppel does not require mutual assent is irrelevant because estoppel can not operate to create hurricane coverage that does not exist under the policy.
whether the leonards proceed under a contract or tort claim,their allegation that fletcher comments entitle them to additional coverage is incorrect as a matter of mississippi law,and requires us to reverse the district court contrary holding.
fletcher conversations with other policyholders 
in addition to the district court error regarding claims based on statements made to the leonards,the district court additionally abused its discretion in considering evidence of statements made by fletcher to policyholders other than the leonards.over nationwide objection,the district court admitted statements fletcher made to five nationwide policyholders as habit evidence under federal rule of evidence because there was enough evidence as a matter of habit and routine,that fletcher expressed his opinion,when he was asked,that customers should not purchase flood insurance unless they lived in a flood prone area leonard,d at.admission of the oral statements under rule was a clear abuse of discretion.the leonards failed to respond to nationwide briefing on this issue.
rule use of the term habit suggests a regular response to a repeated specific situation that has become.reyes.pac,cir see also pursley dretke,cir unpublished habit means a specific reaction to a specific set of stimuli that is reflexive,repeated,and invariable in nature.fletcher has about fifteen hundred customers.comments he purportedly made to five of them over the course of a decade about the need for additional flood coverage do not remotely qualify or quantify as a habit within the meaning the rule.the record demonstrates that fletcher sold nearly two hundred nfip supplemental policies in the years preceding of them to policyholders living in the leonards neighborhood.evidence was lacking to suggest that fletcher statements to other policyholders revealed an invariable,reflexive response to his treatment of inquiries about supplemental flood insurance.admission of the statements under rule was an abuse of discretion.
iii.conclusion 
subject to the foregoing explanation of the trial court errors,we 
the court reached the same conclusion outside the context in electrical fittings thomas betts,when it held that collateral issues litigated below are appealable if they have the potential to affect rights of a party in future litigation.see id.at.at prevailing party in patent dispute entitled to appeal collateral ruling on the validity of a patent claim.the supreme court reversed the court of appeals decision that the threat of collateral estoppel in subsequent suits did not render the appellant a sufficiently aggrieved party within the meaning of article iii.see roper,at.at.
and although not discussed by the fourth circuit in custer,other potential litigants of course pose a damoclean threat to the party aggrieved by collateral rulings because of the potential for the offensive use of nonmutual collateral estoppel in future litigation.see fcc,finding standing on the basis of collateral estoppel and holding that had an article iii stake sufficient to support appeal of a ruling that it was liable for termination of certain access charges but not required to make payments worldcom,fcc,commenting that although petitioner favored the ultimate result reached by fcc,it may have standing to challenge an unfavorable ruling because of the effect on its future legal rights.the instant case is distinguishable from those in which parties appealed issues that had no effect on liability and that would not have preclusive effect in subsequent litigation.see,asarco,secretary of labor,cir finding that prevailing party was not aggrieved by administrative body ruling because it posed no threat of preclusive effect in future litigation,dep t of,bath iron works coulombe,cir.
nor does disagreement among courts necessarily indicate ambiguity.see wooten.farm bureau ins,so d,rejecting contention that differing judicial interpretation of the phrase incurred within one year from the date of the accident rendered the policy language ambiguous.
