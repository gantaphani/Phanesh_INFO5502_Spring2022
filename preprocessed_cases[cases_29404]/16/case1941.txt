pseudonymous plaintiff john doe appeals the dismissal of his complaint against defendant,sexsearch,an online adult dating service that facilitates sexual encounters between its members.doe used sexsearch to meet jane roe,who described herself as an female.the two met and had sexual relations.roe,it turned out,was actually fourteen years old,and doe was consequently arrested and charged with three counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.in an unusual case of first impression,doe then filed suit against sexsearch,alleging an array of violations under ohio law,most of which are variations on the claim that sexsearch is at fault for doe sexual relationship with a minor and the harm that resulted from his arrest.
the district court dismissed all fourteen causes of action under.b for failure to state a claim.in the alternative,the district court held that eight of the fourteen causes of action were also barred by the communications decency act.because we agree with the district court that doe complaint failed to state a claim,we do not reach the question of whether the communications decency act provides sexsearch with immunity from suit.we do not adopt the district court discussion of the act,which would read more broadly than any previous court of appeals decision has read it,potentially abrogating all state or causes of action brought against interactive internet services.we do not have before us any issue concerning the criminal liability of the parties or the voidability of contracts for sexual services.
sexsearch is an online adult dating service.its members use the website to meet one another for sexual encounters.in october,john doe became a gold member of sexsearch,which required him to pay per month and agree to the site terms and conditions,including a promise on doe behalf that he was at least eighteen years old.using the service,doe met jane roe,who likewise had become a gold member after agreeing to sexsearch terms and conditions and warranting that she was at least eighteen.in her profile,she stated that she was born june.after meeting online,roe invited doe to her home on november,at which point they had sexual relations.
at some point thereafter,roe,who was actually fourteen,told the police about her encounter with doe.on december,police surrounded doe home,arrested him,and charged him with three counts of engaging in unlawful sexual conduct with a minor,a felony.for reasons that are unclear,the charges were later dismissed and doe records were sealed.doe claims,however,that the arrest and the publicity that accompanied lasting harm to his reputation,family life,and employment prospects.
based on this harm,doe filed suit against fifteen corporate and individual defendants,whom he believed were the owners of sexsearch.the complaint contained fourteen causes of action,which,as the district court noted,boil down to either a defendants failed to discover that jane roe lied about her age to join the website,or b the contract terms are unconscionable.doe,d.
defendants then filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.for the sake of judicial economy,cytek,which claims to be the true owner of sexsearch,agreed to enter an appearance and waive all issues related to service of process and personal jurisdiction so that the court could consider the b motion before undertaking the task of evaluating personal jurisdiction for each remaining defendant.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss,concluding that doe had failed to state a claim as to each of the fourteen causes of action and,in the alternative,concluding that many of the claims were barred by the communications decency act.this appeal followed.
we review the district court judgment de novo.weiner,cir.we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and accept all factual allegations as true to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.commercial money.union ins,cir.while our analysis primarily focuses on the complaint,matters of public record,orders,items appearing in the record of the case,and exhibits attached to the complaint may be taken into account.amini oberlin,cir.
as noted above,we do not adopt the district court analysis of the communications decency act and explicitly reserve the question of its scope for another day.we do,however,affirm the district court decision to dismiss doe complaint for failure to state a claim.
count one alleges that sexsearch breached its contract with doe by permitting minors to become members of its service.under ohio law,to prove breach of contract,a plaintiff must prove that a contract existed plaintiff fulfilled his obligations defendant failed to fulfill his obligations and damages resulted from this failure.lawrence lorain county cmty,ohio app d,ohio.a contract between doe and sexsearch was formed when doe checked a box indicating that he was over eighteen and had read and agreed to sexsearch terms and conditions and privacy policy.the terms and conditions constitute the content of the contract.doe alleges that sexsearch failed to fulfill its obligations by permitt ing minors to become paid members and by deliver ing a minor to plaintiff for the purpose of sexual relations.compl,at.but the terms and conditions state that sexsearch can not guarantee,and assume s no responsibility for verifying,the accuracy of the information provided by other users of the service.the contract requires that members be eighteen or over to register,but nowhere does sexsearch promise to prevent minors from registering or to monitor members profiles for accuracy.therefore,the complaint does not state a claim because doe has not alleged that sexsearch has breached any promise that is actually part of the contract.
count two alleges that sexsearch fraudulently represented that all persons on its site are years of age,and that it verifies all members profiles prior to posting.compl,at.this allegation stems from a warning on sexsearch stating that all persons within this site are.to state a claim of fraud,plaintiff must allege a a representation b that is material to the transaction at hand,c made falsely,with knowledge of its falsity,d with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,e justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment,and f a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.orbit,helm instrument,ohio app d,ohio.the most obvious deficiency comes from the requirement of justifiable reliance upon the representation.as noted,the terms and conditions expressly disclaim responsibility for verifying members ages.they also state that no information,whether oral or written,obtained by you from sexsearch or through or from sic sexsearch shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the tac.furthermore,having registered for the site himself,doe knew that sexsearch merely required a user to check a box stating that he or she is at least eighteen,with no corroborating evidence required from the user and no attempt at verification made by sexsearch.as a result,there could be no justifiable reliance on the warning,and thus count two does not state a claim for fraudulent representation.
count three alleges that sexsearch negligently inflicted emotional distress by failing to remove roe profile from its website.to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress under ohio law,the plaintiff must allege that he was aware of real physical danger to himself or another.see king bogner,ohio app d,ohio see also heiner moretuzzo,ohio,ohio ohio courts have limited recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress to instances where the plaintiff has either witnessed or experienced a dangerous accident or appreciated the actual physical peril.doe alleged injuries result from embarrassment and harm to social standing and employment prospects he does not allege that he experienced a dangerous accident or appreciated actual physical peril and,consequently,has not stated a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.see wigfall society bank,ohio app d,ohio affirming trial court grant of summary ju
