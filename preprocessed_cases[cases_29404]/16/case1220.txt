this appeal has its origin in the sale of a company subject to an apparently simple right of first offer.cristen gleason gleason founded recognition,usr or company to develop and sell computer systems and software to search,store,and retrieve real estate listing information.in october,gleason agreed to sell all of his capital stock in usr to the defendant,norwest mortgage,norwest,a national mortgage banking company.the sale contract provided that if norwest decided to sell usr within the first five years after the closing date of this sale,it was obliged first to offer it to gleason.if gleason did not accept the offer within thirty days,norwest was free to sell usr to another buyer on terms substantially similar to those offered to gleason.
norwest sold usr to moore business forms,moore in.gleason claims that norwest neither made him the first offer to buy usr nor sold usr at terms substantially similar to those offered to and accepted by moore.gleason moved in a new jersey state court for a preliminary injunction to restrain norwest from proceeding with the sale.norwest removed the action to the united states district court for the district of new jersey,where the court,on october,denied the motion for the injunction.the district court later granted summary judgment for norwest and against gleason.we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion.
gleason founded usr in to develop and sell computer systems and software to store,search,and retrieve real estate listing information.on october,gleason agreed to sell all of the capital stock in the company to norwest for million.gleason remained as president of usr.the stock purchase agreement spa included provisions requiring norwest to maintain usr as a separate profit center for at least five years.particularly pertinent to this appeal,of the spa specifically provided 
norwest agrees that if it decides to sell usr at any time during the first five years after the closing date,it will first offer usr to gleason.gleason shall have days to accept the offer,and if not accepted within the days,norwest shall be free to sell usr to anyone else on terms substantially similar to those offered to gleason.
in early,norwest acquired boris systems,boris,usr former competitor.as early as september,norwest began investigating the sale of boris and usr as a package.norwest created an offering memorandum and other internal and external documents expressing an interest to solicit offers for its usr and boris subsidiaries.by early,after preliminary discussions with several potential buyers,norwest discussions began with moore.commencing in may and through june and july,the negotiations between norwest and moore progressed and intensified.on may,moore wrote norwest that it received corporate approval to proceed with negotiations which will hopefully result in moore acquisition of boris and usr.moore also proposed a price of million for both companies and a general outline of a process to maximize the certainty of closing,including a confidentiality agreement.id.
on june,norwest responded through its investment bank to moore proposal,stating it wanted to move toward a definitive agreement with moore,and would be prepared to cease temporarily preparation of a formal auction for boris and usr if moore accepted norwest terms,viz million purchase price norwest receives participation rights for two years on any initiatives relating to the origination of first mortgage loans through any product offerings by moore moore completes its preliminary due diligence process during any two consecutive day period within nine days of june,to be performed off usr premises moore enters a definitive agreement with norwest by june,moore must not disclose the possible sale of boris or usr during due diligence and moore pays a million fee if it fails to close the transaction.on june,moore wrote norwest stating it received corporate approval to proceed with negotiations for the acquisition of boris and usr,and was making a proposal to pay million.moore also proposed other procedures.
gleason first learned about moore interest in usr and boris on june,when norwest executive vice president mike keller keller invited gleason to dinner and told him that norwest wanted million for boris and usr,that norwest expected to sign an agreement with moore within a few days,and that the million price was allocated million for boris and million for usr.gleason stated that he wanted to buy both companies keller was noncommittal.
on july,moore wrote to norwest stating that moore received corporate approval to proceed with negotiations which hopefully would result in moore acquisition of boris and usr it would pay million for usr and boris it required certain procedures during the due diligence process and the letter was a proposal for how moore would acquire boris and usr.norwest responded on july,stating that the proposed terms were acceptable,and that it had assigned resources to assist moore process.moore later produced,at norwest request,a valuation estimate split attributing million of the proposed million purchase price to usr.
on july,norwest formally offered to sell usr stock to gleason for million,subject to the following terms norwest would have a right to participate in any initiatives for transactional services and products offered by usr a definitive agreement of sale must be entered within thirty days,and gleason would have to place a fee into escrow upon execution norwest would provide transitional accounting and human resources services for the balance of at no charge gleason would have thirty days to accept the offer by formal execution of a mutually agreeable definitive stock purchase agreement and by providing evidence that financing acceptable to norwest was in place if gleason accepted the offer,the purchase must close within days from the date of execution of the definitive agreement and the due diligence process was limited to no more than three days,and must be performed from usr operations.
gleason wrote to norwest on august stating,inter alia,that he was interested in acquiring usr and boris negotiations with financing sources were encouraging the terms norwest offered were unlikely to be met in the time frame proposed if the price for usr changed,he was entitled to another opportunity to purchase usr he had questions about how a norwest software package called would be administered after usr sale and he would be interested in a leveraged buyout if negotiations with moore became difficult.
by august,the day after norwest offer to gleason expired,the price for boris and usr offered by moore had fallen to million.gleason,by letter dated august,offered norwest million for usr pending clarification of the software asset.in that letter,gleason,explaining that he retained an investment bank brown to assist in obtaining financing,also offered million for usr and boris.gleason also asked for more time to negotiate and close a deal.on august,brown wrote to norwest requesting confirmation of the offering price and terms for boris and usr and a sample definitive agreement.norwest did not respond to either the august letters from gleason and brown or the august letter from gleason.norwest,however,worked toward executing binding agreements with moore.
on september,gleason,moving for a preliminary injunction restraining norwest from selling usr and boris,brought a civil action against norwest in the superior court of new jersey,passaic county.norwest removed the action to the united states district court,and successfully opposed the preliminary injunction.on september,in anticipation of the impending sale of usr and boris,norwest caused boris and usr to execute a agreement confirming that both usr and boris had full ownership of.on september,norwest and moore signed two stock purchase agreements,one for boris and one for usr,but the parties did not close on the transactions.moore agreed to pay million for usr.
apparently out of a sense of caution,on september,norwest again offered to sell usr to gleason.norwest stated that it believed gleason right had expired unexercised in august,but that a second opportunity would address gleason claim that norwest did not provide him a meaningful opportunity to exercise his option.norwest enclosed a agreement for in response to gleason query in his august,letter,and a proposed agreement with related schedules.see id.the relevant terms of the offer included gleason had thirty days to accept million purchase price in cash at closing closing and execution of an agreement must be completed by on october,and gleason could perform the due diligence process at any time,subject to a confidentiality agreement,from usr locations.
moore closed on its purchase of boris on october.as part of that sale,moore and norwest executed a agreement in which norwest agreed not to compete with boris for five years after closing,and in which moore allowed norwest to operate usr in competition with boris until usr was sold.moore closed on its purchase of usr on november,after gleason failed to comply with the acceptance terms in the september,offer.
in february,norwest moved for summary judgment on gleason first amended complaint claims of,inter alia,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.also in february,the district court granted gleason leave to file a second amended complaint adding fraud claims.in may,norwest moved for summary judgment on the fraud claims.on september,the district court granted summary judgment against gleason breach of contract and fraud claims.on october,gleason moved for reconsideration based on new evidence,including expert witness testimony developed since march.the district judge denied the motion to reconsider.on october,norwest requested that the court clarify whether it intended to enter summary judgment against the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.on october,the court entered summary judgment against that claim.
before turning to the merits,we must consider,as a threshold matter,our appellate jurisdiction.on january,the parties stipulated to a final judgment order under.b the district judge stated that all claims were resolved through judgment,settlement,or mootness,except that each party claim for contractual attorneys fees and costs under spa remained outstanding the judge found no reason for delay in entry of this final judgment and explicitly labeled the order a final judgment.the judge further stated that the outcome of appeals could materially affect the court determination of which party prevailed and which party lost.when this court docketed the appeal,the clerk warned counsel that dismissal was possible for an unspecified jurisdictional defect.norwest,without conceding that there was appellate jurisdiction,responded that a number of cases have discussed the award of counsel fees in a breach of contract case and the finality of an appeal before such an award is made.gleason responded that the january order of the district court was final within the meaning of final order statute,so that we had jurisdiction to decide the appeal.
gleason,citing the january,final judgment order and budinich becton dickinson,d,argues that there is appellate jurisdiction under.norwest questions whether there is appellate jurisdiction because the attorneys fee issue turns on a provision in the same contract containing the right of first offer provision.even though norwest does not explicitly argue that there is no appellate jurisdiction,we must under the circumstances consider our own jurisdiction before reviewing the merits.see trent realty assocs.first fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.
when an outstanding claim for attorneys fees is by a statutory prevailing party,the unresolved issue of those fees does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.see budinich,at.however,we have held that when attorneys fees are part of the contractual damages at issue on the merits,a district court order delaying quantifying the amount of such fees is for purposes of appeal.see ragan excavating,cir.w hen an award of attorney fees is based on a contractual provision and is an integral part of the contractual relief sought,the order does not become final and appealable until the attorney fees are quantified.id.ragan distinguished claims for attorneys fees by prevailing parties under statute from claims for attorneys fees as damages.see vargas hudson county bd.of elections,cir recognizing distinction in treatment under between fees as an element of damages and fees for a statutory prevailing party.in this case,the claim for attorney fees is not predicated on a statutory prevailing party provision but on the contractual obligation to pay attorneys fees to the prevailing party in whose favor judgment is entered.spa.for all practical purposes,we see no difference under these circumstances,for finality purposes,between payment of attorneys fees to a prevailing party under statute and payment of attorneys fees under the contract to a prevailing party.the prevailing party attorneys fees provided for in spa are not an integral part of the contractual relief sought the issue of which party prevailed in the litigation on the merits is collateral to the substantive issues on appeal and does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.
the rule b final judgment was final for purposes of appeal of the substantive determinations.thus,we have appellate jurisdiction.see.gleason and norwest are citizens of different states,and the amount in controversy exceeds subject matter jurisdiction exists.see.
gleason appeals the summary judgment against his breach of express contract,breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud claims.we exercise plenary review of a grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.see kiewit eastern,l r constr,cir.the court may grant summary judgment only if,after drawing all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see id.in determining whether the district court erred,we must view the facts as asserted by the nonmoving party as true if they are supported by affidavits or other admissible evidentiary material.see becton dickinson wolckenhauer,cir aman cort furniture rental,cir.a nonmoving party has created a genuine issue of material fact if it has provided sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find in its favor at trial.see brewer quaker state oil refining,cir.summary judgment is appropriate for the moving party if no reasonable juror could conclude that the party should prevail.see orsatti new jersey state police,cir.
in this case,the spa states that it shall in all respects be governed by,and enforced and interpreted in accordance with,the laws of the state of minnesota.see spa.we perceive no error in the district court determination that minnesota law applies to the breach of contract and implied duty of good faith and fair dealing claims.the district court also appropriately applied new jersey law to the fraud claim because there is no significant distinction between the substantive laws of fraud among the interested states of new jersey,iowa,and minnesota.neither party contests the district court choice of law decisions.
breach of of spa 
the objective of judicial interpretation of disputed contract provisions is to give effect to the discernable intention of the parties,ascertaining that intent,if possible,by examining the contractual plain language.see midway ctr.assocs.midway.a contract is unambiguous if the court,without looking to extrinsic evidence,can determine the meaning of the contract language.see icc leasing midwestern mach.the determination of whether a contract term is clear or ambiguous is a question of law.see art goebel,north suburban agencies.a contract is ambiguous if,based on its language alone,it is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.see id.whether a contract is ambiguous depends on the meaning assigned to words or phrases in accordance with the apparent purpose of the contract as a whole.see id.
of the spa states 
right of first refusal to repurchase.
norwest agrees that if it decides to sell usr at any time during the first five years after the closing date,it will first offer usr to gleason.gleason shall have days to accept the offer,and if not accepted within the days,norwest shall be free to sell usr to anyone else on terms substantially similar to those offered to gleason.
the threshold question is a determination of the extent of the legal right provided by to gleason for the repurchase of usr.gleason and norwest contest whether provides a right of first offer or a right of first refusal.this is a question of law,the answer to which lays the groundwork for every issue on appeal.
were we to consider the substantive language of as giving gleason the right of first offer to purchase,as he argues on appeal here,we would declare the provision void for vagueness.no price for the property is fixed in,nor are any terms or conditions of sale.nor does set a method for ascertaining a sale price.see portnoy brown,p rice is an essential ingredient of every contract for the transfer of property and must be sufficiently definite and certain or capable of being ascertained from the contract between the parties.restatement second of contracts,see also i richard lord,williston on contracts.on the other hand,if is construed,as we think the parties truly intended at the time the instrument was executed,as a right of first refusal then the price and terms are determined by reference to the same terms offered by a bona fide purchaser.thus,a right of first refusal,also known as a preemptive right,empowers gleason with a preferential right to repurchase usr on the same terms offered by a bona fide purchaser.in the absence of such a construction,this naked right of first offer can have no legal significance or preemptive right whatsoever.without a price,terms,or conditions,a right of first refusal creates a dormant right of preemption,the right to receive an offer before others do,but based on third party information.the right can not be exercised until receipt of a bona fide third party offer.once the holder of a right of first refusal receives notice of a third party offer with price and terms,the right of first refusal is transformed into an option.see 
under the basic rule of contract construction,we ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the agreement.to this end,we construe the contract as a whole,giving effect to every portion of the instrument,if possible,and utilizing that construction rendering the agreement legal rather than one which makes it void.see richard lord,williston on contracts.consistent with our construction of,the caption of the section identifying gleason right to repurchase states,right of first refusal.we are mindful,however,of language in the spa removing legal effect to captions.see spa.
thus,giving gleason as the party and the subject of the provisions of the benefit of all inferences,we conclude that of the spa gave gleason not a right to notice of a decision by norwest to sell,but under the facts of this case,a preemptive right of first refusal,effective upon norwest receipt of a bona fide third party offer.we now turn to whether norwest complied with gleason preemptive right.
the district court held that there were no disputed issues of material fact and that norwest acted consistently with the clear and unambiguous terms of the sp a when it negotiated with moore made the first offer of sale to gleason and waited thirty days for gleason to respond to the offer and sold to moore after thirty days at substantially similar terms.
gleason argues on appeal that five disputed issues of material fact remain whether norwest decided to sell before it offered usr to gleason,thus purportedly breaching the spa once it decided to sell usr,whether norwest first offered usr to gleason whether the terms offered to moor e were substantially similar to those offered to and rejected by gleason whether the million price offered to gleason was substantially similar to the price moore paid and whether gleason suffered any loss,detriment,or injury.
norwest decision to sell 
the parties contest when norwest decided to sell usr,but this is not a material fact.gleason argues that as soon as norwest decided to sell usr,norwest was required immediately to make an offer to gleason under.but does not require such action.the date norwest decided to sell is only relevant to whether it was during the first five years after the closing date of gleason sale to norwest.the parties agree that norwest decided to sell usr during the five year period that ends the inquiry.the timing of the sale,whether determined by tax,marketing or other considerations,remained at all times within norwest control so long as it first gave gleason an opportunity to purchase usr on substantially similar terms as those appearing in moore bona fide offer.to the extent that the district court found or implied that norwest decided to sell on any given date,that finding or that implication is irrelevant.the offering memorandum that norwest produced in was an invitation to negotiate it was not a legal offer for sale.gleason attempts to construct a disputed issue of material fact,when the language of can only be reasonably read to create a right of first refusal,especially on the facts of this case.
whether norwest first offered usr to gleason 
gleason argues strenuously that once norwest decided to sell usr,norwest was required to communicate with gleason first and that norwest overtures to third parties like moore breached.
section gives gleason the right of first refusal,not a right to first negotiation.as we construe,the word first in the phrase first offer means only that gleason was to have been given the opportunity to exercise his right of first refusal.norwest could have valued usr strictly with accounting information,but nothing in prevented norwest from ascertaining usr value by exploring the marketplace and soliciting offers to purchase.frequently,negotiations for a contract are begun between parties by general expressions of willingness to enter into a bargain upon stated terms,and yet the natural construction of the words and conduct of the parties is that they are inviting offers,or suggesting the terms of a possible future bargain,rather than making positive offers.richard cord,williston on contracts ed.
on july,norwest offered to sell usr to gleason,thus providing him with the opportunity to exercise his right of first refusal.until then,norwest had not sold usr to moore or anyone.therefore,any prior negotiations,communications,or conversations with regard to the sale of usr to moore or anyone else are irrelevant and any factual disputes as to those matters are not material.
substantial similarity 
section permitted norwest to sell usr to a third party only if norwest first offered it to gleason on terms substantially similar to those offered by the third party.gleason argues that norwest breached by selling usr to moore on terms more favorable than those offered to gleason.
generally,a determination of substantial similarity would be a jury issue,but the terms that norwest offered to moore and gleason were so close that no reasonable jury could find that they were not substantially similar.the july,offer to gleason required that norwest would have a right to participate in any initiatives for transactional services and products offered by usr a definitive agreement of sale must be entered,and gleason would have to pay a fee into escrow upon execution norwest would provide transitional accounting and human resources services for the balance of at no charge gleason would have thirty days to accept the offer by for mal execution of a mutually agreeable definitive stock purchase agreement and by providing evidence that financing acceptable to norwest was in place if gleason accepted the offer,the purchase must close within fifteen days from the date of execution of the definitive agreement and due diligence was limited to no more than three days,and had to be performed off site from usr operations.gleason argues that norwest gave moore an indefinite period to conduct due diligence no deadline for execution of a stock purchase agreement no obligation to pay a fee an out in the event moore was unable to conclude employment agreements for key individuals and a agreement.see appellant reply br.gleason five objections concern terms of usr sale to moore.
the district court reasoned that the longer deadlines for moore did not amount to a breach because provides only thirty days to gleason to accept the offer.the restrictive terms did appear to hamper gleason ability to accept norwest two offers,but gleason only bargained for thirty days to accept the offer.the district court did not specifically discuss the stress between the provision in and the longer term given to moore.
substantial similarity is not lacking among the terms.independent review of norwest two offers to gleason and the final terms of sale to moore shows that they were substantially similar.a fee appears to have been contemplated between norwest and moore as early as june.see june,letter from norwest by ubs securities,to moore.moore had more time for due diligence because spa allowed norwest to limit gleason due diligence to thirty days.gleason had been president of usr through august,and presumably was familiar with its operations and needed far less time and access to usr financial statements than moore did.the agreement between norwest and moore was entered after gleason first offer expired,and thus can not be fairly used against norwest as an additional term of sale.
price terms 
the most significant term of the offer to sell concerned the price for usr.if the price offered to gleason was artificially excessive,this would in all probability discourage gleason efforts to purchase and would promote norwest persistent plan to conclude successfully the package sale of both usr and boris to moore.gleason argues that norwest million price offer was generated improperly because it was an arbitrary proration of moore combined valuation of usr and boris.he argues that moore and norwest padded usr price and understated boris price to obstruct gleason from acquiring usr and to allow norwest to package sell its two subsidiaries.gleason argues that moore actually paid less than million for usr,and paid more than million for boris,resulting in a purchase at terms substantially different from those offered to gleason.gleason produced documentary and expert evidence that moore had valued boris at million in july,and reduced its value by million by september,and the million price was generated by adding of additional and undocumented synergies.appx.expert report of winston himsworth.norwest responds that gleason never raised his padded pricing argument before the district court,and that he can not raise it now for the first time.
the ruling on a motion for summary judgment is to be made on the record the parties have actually presented,not on one potentially possible.see shafer reo motors,cir.generally,barring exceptional circumstances,like an intervening change in the law or the lack of representation by an attorney,this court does not review issues raised for the first time at the appellate level.see gardiner virgin islands water power,cir citing united parcel serv.intern.broth.local,cir.although we have discretion to review an argument not raised in the trial court,we ordinarily refuse to do so.
gleason argues that his submissions between the close of discovery and the district court ruling on the motion for summary judgment contained support for the padding argument,and should have been consider ed in response to the motion for summary judgment.gleason also suggests that the district court should have inferred or implied the padding argument because of the severe risk of price manipulation in a package deal where part of the package is subject to a right of refusal.
on august,nearly a month before the judge made his first ruling on the motions for summary judgment,gleason submitted the declaration of winston himsworth himsworth in support of an expert report concerning usr proper valuation.in his declaration,himsworth concluded that a proportionate price for usr could have been no more than million,far less than the million norwest offered gleason.some courts have held that allocations of price to elements of a package may readily be manipulated to defeat contractual rights of first refusal.see,pantry pride,stop shop,cir see also gyurkey babler,idaho,collecting cases hinson roberts.although the cited cases concern primarily sales of real property and are factually distinguishable from this case,they establish the principle that we find controlling allocations of price by interested parties to elements of a package may readily be manipulated to defeat contractual rights to substantially similar price terms.in deciding the motions for summary judgment,the district court should have scrutinized carefully the financial evidence the parties produced.himsworth report,combined with the strong inherent potential for price padding between norwest and moore,as exacerbated by norwest reliance on an appraisal by a prospective purchaser,placed the padding issue before the district court.
the evidence in the record presents a dispute of material fact concerning whether norwest and moore padded usr price and valuation.accordingly,we will remand for hearing and fact finding on the price terms as they relate to substantial similarity.on remand,the district court must consider loss,detriment,or injury if gleason proves that there was this breach of the spa.his damages,if any,will be a question of fact for the jury.
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the district court dismissed this claim,reasoning that minnesota does not recognize a separate or independent claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
in minnesota,every contract includes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in re hennepin county recycling bond,requiring that one party not unjustifiably hinder other party performance of contract sterling capital advisors,herzog.one who frustrates the satisfaction of a condition precedent can not take advantage of that failure.see tolzman town of wyoming,no,wl.bad faith is defined as a party refusal to fulfill some duty or contractual obligation based on an ulterior motive,not an honest mistake regarding one rights or duties.see lassen first bank eden prairie.
if a jury finds that the price terms were not substantially similar,it could also reasonably find that norwest hindered gleason performance under spa.as discussed above,package pricing provides immense power to manipulate the terms of the proposed transaction and to bloat the offering price for the usr segment to gleason.norwest may have abused its power.
norwest argues again that gleason did not preserve this issue for appeal because he failed to raise the argument in the district court.however,gleason opposition to norwest motion for summary judgment states f or the reasons set forth above with respect to norwest conduct in breaching and of the spa,as well as its attempt to cheat gleason on his employment agreement,significant material factual issues are presented with respect to the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing claim.but the district court did not consider any of gleason claims under the implied warranty because of its errant conclusion that minnesota law does not recognize such a cause of action.the district court should be in a position to consider the issue in toto on remand.
the district court held that norwest made no material misrepresentations to gleason,and that gleason suffered no damages because he received all to which he was entitled under the spa.gleason argues he suffered damages from fraud because norwest did not offer usr to him in december when it began soliciting bids keller knowingly and intentionally lied in response to gleason inquiries about whether boris and usr were for sale and norwest alleged intentional material misrepresentations had an adverse effect on gleason ability to finance an acquisition of usr.
keller and norwest had no duty to disclose to gleason that norwest was negotiating to divest usr and boris.norwest duty under the spa was
