plaintiff ncr corporation ncr appeals the order of the district court compelling ncr and defendant korala associates kal to arbitrate ncr claims against kal,pursuant to part of chapter of the federal arbitration act,see,et,which implements the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june.
background 
ncr is one of the largest providers of automatic teller machines atm equipment,integrated hardware and software systems,and related maintenance and support services in the world.ncr atms use either the windows operating system or the operating system.ncr installs its aptra xfs software aptra xfs on those atms using the windows operating system and its software on those atms using the operating system.ncr owns a registered copyright for its aptra xfs software and had applied,on an expedited basis,to register a copyright for aptra xfs precursor software.ncr had also applied,on an expedited basis,to register copyrights for two versions of the software.
over ncr atms are installed,and at the time ncr filed its amended complaint,approximately of these atms required the installation of an upgraded software system so that the machines would be compliant.ncr has developed a system upgrade to install on its atms.kal,likewise,has developed a system upgrade,which can be installed on ncr atms.ncr asserts that kal could not have developed its system upgrade without illegally copying and analyzing ncr aptra xfs and software.
on december,kal and ncr entered into a software license agreement agreement in which kal agreed to develop and license to ncr three specific software components for ncr controls,self service controls,and service together form software known as kalypso.kal also agreed to develop additional elements of kalypso from time to time under the terms of the agreement.in order to facilitate kal development of software,ncr agreed to loan to kal certain computer hardware software items that were necessary to enable kal to adapt and support the kalypso components.to that end,ncr loaned to kal an ncr atm which contained ncr copyrighted aptra xfs software.
in addition to this particular atm,ncr alleged that kal obtained and accessed other ncr atms on which aptra xfs or was installed from ncr bank licensees or from dealers of used or refurbished ncr atms.any software still installed on these atms could not have been operated without authorization from ncr.
ncr alleged that kal,without permission,obtained access to,made unauthorized use of,and engaged in unauthorized copying of the aptra xfs software on ncr atms,including the atm loaned to kal.according to ncr,by unlawfully accessing and copying the aptra xfs and software,kal was able to develop its upgrade can be installed on ncr atms.
in,ncr brought suit against kal seeking damages and injunctive relief.in counts i and ii of its amended complaint,ncr alleged kal direct copyright infringement of ncr aptra xfs and software.in counts iii and iv,ncr alleged kal contributory copyright infringement of the aptra xfs and software,asserting that kal induced ncr licensees to breach confidentiality restrictions contained within ncr licensing agreements by providing kal access to the aptra xfs and software.in count v,ncr alleged kal tortious interference with contract,asserting that kal acted intentionally to induce ncr licensees to breach the confidentiality restrictions contained within ncr licensing agreements by providing kal access to the aptra xfs and software.in count vi,ncr alleged that kal illegally imported the infringing kalignite upgrade solutions into the united states.and in count vii,ncr alleged that kal engaged in unethical business practices or common law unfair competition.
kal moved to dismiss ncr amended complaint under rule b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,to compel the arbitration of all of ncr claims pursuant to and in compliance with the arbitration clause contained within the agreement,and to dismiss the matter under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.the district court first denied kal motion to dismiss under rule b,finding that it had subject matter jurisdiction under both diversity and federal question jurisdiction.but the district court granted kal motion to compel arbitration and dismissed ncr complaint without prejudice.the court did not address kal motion to dismiss under rule b or on the basis of forum non conveniens.ncr timely appealed the order compelling arbitration.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo a district court decision regarding the arbitrability of a particular dispute.walker ryan family steak houses,cir.before compelling an unwilling party to arbitrate,the court must engage in a limited review to determine whether the dispute is arbitrable meaning that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement.javitch first union,cir citing at t techs.commc ns workers of,d.
the arbitration clause contained within the agreement provides that 
any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,or breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.the arbitrator shall be appointed upon the mutual agreement of both parties failing which both parties will agree to be subject to any arbitrator that shall be chosen by the president of the law society.
the parties do not dispute that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists rather the issue of contention is whether ncr claims fall within the substantive scope of the agreement.
as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.masco zurich am.ins,cir quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.despite this strong presumption in favor of arbitration,arbitration is a matter of contract between the parties,and one can not be required to submit to arbitration a dispute which it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.simon pfizer,cir quoting united steelworkers,local fireproofing,cir.
when faced with a broad arbitration clause,such as one covering any dispute arising out of an agreement,a court should follow the presumption of arbitration and resolve doubts in favor of arbitration.indeed,in such a case,only an express provision excluding a specific dispute,or the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration,will remove the dispute from consideration by the arbitrators.

here the parties dispute not only the scope of the arbitration clause,but the standard by which to determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable.the district court,relying on language contained within fazio lehman,cir,concluded that the arbitration clause language any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract encompasses all claims which touch upon matters covered by the agreement.emphasis added.the court held that every allegation in ncr amended complaint relates to some part of the agreement and will require examination and interpretation of the agreement or an exhibit to the agreement.
ncr argues that it was legal error for the court to apply the touches upon matters standard,while kal argues that touches upon matters is the proper standard for this circuit.we agree with ncr.while the fazio court stated that e ven real torts can be covered by arbitration clauses if the allegations underlying the claims touch matters covered by the agreement,at quoting genesco,kakiuchi,cir,that court did not apply this standard to determine if the plaintiff claims fell within the scope of the arbitration clause.instead,the standard the court enunciated and applied was whether an action could be maintained without reference to the contract or relationship at issue.if it could,it is likely outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.id.at.
the supreme court has also referenced this touch matters language.in mitsubishi motors soler,d,the court stated that insofar as the allegations underlying the statutory claims touch matters covered by the enumerated articles,the court of appeals properly resolved any doubts in favor of arbitrability.at.emphasis added.this court,however,has explained that the touch matters language in mitsubishi motors should be considered in light of its narrow context 
the issue the mitsubishi court addressed was whether the arbitration clause should be read narrowly to exclude the statutory claims,which were part of the respondent counterclaim and included claims under the antitrust laws.id.at.the enumerated articles were provisions of a distribution agreement to which the arbitration provision specifically referred.id.at.defendant,in its brief,apparently treats the court statement as announcing the standard that a controversy is arbitrable if it touches matters covered by the arbitration clause.defendant reads this passing comment out of context,and we do not believe the words have the broad impact defendant would give them.
alticor,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.and more recently,we reiterated the standard we apply to determine whether a particular claim or dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement if an action can be maintained without reference to the contract or relationship at issue,the action is likely outside the scope of the arbitration with the presumption in favor of arbitrability and the intent of the parties.nestle waters,bollman,cir citing fazio,at.
under this court precedent,the following standard emerges for determining which of ncr claims must be resolved in arbitration while we must bear in mind the presumption of arbitrability,the cornerstone of our inquiry rests upon whether we can resolve the instant case without reference to the agreement containing the arbitration clause.see nestle waters,at.if such a reference is not necessary to the resolution of a particular claim,then compelled arbitration is inappropriate,unless the intent of the parties indicates otherwise.id.we now apply this standard to ncr claims.
copyright infringement 
liability for direct copyright infringement arises from the violation of any one of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner.the owner of copyright has the exclusive right to,and to authorize others to,reproduce,distribute,perform,display,and prepare derivative works from the copyrighted work.bridgeport music,rhyme syndicate music,cir internal citations omitted.to succeed in a copyright infringement action,a plaintiff must establish that he or she owns the copyrighted creation,and that the defendant copied it.kohus mariol,cir.but where there is no direct evidence of copying,a plaintiff may establish an inference of copying by showing access to the work by the defendant and a substantial similarity between the two works at issue.id.at quoting ellis diffie,cir.
aptra xfs count i 
ncr could not maintain a copyright infringement claim against kal without referencing the agreement.while a court would not need to reference the agreement to determine if ncr owns a copyright for aptra xfs,a court would need to reference the agreement to determine what,if any,authorization ncr provided to kal with respect to the aptra xfs software contained on the atm that ncr loaned to kal under the agreement.in its amended complaint,ncr alleged that in each such instance of operating and accessing aptra xfs software on an ncr atm,kal copying of the software was not licensed or otherwise authorized by ncr or any other party.to determine whether kal lawfully copied aptra xfs,by for instance obtaining a license or ncr authorization,a court must examine and possibly construe or interpret the terms of the agreement and its exhibits.
ncr argues that in its amended complaint it also alleged that kal had access to the aptra xfs software through ncr licensees and refurbished atms,matters whose resolution would not require examination of the agreement.enforcement of the arbitration agreement here might,ncr argues,result in piecemeal litigation.see,bratt,noble int l,cir.we do not believe,however,that we must parse out ncr claims in such detail.it is sufficient that a court would have to reference the agreement for part of ncr direct infringement claim.under these circumstances,we find that the copyright infringement claim as to aptra xfs falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
we reach a different conclusion,however,with respect to ncr claim that kal directly infringed the software copyright.no reference to the agreement is necessary to determine whether ncr owns a copyright in the software or kal was licensed or authorized to access copy the software.while the agreement is not limited to kal developing software only for atms running aptra xfs software,neither the agreement itself nor the circumstances surrounding its implementation implicate the software.
kal argues that any claim relating to the software is in fact arbitrable.kal points to several items in the amended complaint to support its argument.first,ncr agreed that kal would develop and license components of its kalypso software for all of ncr just those containing aptra xfs software.second,ncr agreed to loan kal computer hardware software items that were necessary to enable kal to adapt and support the kalypso components,and the agreement does not limit the loaned equipment to just those atms containing aptra xfs software.third,ncr does not allege that kal engaged in any different course of conduct in order to infringe ncr copyright in the software.fourth,kal points out that ncr alleged that kal engaged in unauthorized copying of the aptra xfs software when kal operated ncr atms whether obtained from ncr pursuant to the agreement,from an ncr licensee,or from a atm dealer.emphasis added.
in contrast to the aptra xfs software,however,the software has no obvious link to the agreement and finding such a link would require us to draw too many inferences that are simply not warranted.we,therefore,conclude that the parties agreement did not contemplate arbitrating disputes relating to the software.
kal next argues that even if the software was not installed on the atm that ncr loaned to kal under the agreement,the claims are closely related and we should therefore compel ncr to arbitrate the claims as well.in simon pfizer,cir,we determined that 
w here one claim is specifically covered by an arbitration agreement,and a second claim is not,the arbitrability of the second is governed by the extent to which the second claim is substantially identical to the first.on the one hand,a party can not avoid arbitration simply by renaming its claims so that they appear facially outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.in order to determine whether such renaming has occurred,a court must examine the underlying an otherwise arbitrable claim has simply been renamed or recast it will share the same factual basis as the arbitrable claim.however,a claim that is truly outside of an arbitration agreement likewise can not be forced into arbitration,even though there may be factual allegations in common.in particular,the determination that a claim requires reference to an arbitrable issue or factual dispute is not determinative.
at internal punctuation and citations omitted.we conclude that while the aptras xfs and claims are similar,the claims are not identical.ncr claims relating to are truly outside the arbitration clause even though there are factual allegations common to both types of software.
contributory copyright infringement 
liability for contributory infringement derives from the defendant relationship to the direct infringement.contributory infringement occurs when one,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes,or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.
bridgeport music,wb music,cir internal punctuation and citations omitted emphasis added.that is,a plaintiff must allege direct copyright infringement by a knowledge by the defendant that the was directly infringing and defendant material contribution to the infringement.parker google,cir.and w ith respect to the element of knowledge,contributory liability requires that the secondary infringer know or have reason to know of the direct infringement.encore
