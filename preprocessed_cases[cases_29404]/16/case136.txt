wilmington trust company and jay,of the paul special revocable trust,challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to pruco life insurance company on pruco claim for a judgment of mutual rescission of a life insurance policy,owned by the trust,on the life of paul.
this case turns on a limited set of material facts.pruco sought rescission of the policy after it discovered that the policy application had contained material misrepresentations about the health of the insured.it tendered to wilmington a check in the amount of the policy premiums paid plus interest,along with a letter clearly stating that the purpose of the check was to effect rescission of the policy.under the trust agreement,wilmington had ceded decisionmaking authority to coventry capital i llc,a premium financing company,which was acting as the servicing agent for a bank that had taken a security interest in the policy.wilmington accordingly forwarded the check and the letter to coventry,and after three weeks of investigation and consultation with counsel,coventry sent the check back to wilmington with instructions to cash it.wilmington did so.at no time before or since has anyone attempted to return the money to pruco.
under these circumstances,the district court concluded that,as a matter of law,a mutual rescission had taken place,and pruco was entitled to a judgment declaring the policy void ab initio.in an effort to avoid this conclusion,wilmington and jay raise a series of arguments that attempt to obscure the relevant facts.we reject these arguments and affirm the district court judgment.
in the fall of,on the advice of his accountant,paul met with an insurance broker,vincent passananti,to discuss purchasing a life insurance policy.passananti explained to that he could purchase this insurance using premium financing paul would take a loan to pay the premiums,and when the loan matured he could sell the policy on the open market,using the proceeds to pay off the loan and retaining any excess proceeds for himself.paul testified that his intention was to sell the policy after about two years.
to obtain the loan,passananti submitted paul medical records to coventry,a company with which passananti had a contract to produce premium financing transactions.at least one of these records noted that paul had been experiencing some memory loss.after conducting its own medical underwriting,coventry approved the premium financing on january,and arranged for a loan through lasalle bank.
later that month,paul created two trusts that would be used to take out the premium finance loan and eventually hold the life insurance policy.the first was the paul special trust,of which jay was the sole trustee.the second was the paul special revocable trust,of which the first trust was the settlor and jay and wilmington were.wilmington is a professional trust company that acts as trustee for approximately trusts in connection with coventry premium finance loans.the two trusts and wilmington then entered into a supplement to the trust agreement,which provided,inter alia,that wilmington would create a to enter into the loan agreement with lasalle.
the agreement provided that jay and wilmington would perform their duties as trustees at the direction of lasalle or its designees for the duration of the loan.the note and security agreement between the and lasalle stated that coventry would act as lasalle servicing agent and confirmed that jay and wilmington would follow coventry instructions until lasalle decided otherwise.further,jay and paul each signed a power of attorney designating coventry as his for purposes of,respectively,the and the life insurance policy.
meanwhile,passananti began making inquiries on paul behalf to a number of life insurance companies,including pruco.he sent an informal inquiry to pruco on january.pursuant to a hipaa authorization signed by paul,passananti also gathered and sent paul medical records to pruco and other insurers.the parties vigorously contest which medical records were sent to pruco and when.it is at least common ground,however,that at no time before or during its underwriting process did pruco receive a copy of an earlier letter from a neurologist to paul primary care doctor,dated january,which stated that the neurologist believed paul had p robable mild alzheimer disease and that paul had been given a medication,razadyne er,used to treat alzheimer disease.it is uncontested that paul actually received this medication.further,the inquiry passananti sent to pruco included a medical exam report that also did not mention memory loss or alzheimer disease.while the records that pruco undisputedly received did show that paul had at times complained of depression and dizziness,they did not reflect any probable or actual diagnoses that pruco would consider materially adverse health conditions.alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia would have been considered material.
based on the information it had received,pruco issued a tentative offer of life insurance,subject to the receipt of additional items,including a formal application.on february,paul,through passananti,submitted an application to pruco for a million life insurance policy an amount that was later increased to million.the application contained a number of questions about the insured medical history paul instructed passananti to mark no on everything.the parties do not dispute that some of these no answers constituted misrepresentations.specifically,paul answered no to the question of whether he had been diagnosed with or treated for any disorder of the brain or nervous system,even though he had recently complained of memory problems and received a diagnosis of p robable mild alzheimer disease along with medication to treat that condition.he also answered no to the question of whether he was currently taking any prescription medications,even though he had been given the razadyne.
on march,pruco issued a million policy on paul life.the policy was issued to jay as trustee of the special trust.wilmington,as of the special revocable trust,was added as an owner and beneficiary of the policy on march.lasalle then took a security interest in the policy as collateral for its premium finance loan.
approximately a year and a half later,in the fall of,pruco received an inquiry from coventry relating to the policy.this inquiry suggested to pruco that paul intended to sell the policy,which raised the underwriting manager suspicion that something else was going on with paul health.pruco then ordered paul updated medical records,which revealed the previously undisclosed information about paul memory loss,p robable mild alzheimer diagnosis,and razadyne prescription.after reviewing the records,pruco concluded that paul had made material misrepresentations about his health and that these misrepresentations constituted grounds for rescinding the policy.
on february,pruco sent wilmington a letter and a check for.pruco also copied the letter to paul,and jay learned about the letter from conversations with paul financial advisors.the letter stated,in pertinent part 
we recently received information about paul medical history that was not disclosed on the application for insurance dated february,if we had known this information at the time of application,we would not have issued the policy.we are writing to inform you that the policy is not in force and is void as of the policy contract date of march.we have enclosed with this letter pruco check payable to you in the amount of as the return of the total amount of premiums,including interest,paid under the policy.
the letter went on to detail the representations paul had made in the application that were contradicted by the recently obtained medical records,and it stated that pruco was accordingly entitled to rescind the policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation.
as soon as it received the rescission letter,wilmington forwarded both the letter and the check to coventry along with a request for instructions.coventry counsel then began assessing the situation,including by contacting passananti and jay and by deliberating with another coventry attorney and coventry chief executive officer.coventry also already had in its possession various medical records of paul that it had received in the course of its underwriting process for the premium finance loan.coventry corporate representative testified that the company did not assume the truth of the statements in pruco letter when deciding whether to agree to rescission,but rather relied on the assessment of its counsel.
on february,coventry returned the check to wilmington with instructions to deposit it.the next day,wilmington deposited the check into the account of the special revocable trust,then wired the funds from that account to lasalle bank.at no time did coventry,wilmington,or jay inform pruco that the special revocable trust did not agree to rescission or did not intend to accept rescission by depositing the check 
pruco filed a complaint in the rhode island federal district court on february,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.the complaint sought rescission of the policy and a declaration that the policy was void ab initio,on the basis that paul had made material misstatements in his application,which induced pruco to issue the policy.pruco later amended its complaint to add a claim for a declaration that mutual rescission had been effectuated by wilmington acceptance of the returned premiums,as well as a claim for rescission for lack of an insurable interest,based on the allegation that the true beneficiary of the policy was a investor with no insurable interest in paul life.the first amended complaint named wilmington and paul as defendants pruco amended its complaint a second time to name jay as a defendant.paul later filed a motion to dismiss the claims as to him on the ground that he was not an owner or beneficiary of the policy.the district court granted this motion on may.
after discovery,the parties for summary judgment on september,the district court issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment to pruco on its claim for mutual rescission and denying wilmington and jay motions for summary judgment.citing the seminal rhode island case on mutual rescission,klanian new york life insurance,the district court determined that the undisputed facts compelled the conclusion that a mutual rescission had occurred as a matter of law.pruco had tendered the premium refund check with a letter explicitly stating that the check was for the purpose of rescission,using language common in mutual rescission cases.coventry had considered the offer for three weeks and then directed wilmington to cash the check,and wilmington did so.after cashing the check,no party had expressed any intention not to rescind,and there had never been an offer to return the refund to pruco.
in the face of these facts,the district court held that wilmington and jay mere assertions of their subjective intent not to rescind were immaterial.the court also rejected the argument that any agreement to rescind was invalid because pruco had,it was alleged,obtained the rescission by fraud.the undisputed facts demonstrated that coventry,a sophisticated party in the insurance industry,had independently assessed the situation and consulted with counsel,and had not assumed the truth of the statements in pruco letter.as such,there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether coventry had relied at all,let alone justifiably relied,on pruco alleged misrepresentations.
judgment on the district court order entered on september,and wilmington and jay each timely appealed.their appeals are consolidated before us.

on appeal,wilmington and jay offer different but often overlapping arguments for overturning the district court decision.wilmington first argues that the district court misinterpreted rhode island law and improperly relied on law regarding the standard for mutual rescission.it then argues that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether pruco made material misrepresentations in its rescission letter,which should have precluded summary judgment jay likewise argues that there are genuine issues of material fact for trial,but he frames his argument as addressing pruco allegedly bad faith conduct,which jay contends should equitably bar pruco from obtaining a rescission.we take each argument in turn.
rhode island mutual rescission law 
rescission is an abrogation or undoing of a contract from the beginning.it seeks to create a situation the same as if no contract ever had existed.dooley stillson.in klanian,the rhode island supreme court stated that m utual rescission rests upon intention it depends both upon the acts of the parties and the intention with which those acts are done.at.while the question of intention to rescind is ordinarily a question for the jury,it may become a question for the court where the facts are admitted or clearly established.id.here,the facts surrounding the cashing of the premium refund check were undisputed,with the only difference among the parties being the appropriate inferences to draw from those facts.
as in klanian,the insurance company here sent a letter to the policyholder clearly stating its intent to rescind the policy and including a check tendering the premiums paid,with interest.see id.at.as in klanian,the recipient here cashed the check.see id.at.the klanian court stated that these facts raised a reasonable inference of mutual rescission.id.at.the difference between klanian and this case is that,in the former,the policyholder was illiterate and did not understand the contents of the letter or the notation on the tendered check.id.at.when he learned what the letter said,he immediately dictated a response letter to the insurer stating that he had not intended to agree to rescission and offering to return the refunded premiums.id.days later,his counsel sent the insurer a check in the amount of the premiums.id.under these circumstances,the court determined that there was a jury question as to the policyholder intent to rescind.id.at.
wilmington argues that klanian stands for the proposition that,if a party has an unexpressed,subjective intent not to rescind,then that intent can defeat a claim of mutual rescission.this is not an accurate reading.indeed,the klanian court stated that,were it not for klanian prompt letter and attempt to return the refund,there would have been merit in the insurer contention that there was nothing to go to the jury and that the insurer was entitled to a direction of a verdict as a matter of law.see also reccko criss cadillac,finding jury issue on intent to rescind where plaintiff had sent letter to defendant stating that she was making an offer in mitigation of damages that should not be interpreted as a rescission.the klanian court also specifically distinguished klanian situation from those in other cases holding that a mutual rescission had occurred based on the tender and cashing of a refund check,on the grounds that the other cases had involved policyholders who waited a significant amount of time before cashing the check and thereafter offered no evidence to overcome the inference of an intent to rescind.see at citing kincaid life ins,cir warren life ins,peterson life ins.klanian never suggests that a party unexpressed intentions,evidenced by nothing more than that party bare,post hoc assertions,can overcome the inference of mutual rescission.newport plaza assocs.durfee attleboro bank in re newport plaza assocs,cir noting that,under rhode island law,c ontracts ordinarily
