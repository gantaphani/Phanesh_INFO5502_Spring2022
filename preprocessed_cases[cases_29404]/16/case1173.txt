opinion of the court 
we are asked to determine if the district court erred in ruling that ctf holdings,was not obligated to arbitrate its breach of contract dispute with marriott international and renaissance hotels together marriott.we are also asked to determine if the court erred in staying that litigation pending resolution of related arbitration between marriott and hotel property investments hpi.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the court ruling that ctf was not required to go to arbitration,but we will reverse the district court decision to stay ctf suit against marriott for breach of contract pending resolution of marriott arbitration with hpi.
facts and procedural history 
in,renaissance signed an agreement with ctf to manage the ctf hotels at issue here the ctf master agreement in,renaissance signed an agreement with hpi to manage other hotels the hpi master agreement.marriott international purchased renaissance in and continued to operate it as a subsidiary.in,marriott,hpi and ctf entered into an agreement governing all of the aforementioned hotels and incorporating the ctf and hpi master agreements the agreement 
section of the agreement addresses dispute resolution and states 
governing law dispute resolution in the event of any dispute or difference arising out of or relating to this agreement,if such dispute or difference relates to or arises out of a hotel owned or leased by ctf or otherwise governed by the ctf master agreement,then such dispute or difference shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions in the ctf master agreement and if such dispute or difference relates to or arises out of a hotel owned or leased by hpi or otherwise governed by the hpi master agreement,then such dispute or difference shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions in the hpi master agreement nothing herein is intended to require arbitration of any dispute under the ctf master agreement or to limit any right any party may have to proceed in federal or state court on any dispute under the ctf master agreement 
the ctf master agreement is silent as to the duty to arbitrate and therefore imposes no such obligation.however,the hpi master agreement contains the following section requiring arbitration 
governing law arbitration consent to jurisdiction.the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to settle any disputes or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement if they do not reach a solution within a period of thirty days,then the dispute or difference shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association.
in and,ctf and hpi began questioning marriott performance under the agreement,and in march,ctf notified marriott that it was in default under that agreement marriott thereafter initiated arbitration against ctf and hpi seeking declaratory relief regarding the issues that had been identified in the default notice.one such issue involved proceeds from an audiovisual program conducted in certain hotels operated by marriott the molloy dispute.another issue involved the scope of ctf and hpi rights to review and audit the amount of unrestricted allowances marriott received under its management agreements the audit dispute.
hpi did not dispute that it was obligated to arbitrate the molloy and audit disputes with marriott under the agreement.however,ctf maintained that it was not obligated to arbitrate.it filed a complaint against marriott and a third defendant,avendra llc in the district court.the complaint included issues involving the molloy and audit disputes as well as other claims for relief ctf also petitioned the district court to enjoin marriott attempt to require it to arbitrate its disputes,and marriott moved to compel ctf to arbitrate pursuant to the federal arbitration act.
as noted earlier,the district court granted ctf motion to enjoin arbitration of its claims and denied marriott motion to compel ctf to arbitrate.however,the court then stayed litigation of ctf breach of contract suit pending the resolution of marriott arbitration with hpi.the court explained that it was doing so in order to promote some efficiencies of judicial administration and in light of the participation in this litigation of defendant avendra a to the master and agreements.
thereafter,marriott appealed the court refusal to compel ctf to arbitrate,and ctf the court order staying ctf breach of contract suit pending resolution of the arbitration between marriott and hpi 
ii.jurisdiction 
we may review the denial of marriott motion to compel arbitration under a b,which provides for jurisdiction over appeals from orders denying a petition under to order arbitration to proceed.
marriott questions whether we have jurisdiction over ctf of the district court stay,and has moved to dismiss ctf appeal for lack of jurisdiction.marriott argues that the stay is not a final order and is therefore not appealable.we agree that a stay is usually not a final order because it provides only a temporary respite from litigation.marcus twp.of abington,cir.however,when a stay amounts to an effective dismissal of the underlying suit,it may be subjected to appellate review.cheyney state coll.faculty hufstedler,cir citing moses cone hosp.mercury constr,d see also united states spears,cir holding that appellate review was effectively foreclosed unless we exercised pendent jurisdiction because the issues would become moot and untouchable because of the procedural limbo in which the decision placed the case.we have also recognized that an indefinite stay order that unreasonably delays a plaintiff right to have its case heard is appealable.hufstedler,at see also haberern lehigh new england,cir holding that a stay order of indefinite length which singles out a claim for extended delay,while others of a similar nature proceed,is appealable.
here,the district court decided two important legal issues.first,it found the agreement did not require ctf to arbitrate the molloy and audit disputes in ctf complaint.second,it delayed ctf litigation so that it would not proceed until after the arbitration between hpi and marriott was resolved.in a very practical sense,admittedly has the right to bring suit in the federal been blocked from proceeding in that forum until the issues are resolved in the arbitration.
the stay order at issue here is not indefinite per se because the district court stated that it would reconsider the stay if it appears that the arbitration is not proceeding apace.there is,however,no way of foretelling how long ctf suit must remain in limbo.moreover,we see no way for ctf to attempt to expedite hpi arbitration with marriott because ctf is not a party to it.
if ctf suit must suffer indeterminate delay pending the outcome of hpi arbitration with marriott,ctf will be without any way of challenging the propriety of the district court stay or the procedural limbo that inevitably results from it.ctf will certainly not be able to challenge the order at the conclusion of that arbitration because the stay will become moot and unreviewable.time only runs in one direction.accordingly,we can not correct any error the district court may have made in staying ctf suit unless we review it now.
we have recognized the concept of pendent appellate jurisdiction where a case is rife with special circumstances which bring it outside the general rule and so limit its precedential value as to not measurably weaken our continued aversion to piecemeal appeals.haberern,at.however,in swint chambers cty.comm,d,the supreme court counsel ed resistance to expansion of appellate jurisdiction.in doing so,however,the court noted that it had not universally required courts of appeals to confine review to the precise decision independently subject to appeal.id.at.citing thornburgh american college of obstetricians and gynecologists,d.swint did not resolve whether or when it may be proper for a court of appeals,with jurisdiction over one ruling,to review,conjunctively,related rulings that are not themselves independently appealable.at.

since the district court stay order would be unreviewable and moot at the conclusion of hpi arbitration with marriott,the umbilical connection between it and the district court stay is not neatly severed.as will be evident from our discussion below,there is sufficient overlap in the facts relevant to both the appealable and issues to warrant plenary review.palcko airborne express,cir emphasis in original quoting dupont de nemours,at.the case is therefore rife with special circumstances allowing for appellate review without running afoul of this court continued aversion to piecemeal appeals,haberern,at,or the supreme court holding in swint.in addition,at this point of the proceedings,we are unable to determine what preclusive effect,if any,the arbitration may have on ctf suit in the district court.accordingly,we hold that we may properly exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court order staying that suit while hpi proceeds with its arbitration against marriott.
iii.discussion 
marriott appeal 
marriott appeals the district court conclusion that the agreements allow ctf to litigate its claims and do not require arbitration.marriott argues that the disputes at issue involved interpretation of provisions of the agreement,and that ctf must arbitrate any disputes relating both to ctf and hpi hotels under the dispute resolution provision in that agreement.
arbitration is strictly a matter of contract.if a party has not agreed to arbitrate,the courts have no authority to mandate that it do so.chemrite,cir.principles of contract law therefore govern our inquiry.when interpreting contracts,we are required to read contract language in a way that allows all the language to be read together,reconciling conflicts in the language without rendering any of it nugatory if possible.new castle cty.national union fire ins,cir.
thus,section of the agreement controls our analysis.marriott argues that clause,which states that a dispute relating to a hotel owned or leased by hpi must be resolved under the hpi master agreement,governs the disputes at issue.according to marriott,the instant disputes relate to both hpi hotels and ctf hotels as is evident from the involving marriott,ctf,and hpi.therefore,argues marriott,its dispute with ctf has to be governed by clause and the hpi master agreement controls.as noted above,the hpi master agreement contains a dispute resolution clause requiring the parties thereto to arbitrate disputes that can not be settled by the good faith efforts of those parties.
however,ctf was not a party to that agreement.moreover,marriott interpretation ignores that clause of section is also relevant to the disputes at issue here because they relate to ctf hotels as well as hpi hotels and thus implicate the ctf master agreement.as noted above,the ctf master agreement does not require arbitration of disputes between ctf and marriott.as also noted above,we are obligated to interpret contracts in a manner that gives meaning to every word.if we read clauses such dispute relates to a hotel owned or leased by ctf and such dispute relates to a hotel owned or leased by hpi as mutually exclusive,the confusion disappears along with the conflict.under this interpretation,where a dispute relates to ctf,the ctf master agreement governs and there is no duty to arbitrate pursuant to clause but where a dispute relates to hpi,the hpi master agreement governs and there is a duty to arbitrate pursuant to clause.accordingly,under new castle county,we read clauses and as mutually exclusive in order to eliminate the conflict and give meaning to every word in the relevant clauses of the agreement.
moreover,the resulting interpretation is eminently reasonable.the agreement maintained the separate ctf and hpi master agreements with their corresponding dispute resolution provisions.as ctf observes,the lack of a unitary arbitration provision for disputes common to ctf and hpi in section is no accident brief at.clause makes this crystal clear.as noted above,clause provides that nothing herein is intended to require arbitration of any dispute under the ctf master agreement or to limit any right any party may have to proceed in federal or state court on any dispute under the ctf master agreement.marriott interpretation requires that we strike clause from the master agreement.of course,we can not do that.
if the parties really intended the result marriott urges upon us here,they could easily have provided for it by simply requiring that any dispute that similarly involves marriott operation of both ctf and hpi hotels be governed by the hpi master agreement or be subject to arbitration,notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ctf master agreement.no such language appears,and clause is precisely to the contrary.that clause clearly provides for certain disputes arising under the agreement to be excepted from arbitration.it therefore vitiates marriott argument that clause gives rise to a presumption that all disputes arising under the agreement must be arbitrated.such a presumption is applicable only in the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration at t,comm.workers of america,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.moreover,even if the disputes regarding ctf hotels are identical to those regarding hpi hotels,ctf claim pertains only to its hotels.such disputes are subject to the ctf master agreement,and ctf is therefore not required to arbitrate.
marriott argues that evidence outside the parties contracts establishes that ctf and hpi have an identity of interests that makes them functionally the same corporation,thus binding ctf to hpi contractual obligation to arbitrate disputes.marriott also argues that,even if ctf is not actually contractually obligated to arbitrate these disputes,ctf should be estopped from litigating its claim because the parties correspondence indicates that it relied on the hpi master agreement to assert its rights.both arguments require us to consider evidence extrinsic to the written contract.such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of a written contract when there is ambiguity in the contract.jur.evidence and witnesses the contracts here leave no ambiguity regarding the terms of the dispute resolution mechanisms.therefore,extrinsic evidence such as the parties correspondence can not properly be considered.this leaves these arguments without any foundation.
thus,the district court correctly held that ctf is not required to arbitrate its dispute with marriott,and it properly denied marriott motion to compel arbitration and enjoined the arbitration of ctf disputes.
as we noted earlier,ctf the district court stay of its claim against marriott and avendra.it argues that the district court abused its discretion by staying litigation pending resolution of the separate arbitration proceeding between marriott and hpi.ctf claims that the stay abrogated its right to resolve its disputes through litigation,a right that the district court acknowledged in denying marriott motion to compel arbitration.according to ctf,the district court took away with one hand the very thing it awarded with the other.we agree 
the district court identified two grounds for staying the litigation,avendra participation and judicial efficiency.neither justifies the stay.
judicial efficiency does not,by itself,allow
