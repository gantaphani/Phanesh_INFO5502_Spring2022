in this bankruptcy appeal,we must decide whether a creditor may allocate a payment made by a guarantor first to interest then to principal,thus preserving the unpaid principal for collection in bankruptcy.because we find that the allocation of a payment in this manner would permit the creditor to collect an amount otherwise disallowed as interest,we reverse the judgment of the district court which permitted collection of the additional amount.
national energy gas transmission energy trading power,et power,a debtor here,previously operated as an energy marketing and trading company.as such,it bought and sold electric power,natural gas,coal,and other physical energy commodities.et power also engaged in financial and hedging transactions such as future contracts,swaps,options,and derivatives.as part of its regular course of business,et power entered into an electricity tolling agreement the agreement with liberty electric power,llc liberty,an company.under the agreement,et power obtained an option to purchase energy from liberty in return for a monthly payment to liberty as well as certain other variable costs based on the actual amount of energy which et power purchased.in essence,this permitted et power to provide natural gas necessary to generate electricity and then to purchase the electricity which was generated.
to back up its agreement with et power,liberty obtained two guarantees one from national energy gas transmission,negt,et power corporate parent and also a debtor in this bankruptcy and one from gas transmission northwest corporation gtn,a subsidiary of negt and a.each guarantee contained the same terms,and in each the respective guarantor guaranteed 
a s primary obligor and not merely as surety,the prompt payment when due,in accordance with the terms of the agreement,of all amounts payable by et power under the agreement including termination payment and damage awards arising by reason of et power breach of its performance obligations under the agreement or otherwise.
each guarantor liability was capped at million.
on july,negt,et power,and other debtors filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code and a motion seeking to reject the agreement after et power and liberty consented,the bankruptcy court granted the motion rejecting the agreement.as a result of the rejection,liberty sought million as a termination payment and approximately million in unpaid invoices.liberty claim for million proceeded to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement,and an arbitration panel awarded liberty the full million plus interest accruing from the date of the agreement rejection and continuing subsequent to the arbitration award 
during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings,negt agreed to sell gtn to transcanada corporation.as part of the transaction,million was reserved in escrow to provide for any liability to liberty under the guarantee.after the arbitration award,the dispute between liberty and the debtors shifted back to the bankruptcy court,while interest continued to accrue on the million arbitration award.to stop the accrual of interest,which had reached approximately million,the parties agreed that liberty should receive immediate payment of the amount held in escrow after the gtn sale,and the bankruptcy court approved this disbursal.accordingly,liberty was paid million from the gtn sale escrow in full and final satisfaction of the gtn guarantee.
upon receipt of payment from gtn,liberty allocated the million first to interest,then to principal.meanwhile,liberty continued to assert claims in bankruptcy against negt and et power for million each liberty reasoned that it could continue to assert the full value of the award against the debtors,notwithstanding the fact that it had already received payment of million from gtn,because the debtors remained jointly and severally liable until it received full payment of the total debt.at the same time,liberty recognized that it could not collect more than the approximately million needed to make it whole on et power debt.in seeking this amount,liberty contended that the amount did not represent disallowed interest but rather unpaid interest portion of the award having been paid by gtn.
the debtors objected to liberty claims,arguing that the million which liberty sought to collect had to constitute interest because liberty had already received million from gtn.additionally,the debtors maintained that liberty should not be permitted to assert a claim for million when it had received million and currently was owed only an additional million.otherwise,the judgment would not accurately reflect what liberty was owed.
the bankruptcy court agreed with liberty position,allowing the claim for million against et power but providing that the maximum amount of distribution payable to liberty would be limited to the additional million which it seeks to collect.on appeal to the district court,the bankruptcy court order was affirmed.the debtors once again appeal.because this appeal presents only questions of law,our review is de novo.in re bunker,cir.
we initially consider the debtors contention that the value of liberty claim must be reduced by the million it received from gtn in order to reflect accurately the amount currently owed to liberty.because liberty is currently owed only approximately million,the debtors argue its claim should be limited to this amount.
the debtors argument is foreclosed by the combination of ivanhoe building loan ass of newark orr,and new york law,which governs pursuant to the agreement.in ivanhoe,the supreme court held that a creditor need not deduct from his claim in bankruptcy an amount received from a third party in partial satisfaction of an obligation.thus,as a matter of bankruptcy law,et power debt to liberty is not reduced by the amount which liberty received from gtn.however,this merely leads to the question of what the value of et power debt is,and new york law provides the answer to this question.see travelers cas.sur.of america pacific gas,d w e have long recognized that the basic federal rule in bankruptcy is that state law governs the substance of claims.internal punctuation omitted.
new york law provides 
the amount or value of any consideration received by the obligee from one or more of several obligors,or from one or more of joint,or of joint and several obligors,in whole or in partial satisfaction of their obligations,shall be credited to the extent of the amount received on the obligations of all to whom the obligor or obligors giving the consideration did not stand in the relation of a surety.
oblig.under this statute,whether gtn payment to liberty must be deducted from et power obligation turns on whether gtn was a surety or a.
in chemical bank meltzer,the new york court of appeals concluded that the relationship between the guarantor and the primary obligor must determine the guarantor status as a or a surety,notwithstanding language in the contract purporting to render the guarantor a.using this approach,the court found that a suretyship existed.the relationship between et power and gtn is nearly identical to that of the guarantor and primary obligor in meltzer.therefore,we conclude that,despite language in the guarantee purporting to make gtn a,gtn was a surety for et power obligations to liberty.accordingly,the value of et power debt to liberty under state law is not reduced by the million received from gtn.
we next turn to the more fundamental question presented by this appeal whether the bankruptcy code bars liberty from collecting the million it now seeks.section b of the code provides that a claim shall not be allowed to the extent that it is for unmatured interest.b.the purpose of this section is the avoidance of unfairness among competing creditors,and the avoidance of administrative inconvenience.bruning united states,d.as with all sections of the code,b exists to guide the court in the administration of a bankruptcy estate so as to bring about a ratable distribution of assets among the bankrupt creditors.vanston bondholders protective committee green.see also in re robins,cir noting that bankruptcy court
