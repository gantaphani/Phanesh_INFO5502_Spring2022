in,an arbitration panel awarded the defendant union local million against the plaintiff,the general contractor for a general motors plant renovation project,because the contractor violated the terms of a project labor agreement that general motors made with seventeen unions on the project,limiting dealings to contractors who pay their workers wages equal to union scale.in the ensuing litigation challenging and seeking confirmation of the award,the district court vacated the arbitration award because it found that it violated public policy by extending a collective bargaining agreement to workers who had not chosen the union as their bargaining representative,in violation of sections f and a of the national labor relations act.our review discloses no such policy violation we find that the effect of the arbitration award is to enforce the terms of the project labor agreement,which required contractors and subcontractors who participated in construction activities on the project to abide by union standards for all workers connected to the project,both on and off the job site.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
the dispute in this case arises from the enforcement of a provision of a local collective bargaining agreement between the defendant,sheet metal workers international association local,local,and the sheet metal roofing contractors association of the miami valley ohio local agreement against the plaintiff in this case,eisenmann corporation,who neither signed the local agreement nor was a member of the association.the provision obligated contractors who outsourced work on a project subject to the local agreement to deal only with fabricators who pay their employees engaged in such fabrication not less than the prevailing wage for comparable sheet metal fabrication,as established under the provisions of the local agreement.local agreement,art.ii.
in,general motors corporation embarked upon a project to revamp its paint facilities at its moraine,ohio assembly plant,which manufactures sport utility vehicles.before work on the project began,gm entered into a project labor agreement with seventeen local unions who were members of the dayton building construction trades counsel,including sheet metal workers local.in the project labor agreement,the unions promised to refrain from all job actions,such as strikes,and other work stoppages,and further to refuse to honor any picket lines on the job site.in return,gm agreed to contract with contractors and subcontractors who will employ individuals to perform construction work within the trade work under the jurisdiction of the union.project labor agreement,art.ii.gm also agreed that the terms and conditions and rates of pay of the applicable local and national recognized collective bargaining agreements shall apply where there is no conflict with this agreement,art local local agreement,including article ii,section,quoted above,was thus incorporated into the project labor agreement.finally,the signatories agreed to submit their disputes to binding arbitration.in the case of disputes involving the sheet metal workers,arbitration was to be conducted by a local joint adjustment board ljab composed of equal numbers of representatives of the union and the employers association.
eisenmann,which engineers and installs paint finishing systems,became the supervising contractor on the project on may.it received a purchase order from gm dated march,which incorporated a memorandum dated march.that memorandum,in turn,stated that t he local labor agreement was among the items that shall be considered part of the contract.at.max herholz,eisenmann president,acknowledged in an affidavit that eisenmann received a copy of the project labor agreement before commencing work on the project.
from the beginning of its operations at the moraine site,which started on june,eisenmann had few of its own employees working on the project,choosing instead to subcontract all the work done at the job site to unionized subcontractors.eisenmann own employees at the job site served in managerial and supervisory capacities.local members performed the sheet metal work.
however,a significant portion of the fabrication work was done eisenmann fabricated industrial oven modules and oven heater boxes at its crystal lake,illinois facility,and contracted with imf,a company,to fabricate pretreatment and rinse housing modules.all of these units were to be installed at the moraine job site.none of the workers involved in this work were union members.moreover,imf employees earn an hour on average,whereas the base wage for a local sheet metal worker is.
when local representatives learned of eisenmann outsourcing the sheet metal fabrication work,they complained to eisenmann,arguing that the project labor agreement required that the work be performed by unionized workers.eisenmann contends that around this time a local branch of the sheet metal workers union handed out recruitment literature at its crystal lake facility in an attempt to organize its workers.furthermore,eisenmann alleges that at no time prior to arbitration did local complaints include the issue of workers not being paid union scale wages.nonetheless,when eisenmann and local were unable to resolve their differences,the union filed a grievance on february,before the local joint adjustment board contending that eisenmann had failed to abide by article ii,section,of the local agreement,to ensure that all of the work was done by individuals receiving the prevailing wage.
eisenmann refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings,maintaining instead in a letter by its counsel dated july,that the board lacked jurisdiction over the matter as eisenmann was not a signatory to the various labor agreements which required arbitration.the hearing proceeded on july,after a delay from the scheduled date,with only local presenting evidence.on july,the ljab ruled in local favor,finding that 
eisenmann corporation violated article i and ii of the project agreement and article i,section and article ii,section of the local labor agreement.the disputed work performed and subcontracted by eisenmann was within the scope of work covered by the bargaining agreements and was work regularly,customarily and traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees and employers,and neither eisenmann nor its subcontractor,imf,paid the prevailing wage for the performance of such work.
at.the ljab assessed damages at million,presumably based on evidence of a purported conversation between herholz and union representatives in which herholz allegedly said that this was the amount of work involved in the project.herholz denied that he made the statement.
on august,eisenmann appealed the arbitration award to the national joint adjustment board.eisenmann made clear,however,that it was not waiving its claim that the arbitration panel lacked jurisdiction over the matter.on november,the njab affirmed.it held 
after careful consideration of the evidence presented,the panelists agreed that the eisenmann corporation was or should have been aware of the project agreement which referenced the local collective bargaining agreement.the panelists find a violation has occurred and find no reason to modify the ljab decision.we further find that all damages should be paid to local joint education training fund.
unsatisfied with this result,eisenmann commenced an action in the district court challenging the arbitration award,which,it contended,should be vacated because a the arbitration panel lacked jurisdiction over eisenmann,b enforcement of the award would be illegal under the national labor relations act and the sherman act,and against public policy,and c the award is not supported by the evidence presented at the hearing and does not draw its essence from the relevant agreements.compl.local counterclaimed seeking confirmation of the award.the parties for summary judgment were referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the award be vacated because of his belief that the arbitration award was rendered in manifest disregard of the law.the district court adopted the recommendation.the court reasoned that although the relationship between local and eisenmann constituted a valid prehire agreement under section f of the nlra,the arbitrators unlawfully extended the agreement well beyond its permissible limits by applying it to employees who performed solely work.at.as a consequence,the court concluded,the award violated an explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant,that is,that except in carefully circumscribed circumstances,union representation may not be imposed on a workforce absent majority support.the lower court vacated the arbitration award.this appeal followed.
by its very nature,a summary judgment does not involve the determination of disputed questions of fact,but is confined to purely legal issues.c summary judgment may be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law celotex catrett,d.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.lautermilch findlay city,cir int l union,uaw dana,cir.
the standard of review for the decisions of arbitrators,on the other hand,is highly deferential.see beacon journal publ g akron newspaper guild,local,cir the supreme court has made clear that courts must accord an arbitrator decision substantial deference because it is the arbitrator construction of the agreement,not the court construction,to which the parties have agreed.the supreme court has tightly circumscribed the authority of federal courts to overturn arbitration awards,and has consistently held that they may not do so a s long as the arbitrator award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,and is not merely his own brand of industrial justice.united paperworkers int l union misco,d internal quotations omitted.i f an arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,the fact that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.major league baseball players ass garvey,d internal quotations omitted.
we have identified four ways by which an arbitrator may stray from the essence of the collective bargaining agreement an arbitration award may be declared invalid and vacated if it conflicts with express terms of the agreement it imposes additional requirements not expressly provided for in the agreement it is not rationally supported by or derived from the agreement or it is based on general considerations of fairness and equity instead of the exact terms of the agreement.int l union,at quoting midmichigan reg l med.prof l employees div.of local,cir.in addition,courts may upset an arbitration award if it is rendered in manifest disregard of the law,see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,jaros,cir,or if it is contrary to a and dominant public policy,see eastern associated coal united mine workers of,dist,d.finally,certain gateway procedural disputes,such as questions of arbitrability,including whether parties have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration,are reserved for the courts to decide.see howsam dean witter reynolds,d.
on appeal,eisenmann argues that the arbitration award was properly vacated for three reasons.first,it contends,as the lower court held,that the award was made in violation of explicit labor policy because it extended a section f prehire agreement to workers,contrary to the dominant policy of reserving the privilege of union representation to those bargaining entities who have garnered majority support.second,eisenmann argues that it was not bound by the arbitration provisions incorporated into the project labor agreement,particularly with respect to disputes relating to work,because it never manifested an intent to be bound be the agreement.third,eisenmann claims that the arbitration decision,particularly the calculation of damages,did not draw its essence from the contract.
the national labor relations act confirms the right of workers to organize and join labor organizations,to bargain collectively through chosen representatives,and to refrain from any or all such activities.a workforce decision to organize,and its choice of a representative,are governed by majority rule.see nlra a,representatives designated or selected for the purpose of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes,shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining.nlrb,d holding that majority rule concept is at the center of federal labor policy.majority status is established by an election conducted under the supervision of the national labor relations board,nlra c,c,or by other means set forth in the act.see nlrb canton sign,cir.generally,employers who recognize a labor organization that does not have the majority support of workers,and labor unions that purport to represent workers absent such majority support,commit an unfair labor practice.see nlra a,b,a,b int l ladies garment workers union nlrb,d quoting nlrb.greyhound lines.the law has long been settled that a grant of exclusive recognition to a minority union constitutes unlawful support in violation of that section,because the union so favored is given a marked advantage over any other in securing the adherence of employees.
because of the lengthy procedure required to call,hold,and certify representation elections,the process ordained by section has been found to be impractical in industries where there is a high labor turnover.congress specifically has recognized that mandating representation elections in the construction industry would effectively preclude union representation of those workers.see,sess,cong.admin.news,at representation elections in a large segment of the construction industry are not feasible to demonstrate such majority status due to the short periods of actual employment by specific employers.thus,in an exception was created to permit employers in the construction industry to bargain with labor unions prior to the establishment of majority status through elections.section f of the nrla provides 
f agreement covering employees in the building and construction industry.
it shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections a and b of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged or who,upon their employment,will be engaged in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members not established,maintained,or assisted by any action defined in subsection a of this section as an unfair labor practice because the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section of this title prior to the making of such agreement,or such agreement requires as a condition of employment,membership in such labor organization after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement,whichever is later,or such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer,or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment,or such agreement specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer,in the industry or in the particular geographical area provided,that nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to subsection a of this section provided further,that any agreement which would be invalid,but for clause of this subsection,shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section c or e of this title.
f some emphasis added.
agreements made pursuant to section f are commonly known as prehire agreements.see constr.trades council associated builders contractors of,d.thus,we have held that in the construction industry,there can be two types of bargaining relationships under the national labor relations act between labor unions and employers a section f relationship w
