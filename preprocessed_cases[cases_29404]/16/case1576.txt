duke energy international dei appeals the district court judgment confirming an arbitration award and denying dei request for a stay of enforcement.the district court entered a judgment ordering dei to pay wartsila finland oy and wartsila guatemala,sa,collectively wartsila plus pre and interest.the district court enforced the arbitrator award despite the presence of separate,pending arbitration claims brought by dei against wartsila.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,wartsila contracted with dei to construct a power plant near puerto quetzal,guatemala.the contract provided for wartsila to complete construction of the power plant in four phases.pertinent to this case,the agreement gave dei certain rights to withhold payment on invoices.specifically,sections and of the contract provide that 
any amount of an invoice which is disputed by dei as provided in this section shall be resolved in accordance with section.once the dispute is resolved in accordance with section,dei shall pay any amount owing within five business days after the date of the final resolution.
dei may withhold payment on an invoice or a portion thereof in an amount and to such an extent as may be reasonably necessary,subject to the dispute resolution provisions of section,to protect dei from loss because of work that has not been remedied.
the agreement also gave dei certain rights to setoff amounts owed to dei against amounts dei owed wartsila.specifically,section states 
notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement,and in addition to its other rights and remedies,dei shall be entitled to setoff against any amount it owes wartsila,or that will become owed to wartsila,under this agreement,any amount that wartsila owes dei under this agreement.
in section,the contract included an arbitration provision which provided that if disputes could not be resolved by senior officers of each party,then the disputes were to be submitted to arbitration held pursuant to international chamber of commerce icc rules.section states that any decision rendered by the arbitrators in any arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties,and judgment may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
in april,prior to completion of phase four of the power plant,wartsila sought payment for disputed invoices and filed a demand for arbitration with the icc to resolve disputes that had arisen with respect to the first three phases.the arbitral tribunal conducted a hearing as to these claims in september.in january,the tribunal instructed wartsila and dei to raise any further claims and counterclaims to be resolved in the arbitration proceeding.both parties served memoranda containing their remaining claims for relief related to phase four.in february,dei requested more time from the tribunal,stating that it needed the time to comprehensively address all of its counterclaims.the tribunal refused the request,but stated that it would allow dei to withdraw any claims that it felt should be reserved for a later proceeding.a second hearing was held in june to consider all claims and counterclaims that had not been withdrawn.the tribunal then issued a partial award,reserving its decision on all undecided claims for further partial awards or a final award.because some construction on the project was still ongoing,the parties asked the tribunal to consider a third set of hearings.the tribunal noted that a third set of hearings may be necessary but did not set a date for those hearings.
in september,the tribunal chairman informed the parties that he had been appointed as a high court judge in england and that he would therefore be unable to continue as an arbitrator.wartsila and dei disputed whether the tribunal should be reconstituted to consider further claims.the tribunal determined that it would not reconstitute itself for another round of hearings,but instead would issue a final award as to the claims then before it.the tribunal allowed dei to withdraw certain of its claims according to article of the icc rules so that dei might present the claims in a later arbitration proceeding 
in april,the tribunal issued a final award which dealt with all remaining claims and counterclaims,including the remaining claims in phase iii and those arising in phase iv.after correcting computational errors in its award,the tribunal ordered dei to pay wartsila and wartsila to pay dei.
wartsila sought payment in accordance with the final award.dei refused to pay,claiming that it was entitled to withhold payment to protect itself from loss due to defective or unfinished work.dei also contended that it could set off the amounts it sought in its withdrawn claims against the amount ordered to be paid in the tribunal final award.in october,dei made a request to the icc for arbitration in order to bring the claims withdrawn from the previous arbitration.three days after dei made this request,wartsila filed a motion in federal court to have the tribunal award confirmed and enforced under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards hereinafter new york convention,see providing courts with jurisdiction to confirm and enforce arbitration awards arising under the new york convention dei filed a for confirmation as well as a stay of the proceedings pending completion of its newly filed arbitration claims.because neither party objected to confirmation,the district court confirmed the award.the district court then rejected dei arguments for a stay and enforced the award by reducing it to judgment required dei to pay wartsila.
dei appeals,contending that the district court erred in refusing to stay the entry of judgment.dei presents two arguments in support of a stay.first dei argues that the award itself,when properly interpreted,required the district court to stay enforcement of the award.second,dei argues in the alternative that,even if the award contemplates immediate enforcement,the district court should have exercised its discretion to stay enforcement of the award.
this court reviews a district court confirmation of an arbitration award de novo,using the same standards as the district court.american laser vision,laser vision,cir.as to dei claim seeking a stay of enforcement in spite of the arbitration award,we review the district court decision denying a stay for an abuse of discretion.see sutter p p industries,cir recognizing that a district court decision whether to stay confirmation of an arbitration award is ordinarily reviewed for an abuse of discretion.because the only potential sources of authority for the district court to grant a stay under these circumstances are discretionary,an abuse of discretion standard is appropriate.see new york convention,at article vi stating that in certain circumstances a court may,if it considers it appropriate,adjourn the decision on enforcement of the award,berg,cir noting that a court may,incidental to its inherent power to control disposition of the cases on its docket,exercise its discretion to stay enforcement proceedings under the new york convention.
we examine two distinct questions in this appeal first whether the district court order and judgment are consistent with the arbitration award and second,even if the tribunal award allows for immediate enforcement,whether the district court abused its discretion in not staying enforcement of the award.
dei does not challenge the confirmation of the award,nor seek to set aside the award instead,dei contends that the award should be confirmed as written.dei claims that the district court,in issuing a judgment requiring dei to pay the award amount,misinterpreted the arbitration award.dei argues that the award did not allow the district court to issue a judgment requiring payment while dei still had claims outstanding in a separate arbitration arising out of the contract.
a district court should enforce an arbitration award as do anything more or less would usurp the tribunal power to finally resolve disputes and undermine the policies of the new york convention.see scherk,d explaining purposes of new york convention brown witco,cir notin
