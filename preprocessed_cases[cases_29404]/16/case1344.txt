this case raises two issues of importance to healthcare providers who receive reimbursement from medicaid.the first is whether healthcare providers serving medicaid recipients have a right to sue state officials,under,to enforce rights created under the medicaid reimbursement program at bb.the second is whether the appropriate venue for such an action can be limited by contract.
pee dee health care,pee dee is a healthcare provider qualified under the medicaid program to serve individuals in rural areas of south carolina.as a medicaid service provider,pee dee is entitled to reimbursement payments from the state.the benefits improvement and protection act of bipa provides the methodology for computing those payments.to receive reimbursement payments,however,healthcare providers must first enter into a contract with the south carolina department of health and human services scdhhs,the state agency responsible for the administration of the medicaid program in south carolina.each contract contains a clause which dictates that all reimbursement claims must be pursued through state administrative and judicial avenues.
pee dee claims that the scdhhs payment methodologies do not comply with various provisions of bipa.pee dee brought this action,pursuant to,in the united states district court for the district of south carolina against the governor of south carolina,the director of scdhhs and scdhhs itself,to enforce the reimbursement provisions of bipa.the district court dismissed the bipa claim,finding venue inappropriate based on the clause in the provider contract between pee dee and scdhhs.we affirm,holding that even though a healthcare provider has a private right of action under to enforce bb,pee dee agreed,in the clause,to bring such an action in a state tribunal and is bound by that agreement.
a.the medicaid scheme 
medicaid is a cooperative program designed to partially compensate states for the costs of providing healthcare to needy individuals.states are not required to participate in the program,but if they choose to do so,they must implement and operate medicaid programs that comply with detailed federally mandated standards.antrican odom,cir.to qualify for federal assistance,a state must submit a comprehensive plan to the federal secretary of health and human services describing the nature and scope of the state medicaid program.each state plan must include,among its details,a scheme for reimbursing rural health clinics rhcs for services provided to medicaid patients bb.
the medicaid act,as amended by bipa,a,stat,codified as amended in scattered sections of,regulates the way in which rhcs receive reimbursement payments for the services they provide to medicaid patients.in general,bipa allows for two methods of reimbursement.the first method is a prospective payment system based on costs plus a factor bb.the second method,set forth in bb,authorizes an alternative payment methodology that can take a number of forms,provided that the state and the clinic agree upon the system and it results in payment of an amount which is at least equal to the amount authorized under the prospective payment system.
scdhhs is the state agency in south carolina responsible for administration of the medicaid program.healthcare providers in south carolina are not required to accept medicaid patients.however,if a healthcare provider elects to treat medicaid patients and to seek reimbursement from scdhhs for its services,it does so by entering into a contract provider contract or contract with scdhhs.
the contract provides for the method and amounts of payment,as well as for certain remedies if a healthcare provider believes it has not been reimbursed as required by law for example,the contract provides 
reimbursement 
the rural health clinic rhc medicaid rate for services rendered under this contract shall be determined based upon applicable laws,rules or regulations and scdhhs policies and procedures in accordance with attachment of the state plan for medical assistance.
should any dispute arise under the terms of the contract,a healthcare provider agrees,as part of its decision to accept medicaid reimbursement payments,that its sole and exclusive remedy regarding such disputes would be to first file a notice of appeal of scdhhs action to the scdhhs appeals division.upon exhaustion of all administrative remedies,judicial review of final agency decisions is available in the state court system.ann.such appeals are governed by article viii of the contract,which provides 
if any dispute shall arise under the terms of this contract,the sole and exclusive remedy shall be the filing of a notice of appeal within thirty days of the receipt of written notice of scdhhs action or decision which forms the basis of the appeal.administrative appeals shall be in accordance with scdhhs regulations et.judicial review of any final scdhhs administrative decision shall be in accordance with,code of laws of south carolina,as amended.
emphasis added.
such subsequent judicial review must proceed in the venue and location identified in sections r and s of article ix of the contract 
venue of actions.
any and all suits or actions for the enforcement of the obligations of this contract and for any and every breach thereof,or for the review of a scdhhs final agency decision with respect to this contract or audit disallowances,and any judicial review sought thereon and brought pursuant to the ann,as amended shall be instituted and maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county of richland,state of south carolina.
place of suit 
any action at law,suit in equity,or judicial proceeding for the enforcement of this contract or any provision thereof shall be instituted only in the courts of the state of south carolina.
pee dee,through three rhcs,provides healthcare services to individuals in rural areas of south carolina.its services are subject to reimbursement from medicaid funds.pee dee has entered into two consecutive contracts with scdhhs since the enactment of bipa.each contract contains a r and s requiring that any claims that arise under the terms of the contract be pursued first through an administrative appeals process and then in state court 
pee dee originally filed this action in south carolina state court against south carolina governor mark sanford,director of scdhhs robert kerr,and scdhhs itself collectively appellees appellees answered and removed this case to federal district court.pee dee filed an amended complaint asserting a federal cause of action against appellees under,seeking to enforce the reimbursement provisions of bipa,bb.specifically,the new claim alleges that the reimbursement formula used by scdhhs violates pee dee statutorily conferred right to proper reimbursement as provided under bb pee dee claims that if scdhhs had computed payments in accordance with federal requirements,pee dee would have been compensated at higher rates than those at which it was actually paid beginning in january 
appellees moved to dismiss pee dee new claim under bipa alleging that pee dee agreed,as part of its contract for medicaid reimbursement,to pursue all claims arising under the contract through state administrative and judicial avenues.thus,appellees asserted that the voluntary clause rendered venue in federal district court improper.
following arguments on the motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the reimbursement claim based on the clause.pee dee now appeals the dismissal of that claim arguing the district court erred in holding that the exclusive remedy available to pee dee is provided in the provider contract between pee dee and scdhhs,and the claim against appellees can only be brought in a state tribunal due to the clause.
we review de novo the district court dismissal based on a clause.sucampo,astellas pharma,cir a motion to dismiss based on a clause should be properly treated under rule b as a motion to dismiss on the basis of improper venue.in doing so,we first address the issue of whether healthcare providers have a private right of action under to enforce bb.
section imposes liability on anyone who,acting under color of state law,deprives a person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.a plaintiff alleging a violation of a federal statute may sue under unless the statute does not create enforceable rights,privileges,or immunities within the meaning of,or congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.wright city of roanoke redev.hous,d.
a statute creates an enforceable right if congress intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff the right ostensibly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and the statute unambiguously imposes a binding obligation on the states.blessing freestone,d internal quotations omitted.in analyzing these requirements,a court must be careful to ensure that the statute at issue contains language and that the language is phrased in terms of the persons benefited,not in terms of a general policy or practice.gonzaga doe,d 
prior to the enactment of bipa,this court considered the rights of healthcare providers to enforce reimbursement provisions of the medicaid act.see.hosp.ass baliles,cir,aff sub nom.wilder.hosp.ass n,d.in baliles,this court held that healthcare providers had a right actionable under to challenge the method by which a state reimburses them for the cost of treating medicaid patients at.this court concluded that the language and legislative history of the relevant provision impl ied a congressional intent to allow providers a right of action against state failure to comply with federal medicaid requirements.id.at.the supreme court,affirming the decision,reasoned that the provision established a system for reimbursement of healthcare providers and was phrased in terms benefiting those providers.wilder,d.
more recently,this court found that another provision of the medicaid act,dealing with the medicaid waiver program created by c,conferred a private right of action enforceable under.doe kidd,cir.this court has also allowed a healthcare provider to pursue a action to enforce bb of the medicaid act.three lower counties cmty.health servs.maryland,cir clarifying a state obligations under bb when paying fqhcs for services they render to medicaid patients 
pee dee relies heavily on a first circuit decision in support of its assertion that a right of action exists under to enforce bb.see rio grande cmty.health,rullan,cir.the rio grande court held that t here is an implied action under section to enforce the special provisions of the medicaid law dealing with fqhc reimbursement,bb,as these provisions vest the fqhcs with a federal right to proper reimbursement.at.however,as appellees point out,the focus of the rights analysis in rio grande is on the language found in bb,not on bb as a whole.appellees argue that bb,the wraparound provision that was the subject of both three lower counties and rio grande,is the only part of bb that specifically authorizes payment to a provider,as opposed to describing a general payment methodology.with respect to bb through and,appellees argue that no language is present.subsection bb is the one subsection that is not cited by pee dee in support of its claims.
it is an issue of first impression in the federal courts whether bb,read as a whole,contains language phrased in terms of the persons benefited such that it creates a right of action under.considering the language of bb and the case law interpreting medicaid provisions of similar import in light of the blessing factors,it is scarcely a stretch to conclude that it does.
subsection bb states that a s tate plan shall provide for payment for services furnished by a health center and services furnished by a rural health clinic in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.emphasis added.subsections bb bb repeat the phrase the state plan shall provide for payment for such services.emphasis added.subsection bb b,which provides the option for an alternative payment methodology,states that such methodology must result in payment to the center or clinic of an amount which is at least equal to the amount otherwise required to be paid to the center or clinic under this section.emphasis added.
applying the blessing test to bb as a whole,we conclude that bb gives rise to a right enforceable under.first,congress intended the statute to benefit rhcs such as pee dee the state plan shall provide for payment for services furnished by a rural health clinic.bb emphasis added.second,the use of shall provide for payment is not unduly vague or amorphous such that the judiciary can not enforce it the provision is clear that states must reimburse rhcs for services provided to medicaid patients.third,the language unambiguously binds the states as indicated by the repeated use of shall.
we further find,as required by gonzaga,that bb contains language because it specifically designates the it mandates action on the part of the states.moreover,bb has an individual focus rather than an aggregate focus on institutional policy or practice.indeed,this statutory focus stands in stark contrast to the policy or practice language present in the provision interpreted in gonzaga at.thus,we conclude that bb creates an enforceable right under.
notwithstanding our finding that a right of action exists under to enforce bb,there is nothing in federal law prohibiting a healthcare provider from waiving the right to pursue such a claim in a federal forum.on the contrary,procedural rights under,like other federal constitutional and statutory rights,are subject to voluntary waiver.town of newton rumery,d.
in town of newton,the supreme court upheld a contract clause that completely eliminated the plaintiff right to sue under.see id.at.see also lake james cmty.volunteer fire,burke county,cir upholding a similar contractual waiver the town of newton dropped criminal charges against the federal plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff waiver of his right to file a civil rights action,including an action under.the court enforced the agreement because the plaintiff voluntarily entered into it.the court noted that the controlling principle for determining whether a waiver clause is unenforceable is if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement.town of newton,at.however,where a party voluntarily waive s his right to sue under,the public interest opposing involuntary waiver of constitutional rights is no reason to hold an agreement invalid.id.at.
this court has applied a voluntariness standard to determine the enforceability of agreements in which a party releases possible claims.see,bushnell rossetti,cir allowing the release of a right to bring a action if the decision to release was voluntary,deliberate,and informed internal quotations omitted united states lemaster,cir a criminal defendant may voluntarily waive constitutional procedural rights as well as statutory procedural rights through a plea agreement.where a party knowingly and willingly enters into an agreement that waives a constitutional right,the agreement is enforceable so long as it does not undermine the public interest in protecting the right see lake james,at.the lake james court held this to be the case where the contract itself provided the basis for the right and the waiver was narrowly tailored.see id.at.
healthcare providers in south carolina are not required to accept medicaid patients.therefore,any decision on the part of a healthcare provider such as pee dee to enter into a contract for medicaid reimbursement is voluntary.moreover,pee dee has entered into a series of contracts with scdhhs,renewing its commitment to the terms therein.because pee dee voluntarily waived its right to bring an action alleging improper reimbursement in federal court,the public interest opposing involuntary waiver of constitutional rights is no reason to hold this agreement invalid.see town of newton,at.
furthermore,the contract between pee dee and scdhhs does not completely deprive pee dee of a remedy,as was the case in town of newton and lake james.pee dee did not contract away its right to bring an action under,but inste
