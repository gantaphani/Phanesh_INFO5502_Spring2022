horving ramos was a driver with the united parcel service ups when he failed to deliver packages over the span of two business days in.for this incident,ups terminated his employment and ramos,through his union representative,filed a grievance challenging the termination.pursuant to the controlling agreement cba,ramos grievance was submitted to arbitration.the arbitrator found that under article,of the cba,ups was justified in terminating him.ramos now seeks judicial review.applying the high degree of deference generally accorded arbitral decisions,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment enforcing the arbitration award.
background 
as this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the,ramos,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.franceschi dep t of veterans affairs,cir.petitioner ramos had been a ups employee for the past twelve years,most recently as a driver.he is a member of the international brotherhood of teamsters union,which,along with ups,is party to a cba the cba outlines the procedure to be followed in carrying out disciplinary actions against union members.on friday,january,and monday,january,ramos failed to deliver packages to centro médico,a medical institution in río piedras,puerto rico as a result,ups terminated ramos employment pursuant to article,of the cba the union then filed a grievance challenging ramos discharge,arguing that ups had failed to follow the disciplinary procedure mandated by the cba,which requires the application of progressive discipline before a final dismissal.the grievance was submitted to arbitration.
the arbitrator assigned to adjudicate ramos grievance held hearings at the puerto rico department of labor on september,and august.at these hearings,ramos stated that he had engaged in an error of judgment when he made the decision not to deliver the packages to centro médico.after reviewing the evidence,the arbitrator held in favor of ups,finding that the failure to deliver the packages was not about mere negligence nor failure of procedures,but was instead a deliberate action.as such,ramos had violated article,of the cba and ups had properly terminated his employment.
thereafter,ramos filed a complaint in puerto rico state court challenging the arbitrator decision.ups promptly removed the case to the district court for the district of puerto rico based on jurisdiction granted by of the labor management relations act.a.on august,ups filed a motion for summary judgment,which ramos opposed.the district court granted the motion on october,finding that the arbitral award was a plausible interpretation of the cba.subsequently,the district court granted ups request for costs on november.ramos now appeals the district court decision,as well as its award of costs.

when parties include an arbitration clause in their agreement,they are choosing to forego a number of legal options in favor of having their disputes regarding the construction of that contract settled by an arbitrator.as this was the bargain the parties struck,they are bound by the arbitrator decision.see keebler truck drivers,local,cir.in the spirit of freedom of contract then,we can not review the merits of the underlying dispute and are obligated to enforce the arbitral award unless the decision fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.see united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d accord kraft foods,office employees int l union,local,cir.though we may be convinced that the arbitrator committed a serious error,if she is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,we may not overturn the arbitrator decision.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.
review of the arbitration award 
this court has recognized a very limited exception under which we may vacate an arbitration award when there is evidence that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law.wonderland greyhound park,autotote,cir.to establish such an exception,the challenger must show that the arbitration award complained of is unfounded in reason and fact based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge,or group of judges,could ever conceivably have made such a ruling or mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is concededly a.mccarthy citigroup global,cir.to succeed,there must be some showing in the record,other than the result obtained,that the arbitrator knew the law and expressly disregarded it.advest,mccarthy,cir quoting,prof l planning,cir 
ramos argues that this is the type of extraordinary case that warrants our vacating the arbitral decision because the arbitrator who issued it acted in manifest disregard of the law by knowingly applying the wrong provision of the cba.ramos argument is unavailing.ups terminated ramos employment under article,of the cba,which by its text allows for the summary discharge or suspension of an employee who declares an unauthorized strike,work stoppage,slowdown,walkout or other action that paralyzes,obstructs or interrupts the operations of the company.the arbitrator properly found that ramos dismissal was justified under this provision.
ramos argues that his actions can not be characterized as a strike,work stoppage,slowdown or walkout for the sole reason that he did not engage in any concerted activity with other employees.while ramos is correct that the existence of a strike requires concerted action,see,this court has stated that concerted action may be carried out by a single employee under certain circumstances.five star transp.nlrb,cir holding that the critical inquiry in determining whether action by a single employee constitutes concerted activity is whether such action is in furtherance of a group concern.more to the point,the very text of article,contemplates actions carried out by any employee or delegate,and does not institute a group action requirement.thus,though concerted action does not by itself constitute a strike,the fact that ramos acted alone does not render the application of article,improper.
furthermore,the fact that ramos delivered packages other than those scheduled for delivery at centro médico on the friday and monday in question does not make his discharge under article,unwarranted.ramos decision to not deliver the packages on the assigned days clearly obstructed interrupted ups operations in contravention of article.as developed in arbitration,ups regular mode of operation is that packages be delivered to the recipient on the day they are sent out from the ups processing center for delivery.even if it is understood that some low number of packages might miss their delivery date due to extenuating circumstances,that that number should be as high as is clearly a departure from the norm.
based on ramos admission during arbitration,the arbitrator found that this departure from ups normal operations was caused by ramos conscious decision to not deliver the packages to centro médico.as such,ramos action obstructed interrupted ups operations and the arbitrator decision is a plausible construction of article.it is also clear that the arbitrator decision draws its essence from the cba.because the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard of the law,and her opinion is supported in reason and fact and is not based on faulty reasoning or a crucial assumption that is concededly a,the arbitral award is allowed to stand.
