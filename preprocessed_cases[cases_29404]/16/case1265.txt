pursuant to the provisions of the telecommunications act of,et,sprint communications company of virginia,and sprint communications company collectively sprint or the sprint defendants entered into interconnection agreements with nineteen incumbent local exchange carriers collectively centurylink or the centurylink plaintiffs providing for the mutual exchange of telecommunications traffic.when sprint began to withhold payments under the agreement,centurylink brought a breach of contract claim in federal district court.after rejecting sprint threshold argument that its jurisdiction was limited to reviewing determinations by state utilities commissions,the district court entered judgment in favor of centurylink on the merits.the district court judge subsequently also concluded that a belatedly discovered financial interest in centurylink held in a managed individual retirement account did not require his recusal.sprint appeals all of the district court rulings for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
prior to the telecommunications act of the act,telephone service within a local calling area was provided by an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec operating as a monopoly.the purpose of the act was to create competition within these local telephone markets.
at the core of the act is a requirement that ilecs interconnect their facilities and equipment with competitive local exchange carriers clecs,such as sprint,for the mutual exchange of traffic.defined as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic,interconnection allows clec customers to call ilec customers and vice versa.while the carriers may reach agreement through arbitration or negotiation,the product of the process is an interconnection agreement an ica,which must include a detailed schedule of itemized charges for interconnection and each service or network element included in the agreement.a.
a brief description of the corporate relationship between sprint and centurylink,and the latter organizational parentage,provides necessary background for our consideration of the recusal issue.we then set out the underlying facts and procedural history of the appeal before us.
when sprint sought negotiation of the icas at issue in april,it and the nineteen companies that comprise the centurylink plaintiffs were wholly owned subsidiaries of sprint corporation the centurylink plaintiffs were a part of sprint corporation local telephone division.in may,sprint corporation spun off the centurylink plaintiffs,which then formed a separate company known as embarq corporation embarq.in july,centurytel,centurytel acquired embarq and its subsidiaries.the resulting entity began doing business as centurylink.between and sprint and centurylink executed the nineteen icas that are the subject of this dispute,and which were approved by the appropriate state commissions 
some general information about telecommunications traffic provides context for our discussion of the issues in this case.there are three ways to place a call landline,wireless,and internet protocol voip,which,as its name suggests,relies on the internet to originate voice communications.see vonage holdings nebraska pub.serv.comm n,cir voip is an internet application used to transmit voice communication over a broadband internet connection.likewise,a call placed through any of these three formats can be classified into three categories of traffic,depending on the locational relationship of those speaking local long distance intrastate and long distance interstate.the facts giving rise to the underlying dispute revolve around the ica compensation structure for these three categories of traffic.
in assessing the appropriate compensation for a local,long distance intrastate,and long distance interstate call,the relevant metrics are where a call originated and where it terminated this determination is often referred to in the telecommunications industry as the jurisdictionalizing of a call.all the calls at issue in this case originated on sprint network and were terminated by one of the centurylink plaintiffs on its local network.
the ica first addresses local traffic.in salient part,the ica defines local traffic as traffic that is originated and terminated within sprint local calling area.the ica applies to local traffic a practice known as bill keep or reciprocal compensation.as of the ica explains,u nder bill and keep,each party retains the revenues it receives from end user customers,and neither party pays the other party for terminating local traffic which is subject to the bill and keep compensation mechanism.in brief,no payments exchange hands for the termination of local traffic.
by contrast,the ica provides for access charges for the two categories of long distance traffic discussed above intrastate and interstate.under the ica,the applicable access charge depends on the category of long distance traffic.
all three categories of traffic local,long distance intrastate,and long distance interstate travel across trunks.see x defining trunk as including transmission media such as radio,satellite,wire,cable and fiber optic cable means of transmission.the parties stipulated below that sprint delivers some traffic to centurylink via local interconnection trunks,and other traffic by way of feature group d fgd trunks.fgd trunks carry long distance traffic only.id.at.fgd trunks attach to local interconnection trunks,and thus enable long distance traffic to be terminated on one of centurylink local networks.
the dispute in this case only involves voip traffic,which travels over fgd trunks for a long distance call and over local interconnection trunks section of the ica addresses the compensation system for the termination of voip traffic voice calls that are transmitted,in whole or in part,via the public internet or a private ip network voip shall be compensated in the same manner as voice traffic reciprocal compensation,interstate access and intrastate access.
sprint paid centurylink access charges for voip traffic as set out in from the time of the execution of the icas between the parties in and until june.at that point,sprint began filing written disputes with centurylink.although the nature of sprint objections changed,its core contention appeared to be twofold that the ica did not apply to long distance voip traffic that traveled over fgd trunks and that centurylink had billed sprint at an improperly high rate for voip traffic since may.
instead of following the dispute resolution procedure established in the ica,sprint unilaterally reduced the rate for termination of traffic.it demanded that centurylink apply sprint recalculated rate going forward and remit portions of previous payments made by sprint which sprint deemed to be in excess of what it should have paid.sprint withheld payments for both voip and traffic,although no dispute concerning the latter existed.
in november,centurylink filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia alleging one count of breach of contract based on the facts recounted above.sprint moved to dismiss centurylink complaint for lack of jurisdiction due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies,or,alternatively,to stay the case under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.sprint also filed a counterclaim alleging,inter alia,that centurylink breached the north carolina ica the nc ica by billing sprint for local traffic not subject to access charges.
the district court denied sprint motion to dismiss in a lengthy opinion.it concluded that it had federal question jurisdiction under supreme court and circuit precedent interpreting the act.it then decided that the act imposed no requirement for centurylink to exhaust its remedies before a state commission.finally,it declined to stay the case under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,which allows a court to refer a case within its jurisdiction to an administrative agency.
the district court conducted a bench trial on centurylink breach of contract claim during august and september.it subsequently entered judgment in favor of centurylink,and issued a memorandum opinion setting out findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court concluded that in refusing to pay the access charges as billed,sprint breached its duties under the icas,which clearly included paying access charges for traffic according to the jurisdictional endpoints of the calls.cent.of sprint commc ns of,d.central to the district court decision was its finding that of the ica operated to apply the compensation regime for local,long distance intrastate,and long distance interstate traffic to voip calls although the district court did not find the relevant portions of the ica to be ambiguous,it noted that if ambiguity existed,it would be construed against sprint as the drafter of the ica the district court then awarded centurylink,which consisted of damages under the breach of contract claim and prejudgment interest.
the second phase of the litigation,the bench trial on sprint counterclaim,took place over two days in december.unlike centurylink breach of contract claim,which focused on long distance voip traffic,sprint counterclaim alleged that centurylink had improperly charged it for local voip calls recognizing that the ica bill and keep provision did not provide for access charges for local traffic,the district court rejected sprint argument that the ica did not permit centurylink use of the billing telephone number btn method for determining whether a call should be deemed local.under the btn method,a carrier classifies a call as local or nonlocal for billing purposes based on a unique account number that is assigned to a specific facility.sprint contended that centurylink was required to use another method for jurisdictionalizing a call known as the calling party number or cpn.centurylink used btn throughout the period in dispute,in part because at the time the parties executed the nc ica,centurylink did not have the software in place to use the cpn method.see.
the district court found that the nc ica did not specify a method for identifying local calls,but instead incorporated by reference a telecommunications industry publication that explicitly permitted use of the btn method.alternatively,the district court again construed any ambiguity in the nc ica against sprint as the drafter.
by may,the district court judge had presided over both bench trials,had ruled on sprint jurisdiction motion,had entered judgment for centurylink on its breach of contract claim,including the issuance of an accompanying page memorandum opinion,and had begun drafting the opinion on sprint counterclaim.on that date,as the district judge was preparing his financial disclosure for financial year,he discovered that he had owned eighty shares of centurylink in a managed individual retirement account ira during the time he presided over this case.
fund managers made decisions to buy and sell stocks in the ira,which at any given time held shares in as many as companies,without input from the judge.the fund managers initially purchased shares in embarq,which subsequently converted into shares in centurytel following its acquisition of embarq.the fund managers subsequent purchases of centurytel stock in october and march brought the district court judge total holdings up to eighty shares,which represented between and of the value of the ira.in july,the district court judge had filed his financial disclosure form,which reflected that the ira held eighty shares in centurytel because centurytel was not a party to this case,the computerized system used to identify potential conflicts did not register any conflict.
as soon as the district court judge discovered that his ira owned shares in centurylink,he initiated a conference call to inform the parties.he explained the situation,and stated that he was not qualified under the canons of ethics to sit as a judge in this case.he then noted i do know that there any alternative but for me to vacate the orders that i entered in the case and recus e myself and hav e the case reassigned to some other judge to make a decision.counsel for centurylink requested time to research the recusal and vacatur issues before the judge took any action.hearing no objection from counsel for sprint,the district court judge gave centurylink one week to conduct research and,if desired,file a brief.
on may,centurylink moved for the district court judge to divest from centurylink,or,in the alternative,to recuse without vacating any of the previous orders and opinions.in the interval between the conference call and the filing of centurylink motion,the district court judge conducted additional research,and came to the conclusion that his earlier statements rested on a misinterpretation of the ethical rules.he therefore had the parties agree to a briefing schedule to address the recusal issue.he also directed the ira fund manager to sell the shares of centurylink immediately,which was done on may.
after considering briefing from the parties,the district court judge concluded that his statements during the conference call did not constitute recusal allowing briefing of the recusal issue as a response to centurylink request was permissible and neither relevant subsection of the statutory provision governing recusal,required recusal or vacatur.he issued a written opinion on the recusal issue on december,and,on the following day,a separate opinion in which he ruled in favor of centurylink on the merits of sprint counterclaim.
sprint appeal followed.
this appeal raises questions of federal and state jurisdiction under the act,and also implicates a decision of the federal communications commission the fcc.we therefore requested the fcc to submit an amicus brief we incorporate the fcc views in our discussion as appropriate.
sprint advances two reasons why the district court should not have reached the merits of this case.it first argues that the district court had no authority under the act to interpret and enforce an ica because its role is limited to reviewing a state commission determination,and no such determination occurred here.it further contends that the district court judge should have recused himself and vacated all orders and judgments issued in the case.before considering each argument,we briefly describe pertinent parts of the act.
section of the act requires carriers to submit their proposed ica to the applicable state commission,which shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.e if a state commission fails to approve or reject a proposed ica within ninety days of an ica adopted by negotiation or within thirty days of an ica adopted by arbitration,the ica is deemed approved.e.by contrast,if the state commission fails to carry out its responsibility under section in any proceeding or other matter under section,the fcc must preempt the state commission and assume whatever responsibility it otherwise possessed.e.the act does not define what constitutes a responsibility for purposes of e.
section e provides for review of state commission actions in two distinct ways.first,when the fcc preempts a state commission under section e,section e makes the fcc proceeding and any judicial review of that proceeding the exclusive remedies for a state commission failure to act.second,section e provides that i n any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
sprint urges us to read the act as permitting only state commissions to interpret and enforce icas in the first instance.in sprint view,because no state commission considered the ica dispute before the district court did,the district court lacked authority to do so.sprint first argues the act contains a statutory exhaustion requirement.even if the text and structure of the act do not mandate initial state commission consideration,sprint contends that we should impose such a requirement as a prudential matter.both arguments raise legal questions,which we review de novo.see cavalier,llc.power,cir.we begin with the former.
in considering whether the act bestows on state commissions the exclusive responsibility to interpret and enforce icas in the first instance,it is useful to begin by identifying what is not at issue in this case.following the supreme court decision in verizon maryland,public service commission of maryland,d,and our decision in verizon maryland,global naps,cir,it is clear that a federal court has jurisdiction to interpret the terms of compensation provisions in an ica under u.sprint does not argue otherwise.instead,sprint contends that although the act confers federal question jurisdiction over the dispute in this case,it restricts federal courts to reviewing initial determinations made by state commissions.
sprint argument assumes that a state commission has the authority to interpret and enforce an ica.interestingly,nothing in the act text so provides.nonetheless,every circuit to have considered the question has concluded that a state commission does have such authority.see core commc ns,verizon,cir sw.bell,pub.util.comm n,cir commc ns,pub.regulation comm n,cir iowa network,qwest,cir bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir en banc mci telecomms.bell,cir sw.bell.brooks fiber commc ns of,cir the fcc has as well.in re starpower commc ns,llc.although we have yet to address this issue we need not do so here because we reject sprint more particularized claim that a state commission must interpret an ica before a federal district court can do so.
we begin with the text of the act.just as there is no statutory text granting state commissions the authority to interpret and enforce the provisions of icas,there is similarly none granting them the exclusive authority to do so in the first instance.see core comm cns,at t he act is simply silent as to the procedure for disputes.congress could have made review by a state commission in the first instance an exclusive remedy it used this very phrase when discussing the review of an fcc preemption action.see e in a case in which a state fails to act as described in e,the proceeding by the fcc under such paragraph and any judicial review of the fcc actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a state commission failure to act.emphasis added.but congress did not do so.
notwithstanding the act textual silence on this point,sprint argues that language in e requires a state commission to make a determination before a federal district court can act.specifically,sprint points to the following in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court e.we disagree.the plain import of this language is to provide for federal court review of a state commission decision to approve or reject a proposed ica this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the act precludes such review by state courts.see e no state court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an ica.
nonetheless,sprint seeks to rely on cases that interpret determination in e to include a state commission interpretation or enforcement of an ica.see,bellsouth,at sw.bell.at we next conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to review the decision of the oklahoma corporation commission interpreting the interconnection agreement.sprint reliance is misplaced.in recognizing that a federal court authority to review state commission actions includes the authority to review a state commission interpretation or enforcement of an ica provision,these cases neither explicitly nor implicitly hold that parties must bring a dispute concerning an ica to a state commission in the first instance.rather,they simply acknowledge that where parties make a state commission the first stop for interpreting or enforcing a provision in an ica,the language of e provides that it need not be the last stop 
what sprint terms its structural argument that the structure of the act gives state commissions plenary authority over the interpretation of an ica in the first instance,and limits federal courts to a reviewing role merely repackages the same textual argument.just as sprint can not ground its textual argument in any text,neither can it point to any structural features of the act indicating that congress intended to mandate initial state commission consideration.nor does sprint vague appeal to cooperative federalism advance its argument.as we have observed,adhering to the act policy of cooperative federalism requires close attention to the role that congress and the fcc has actually assigned to state commissions.see bellsouth,sanford,cir states continuing exercise of authority over telecommunications issues forms part of a deliberately constructed model of cooperative federalism,under which the states,subject to the boundaries set by congress and federal regulators,are called upon to apply their expertise and judgment and have the freedom to do so.emphasis added.here,neither the plain text of the act nor its structure evince congressional intent to place exclusive authority to interpret an ica in the first instance in a state commission.
sprint further contends that even if the text and structure of the act do not require initial state commission consideration,deference to the fcc starpower decision should lead us to construe the statute as imposing such a requirement in starpower,the fcc considered whether to preempt the virginia state corporation commission virginia commission when the virginia commission took no action on a disputed issue arising from an ica.the fcc concluded first that the virginia commission had the authority to interpret and enforce an ica,and then decided that preemption was proper because a state commission failure to act to carry out its responsibility under section can in some circumstances include the failure to interpret and enforce existing icas.starpower,at emphasis added.
there is some support for sprint argument that starpower advocates initial state commission consideration of ica provisions.in core communications,the third circuit purported to apply chevron deference to the fcc decision in.at.in what it acknowledged to be a broad reading of starpower,that court interpreted the fcc observation that a state commission responsibility under e can in some circumstances include the failure to interpret and enforce existing icas,starpower,at,as conferring an exclusive authority on state commissions to resolve disputes over icas in the first instance.core commc ns,at.
in its amicus brief in this case,however,the fcc disputed that it had taken such a position in starpower,describing the third circuit interpretation as incorrect.fcc amicus br.at.the fcc agrees that starpower gives state commissions the responsibility to interpret and enforce an ica when asked to do so by the parties,but emphasizes that the decision does not hold that state commissions are the only entities with that responsibility.id.moreover,the fcc argues that reading the act to grant exclusive authority to state commissions to interpret and enforce icas would be inconsistent with the broad adjudicatory authority that other sections of the act confer on the fcc and federal district courts.id.at.finding this interpretation of the proper allocation of decisional authority between federal courts and state commissions consistent with our reading of the act,we decline sprint invitation to follow the third circuit and accord chevron deference to a position the fcc did not take.accordingly,we hold that the act does not require a state commission to interpret and enforce an ica in the first instance.
sprint next argues that even if the act does not mandate initial state commission consideration,we should nonetheless impose this step as a prudential exhaustion requirement.sprint contends that state commissions necessarily bring a level of expertise to the consideration of interconnection issues that federal courts lack.where,as here,congress has legislated no explicit exhaustion requirement,we are nonetheless guided by congressional intent in determining whether application of the exhaustion doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme.cavalier,at quoting patsy bd.of regents of,d.cognizant of the virtually unflagging obligation to exercise that jurisdiction which we possess,colorado river water conservation district united states,d,we must use our sound judicial discretion to balance the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion,cavalier telephone,at quotation and citation omitted.here,that balance tips against imposing an exhaustion requirement.
an exhaustion requirement would neither align with congressional intent nor serve one of the exhaustion doctrine core purposes.as we have noted,the purpose of the act was to introduce the benefits of competition into the local telecommunications market.an exhaustion requirement exists in part to promote efficiency.see woodford ngo,d claims generally can be resolved much more quickly and economically in proceedings before an agency than in litigation in federal court.the goals of competition and efficiency would only be disserved by a requirement that the underlying merits of a dispute between sprint and centurylink be considered by multiple individual state commissions with the attendant risk of disparate interpretations and dispositions.nor are we persuaded that state commissions necessarily possess superior expertise to resolve such disputes.congress certainly did not agree,as it expressly provided for the fcc to act when a state commission has failed to do so,and for federal courts to review such disputes in any event.for these reasons,we conclude that neither the text of the act nor prudential considerations compel federal deference to state commissions in the first instance.
in its second challenge to the district court authority to decide the merits of this case,sprint argues that the district court judge discovery of a financial interest in centurylink required recusal and vacatur of all opinions and orders already issued.we review a district judge recusal decision for abuse of discretion.newport news holdings virtual city vision,cir.
sprint advances two arguments under the judicial recusal statute.first,in sprint view,recusal here was mandatory because the district court judge knew that he had a financial interest in a party to the proceeding.b.alternatively,sprint argues that the district court judge should have recused himself because his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.a.we consider each in turn.
relying in part on the federal circuit decision in shell oil united states,sprint contends that the financial disclosure form that the district court judge completed in july established knowledge of his financial interest in centurylink before he took any significant action in this case.see appellant br.at.generally,a financial interest is ownership of a legal or equitable interest,however small in the affairs of a party.d.and it is that the ownership of stock constitutes a financial interest for purposes of b.shell oil,at.
sprint argument,however,fails to distinguish between direct ownership of securities and ownership of securities in a common investment fund over which a judge exercises no management responsibilities.the judicial recusal statute specifically carves out the latter situation from the definition of a financial interest ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a financial interest in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund.d i.congress created this exception to enable judges to hold securities without risking recusal across a broad range of cases.see new york city dev.hart,cir when congress amended in,it designed d i as a safe harbor,a way for judges to hold securities without needing to make fine calculations of the effect of a given suit on their wealth.moreover,the operation of d i is mechanical just as b requires disqualification when there is any financial interest,however small,so d i eliminates any inquiry into the size of the likely effect of a decision on the value of securities held through a mutual fund.id.citation omitted.
the safe harbor exception created in d i applies here.although the recusal statute does not define common investment fund,the core elements,which include assets held together in trust in order to provide satisfactory diversification and a reduction of administrative expenses,see b ii see also federal tax coordinator h,wl defining common investment fund as a group trust created to provide a diversification of investments or a reduction of administrative expenses into which ira assets may be commingled,are found here.the record demonstrates that the district court judge held the centurylink shares in an ira along with the assets of many others who hold similar accounts.the record also indicates that d ecisions to buy and sell stocks in the ira were made by the fund managers without input from the presiding judge.thus,the shares at issue here were held in a common investment fund in whose management the district court judge did not participate accordingly,the district court judge ownership of shares in centurylink does not constitute a financial interest in centurylink for purposes of b.see hart,at because the underlying assets are not a financial interest of the judge it is unnecessary and inappropriate to inquire how a case might affect the value of the fund assets.
sprint alternatively argues that a required recusal because the district court judge should have known about his interest in centurylink,and a reasonable observer would ascribe such knowledge to him and call into question his partiality.we note at the outset that a judge whose conduct has satisfied the d i safe harbor will almost certainly have complied with a by acting in a reasonable and impartial manner.see hart,at noting that using a as a back door inquiry into the substantiality of the effect on the value of assets held in a managed fund is inappropriate,and holding that a reasonable person would not question the impartiality of a judge who holds nothing but well diversified mutual funds.even if one could imagine a scenario where d i applies but a judge partiality might reasonably be questioned,such a scenario is not present here.given the small number of shares the district court judge held,the fact that the centurylink shares only came into his portfolio after a series of mergers about which he was unaware,and,as we have noted,that he held the shares in an ira managed by others,a reasonable observer would have no cause to question his impartiality.his prompt action to inform the parties of his stock when he learned of it,and to divest from centurylink shortly thereafter further supports this conclusion.
the district court judge did not violate the recusal statute,and therefore did not abuse his discretion in deciding that neither recusal nor vacatur was appropriate.
having concluded that the district court properly reached the merits of this case,we now consider whether it decided them correctly.sprint raises two challenges.first,sprint asserts that the district court misconstrued the ica as applying to long distance voip traffic.second,it contends that centurylink impermissibly billed sprint for local calls.when reviewing a district court judgments after a bench trial,we accept factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and examine conclusions of law de novo.plasterers local union pension plan pepper,cir.
as the district court did,we apply virginia law to centurylink breach of contract claim,cent.of,d at,and north carolina law to sprint counterclaim to succeed on a breach of contract claim,the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a legally enforceable obligation existed between it and the defendant that the defendant breached that obligation and that the plaintiff incurred damages as a result of the breach.see sunrise continuing care,llc wright,citation omitted birtha stonemor,llc.both centurylink claim and sprint counterclaim implicate the first of these elements.we interpret a contract as written and,when its terms are clear and unambiguous,we construe the contract according to its plain meaning.city of chesapeake states self insurers risk retention,state philip morris usa.
where ambiguities arise,however,the basic contract law principle contra proferentem counsels that we construe any ambiguities in the contract against its draftsman.maersk line,united states,cir station,dare,rev on other grounds.finally,a settled rule of contract interpretation allows consideration of the practical construction put by the parties upon the terms of their own contract.first nat.exch.bank of roanoke roanoke oil,see also id.no rule for the construction of written instruments is better settled than that which attaches great weight to the construction of the instrument by the parties themselves.citation omitted century commc ns,hous.auth.of wilson.armed with these principles,we turn to sprint arguments.
sprint first argues that the ica does not apply to long distance voip traffic carried over fgd trunks.in its thorough opinion on centurylink breach of contract claim,the district court explained how local calls are subject to bill and keep reciprocal compensation under of the ica,while the ica set out specific access charges for intrastate long distance and interstate long distance traffic.in the district court view,of the ica,which provides that v oice calls that are transmitted,in whole or in part,via the public internet or a private ip network voip shall be compensated in the same manner as voice traffic,reciprocal compensation,interstate access and intrastate access,applied that existing compensation regime to voip traffic.
on appeal,instead of directly challenging this interpretation of the ica,sprint argues that the ica plain language only covers interconnection of local networks,of which fgd trunks are not a part thus,under sprint view,the compensation regime set out in does not apply to voip traffic carried over fgd trunks.appellant br.at.the plain language which sprint cites includes provisions that define the scope of the ica as relating to the establishment of local interconnection,set out guidance for the local interconnection trunk arrangement,and define the physical point of interconnection as the physical point that establishes the technical interface,the test point,and the operational responsibility between clec and sprint for the local interconnection of their networks,see appellant br.at.but given that federal law defines interconnection simply as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic,and nothing in the ica defines it otherwise,none of these provisions advances sprint position.simply put,the ica is ambiguous as to whether local interconnection includes or excludes long distance voip traffic carried over fgd trunks.
this ambiguity along with the parties previous course of dealings,compels us to reject sprint argument.the district court found,and sprint does not challenge,that it drafted the icas at issue here.had sprint intended to exclude fgd trunks from the scope of the ica,a simple provision stating that the established compensation framework for voip traffic in did not apply to any voip traffic traveling on fgd trunks would have accomplished this goal.instead,sprint argument seeks to cobble together a handful of other ambiguous provisions and ignore the language of to support the proposition that voip traffic over fgd trunks is excluded from the ica coverage.as the district court observed,only so much can be gained from sprint referencing other provisions in the icas,but ignoring the one provision,section,that speaks directly to the issue in dispute compensation for termination of traffic.cent.of.at.because we are required to construe ambiguity against the drafter here,sprint we conclude that the ica must be read to apply to voip traffic carried over fgd trunks.
the parties own longstanding practical construction of the ica bolsters our conclusion.see first nat.exch.bank of roanoke,at.sprint paid the centurylink plaintiffs for voip traffic carried over fgd trunks in accordance with from the execution of the icas in and until june.although the fact that the parties were for some of this time both part of sprint corporation may explain sprint reluctance to challenge this arrangement until the centurylink plaintiffs split off from sprint corporation in may,it does not explain sprint continued payments until june.the district court unchallenged factual findings,however,offer an explanation in the summer of,sprint,like many companies at the time,embarked on efforts.notably,during this time period,sprint launched a coordinated effort to contest access charges on traffic with other carriers across the telecommunications industry.cent.of.at.sprint change in strategy does not undo the parties shared interpretation of the ica over a number of years.when viewed in conjunction with the ambiguity in the ica coverage of voip traffic over fgd trunks,the parties course of dealing reinforces our conclusion that the district court did not err in entering judgment for centurylink on its breach of contract claim 
sprint also challenges the district court ruling on its counterclaim,which alleges that centurylink improperly billed it for local traffic under the nc ica.sprint does not dispute that the calls are covered by the ica,but instead contends that centurylink wrongly identified the calls as intrastate long distance,using an impermissible method.specifically,in sprint view,the plain terms of the nc ica disallowed centurylink use of the billing telephone number the btn method.we disagree.
as noted above,the bill keep compensation regime under which neither party pays the other applies to local traffic,whereas the ica requires sprint to pay the applicable access charges for intrastate long distance traffic.thus,while no charge would apply to a call deemed local,sprint would have to pay access charges for any traffic deemed intrastate long distance.moreover,there are at least two different methods for determining whether a call is deemed local.the btn method identifies traffic as local or nonlocal for billing purposes based on a unique account number that is assigned to a specific facility.by contrast,the calling party number or cpn method identifies the actual originating location of the call in question.in some instances,traffic that the btn method identifies as intrastate long distance and therefore subject to access charges the cpn method would identify as local.
the crux of the question,then,is whether the ica establishes a method for determining when a call is properly considered local and when it is not.we must therefore determine whether the ica required centurylink to use the cpn method instead of the btn method it actually used.
in its comprehensive opinion,the district court identified the relevant provisions of the nc ica at issue.first,defines local traffic under the nc ica as traffic that is originated and terminated within sprint local calling area.importantly,the text of the nc ica does not prescribe a specific method of jurisdictionalizing traffic as local subject to bill and keep or subject to the applicable access charges for billing purposes.instead,provides that e ach party shall calculate terminating interconnection minutes of use based on standard ama recordings made within each party network,these recordings being necessary for each party to generate bills to the other party.section of the nc ica defines ama as automated message accounting,and notes that ama format is contained in the automatic message accounting document published by telcordia as gr core which defines the industry standard for message recording.the parties do not dispute that the industry manual known as the telcordia gr core permits use of the btn method.
both sprint and centurylink invoke the express language of the nc ica in support of their respective positions.sprint claims that definition of traffic that is originated and terminated within a local calling area,required centurylink to use the calling party number or cpn method to jurisdictionalize the originating and terminating points of a call.according to sprint,application of the cpn method to the calls at issue would transform them from long distance into local c
