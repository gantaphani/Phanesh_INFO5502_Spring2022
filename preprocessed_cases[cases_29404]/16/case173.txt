these are in a case involving copyright infringement.in,appellant and banco popular de puerto rico bppr sought a declaratory judgment under the copyright act,et,after several music publishing companies contacted bppr claiming that they owned and were owed royalties on various music compositions that bppr had produced and distributed in a series of christmas concerts.bppr deposited the royalties due on these compositions with the district court and asked the district court to declare to whom the royalties were actually due,and distribute them accordingly.
latin american music,lamco and its affiliate,la asociación de compositores y editores de música latinoamericana acemla,countersued bppr for copyright infringement of several of their compositions.an additional music publishing company,guillermo venegas lloveras,gvli,filed counterclaims against bppr,lamco,and acemla for copyright infringement of the song genesis.the district court consolidated these cases and denied the parties respective motions for summary judgment.
subsequently,several of the settled their claims for copyright infringement amongst themselves and with bppr.the district court then bifurcated the remaining claims into two cases,case proceeded as a jury trial,case,as a bench trial.
the jury found bppr liable for the copyright infringement of two compositions owned by lamco and acemla,and awarded lamco and acemla in compensatory damages.meanwhile,after the bench trial,the district court found acemla liable for violating the copyright of gvli composition and ordered acemla to pay gvli,plus interest,in damages.we affirm the decisions in both cases,in all respects.
beginning in,bppr,a financial services corporation,has produced live christmas concerts to showcase puerto rican and international singers and songwriters.these concerts are broadcast over major radio and television stations throughout puerto rico,and then released on cd,dvd,and in other formats,in part to raise money for bppr philanthropic foundation,fundación banco popular.
bppr did not initially obtain performance,mechanical,or synchronization licenses for all of the compositions it utilized in these concerts.in,bppr began the complicated task of obtaining retroactive licenses from various license holders for the use of their compositions in the concerts.
lamco,a new music publisher,represented to bppr through lamco affiliate,acemla,a company based in puerto rico that it held the rights to license and collect royalties for a number of the compositions utilized by bppr before.bppr negotiated with lamco a contract the retroactive licensing agreement in which bppr agreed to pay to lamco for the mechanical and synchronization licenses for six compositions dame la mano paloma,genesis,madrigal,mi jaragual,ojos chinos,and un jibaro terminado,as well as in public performance fees to acemla for the public performance of its entire catalogue between and.in exchange,agreed to indemnify bppr against any future claimants asserting interests in the performance of the compositions set forth in the agreement.at the same time,bppr negotiated with the mechanical and synchronization licenses for seventeen compositions bppr planned to use in its christmas concert,and began negotiations for the performance rights for these same compositions.the parties never followed through on this performance license agreement however,partly,bppr alleges,because bppr became aware that did not hold the rights to some of the compositions it sought to license to bppr.
while negotiations for the christmas concert were ongoing,bppr began to receive claims from outside entities purporting to hold the rights to several of the compositions then under negotiation for the christmas concert as well as compositions which had been licensed to bppr by under the retroactive license agreement.on january,bppr filed suit under the copyright act of,et,and a,a,and a,seeking a declaratory judgment and naming those companies which had come forward peer international corporation and affiliates peer,universal musica universal,sonido,emi catalogue partnership and affiliates,gvli,broadcast music,and the american society of composers,authors and publishers,as well as,and any and all other entities purporting to hold rights in the compositions utilized in the christmas concerts.
bppr deposited the royalties due on these compositions with the district court and asked the court to disburse the monies to whichever of the defendants were lawful license holders of the compositions during the time period in question.bppr also requested that the court enjoin the defendants from instituting any further copyright infringement actions against it over the christmas concerts.bppr asked for a reimbursement of any sums of money paid under the retroactive licensing agreement to for the rights to perform works which were not actually under the control of during the term of the agreement or,in the alternative,for an offset against any royalties or fees the court found bppr owed to.
on march,answered bppr complaint,contesting various facts and alleging that bppr had not yet paid the royalties owed for several compositions performed in bppr,and christmas concerts.for this reason,and under the terms of the retroactive licensing agreement,including its indemnity provision,argued that bppr should not receive any offset or refund of monies paid for the license to use any of the compositions included under the agreement.in addition,on april,filed its own complaint against bppr under the copyright act and,a,a,and a,alleging that bppr had willfully infringed copyrights to multiple compositions performed in bppr,and christmas concerts,and had committed other violations under the copyright act and puerto rico law.sought injunctive relief and damages under,and under puerto rico law.the district court consolidated this suit with bppr case.
on june,gvli,which claimed to hold the rights to the song genesis,filed an answer to bppr complaint,a counterclaim against bppr alleging copyright infringement for the unauthorized use of genesis,and a against and peer.in its,gvli alleged that and peer knew or had reason to know that they could not license genesis to bppr and accordingly had infringed gvli copyright to that song.
after extensive discovery,the parties moved for summary judgment.on october,the district court denied their motions for summary judgment in nearly all respects the court set the date for trial as october,and denied the parties motions for reconsideration.
on october,the district court held a bench trial as to the dispute between defendant and defendant universal over the ownership of fichas negras.on january,the district court held that copyright registration is valid for fichas negras and that held a priority registration for that composition.banco popular de,latin am.music,d.
importantly,on october,the defendants reached a settlement agreement,in which they resolved their various claims as to most of the compositions in dispute and distributed the royalty funds deposited by bppr as to these.received payment for the equivalent of songs used in bppr christmas program.payment for the equivalent of songs was divided among the remaining publishers and rights holders,who were subsequently dismissed from the suit.
the settlement agreement expressly excluded from settlement the dispute between bppr and as to bppr alleged copyright infringement of twelve songs what the agreement termed the undisputed lamco songs,including fichas negras,madrigal,mi dolor es mio,and aló quien llama.claims as to those songs would proceed in a jury trial.the settlement agreement also excluded the dispute over gvli claims concerning genesis.on october,the district court approved the settlement agreement.
on november,bppr filed a motion objecting to the settlement agreement on the basis of an understanding it claimed to have reached with,in which had promised,as part of the settlement agreement,to voluntarily dismiss its infringement claims against bppr with respect to the christmas concert.bppr argued in this motion,and in an additional motion in limine filed on july,that the district court should read the settlement agreement to exclude from the twelve undisputed lamco songs four songs performed in the christmas concert fichas negras,madrigal,mi dolor es mio,and aló quien llama.opposed both bppr motions.
on july,the district court denied bppr motions as to the settlement agreement,finding that the agreement specifically permitted further litigation as to the twelve undisputed lamco songs.
on july,the district court held a bench trial in case to determine whether had violated gvli copyright to the song genesis by granting bppr a retroactive performance license for that song,and whether bppr should be awarded costs for the monies it paid under the retroactive licensing contract for genesis and ojos chinos.banco popular de,latin am.music bppr,wl july.
on july,the court ruled based on the testimony at trial and several decisions considering the same topic,see,venegas hernández asociación de compositores y editores de música latinoamericana acemla,cir,that gvli held the exclusive performance rights to genesis between and december,and that accordingly had infringed those rights by issuing bppr a retroactive performance license for genesis during that time period.bppr,wl,at july.
the court declined to award statutory damages and instead ordered acemla to pay gvli damages in the amount of,or of the total sum paid by bppr to acemla under the retroactive licensing agreement for the retroactive licenses to use the six compositions,including genesis.id.at.
the court then held that bppr offset claim with respect to genesis was moot,since the court had awarded to gvli all the royalties originally paid by bppr to acemla under the retroactive licensing agreement.id.at.
relying on this court opinion in latin american music archdiocese of san juan of the roman catholic apostolic church,cir,bppr presented evidence that was not the exclusive owner of ojos chinos during the time period covered under the retroactive licensing agreement,and argued that the court should reassign or refund the monies bppr had paid to for ojos chinos under the agreement.the district court rejected bppr argument,noting that this court opinion in archdiocese of san juan had not held that had no ownership interest in the composition,but merely that held a license.bppr,wl,at.finding that bppr had failed to meet its burden to show that had misrepresented its ownership rights in the song under the retroactive licensing agreement,the court rejected bppr request.
on july,the jury trial commenced in the other case,case,on the remaining questions of whether bppr infringed copyrights to fichas negras,madrigal,mi dolor es mio,and aló quien llama in its christmas concert,and if so,whether and what damages were due.
on the seventh day of the jury trial,bppr moved to introduce a new issue and what it said was newly discovered evidence.the evidence consisted of documents and testimony,which bppr contends reveal that the composer of fichas negras,johnny rodriguez,conferred all rights and royalties in his collected works to the university of puerto rico upon his death.bppr also argued that it could prove that knew about this evidence but failed to disclose it during the course of discovery under.the district court denied bppr motion,finding that the evidence would require additional hearings,authentication,and potential discovery,and would unduly delay a jury trial already well underway.the court noted that bppr had had several years in which to locate this new evidence during the course of the parties extensive discovery.
on august,the jury returned a verdict in favor of lamco,finding bppr liable for copyright infringement of two songs fichas negras and madrigal.the jury found that bppr was an innocent infringer with respect to these songs and awarded lamco in compensatory damages.on the same day,the district court ordered bppr to pay lamco in compensatory damages,permanently enjoined bppr from performing,producing,selling distributing the christmas concert,and required bppr to retain the master copy and full inventory of that concert,until final judgment in the case.
on appeal from the jury verdict against it,bppr argues that it was not a party to the october,settlement agreement,did not consent to that agreement terms,and that,in any event,aló quien llama,fichas negras,madrigal,and mi dolor es mio were included in the agreement and should not have been subjected to a jury trial.bppr also argues that it had an implied license from to use these songs in the christmas concert,that was precluded from litigating its claims over the songs.regardless,bppr argues,failed to establish that it owned fichas negras or madrigal in,failed to establish that bppr had infringed its ownership of these works in the christmas concert,and,regardless,was barred from litigating the copyright infringement claims based on own misuse of copyright.
bppr also argues that the district court committed reversible error at trial by limiting bppr ability to use the affirmative defense of copyright misuse and by refusing to admit into evidence the documents concerning johnny rodriguez will.
with respect to the bench trial,bppr argues that because failed to establish exclusive ownership of genesis and ojos chinos,it was error not to refund the monies it paid to for the right to use those songs.
defends the jury verdict on appeal as well as the district court decisions to deny bppr motions as to the settlement agreement and the evidence of johnny rodriguez will.
appeals the district court decisions in the bench trial that gvli exclusively owned the performance rights to genesis between and december,and that accordingly infringed these rights by licensing genesis to bppr during that time frame.also appeals the district court award of damages to gvli.
gvli defends the district court decision in its favor in the bench trial.
we affirm the district court decisions and rulings in all respects.we first address bppr claims as to the settlement agreement and the jury trial in case.we then take up bppr,and gvli claims as to the district court opinion and order from the bench trial in case 
bppr claims as to the scope of the settlement agreement 
we reject bppr claim that the district court abused its discretion by allowing to litigate the copyright infringement claims as to aló quien llama,fichas negras,madrigal,and mi dolor es mio,which,bppr argues,were included under the settlement agreement and therefore should not have been the subject of further litigation.
the district court rejected bppr reading of the settlement agreement,finding that the agreement,by its terms,did not preclude the future litigation of the twelve undisputed lamco songs as the same is included in the agreement.
in reviewing the district court conclusions concerning the settlement agreement,we apply a sliding scale standard of review under the label of clear error review.quint staley,cir.the more the district court conclusions are characterized as factual conclusions,the more our review of those facts is for clear error the more the district court conclusions are conclusions of law,the more independent review we give.id.
paragraph six of the settlement agreement states,t he remaining undisputed lamco songs shall be the further subject of the litigation in the copyright consolidated case.the settlement agreement defines undisputed lamco songs as the following twelve songs felices dias,aló quien nama,cortijo bailable,tiempo perdido,en la vida todo es vivir,fichas negras,oubau moin,madrigal,mi jaragual,mi dolor es mio,genesis,and un jibaro terminado.
the district court interpretation thus plainly accords with the text of the settlement agreement and we reject bppr argument.
bppr sufficiency of the evidence arguments 
bppr next attacks the jury verdict on the ground that,as a matter of law,failed to establish that it held the copyright to either fichas negras or madrigal when bppr utilized those songs in its christmas concert,and so failed to make out a viable claim of infringement.bppr also argues that it had an implied license to use the songs,and that the evidence demonstrates that in fact misused its copyrights and so should be barred from asserting any claim of copyright infringement against bppr.
we review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict by asking whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could have found in favor of the party that prevailed.galarneau merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.we must affirm the jury verdict unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.kenda pot money leagues,cir quoting negron caleb brett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.bppr has failed to meet this exacting standard with respect to its sufficiency of the evidence arguments.
first,with respect to bppr claim that failed to establish that it held the rights to either fichas negras or madrigal,bppr argues that never placed into evidence certified or deposit copies of,or valid copyright registration forms for,the compositions,or testimony comparing the versions registered by with the versions actually utilized by bppr in its christmas concert.as a result of this failure to demonstrate either that it held valid copyrights in the two compositions or that the versions registered were the versions utilized in the christmas concert,bppr argues,failed to demonstrate that bppr infringed the copyrights to the two songs.second,bppr argues that the evidence showed that lamco was barred from claiming copyright infringement due to its own misuse of copyrights.bppr alleges that lamco and affiliate acemla regular practice of simultaneously assigning the publishing rights of a work to lamco,and the public performance rights of the same work to acemla,violates antitrust laws and constitutes copyright misuse.
we reject these claims.as we noted earlier,on october,the district court conducted a bench trial on the issue of the ownership of fichas negras as between and universal,after which the court ruled that lamco held a priority assignment in the song,and that lamco copyright registration is valid for fichas negras.bppr,d at.in addition,at trial,the president of testified as to,and presented the registrations of,the two compositions,and bppr has failed to establish that these registrations were invalid or insufficient to support claims of copyright infringement.
the jury heard the evidence and received instructions as to the copyright registrations and its verdict was not unreasonable in light of the evidence presented.bppr bore the burden of proving its affirmative defense of copyright misuse,and the jury was not unreasonable in rejecting this defense with respect to fichas negras and madrigal.
bppr also argues that it had an implied license from to perform aló quien llama,fichas negras,madrigal,and mi dolor es mio in the christmas concert because it had signed license agreements with for the mechanical and synchronization licenses for these songs,and had prepared the performance licenses for the songs use in the christmas concert.bppr argues that even though the parties never signed these licenses,it is clear from lamco actions that it had authorized bppr to use the songs in the christmas concert.bppr points to the fact that brought a breach of contract claim in its countersuit for failure by bppr to pay for the songs used in the concert.
the jury considered bppr argument,and we find its conclusion that bppr actions constituted copyright infringement of fichas negras and madrigal to be reasonable,regardless of whether it found that bppr did not have licenses to perform the songs either because the licenses had not been conferred or because bppr had not made the proper payments pursuant to conferred licenses.
bppr challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings 
bppr argues that the district court erred by twice denying it the opportunity to introduce certain evidence.our review is for abuse of discretion.see palmer champion,cir.in conducting that review,this court defer s to the district court judgment so long as the record evinces an adequate reason for the denial.id.quoting aponte torres of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
first,bppr argues that the district court committed reversible error by refusing to admit into evidence a series of judgments entered against,in which various courts had held that did not have the rights or exclusive rights to various compositions within certain time frames.see,archdiocese of san juan,brown latin am.music,cir venegas hernández,peer int l latin am.music,d.however,none of the judgments cited by bppr concerns any of the four songs at issue in the jury trial.the district court found that mentioning these rulings by name and in detail could give the jury a misimpression of the evidence before it.there was no abuse of discretion.see.
second,bppr argues that the district court erred in excluding newly discovered evidence consisting of documents and testimony bppr alleges reveal that johnny rodriguez,composer of fichas negras,conferred all rights and royalties in that composition to the university of puerto rico upon his death 
bppr argued that knew about this evidence all along and failed to disclose it during the course of discovery under.on appeal,bppr points to the fact that has conceded in its brief before this court that it had evidence of rodriguez will which it did not disclose in discovery.in its brief at page,states of the will and testament such evidence had been previously provided to,thus available.
however,there was no error.bppr asked to introduce the evidence on july,seven days into the jury trial and nine years into the litigation.among the district court concerns with admitting the evidence so late in the litigation were that would then have every right to seek additional discovery into the will,and the court would have to examine puerto rico probate law or testament law in depth,and there is no telling how long that should take.the court also noted there might be a need to hear from other witnesses,including from the university of puerto rico.after reviewing bppr documents concerning the will,the district court ruled against bppr,finding that the evidence would unduly delay the trial.
the fact that bppr had nine years to find the evidence of johnny rodriguez will,the fact that it came from a witness,richard viera cintron,who testified at trial,but who could have been questioned on the matter well before that point,and the fact that the district court was concerned that the new evidence would result in the need for significant new discovery when the parties were already halfway through the jury trial,all more than justify the court decision to disallow the new evidence.
and gvli dispute over genesis 
appeals the district court july,decisions from the bench trial that gvli owned genesis between and december,and that accordingly infringed gvli rights by retroactively licensing the performance rights to that song between and.also appeals the court award of damages.gvli defends both rulings.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,walsh walsh,cir,its factual conclusions for clear error,and its damages award for abuse of discretion,lawton nyman,cir.
first,lamco argues that gvli claim was precluded based on the district court ruling in venegas hernandez peer,wl,at may,aff in part,rev in part,venegas hernández,that there was no evidence that bppr actually performed genesis before.in that case,the district court held that by granting bppr retroactive mechanical and synchronization licenses for the work genesis,had infringed gvli copyrights in that song,but that because there was no evidence in the record that bppr had actually performed genesis before,lamco mere authorization of the performance rights of that song did not result in liability for infringement.id.at.
in this case,the parties stipulated to the fact that the work genesis had in fact been performed by bppr in the christmas concert.bppr,wl,at.as a result,authorization of the performance of that song under the retroactive license agreement,under these new facts,supports the district court finding of liability for copyright infringement 
next argues that gvli failed to produce any evidence of damages at the bench trial,and thus the district court a
