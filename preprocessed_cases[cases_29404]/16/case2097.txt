background 
on december,the defendant,utility workers union of america,local union,filed a grievance on behalf of its members and retirees against the plaintiffs,cleveland electric illuminating company,firstenergy nuclear operating company,and firstenergy generation corporation collectively cleveland electric,alleging that cleveland electric decision to make changes in health benefits was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement cba.the grievance states the company unilaterally and without bargaining changed the health care provisions and providers including but not limited to preferred provider organizations,prescription coverage,traditional plans,and health maintenance organizations for both active and retired members.the complaint proceeded through the cba grievance steps to arbitration with cleveland electric contending all along the way that the union grievance was not arbitrable with respect to the retirees because they were not employees covered by the cba.
the parties submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator for his consideration,and he determined that the union was not required to represent the retirees or to bargain on their behalf because the retirees were not members of the union but,since the union and cleveland electric agreed to include retirees benefits in the cba,the union had standing to seek arbitration on behalf of the retirees for benefits that were included in the cba.importantly,at arbitration,cleveland electric did not argue that the arbitrator had no authority to decide the issue of arbitrability.rather,cleveland electric argument focused solely on the arbitrability of the retirees health benefits.
thereafter,pursuant to of the labor management relations act,cleveland electric filed a complaint in federal court seeking to have the arbitrator decision vacated.cleveland electric claimed that the arbitrator ruling did not derive its essence from the cba and was contrary to the cba express terms.further,in its brief to the district court,cleveland electric questioned for the first time whether the arbitrator had authority to determine the arbitrability question.the district court found that the parties submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator without reservation and that cleveland electric thereby waived its right to have the issue decided by the court.on the issue of whether the retirees dispute over the changes in their health care provisions was arbitrable,the district court upheld the arbitrator decision that the union could represent the retirees in arbitration,but disagreed with the arbitrator determination that the retirees consent was not necessary unless evidence submitted in arbitration demonstrated otherwise.the district court found that the retirees,unlike the active employees,had individual contractual rights and that they could not be forced to arbitrate their grievance.the district court held that the retirees must consent to the union representation.
in its appeal,cleveland electric argues that the district court erred in finding that cleveland electric waived its right to have the court decide the issue of arbitrability and in upholding the arbitrator decision on arbitrability.the union appeals the portion of the district court opinion requiring the union to obtain the retirees consent before proceeding to arbitration over the health benefits.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court decision that confirms or refuses to vacate an arbitration decision is reviewed under the same standards as other district court decisions.this court must accept the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous,but questions of law are reviewed de novo.first options of chicago,kaplan,d ak steel united steelworkers,cir.
arbitrability of the retirees grievance 
the framework considered by the supreme court in first options is useful in separating the issues before this court.there are three issues present in this case the propriety of cleveland electric changes to the health care provisions of the cba the merits of the dispute whether the union can force cleveland electric to arbitrate the merits related to the retirees benefits and who has the authority to decide the second matter.see first options,at.only the last two issues are before this court,and the last issue will be considered first.
who has the authority to decide arbitrability 
the question of who,the court or the arbitrator,has the authority in a particular case to decide the arbitrability of a grievance determines the standard of review of the arbitrator decision.if the parties have agreed to allow the arbitrator to decide arbitrability,the district court should give considerable leeway to the arbitrator,setting aside his or her decision only in certain narrow circumstances.id.at.on the other hand,if the parties did not agree to submit the arbitrability question to the arbitrator,then the district court conducts an independent review.id.
cleveland electric raised the issue of who should decide arbitrability for the first time in its brief to the district court.it argued that the arbitrator had no authority to determine arbitrability of the retirees grievance and,therefore,that his decision is void ab initio.citing cases from the supreme court and this court,cleveland electric asserts that the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.see at t techs.commc ns workers,d reaffirming the principle that the court is to determine whether or not the company was bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbitrate,on the basis of the parties contract see also armco employees indep.fed ak steel,cir finding that courts determine substantive arbitrability.
the union did not address this issue in the district court because it had not been raised before,and its brief was filed the same day as cleveland electric brief.in its brief to this court,the union agrees with the general statement of the law set out above but argues that the district court was correct in its conclusion that the parties clearly and unmistakably consented to the arbitrator jurisdiction on the issue and waived the right to have the issue decided by the court.
in at t technologies,the supreme court referenced the steelworkers trilogy,a series of cases decided in and reiterated four principles for which these cases stand,one of which is that the question of arbitrability of a particular dispute is a matter for judicial determination.at t,at.in this circuit,however,although a court is usually the proper venue for decisions about arbitrability,if the parties clearly and unmistakably submit the issue to the arbitrator without reservation,then the parties have waived their right to have a court make the decision.see vic wertz distrib.teamsters local,cir see also interstate brands chauffeurs,teamsters,warehousemen helpers local union,cir.
in interstate brands,the union filed a grievance related to the dismissal of one of its members.the company participated in the arbitration proceedings on the issue of arbitrability as well as the merits,but later complained that the issue of arbitrability was a question for the court.interstate brands,at.the court,relying on vic wertz,held that an agreement to have the arbitrator decide the issue of arbitrability will be implied where the parties did not bring the issue to the district court in the first place.id.thus,the company waived its right to have the court decide the arbitrability question by participating in the arbitration proceedings.id.
