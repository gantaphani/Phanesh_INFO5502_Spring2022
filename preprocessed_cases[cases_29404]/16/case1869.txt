the plaintiffs in this class action case,john stirman and beth blakemore hunter,allege that defendant exxon corporation breached its lease obligations to them and to a class of similarly situated individuals by violating an implied covenant to market the natural gas and natural gas liquids collectively,natural gas that were the subject of the leases.exxon allegedly did so by transferring the natural gas within its own divisions at a lower price than the price realized in third party sales,causing the royalty owners to receive lower royalty payments.the plaintiffs moved for class certification and the district court twice denied their motions,but in its second order called for an evidentiary hearing on the matter.after the hearing,the district court certified a class consisting of 
all private persons and private entities who own or owned royalty interests under leases located in the continental united states,
where exxon corporation is the lessee,
the leases provide for payment of royalties on natural gas production on an amount proceeds basis or a market price basis,and 
from which exxon corporation has produced natural gas including natural gas liquids that was directly or indirectly sold or transferred to exxon corporation or within exxon corporation,
during the time period july,through the present the class.
exxon filed a petition for permission to appeal,which we granted.we hold that the district court failed adequately to examine whether the plaintiffs met all the requirements for class certification under federal rule of civil procedure rule.we reverse the certification order and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
plaintiffs stirman and hunter are residents of colorado.stirman is apparently not a member of the class,although his name is still on the caption of this case hunter is a royalty interest owner under a natural gas leasehold owned operated by exxon.this suit was filed on july.the suit was brought under diversity jurisdiction,and alleged breach of contract and unjust enrichment,and sought an accounting.the plaintiffs allege that exxon breached an implied covenant to market diligently the natural gas that is the subject of their leaseholds and to obtain the highest price reasonably possible.exxon allegedly did so by transferring the gas purchased from the plaintiffs within exxon at lower prices than those it received in third party sales.the plaintiffs also allege that exxon lists unreasonable and excessive charges and costs in its books,leading to undervaluation of the gas and unreasonably low royalties.the plaintiffs sought to certify a class of all current and former owners of royalty interests on exxon natural gas leases where any subsidiary,affiliate,or division of exxon markets or purchases the natural gas.the putative class included royalty interest owners in alabama,arkansas,california,colorado,florida,kansas,louisiana,mississippi,montana,new mexico,north dakota,oklahoma,texas,utah,and wyoming.
hunter royalty interests arise from three separate leases,a royalty contract,and a division order.her port city tract mineral lease provides for royalty payments based on market value for gas sold or used off the premises,but for royalty payments based on the amount realized from the sale of gas sold at the wells.another of her leases provides for payments of gas royalties based on the reasonable market value at the wells of all gas produced or manufactured from said premises and sold or used off said premises however,the royalty contract contains a clause which the defendant expert,professor bruce kramer,testified could be held to modify any implied covenant to market 
in its initial order on february,the district court found the plaintiffs met the requirements of rule a for class certification.these requirements are 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,
there are questions of law or fact common to the class,
the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and 
the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.the parties do not dispute the first requirement,numerosity.according to the affidavit of john rockwell,the litigation coordinator for exxon mobil north american controller ownership group,upstream business services,exxon has over natural gas leases and unique interest owners who receive royalty working interest owner payments as to commonality,the district court stated 
plaintiffs claim that exxon mobil engaged in a course of conduct by failing to market gas in such a way as to maximize the plaintiffs returns.whether or not this conduct satisfied the reasonably prudent operator standard is,as plaintiffs argue,a common issue of fact and law.the court finds that commonality has been satisfied.
stirman exxon,no,order at february,order.although the putative class members had different types of leases,the district court found that this did not destroy typicality,as all the asserted claims would consist of the same basic legal elements subject to a finding that state law variations did not make class certification infeasible.id.at.the court determined that counsel was qualified to represent the class,but did not address whether hunter and stirman were themselves adequate class representatives.id.at.the court discussion of each of these factors was brief.
additionally,in order to maintain an action as a class action,the plaintiffs must qualify under one of the three prongs of federal rule of civil procedure b.the plaintiffs sought to certify the class under b,which requires that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.the court found that variations in individual leases and in applicable statutes of limitation did not destroy commonality.however,the court found that differences in the applicable law of the fifteen different states where leases were held,as well as difficulties in identifying individual class members and determining whether a breach occurred in each case,could present problems.accordingly,the court did not yet find that common issues predominated,but instead ordered more discovery on these issues.id.at.the district court did not address superiority.
after additional discovery,the plaintiffs again moved for class certification.in its february,order,the district court did not certify the class,but called for an evidentiary hearing on whether class certification was appropriate given the different state laws that could apply.in its order,the district court stated that 
there is little serious question that an implied covenant to market exists throughout the jurisdictions at issue,unless the lease in issue expressly precludes that conclusion.in addition,there seems to be a consensus in the law that the standard to be applied in determining whether such a covenant has been breached is the reasonably prudent operator standard.
stirman exxon,no,order at february,order.however,the court noted that it had not reached a final determination on these issues.further,the court listed nine considerations raised by the defendant that it found to be of concern and to require an evidentiary hearing before resolution 
at the evidentiary hearing,the plaintiffs offered the expert testimony of john tysseling,an economist familiar with the natural gas industry.he testified that royalties are often calculated on the basis of a field price index,which is an index of the value of the gas measured at a point in the field near the wellhead,and that this was how the price of the plaintiffs gas was calculated.he added that this most likely does not represent the best price reasonably available.further,he did not believe that there would be a need to analyze market value in each individual transaction,because exxon own computerized records would demonstrate the price it paid for gas in transactions,which would represent a fair market value for the gas.he did admit that particularized facts and circumstances,including different geographic locations,might lead to different market valuations.he also admitted that if state laws differed on whether exxon could deduct the costs of making gas marketable from royalty payments,this would affect the price upon which royalties are calculated.he stated that the computer records should be able to identify sales of gas to exxon affiliates,and would keep track of royalty transactions.
they also offered the legal analysis of professor jacqueline weaver,professor of oil and gas law at the university of houston she argued that all oil and gas lessors are subject to the reasonably prudent operator standard,and that in very few cases do lessees attempt to lessen the burden of this standard by express lease provisions.she also pointed to cases stating that an implied covenant to market exists in both market value and proceeds leases,and this includes the duty to obtain the best current price reasonably available.weaver also cited statutes from eight of the states involved,which state that division orders can not override an oil and gas lease,and noted that the howard williams and charles meyers oil and gas law treatise concurred.the plaintiffs also pointed to a law review article by professor kramer which notes that a lessee has a duty to secure the highest price obtainable for the gas being marketed.
the defendants called professor kramer,the revisor and editor of the williams and meyers treatise since,as an expert witness.contrary to professor weaver arguments,he stated that the division order statutes were not uniform.some do not address the impact of a division order on an oil and gas lease,and therefore the common law of the jurisdiction in question would control the matter,which is often not clear.some division order statutes do not make it clear if they are retroactive or not.he testified that the reasonably prudent operator standard applies differently to different areas of operation of the lease,and that different jurisdictions use different standards in defining this term.further,he stated that the highest court of each state has not made clear that an implied covenant to market even exists in each state.he testified that many factors go into calculating market value,including geographic area,volume of gas,quality of gas,point in time,and competition in the market,and that market value can differ based on all of these.
on may,the district court issued an order certifying a class in this case.the court implicitly found that there is an implied covenant to market gas in a gas lease in each of the relevant states.it further found that differences among the jurisdictions as to whether an implied covenant to market was implied in fact or implied in law are irrelevant,because what is at issue here is whether exxon violated the implied covenant to market.stirman exxon,no,may,order at may,order.further,although it would be burdensome to determine if individual leases have express clauses negating the implied covenant to market,the district court found that,with the assistance of a special master,this is not an insurmountable challenge.id.the court found that there is no serious question that the reasonably prudent operator standard applies to the implied covenant to market in all the applicable states,and that parties do not ordinarily draft express provisions to avoid this standard.id.at.according to the court,the statutes in all the jurisdictions at issue are uniform in the effect that a division order does not alter the terms of a gas lease,and that to the extent of any variance between a lease and a division order,the lease prevails.id.the court found that notice and demand were not a prerequisite to an action to recover damages for breach of covenant.id.at.further,market value could be determined from exxon records of sales to third parties,which ordinarily occur in large aggregated packages of gas.id.although there might be some individual sales at the wellhead,the court felt these would not be so numerous as to prevent class certification.id.the court therefore found that common legal and factual issues would predominate,and certified the class.

we first consider the district court analysis of the frcp a requirements.the parties do not dispute that numerosity is met,satisfying frcp a.exxon argues that there are not common questions of law or fact,as required by a.we address this contention in our discussion in part iii of whether common issues of law or fact predominate.
exxon also argues that hunter claims are not typical of the claims of the class,as required by a.we have stated that 
the test for typicality is not demanding.it focuses on the similarity between the named plaintiffs legal and remedial theories and the theories of those whom they purport to represent.typicality does not require a complete identity of claims.rather,the critical inquiry is whether the class representative claims have the same essential characteristics of those of the putative class.if the claims arise from a similar course of conduct and share the same legal theory,factual differences will not defeat typicality.
james city of dallas,cir citations and quotation marks omitted,petition for cert.filed.the plaintiffs allege that exxon engaged in a similar course of conduct with respect to each of them,the underpayment of royalties based on breach of an implied duty to market.hunter royalty agreements provide for payments based on both market value and actual proceeds bases.the texas supreme court has recently held that there is no implied covenant to market in market value leases,as these have their own express covenant,though there is such an implied covenant in proceeds leases.see yzaguirre kcs resources.therefore,in a class action based on alleged breach of an implied covenant to market,there can not be typicality where there are both and proceeds leases included in the class,at least under texas law other states take different views of the implied covenant to market,and some have not addressed whether such a covenant exists see part iii.plaintiffs seem to rely on the fact that hunter,owning both and leaseholds,is typical of the class.but the test is whether her claims are typical,not whether she is.given the differences among the state laws,it can not be said that hunter claims are typical of the class as it is currently defined,that is,to include all leases.
