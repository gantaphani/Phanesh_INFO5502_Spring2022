in,fantastic sams regional owners association fsro filed a demand for arbitration against fantastic sams franchise corporation fsfc with the american arbitration association aaa.fsro demand,made on behalf of its members,who are franchisees of fantastic sams and who have individual license agreements with fsfc,alleged that fsfc had breached those license agreements.fsfc then filed a petition in federal district court pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa,to stay fsro arbitration and to compel fsro members to arbitrate their claims with fsfc on an individual basis.
the district court allowed fsfc petition as to some of the license agreements at issue,based on the terms of those agreements,and that decision is not at issue in this appeal.fantastic sams franchise fsro ass n,d.however,it denied relief as to ten other agreements,which contained different language fsfc appeals this denial.we affirm the judgment of the district court allowing these claims to proceed to arbitration.we leave to the arbitrators the issue of whether fsro may compel arbitration under the terms of the agreements at issue,or whether its members must proceed individually.
fsfc is the franchisor of the nationwide chain of hair salons known as fantastic sams.fsfc licenses the rights to its brand to regional owners,who are organized into designated geographic regions and who license and manage over individual salons.in return for the exclusive right to conduct business under the fantastic sams brand,the regional owners,among other things,pay fsfc a fee of fifteen percent of any amount collected in royalties from their individual salons plus a weekly advertising fee.
the regional owners have entered into regional license agreements with fsfc all agreements provide for resolution of disputes via arbitration.the terms of the arbitration clauses vary somewhat among the license agreements,but for purposes of this case they may be grouped into two categories.of the agreements expressly prohibit class arbitration in the following or similar terms any arbitration between fsfc and the regional licensee shall be of regional licensee individual claim only and n o arbitration shall be conducted on a basis.these agreements were executed at various dates after.
in contrast,the remaining ten agreements,which were executed at various dates before,do not contain any express prohibitions on class or collective arbitration.beyond this,they set out in broad terms the matters as to which arbitration is required any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this agreement or with regard to its formation,interpretation or breach shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.
the regional owners also formed the corporation fsro,the appellee here,for the purpose of promoting their business interests.the owners comprise the exclusive membership of fsro,and each member is party to at least one regional license agreement with fsfc.
invoking the provisions for arbitration in the regional license agreements,on july,fsro filed a demand for arbitration against fsfc seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of its members both for breach of contract and related violations of the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.fsro alleged that fsfc had engaged in a pattern of conduct designed to depress the price of regional owners businesses by making it impossible or impractical to offer or sell such regions on the open market and thus was in breach of the regional license agreements.
on august,fsfc filed a petition pursuant to section of the faa,in federal district court seeking both to stay fsro demand for arbitration and to compel fsro members to arbitrate their claims individually.fsfc argued that the express prohibitions on arbitration in of the regional license agreements at issue barred fsro from seeking to represent its members in arbitration under those agreements.
although the remaining ten agreements are devoid of similar arbitration prohibitions,fsfc argued that fsro arbitration as to these ten was foreclosed under the supreme court decision on class arbitration in stolt nielsen animalfeeds international,d.that decision,fsfc contended,holds as a matter of law that no class or collective arbitration may proceed unless the arbitration agreement expressly authorizes those forms of proceedings.because the ten agreements here do not contain such express consent to arbitration by an association,fsfc argued,fsro representative action must be barred.
in its september,response in opposition,fsro argued that fsfc had misread stolt nielsen,that the decision does not require the express consent posited by fsfc,and that,in any event,neither stolt nielsen nor the prohibitions on arbitration contained in some of the agreements applies to bar associational arbitration,which,fsro argued,is different in kind from class arbitration.fsro also urged the court to send the dispute to be decided by the arbitrators.
as said,the district court granted fsfc petition as to the agreements expressly barring class arbitration,finding that the requirements in those agreements that arbitration be of a licensee individual claim only,foreclosed fsro action.fantastic sams franchise,d at.fsro does not appeal this decision.
the court denied fsfc petition as to the remaining ten agreements,on the grounds that t he arbitration clause in those contracts is very broad and applies,without qualification,to all controversies or claims arising from or related to the contract,including issues of interpretation and breach,and that the contracts incorporate by reference the rules of the aaa,which,in turn,provide that the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.id.the court concluded that whether the agreements preclude fsro action is a matter of contract interpretation which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.id.
we review the district court order denying fsfc petition to stay arbitration and compel individual arbitrations de novo as it presents a pure question of law.powershare,syntel,cir.we may affirm the district court order on any ground manifest in the record.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.
as an initial matter,fsfc argues on appeal that because the agreements at issue do not expressly permit fsro associational action,under the supreme court decision in stolt nielsen,the action is prohibited outright.
fsfc reads stolt nielsen too broadly.the court granted certiorari in that case to decide whether imposing class arbitration on parties whose arbitration clauses are silent on that issue is consistent with the faa.at.the court held that an arbitration panel had exceeded its powers,id.at,under the faa,state,and federal law,when it elected to follow its own policy preferences and permit class arbitration to go forward where the parties to an arbitration agreement had reached no agreement on that subject,id.at.
the parties in stolt nielsen stipulated that their agreement was unambiguously silent on class arbitration,not merely in the sense that the agreement made no express reference to class arbitration,but because they had not reached any agreement on the issue.id.at.although it acknowledged this silence,the arbitration panel nonetheless concluded that class arbitration should be permitted for a variety of reasons.id.at.the panel stayed the arbitration to allow the parties to seek judicial review of its decision.id.at.on review,the supreme court reversed.
the court held that class arbitration may not be imposed on a party to an arbitration agreement unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to submit to class arbitration.id.at first emphasis added.the court found no such contractual basis present on the facts before it.although the arbitration panel had considered the language,context,and usage of the agreement in that case,the court held that these considerations were beside the point in a case in which the parties were in complete
