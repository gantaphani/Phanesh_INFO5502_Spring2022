background 
in july,lumbermens sold an insurance administration business pursuant to a written purchase agreement the agreement.no cash was exchanged at the time of the closing.instead,the purchase price was to be based on a series of annual earnout and lump sum payments to be made by broadspire over the four years following the transaction,which the parties defined as the earnout period.earnout payments would be based on the financial performance of the purchased business each year during the earnout period.lump sum payments would be made if broadspire sold off any parts of the purchased company during the earnout period,based on an estimate of the expected performance of the sold asset over the remainder of the four years.
article iii of the agreement,titled purchase price,set forth the methodology and procedures for determining the amount of the payments due each year.broadspire had to calculate the amounts owed pursuant to a formula set forth in the agreement,and prepare and deliver reports to lumbermens setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations and assumptions on which its determinations were based.see generally agreement.upon receiving a report from broadspire,lumbermens had days to review it,during which time broadspire had to make available to lumbermens any books and records relevant to the review.if lumbermens decided that it agreed with broadspire determination,it would send an acceptance notice so indicating,or do nothing at all,and the amount broadspire had set forth would become the binding payment amount for that year.but if lumbermens disagreed with broadspire determination,it had to send broadspire a disagreement notice saying so within the period.a disagreement notice has to set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement and lumbermens determination of the payment required to be paid to lumbermens under this section.agreement g.
a.the purchase price dispute arbitration clause 
if lumbermens submitted a timely disagreement notice to broadspire indicating disagreement with a given earnout or lump sum report,the parties first had days to try and resolve the differences themselves.failing that,the dispute would be submitted to an accounting or appraisal firm for arbitration 
purchase price disputes.if a party delivers a disagreement notice to the other party in a timely manner,then buyer and seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within days from the date of such notice.if buyer and seller can not reach agreement then the dispute shall be promptly referred to an independent accounting or appraisal firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to buyer and seller,or if the parties are unable to agree on such a firm within days to pricewaterhousecoopers llp the firm for binding resolution.the firm may conduct such proceedings as the firm,in its sole discretion,determines will assist in resolving the dispute and shall,within days deliver a written report setting forth its determination of all disputed amounts and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the parties.
b.the general arbitration clause 
in addition to the arbitration procedure intended specifically for article iii price disputes,the agreement also contains a arbitration provision for all other disputes.it provides 
dispute resolution.except as otherwise provided for in article iii,the following shall constitute the exclusive procedures and remedies for all disputes arising out of or relating to this agreement.

c.the four purchase price disputes 
the full history of the transaction and dispute between the parties is somewhat complex,but all of those details are not necessary to resolve question before us.at issue here are disputes over four price lump sum reports dated december,march,and october,and one earnout report dated june,broadspire provided to lumbermens under the process and lumbermens then timely disputed.on each occasion,lumbermens sent a disagreement notice regarding broadspire price determination each was relatively general.broadspire disputed the sufficiency of the disagreement notices,arguing that they did not meet g requirement that they contain reasonable detail and lumbermens alternative determination of the payment required.lumbermens claimed that it could not provide the requisite level of detail called for by g,because broadspire price reports were themselves lacking in details that would enable lumbermens to do so.lumbermens also claimed in its disagreement notices that it had not been given sufficient access to the books and records necessary to properly evaluate broadspire determinations.
lumbermens sought arbitration of each of these four disputes under the purchase price dispute procedures set forth in of the agreement,but broadspire refused to arbitrate on the basis that lumbermens had not met the precondition of filing adequate disagreement notices.instead,broadspire sought to commence pan el arbitration of the disputes under the more general procedures.eventually,on january,lumbermens filed a petition in aid of arbitration in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,seeking to compel arbitration under the provision and to compel broadspire to produce certain documents and information to which it had not given lumbermens access.
the district court ruled in favor of lumbermens.with regard to which arbitration clause governed the dispute,or the broader,the district judge concluded that lumbermens is clearly right and that the article iii purchase price dispute procedure applied.the court concluded that the question of whether lumbermens disagreement notices were adequate was certainly within the purview of the arbitrator and that the question was one that was peculiarly within the competence of an firm.the district judge ordered the parties to arbitrate the disputes under the procedures,and to each submit within ten days of his ruling the names of two potential accounting or appraisal firms to act as arbitrator to replace pricewaterhousecoopers,which was already acting as an arbitrator in an unrelated article iii price dispute arbitration the court also ordered broadspire to produce certain documents.broadspire appealed.
ii.analysis 
the question before us is whether a court or an arbitrator should decide the question of whether the parties disputes are arbitrable under of the agreement.broadspire contends that lumbermens did not file valid disagreement notices and has thus failed to satisfy a necessary precondition to bringing the dispute within the scope of arbitration,and that a court,
