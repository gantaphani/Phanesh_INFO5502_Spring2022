the doctrine of surety has several defenses by which the surety may avoid liability on the contracted payment bond.has relied upon one of these defenses in arguing that by signing the checks presented by grooms,mcwane extended the time of payment by grooms without consent,thus discharging the surety obligation.
the district court agreed with argument that mcwane impaired fidelity suretyship status by unilaterally negotiating the highland checks back to grooms,without fidelity consent,and thereby intentionally forfeiting its right to be paid for its materials from the proceeds of the four checks.the district court concluded,ohio courts would hold that plaintiff impaired its suretyship status by endorsing the checks presented by grooms without taking steps to secure payment from grooms for the materials plaintiff had supplied so as to relieve fidelity of liability to plaintiff under the payment bond.

the ohio courts have recognized that an agreement between the creditor and principal that extends the time for performance will not discharge the surety absent a concrete showing of prejudice.water works,wl at.as the ohio court of appeals noted in reversing the lower court decision in water works,an adequate showing of prejudice may arise where the principal could have paid the debt by forwarding to the claimant its share of a payment received from the owner,had the claimant not given the principal an opportunity to misapply or dissipate those funds by agreeing to an extension.id.
in the instant case,has claimed that by endorsing the joint checks,mcwane improperly granted grooms an extension of time for payment.in response,mcwane has argued persuasively that expressly waived any defense based upon an extension of time in the waiver clause of the bond.
