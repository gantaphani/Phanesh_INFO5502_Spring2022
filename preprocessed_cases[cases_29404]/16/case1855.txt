state farm fire and casualty company state farm,proceeding pursuant to an assignment of claims from one calvin hotard,appeals the district court summary dismissal of travelers indemnity company travelers from the case,contending that the motorist um coverage waivers in the travelers insurance policy are invalid.agreeing with the district court conclusion that the travelers um coverage waivers are valid,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
calvin hotard sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident.he sued the driver of the other vehicle,who admitted total fault for the accident.hotard was paid the policy limit of by the tortfeasor insurer,as well as his own vehicle liability insurance policy um limit of by his insurer,state farm.in addition to his basic motor vehicle liability policy,hotard had in um coverage under his umbrella policy that also was issued by state farm.
the car that hotard was driving at the time of the accident was not his own,but was one owned by his employer,jefferson parish the parish.the parish maintained a policy issued by travelers that provided both commercial automobile insurance and excess automobile liability indemnity which,in combination,covered the vehicle driven by hotard for up to the parish had purported to reject um coverage for its vehicles by marking a box on each of two um coverage waiver forms,which were integral parts of travelers policy,one form for the basic coverage and the other form for the excess coverage.the validity of the parish rejection of um coverage is the central issue of this case,and it turns on the legal sufficiency of the um waiver forms provided to the parish by travelers and used by the parish in its effort to reject um coverage.
hotard filed a claim for damages against his insurer,state farm,in louisiana state court after state farm denied um coverage under its umbrella policy.state farm removed the case to district court based on diversity of citizenship.in its answer to hotard complaint,state farm asserted an affirmative defense that the parish waivers of um coverage under the travelers policy were invalid.therefore,argued state farm,travelers was obligated to provide um coverage and,as the insurer of the vehicle in question,travelers had primary responsibility to pay um coverage to hotard.
in response,hotard amended his complaint to add travelers as a defendant.he then moved for summary judgment against state farm,seeking a declaration that the um waivers in the travelers policy were valid,leaving state farm as the insurer with um coverage responsibility to him.the district court granted hotard motion,ruling that the parish um rejections in the travelers policy were valid and that state farm was responsible for hotard um claim.
a few months later,in november,travelers filed a summary judgment motion seeking a declaration that,because there were no longer any fact issues relating to it,travelers should be dismissed from the case.the district court granted that motion,dismissing with prejudice all of hotard claims against travelers.it then moved for entry of judgment pursuant to rule b,asking the district court to certify as final its summary judgment of dismissal,but the district court denied this motion.
the trial of hotard suit against state farm was scheduled to commence at the end of january,but the parties settled before trial,and the settlement was approved by the district court.pursuant to the settlement,hotard assigned to state farm any rights that he might have to proceed against travelers on the issue of um coverage.in may,state farm filed a motion to have all the orders entered by the district court relating to the issue of travelers um coverage certified as final judgments under rule b or,in the alternative,under b,to permit an immediate appeal of those orders.the district court granted state farm motion and certified the orders as final judgments under rule b.having thus decided,the court declined to address state farm alternative b motion.the next day,state farm filed its notice of appeal.
analysisa.standard of review 
although a district court may not deem as final that which is not final,certifications of judgments as final pursuant to rule b are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion the underlying motions regarding travelers um coverage and the dismissal of travelers from the case were summary judgment motions,which we review de novo a motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact an issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action in deciding whether a fact issue has been created,we must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party 
the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for judgment as a matter of law thus,we must review all of the evidence in the record but make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence in reviewing the evidence,we must disregard everything favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,and should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmoving party as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached 
the issue underlying the summary judgment in this case is the correctness of the district court application of louisiana insurance law to the determine the validity of traveler um coverage waiver forms.this presents a question of law,which we review de novo,employing the principles of louisiana insurance contract construction 
timeliness of state farm appeal 
as a threshold matter,travelers contends that state farm notice of appeal,filed on may,violates the time limit set by fed.a a travelers notes that it was dismissed as a party in november,leaving hotard and state farm as the only remaining parties to the litigation.when state farm and hotard entered into a settlement agreement in january,all issues of liability between the relevant parties were resolved.consequently,reasons travelers,the time period expired well before may,when state farm first and only notice of appeal was filed.
state farm counters by noting that the orders herein appealed were not deemed final until may,only one day before state farm filed this appeal,when the district court certified them as such under rule b.state farm argues that the settlement agreement between it and hotard did not render past judgments from the district court final retroactively.we agree with state farm as the therefore in this case was not entered until may,state farm notice of appeal was timely filed.
hotard assignment of rights to state farm 
travelers contends that state farm can not maintain this litigation against travelers because state farm only basis for proceeding against travelers is hotard assignment of claims to state farm.even though hotard was the party who had added travelers as a defendant,he argued on numerous occasions that the parish um waivers were valid as to travelers,so that state farm was the party solely liable for his damages.relying on the fact that hotard advanced this position throughout the litigation,travelers asserts that,as hotard subrogee,state farm can not now advance an argument wholly inconsistent with its subrogor prior consistent position in the litigation,namely,that travelers um hotard repeatedly insisted were invalid.in other words,travelers contends that hotard subrogation can not place state farm in a better position than was hotard at the moment of the subrogation and had subrogation not occurred,hotard could not have argued that travelers um waivers were invalid,a direct contradiction of his previous position.
in response,state farm argues that it is entitled to appeal the dismissal of travelers even if so doing advances a position inconsistent with hotard prior arguments.state farm offers two supporting reasons hotard is the one who impleaded travelers as a defendant and hotard filed a motion opposing the dismissal of travelers from the case 
travelers position in this regard,although not articulated in its brief as such,rings of res judicata or judicial estoppel.under general principles of judicial estoppel,a par
