opinion of the court 
we deal with a question of pennsylvania a third party here,an auditor colludes with agents to defraud their principal,do we impute to the principal the agents misconduct and,if so,does that preclude recovery by another standing in the principal place with the benefit of a clarifying opinion from the supreme court of pennsylvania,we now hold that pennsylvania law requires an inquiry into whether the third party dealt with the principal in good faith.because the district court did not have the benefit of this clarifying opinion and did not conduct such an inquiry,we remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural background 
a.the debtor growth 
the debtor is the allegheny health,education,and research foundation aherf,a pennsylvania corporation that,prior to its liquidation,provided a wide range of healthcare services,including operating hundreds of physicians practices,hospitals,and two medical schools.
from the,aherf,under the leadership of ceo sherif abdelhak,tried to build a integrated delivery system through an aggressive program of acquisitions.according to the theory,a health system could make money by building a network of hospitals,physician practices,and medical schools.the schools would staff the hospitals with residents the physician practices would,through referrals,provide the hospitals with patients and the hospitals would bring in substantial net income through the provision of specialty care.industry publications and news articles from the discussing the model indicate that it was,at least for a time,the business model du jour for large healthcare providers 
aherf pursued the model by acquiring hospitals and physician practices.when acquired,these entities generally were losing money.the hospitals,some thought,could be rehabilitated through better management,operational efficiencies,price reductions from mass contracts with vendors,and other economies of scale.the physician practices,on the other hand,would perform better,but would primarily serve as loss leaders to generate patients for the hospitals specialist care.
aherf implementation of the model failed.by,the company was suffering substantial operating losses.cost savings and efficiency gains were not being realized,and cash was running out.
pwc and audits of aherf 
aherf had for some time employed the services of coopers and lybrand,now pricewaterhousecoopers,llp pwc,to audit its financial statements.specifically,pwc was engaged to provide an opinion on aherf financial statements to its board of trustees.pwc could either provide a clean opinion,which would indicate that the statements were accurate and complied with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and generally accepted auditing standards gaas,or an adverse opinion,which would identify deficiencies in the statements.
a group of aherf officers,led by david mcconnell aherf chief financial officer and operating with abdelhak approval,is alleged to have knowingly misstated aherf finances in the figures they provided pwc for the audit of aherf.these misstatements were designed to conceal how precarious aherf financial position was,and to make it look as though the model was beginning to pay dividends in the form of cost savings and increased net income.as alleged by the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee,standing in the shoes of aherf,pwc audit should have brought these misstatements to light,but,rather than issuing an adverse opinion as gaap and gaas required,pwc knowingly assisted in the officers misconduct by issuing a clean opinion.according to the committee,the officers and pwc repeated this misconduct in.
the result of these misdeeds,according to the committee,was that the aherf board was under the false impression that the company was in relatively good financial shape.thus,the board did not intervene in management business strategy,and instead allowed abdelhak to continue making acquisitions.
bankruptcy 
by the spring of,abdelhak and mcconnell were unable to prevent board members from perceiving that aherf financial position was dire.suppliers began complaining directly to board members about not being paid,and doctors threatened to quit over allegheny general hospital lack of resources.as aherf financial condition leaked out,board members became less confident in abdelhak leadership,and in early june they removed him as president and ceo.they also removed mcconnell as cfo.soon thereafter,they terminated pwc and issued warnings that their financial statements were not reliable.
aherf corrective measures came too late,and in july it filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
d.this action 
in this adversary proceeding,the committee,on behalf of aherf,asserted three causes of action against pwc breach of contract,professional negligence,and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.pwc moved for summary judgment on numerous grounds.
on january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pwc.official comm.of unsecured creditors of allegheny health,educ.research found.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp allegheny i,wl.although pwc asserted seven arguments in favor of granting summary judgment to it,the district court granted it on the sole ground that aherf was in pari with pwc,and thus the committee could not recover.put another way,the court found that the wrongdoing of aherf senior management must be imputed to aherf,and that the doctrine of in pari delicto applies to bar the committee claims,as aherf was at least as much at fault as pwc.id.at.
on the issue of imputation,the district court looked to our decision in lafferty,official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir,and applied a test to determine whether fraud of an officer is imputed to a corporation.it found both prongs course of employment and benefit to the corporation satisfied and imputed the officers conduct to aherf.allegheny i,wl,at.in particular,it set a low bar for benefit to the corporation the question is a relatively simple any benefit accrued to aherf.id.at emphasis in original.although it noted that there were many factual issues that are disputed,the district court determined that aherf management was acting within the scope of their employment in submitting the false financial statements and that such misconduct enabled further acquisitions that,in the short term,was a benefit to aherf.id.at.
on the issue of in pari delicto,the district court found that even though the auditor was alleged to have improperly colluded with management,the mutual fault of the corporation as a result of imputation barred its and thereby,the committee claims.id.at.the court also rejected the innocent and independent adopted by some courts to bar in pari delicto defenses in the context.id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
certification to the supreme court of pennsylvania 
although we normally resolve issues of state law without certifying questions to a state supreme court,this case includes a dimension not previously considered in the pennsylvania cases cited to us.after reading the briefs and submissions of the parties,hearing oral argument,and reviewing applicable pennsylvania law,we certified two questions to the supreme court of pennsylvania to clarify important and unresolved questions concerning the interaction between the in pari delicto doctrine and the imputation of an agent fraud to his principal under pennsylvania law.official comm.of unsecured creditors of allegheny health,educ.research found.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp allegheny ii,wl,at cir.july.
the pennsylvania supreme court unanimously answered the certified questions and returned the matter to us.official comm.of unsecured creditors of allegheny health educ.research found.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp allegheny ii.it conducted a comprehensive analysis of the certified questions,for which we are most grateful,and we proceed with the benefit of that opinion.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to b.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we exercise plenary review over an appeal from a grant of summary judgment.revell port auth.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
iii.discussion 
as we discussed in the certification request,the district court grant of summary judgment rests on two holdings.first,the court imputed to aherf its officers fraud in misstating the company finances to the corporation.second,it held that the doctrine of in pari delicto prevents aherf and thereby the committee standing in its shoes from recovering against pwc because,even were pwc in collusion with the officers,the latter were joint fraudfeasors whose conduct was imputed to aherf.however,the district court did not have the benefit of allegheny iii when it considered pennsylvania law,and it did not consider whether imputation and in pari delicto were appropriate under the supreme court of pennsylvania good faith test discussed below.in that context,this case requires further inquiry,and we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
imputation 
the first question we certified to the supreme court of pennsylvania concerned the test in pennsylvania for imputing an agent fraud to the principal.we asked 
what is the proper test under pennsylvania law for determining whether an agent fraud should be imputed to the principal when it is an allegedly that seeks to invoke the law of imputation in order to shield itself from liability 
allegheny ii,wl,at.the court answered the question as follows 
the proper test to determine the availability of defensive imputation in scenarios involving depends on whether or not the defendant dealt with the principal in good faith.while one of the primary justifications for imputation lies in the protection of innocents,in pennsylvania it may extend to scenarios involving auditor negligence,subject to an exception,as well as other limits arising out of the underlying justifications supporting imputation.imputation does not apply,however,where the defendant materially has not dealt in good faith with the principal.
allegheny iii,at.
because the underlying purpose of imputation is fair,including the affordance of appropriate protection to those who transact business with corporations,id.at,the court dr e w a sharp distinction between those who deal in good faith with the in material matters and those who do not,id.this sharp distinction led the court to reach different policy outcomes for imputation in the negligence context versus the collusion context.
for the former,the court saw two possibilities.first,a third party would generally be able to impute an agent bad acts to the principal corporation if they benefit the corporation though the court did not specify a minimum quantum of benefit.id.at.this creates incentives for the principal to select and delegate responsibility to agents carefully and responsibly.id in this manner,the court maintained the traditional,liberal test for corporate benefit.id.at.
second,a third party would not be able to impute an agent bad acts to the principal corporation if those bad acts were only in the agent and conferred benefits only to the agent,not the corporation.id.at.this is the adverse interest exception to imputation.
addressing the context,the court concluded that,to the extent that an auditor is alleged to have acted negligently in conducting the corporate audit,imputing the beneficial misconduct of corporate officers agents to the corporation may be appropriate because such a result gives appropriate recognition to the fact that it is the principal who has empowered the agent,and imputation dovetails with other defenses that may be available to a negligent auditor under prevailing pennsylvania law,in particular,those related to audit interference.id.at.
the court took pains,however,to limit the test to scenarios.it took a different approach to secretive,collusive conduct between corporate agents and third parties that was overwhelmingly adverse to the corporation even if the collusion provided a peppercorn of benefit.id.at citation omitted.in such cases,the ordinary rationale supporting imputation breaks down completely,and thus the corporation,or those in its place,may sue the corporation auditor free of that auditor claim that the misconduct of corporate officers is imputed to the corporation itself.id.at.this is because imputation rules justly operate to protect third parties on account of their reliance on an agent actual or apparent authority,but there can be no justifiable reliance on the agent authority when both the agent and the third party know very well that the agent conduct goes unsanctioned by one or more tiers of corporate governance.id.indeed,though the court parted ways with new jersey ncp decision in the negligence context it was in full agreement with its rationale as pertaining to collusive ones.id.at citing ncp litig.trust kpmg llp.
when the third party and an agent collude against the corporation,the conduct is transparently unsanctioned.furthermore,the pennsylvania supreme court rejected pwc assertion that the alleged,secretive falsification of corporate financial information by rogue officers can be regarded as a benefit to the corporation.id.at.this was because it is in the best interests of a corporation for the governing structure to have accurate or at the very least honest financial information.id.at.therefore,in settings involving auditors who have not proceeded in material good faith relative to a,the court as a matter of law decline d to consider a knowing,secretive,fraudulent misstatement of corporate financial information to be of benefit to a company.id.emphasis added.
the supreme court concluded its discussion of imputation by looking to what a reasonable third party should glean from its dealings with a corporate agent.the touchstone of the availability of an imputed defense for pwc is whether there is sufficient lack of benefit or apparent adversity such that it is fair to charge the third party pwc with notice that the agent the officer group is not acting with the principal aherf authority.id.collusion between agent and auditor makes imputation of the agent conduct to its principal unavailable because the auditor has not proceeded in material good faith,for the auditor is on notice that the will withhold material information from the principal.id.at citing restatement third of agency,cmt.c.
b.in pari delicto 
the second question we certified to the supreme court of pennsylvania concerned the availability of the in pari delicto defense to a particular scenario.we asked 
does the doctrine of in pari delicto prevent a corporation from recovering against its accountants for breach of contract,professional negligence,or aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,if those accountants conspired with officers of the corporation to misstate the corporation finances to the corporation ultimate detriment 
allegheny ii,wl,at.the court responded 
the in pari delicto defense may be available in its classic form in the setting,subject to ordinary requirements of pleading and proof including special ones related to averments of fraud where relevant,and consideration of competing policy concerns.however,imputation is unavailable relative to an auditor which has not dealt materially in good faith with the.this effectively forecloses an in pari delicto defense for scenarios involving secretive collusion between officers and auditors to misstate corporate finances to the corporation ultimate detriment.
allegheny iii,at.
the court noted that although in pari delicto has been imported from equity and recast as an defense,its origins in equity mean that it is subject to appropriate and necessary limits.id.at.even though the court was in full accord with the application of the in pari delicto defense to instances in which a corporate plaintiff can be said to be at least equally culpable relative to the subject of its lawsuit,matters of public policy are to be taken into consideration in determining the defense availability in any given set of circumstances.id.in pari delicto is not to be woodenly applied and vindicated in any and all instances,but instead may be trumped by another
