we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see ramos davis geck,cir.
victor omar portugues santana portugues wished to open a victoria secret franchise in puerto rico and sought assistance in establishing a relationship with victoria secret from defendant domingo,who was employed by defendant rekomdiv.domingo in turn recommended that portugues work with former senator birch bayh,a partner at venable,llp,to assist portugues in establishing a business relationship with victoria secret.domingo explained to portugues that bayh had successfully achieved a victoria secret franchise for the philippines,trial transcript at,portugues santana rekomdiv int l,ecf,and that victoria secret owed many favors to bayh so this was,for all purposes,a done deal,id.at.
domingo informed portugues that he must retain venable before the firm would be able to help him or assist him in getting a victoria secret franchise.domingo also made clear that portugues must hire rekomdiv,in addition to venable,in order to complete the deal.portugues testified that,during this time period,domingo repeatedly represented to him that obtaining the victoria secret franchise was a done deal.portugues also testified that he relied on domingo representations when he entered into retainer agreements with venable and rekomdiv.portugues paid a retainer fee to venable and a business broker fee to rekomdiv.in addition to the business broker fee,portugues made another payment to rekomdiv.after entering into the retainer agreement,venable sent an to portugues informing him that a victoria secret franchise was not available because victoria secret did not use a franchise or distributor model,but assuring portugues that venable would explore other ways to present portugues as a worthy business partner for victoria secret in puerto rico.app.selected tr.ex.
portugues subsequently filed suit against rekomdiv and domingo alleging that domingo false representations as to the availability of a franchise fraudulently induced him to enter into retainer agreements with venable and rekomdiv.at the same time,portugues filed suit against venable and bayh,alleging breach of contract.portugues settled with venable and bayh before the suit against the defendants went to trial.for simplicity in the remainder of this opinion,we refer to both venable and bayh as venable.at trial,the district court held that no independent mention of the settlement agreement with venable could be made by the defendants.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of portugues,finding the defendants liable for dolo and assessing damages of.the defendants filed a motion requesting judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure,a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure,and an offset of the damages award by the amount of the venable settlement the district court denied this motion.the defendants timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the defendants first argue that the district court jury instruction on the issue of dolo was unfairly prejudicial and thus warrants a new trial.dolo can take two forms dolo in the formation of contracts,and dolo in the performance of contractual obligations.see,commercial,pace membership warehouse.here,the defendants were found liable for dolo in the formation of contracts between portugues and rekomdiv and venable.dolo occurs where the w rongful representations or omissions affect the freedom of consent of one of the contracting parties.ocaso,compania de seguros y reaseguros maritime shipping.the puerto rico civil code provides that no valid contract exists without t he consent of the contracting parties,and c onsent given by deceit is void,id.see also id.
here,the district court instructed the jury that,in a civil case,a plaintiff must prove his claim by a preponderance of the evidence and any other requirements a particular claim may have.with respect to the dolo claims,the court instructed that,under puerto rico contract law,fraud that affects a contracting party is commonly referred to as dolo or deceit,and w hile the standard of proof in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence,in dolo cases the party alleging fraud has the burden of presenting evidence which is clear,solid,and convincing.the court reiterated this instruction,stating that the plaintiff has to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence,but as to the dolo claim,that preponderance of the evidence and that evidence must be clear,solid,and convincing.the defendants objected to this instruction at trial,arguing that mixing the preponderance of the evidence standard with a strong,clear,and convincing standard could confuse the jury.the court noted the objection,but concluded that,because puerto rico law is somewhat conflicting,an explanation of both standards was warranted to ensure that the jury does not go below the preponderance standard.id.
the defendants maintain that the correct standard for dolo claims is strong,clear,and convincing evidence.portugues,on the other hand,argues that the correct standard for dolo claims is preponderance of the evidence and that,if anything,the jury instruction given by the district court was too favorable to the defendants.we review claims of instructional error under a standard.united states jadlowe,cir.w e consider de novo whether an instruction embodied an error of law,but we review for abuse of discretion whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.id.quoting united states silva,cir.
although opinions of both this court and the federal district court for the district of puerto rico recite the strong,clear,and convincing standard of proof for dolo claims,we conclude that these cases relied on outdated puerto rico supreme court cases and should no longer be followed this line of outdated cases began in with texas estrada,in which the puerto rico supreme court held that a party alleging dolo could meet its burden only with evidence that is solid,clear and convincing,and unquestionable.in monclova financial credit,the puerto rico supreme court reaffirmed this standard,holding that a party alleging fraud must prove its existence with solid,clear,and convincing evidence.cases from this court and the federal district court for the district of puerto rico that recite the strong,clear,and convincing standard ultimately relied on monclova or other federal cases 
in,the puerto rico supreme court made clear that it had abandoned the solid,clear,and convincing standard recited in texas and monclova in favor of the preponderance of the evidence standard.see de jesus diaz carrero,offic.trans.in de jesus diaz,the court stated 
in carrasquillo lippitt simonpietri,and in garcia lopez mendez garcia,we abandoned the classification of solid,clear and convincing,and unquestionable evidence set forth in texas to note that the general rule that fraud is not presumed only means that the one affirming it must prove it with reasonable certainty,with preponderance of evidence that satisfies the trier conscience.in this way,the obstacle of requiring a higher degree of evidence,which served no other purpose but to give the agent of fraud a special protection other defendants do not have,was eliminated.
in cases decided after de jesus diaz,the supreme court of puerto rico has uniformly held that a preponderance of the evidence standard applies to claims of fraud.see,acosta bd.of exam rs of eng rs,fraud is never presumed,but must be established by the party alleging its existence with reasonable certainty,by preponderance of evidence gonzalez cruz quintana cortes,some time ago we abandoned the requirement of solid,clear,convincing and irrefutable evidence to prove fraud.the general rule that fraud is not assumed only m
