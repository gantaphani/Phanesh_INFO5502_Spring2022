jay industries,jay appeals from the district court judgment against it following a jury trial and the district court denial of its motions.johnson controls,jci from the district court denial of its motions.the dispute in this case arose over the price of packaging for parts that jay supplied to jci for use in constructing automobile seats jci claims that the parties had an agreement according to which jay would purchase returnable packaging and then amortize the cost of the packaging over the course of several months.jay never stopped charging jci for the packaging,even after the packaging costs should have been paid in full.when jci discovered the overcharges several years later,it brought this suit against jay.the district court awarded damages to jci for the overcharges accruing after the point at which it notified jay of the problem.in its appeal,jay argues that the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law because of the untimely nature of jci claims and because of the lack of evidence of an amortization agreement,that the district court erred in instructing the jury and in presenting the verdict form,and that the district court improperly admitted parol evidence of the amortization agreement.in its,jci contends that it was entitled to damages prior to the time that it notified jay of the overcharges and that the district court erred in allowing the jury to determine that jay was entitled to an ongoing packaging charge.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court on each of the claims presented on appeal.
background 
jay is a automotive supplier that manufactures components of automobile parts.components from jay,incorporates them into automotive systems,and then sells the systems to automobile manufacturers.in june,jay and jci entered into a agreement regarding the ford quest and the ford econoline jci agreed to purchase parts from jay for the life of the program at a reduced price.at agreement.
on december,jay provided jci with an estimate for the cost of three new manual pedestals for the econoline van program program.the letter setting forth the estimate explained that packaging was not included but that jay will amortize returnable and amortization content to be determined.at letter from todd gensheimer to vic bohacheff.jci agreed to purchase the pedestals from jay,stating that the cost of packaging would be determined at a later time.the parties began the process of designing the pedestals,without ever finalizing the packaging issue.in march,the parties agreed temporarily to use expendable packaging cardboard and to add per assembly to cover the cost of the cardboard packaging.on june,jci issued its first permanent production order for the pedestals.jay began shipping the pedestals pursuant to this order.
after the parties agreed temporarily to use expendable packaging,jay submitted several letters to jci proposing amortization terms for returnable containers.the final letter on this topic,dated june,proposed that jay would purchase containers and that jci would reimburse jay for the containers at a cost of per part to be paid over the course of eight or nine months.darren robinson from jci signed and returned the letter to jay the next day however,robinson deleted one section and added an amendment todd gensheimer from jay testified that he called robinson upon receipt of the amended letter to inform him that jay would not sign the agreement with the proposed changes.robinson testified that he did not recall being contacted by anyone from jay regarding the changes.after this exchange,the parties continued to work on the returnable packaging issue.on november,jci sent a letter authoriz ing jay to release the order for returnable containers for the following part numbers at letter from jim veil to dick young.the letter concluded that p ayment terms and conditions will be handled at a later date with and todd gensheimer.at.jay purchased the returnable containers.
jay asserts that at this time,jci personnel were actively reviewing whether jci should abandon the idea of an amortization agreement and instead purchase the returnable containers itself outright.appellant br.at see also at broshco returnable summary comparing the costs of purchasing versus amortizing the containers at mem.from don mills to mike warner stating that w e would perfer sic to buy the containers to save money.jci responds by explaining that veil and mills did look into the prospect of purchasing the containers however,they stopped investigating this option when mills was informed that the parties had a binding contract and that it was closed and nonnegotiable.at trial tr.at mills test.
in february,jay began using the returnable containers in its shipments.the parties amended the prices of the pedestals several times over the next few years,yet the that had been included for the cost of the cardboard packaging never was eliminated.not only was the never eliminated,but jay also never reduced the price of the pedestals by once jay recovered the price of the returnable packaging as per the proposed amortization agreement.in,a jci employee analyzed the pedestal data while researching another project and discovered that the was never eliminated from the purchase orders.
on february,jci filed a complaint against jay in federal district court.jci final amended complaint included the following claims related to the packaging dispute breach of contract,unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,and a request for declaratory judgment.the complaint also included various claims regarding a price increase imposed by jay and jci right to submit the program for competitive bidding jay filed both a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment on the claims,and jci filed a motion for summary judgment.in june,the district court denied jay motion to dismiss,and it denied both parties motions for summary judgment.the district court also concluded that jci is time barred from making any claim based on overcharges which occurred more than years prior to filing suit,or prior to february.at dist.mem.order granting in part and denying in part def.mot.to dismiss at dist.mot.to dismiss order.
in august,the district court ordered that the issues of liability and damages be tried separately.the jury trial began on october.on november,jay filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on jci packaging claims,at subsequently,jci filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on these claims,and jay filed a second motion for judgment as a matter of law.the district court did not rule on these motions before the case was submitted to the jury.the jury came to the following conclusions with regard to the packaging claims jay breached the parties agreement as to the pedestals the agreement required that jay reduce its price by after jci had fully paid for the returnable packaging and jci did not notify jay of the overcharge within a reasonable time after it discovered or should have discovered this charge.at verdict.the district court entered judgment in favor of jci on the packaging claims in the amount of for the period february,through july,and for the period july,the date on which jci notified jay of the packaging overcharge dispute through september.at.
on may,the district court entered an order addressing the various motions that were submitted by jay and jci.the district court amended the judgment so that jci would no longer receive the for the period prior to july.jay timely appealed the district court december,and may,judgments case,and jci filed a case.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to because jci is incorporated in wisconsin with its principal place of business in wisconsin,and jay is incorporated in ohio with its principal place of business in ohio the amount in dispute in this case clearly exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to because the parties filed timely notices of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.keeton flying,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.tisdale fed.express,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
dismissal of jci claims on the basis of untimeliness 
statute of limitations 
the district court concluded that jci claims for overpayments arising over four years prior to the filing of the suit were untimely jci did not appeal this conclusion.jay asserts that jci claims after february are also barred by the statute of limitations for claims.see.comp.laws jay claims that the district court improperly applied the continuing violations or continuing breach doctrine in allowing jci claims to go forward,appellant br.at the continuing wrong doctrine recognizes that w here a defendant wrongful acts are of a continuing nature,the period of limitation will not run until the wrong is abated.blazer foods,rest,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
however,the continuing breach theory is not relevant to the case because the agreement is an installment contract michigan compiled laws states that claims on an installment contract accrue as each installment falls due.thus,each overcharge was a distinct breach that fell within the statute of limitations.at dist.mem.order re post trial mots.dist.mem.order at.jay offers several arguments regarding the applicability or effect of.first,jay asserts that the amortization contract was distinct from the pedestal contract and thus only lasted approximately seven months.jci fourth amended complaint clearly asserts that the packaging agreement was a part of the contract.see at verified fourth amended compl.the returnable container program that is a subject of this complaint is part of the agreement.in addition,there is evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the packaging agreement was negotiated in the context of the overall agreement for the sale of pedestals.see,at letter from todd gensheimer to vic bohacheff dated,discussing amortization in the context of the pedestal agreement as a whole.as we are required to view the facts in the light most favorable to jci,we conclude that the packaging agreement was not a distinct agreement from the installment contract 
finally,jay claims that is inapplicable because it is relevant only for the payment of money,rather than the delivery of goods.instead,jay asserts that the relevant rule is which states that a n installment contract is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted.according to,a breach of the whole contract occurs at the time that the contract is substantially impaired jay claims that the contract was substantially impaired prior to february.however,we see no reason that the general contract principle set forth in should not apply in this case.see bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of,d consistent with general principles governing installment obligations,each missed payment creates a separate cause of action with its own limitations period.because the agreement was an installment contract for the delivery of goods,each installment after february was substantially impaired.see at dist.mot.to dismiss order at t he thousand of dollars in overcharges per order serves as a substantial impairment.jci claims arising after february are not barred by the statute of limitations.
failure to provide reasonable notice 
the district court concluded that applies in this case the parallel michigan statutory provision provides 
where a tender has been accepted 
a the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy 
comp.laws.although the jury found that jci failed to reasonably notify jay in accordance with,the district court concluded that jci was entitled to recover damages for overcharges occurring after notice was given.at dist.mem.order at.
jay argues that the district court should have dismissed all of jci claims,because the failure to provide reasonable notice prevents jci from seeking any remedy.appellant br.at.it is true,as jay points out,that the michigan court of appeals has broadly construed the term any remedy.am.bumper transtechnology.however,the district court correctly found that jci was entitled to recover damages for the overcharges for two reasons.first,the district court explained that only applies by its own terms w here a tender has been accepted at the point at which jci notified jay of the overcharges,the goods in the subsequent installments had not yet been tendered or accepted.at dist.mem.order at.second,because the sales between jci and jay were in the nature of installment contracts,each overcharge was a distinct breach and jci was not required to give notice prior to the occurrence of the breach.at dist.mem.order at.
finally,jay claims that jci waived its alleged contract right to a lower price by promising and continuously paying to jay its purchase order prices during the time that the pedestals were shipped.appellant br.at.michigan compiled laws states 
where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other,any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.
subject to the provisions of the next section on modification and waiver,such course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.
jci first responds that jay waived this claim by failing to object to the lack of an appropriate jury instruction.jci acknowledges that jay requested a instruction that included a passing reference to waiver,but states that there was no objection to the failure to provide a substantive waiver instruction.appellee br.at.jay requested instruction,which was based on,stated,t he parties course of performance is also relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.at jay revised proposed jury instructions at.contrary to jci arguments,jay requested instruction clearly raised the issue of waiver.
as to the merits of jay claim,jci did not waive its rights regarding the packaging payments according to michigan law.the michigan supreme court has explained that a waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment of a known right.quality prods.concepts,nagel precision.jay is correct in stating that a party conduct can establish waiver in fact,quality products acknowledges that a course of conduct can indicate a knowing waiver.id.however,because jay does not offer any evidence that jci intentionally relinquished its rights,jay claim is without merit.therefore,judgment as a matter of law based on waiver of the price contract term was not warranted.
jay obviously can not assert that jci waived its rights under the contract after july,because jci expressed its objection on that date.rather,jay argues that jci retraction of the alleged waiver was improper pursuant to michigan compiled laws because jci did not waive its rights as to the packaging charges,however,is inapplicable.the district court correctly denied jay claim with regard to waiver.
jury instructions and verdict form 
jury instructions 
jay requested the following jury instruction 
where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other,any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.the parties course of performance is also relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.
at jay revised proposed jury instructions.the district court instructed the jury as follows 
now,as to the packaging overcharge claim,it involves the assertion that jci and jay agreed that,one,jay would ship vn front seat pedestals in returnable containers.jay would initially purchase the containers and jci would repay jay for its purchase of the containers including interest through a temporary increase in the piece price for the parts,and two,jci would pay jay per part for jay temporary use of expendable packaging until returnable packaging was available.
jci has the burden of proving,one,that one or more of these agreements were formed,and two,that jay breached one or more of these agreements.on this claim your answer to part i question will be yes if you decide that jci has proved each of these elements.on this claim your answer to part i question will be no if you decide jci has not proved one or more of these elements.
with regard to this claim,parties can enter into an agreement even though a particular term is not explicitly agreed to.in such a case the term can be established by the conduct of the parties.it is for you to decide in your answers to part i question and part i question whether or not the parties by their actions came to such an agreement.
at trial tr.at.
this court reviews a district court refusal to give requested jury instructions under an abuse of discretion standard.hisrich volvo cars of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the refusal to give the requested instructions is error if the omitted instructions are a correct statement of the law the instruction is not substantially covered by other delivered charges the failure to give the instruction impairs the requesting party theory of the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a judgment may be reversed only if the instructions,viewed as a whole,were confusing,misleading,or prejudicial.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
jay contends that each of these requirements for error is satisfied in this case.first,the requested instructions are based upon and are thus a correct statement of the law.jay concedes that the instruction given did address the issue of the parties conduct however,jay asserts that this instruction only demonstrated that conduct could indicate the existence of additional contractual terms rather than showing that the parties did not agree to disputed terms.appellant br.at.finally,jay claims that the district court failure to give the instruction struck at the core of jay primary trial defense against the existence of an amortization agreement the jury was not told that course of performance could show no agreement ever arose,could show modification of an agreement,or could show that a party had waived its contract rights.appellant br.at.
jay argument as to waiver is without merit due to the lack of evidence of jci intent,as discussed in the previous section.because this court will not reverse a decision on the basis of an erroneous jury instruction where the error is harmless,any possible error with regard to the issue of waiver is not grounds for reversal in this case.barnes fiberglas,cir.in addition,jci points out that jay was not impaired in its presentation of its theories as jay itself admitted,it introduced a wealth of evidence tending to show that the parties course of performance proved that an amortization agreement did not exist.appellant br.at.in united states jackson,cir,we stated,the failure to give the requested instruction did not substantially impair the defense because the jury was already well aware of his theory of the case.because the instructions given were not confusing,misleading,or prejudicial to jay,hisrich,at,the district court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury.
verdict form 
jay also argues that the district court erred in refusing to use jay proposed verdict form,which contained the question,d id jay and jci agree to an amortization contract for returnable containers at jay proposed verdict form.the verdict form given to the jury stated as follows 
did jay breach the parties agreement for the manufacture and sale of the three vn front seat pedestals or any related agreement by continuing to charge jci per part after it began shipping the parts in returnable packaging and had been reimbursed for the cost including interest of the returnable packaging 
at verdict.we review the content of verdict forms for an abuse of discretion.bills aseltine,cir,cert.denied,d.
jay asserts that the verdict form effectively assumed the existence of the amortization agreement.appellant br.at.however,w e review jury charges as a whole,and will not find a cause for reversal unless it is likely the jury has been misled.piper goodwin,cir.as set forth above,the district court clearly instructed the jury that jci had the burden of proving the existence of an amortization agreement.there is therefore no basis to reverse the judgment of the district court on this issue.
parol evidence 
jay argues that the district court erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude evidence contradicting the terms of the purchase order.michigan follows the general rule that does not permit extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of a written contract that was intended by the parties to be a complete expression of their agreement,quantum air,cir.the statutory provision regarding parol evidence states as follows 
terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented 
a by course of dealing or usage of trade section or by course of performance section and 
b by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.
comp.laws footnotes omitted.
jci asserts that jay did not raise this issue again after the district court denial of the motion in limine,either by objecting to the introduction of evidence,requesting a jury instruction,or by filing a motion for judgment as a matter of law jay does not respond to these assertions nor does the record reveal that jci is incorrect.we have held that a motion in limine does not preserve evidentiary questions for appeal.united states kelly,cir,cert.denied,d.we thus review this asserted evidentiary error for plain error,rather than for an abuse of discretion.id.b efore we can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d third alteration in original quoting united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.third alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting olano,at.
jay arguments would fail under either the or standard of review.jay asserts that because the purchase orders were confirmatory memoranda pursuant to and,the parol evidence was improperly admitted.appellant br.at.the supreme court of michigan has stated,w hen the parties did not regard their purchase order as the final expression of their agreement,parol evidence is admissible to establish what that agreement was.baker dec int l,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the existence of the purchase orders alone can not trigger the parol evidence rule 
jay and jci dispute whether the purchase orders adequately reflect the agreement that existed between them.extrinsic evidence offered to show that a contract was not intended to be a complete expression of an agreement on the matters covered must be presented to the jury so that the jury may determine whether the contract was,in fact,intended to be a complete expression of the parties agreement,at.the district court properly allowed jci to present parol evidence in this case.
evidence of amortization agreement 
jay requested judgment as a matter of law on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of an amortization agreement,and the distric
