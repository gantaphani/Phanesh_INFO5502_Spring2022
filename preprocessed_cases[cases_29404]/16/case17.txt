on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether a contractual waiver of class arbitration is enforceable under the federal arbitration act when the plaintiff cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery.
respondents are merchants who accept american express cards.their agreement with petitioners american express and a wholly owned subsidiary contains a clause that requires all disputes between the parties to be resolved by arbitration.the agreement also provides that t here shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.in re american express merchants litigation.
respondents brought a class action against petitioners for violations of the federal antitrust laws.according to respondents,american express used its monopoly power in the market for charge cards to force merchants to accept credit cards at rates approximately higher than the fees for competing credit cards this tying arrangement,respondents said,violated of the sherman act.they sought treble damages for the class under of the clayton act.
petitioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa,et.in resisting the motion,respondents submitted a declaration from an economist who estimated that the cost of an expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would be at least several hundred thousand dollars,and might exceed million,while the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff would be,or when trebled.app.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits.the court of appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings.it held that because respondents had established that they would incur prohibitive costs if compelled to arbitrate under the class action waiver,the waiver was unenforceable and the arbitration could not proceed.in re american express merchants litigation.
we granted certiorari,vacated the judgment,and remanded for further consideration in light of animalfeeds int l,which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to class arbitration absent an agreement to do so.american express italian colors restaurant.the court of appeals stood by its reversal,stating that its earlier ruling did not compel class arbitration.in re american express merchants litigation.it then sua sponte reconsidered its ruling in light of mobility llc concepcion,which held that the faa a state law barring enforcement of a waiver.finding mobility inapplicable because it addressed,the court of appeals reversed for the third time,at.it then denied rehearing en banc with five judges dissenting.in re american express merchants litigation.we granted certiorari,to consider the question w hether the federal arbitration act permits courts to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a claim,pet.for cert.
congress enacted the faa in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration.see mobility,supra,at slip,at.as relevant here,the act provides 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
this text reflects the overarching principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.see,west,jackson,slip,at.and consistent with that text,courts must rigorously enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms,dean witter reynolds byrd,including terms that specify with whom the parties choose to arbitrate their disputes,supra,at,and the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.that holds true for claims that allege a violation of a federal statute,unless the faa mandate has been overridden by a contrary congressional command.compucredit greenwood,slip,at quoting express mcmahon.
no contrary congressional command requires us to reject the waiver of class arbitration here.respondents argue that requiring them to litigate their claims individually as they contracted to do would contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.but the antitrust laws do not guarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim.congress has taken some measures to facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims for example,it enacted a remedy.see treble damages.in enacting such measures,congress has told us that it is willing to go,in certain respects,beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its goals of deterring and remedying unlawful trade practice.but to say that congress must have intended whatever departures from those normal limits advance antitrust goals is simply irrational.n o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.rodriguez united states,per curiam.
the antitrust laws do not evinc e an intention to preclude a waiver of procedure.mitsubishi motors soler.the sherman and clayton acts make no mention of class actions.in fact,they were enacted decades before the advent of federal rule of civil procedure,which was designed to allow an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.califano yamasaki.the parties here agreed to arbitrate pursuant to that usual rule,and it would be remarkable for a court to erase that expectation.
nor does congressional approval of rule establish an entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of statutory rights.to begin with,it is likely that such an entitlement,invalidating private arbitration agreements denying class adjudication,would be an abridg ment or modif ication of a substantive right forbidden to the rules,see b.but there is no evidence of such an entitlement in any event.the rule imposes stringent requirements for certification that in practice exclude most claims.and we have specifically rejected the assertion that one of those requirements the requirement must be dispensed with because the prohibitively high cost of compliance would frustrate plaintiff attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the antitrust laws.eisen carlisle jacquelin.one might respond,perhaps,that federal law secures a nonwaivable opportunity to vindicate federal policies by satisfying the procedural strictures of rule or invoking some other informal class mechanism in arbitration.but we have already rejected that proposition in mobility,at slip,at.
our finding of no contrary congressional command does not end the case.respondents invoke a exception to the faa which,they say,serves to harmonize competing federal policies by allowing courts to invalidate agreements that prevent the effective vindication of a federal statutory right.enforcing the waiver of class arbitration bars effective vindication,respondents contend,because they have no economic incentive to pursue their antitrust claims individually in arbitration.
the effective vindication exception to which respondents allude originated as dictum in mitsubishi motors,where we expressed a willingness to invalidate,on public policy grounds,arbitration agreements that operat e as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.at,emphasis added.dismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inadequate,we said that so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.at.subsequent cases have similarly asserted the existence of an effective vindication exception,see,penn plaza llc pyett,gilmer lane,but have similarly declined to apply it to invalidate the arbitration agreement at issue 
and we do so again here.as we have described,the exception finds its origin in the desire to prevent prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies,mitsubishi motors,supra,at,emphasis added.that would certainly cover a provision in an arbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights.and it would perhaps cover filing and administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so high as to make access to the forum impracticable.see green tree financial.randolph,it may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights but the fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy.see,at jacobs,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc the waiver merely limits arbitration to the two contracting parties.it no more eliminates those parties right to pursue their statutory remedy than did federal law before its adoption of the class action for legal relief in,see fed.rule civ.proc,supp v wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.or,to put it differently,the individual suit that was considered adequate to assure effective vindication of a federal right before adoption of procedures did not suddenly become ineffective vindication upon their adoption 
a pair of our cases brings home the point.in gilmer,supra,we had no qualms in enforcing a class waiver in an arbitration agreement even though the federal statute at issue,the age discrimination in employment act,expressly permitted collective actions.we said that statutory permission did not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.at.and in vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,we held that requiring arbitration in a foreign country was compatible with the federal carriage of goods by sea act.that legislation prohibited any agreement relieving or lessening the liability of a carrier for damaged goods,at,quoting app.ed.which is close to codification of an effective vindication exception.the court rejected the argument that the inconvenience and costs of proceeding abroad lessen ed the defendants liability,stating that i t would be unwieldy and unsupported by the terms or policy of the statute to require courts to proceed case by case to tally the costs and burdens to particular plaintiffs in light of their means,the size of their claims,and the relative burden on the carrier.at.such a tally ing of the costs and burdens is precisely what the dissent would impose upon federal courts here.
truth to tell,our decision in mobility all but resolves this case.there we invalidated a law conditioning enforcement of arbitration on the availability of class procedure because that law interfere d with fundamental attributes of arbitration.at slip,at.t he switch from bilateral to class arbitration,we said,sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and makes the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.at slip,at.we specifically rejected the argument that class arbitration was necessary to prosecute claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system.at slip,at 
the regime established by the court of appeals decision would require before a plaintiff can be held to contractually agreed bilateral arbitration that a federal court determine and the parties litigate the legal requirements for success on the merits and,the evidence necessary to meet those requirements,the cost of developing that evidence,and the damages that would be recovered in the event of success.such a preliminary litigating hurdle would undoubtedly destroy the prospect of speedy resolution that arbitration in general and bilateral arbitration in particular was meant to secure.the faa does not sanction such a judicially created superstructure.

i join the court opinion in full.i write separately to note that the result here is also required by the plain meaning of the federal arbitration act.in mobility llc concepcion,i explained that the faa requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement,such as by proving fraud or duress.at concurring opinion slip,at.in this case,italian colors makes two arguments to support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced.first,it contends that enforcing the arbitration agreement would contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.ante,at.second,it contends that a court may invalidate agreements that prevent the effective vindication of a federal statutory right.ante,at.neither argument concern s whether the contract was properly made,concepcion,supra,at thomas,concurring slip,at.because italian colors has not furnished grounds for the revocation of any contract,the arbitration agreement must be enforced.italian colors voluntarily entered into a contract containing a bilateral arbitration provision.it can not now escape its obligations merely because the claim it wishes to bring might be economically infeasible.

justice kagan,with whom justice ginsburg and justice breyer join,dissenting.
here is the nutshell version of this case,unfortunately obscured in the court decision.the owner of a small restaurant italian colors thinks that american express amex has used its monopoly power to force merchants to accept a form contract violating the antitrust laws.the restaurateur wants to challenge the allegedly unlawful provision imposing a tying arrangement,but the same contract arbitration clause prevents him from doing so.that term imposes a variety of procedural bars that would make pursuit of the antitrust claim a fool errand.so if the arbitration clause is enforceable,amex has insulated itself from antitrust liability even if it has in fact violated the law.the monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse.
and here is the nutshell version of today opinion,admirably flaunted rather than camouflaged too darn bad.
that answer is a betrayal of our precedents,and of federal statutes like the antitrust laws.our decisions have developed a mechanism called the rule to prevent arbitration clauses from choking off a plaintiff ability to enforce congressionally created rights.that doctrine bars applying such a clause when but only when it operates to confer immunity from potentially meritorious federal claims.in so doing,the rule reconciles the federal arbitration act faa with all the rest of federal law and indeed,promotes the most fundamental purposes of the faa itself.as applied here,the rule would ensure that amex arbitration clause does not foreclose italian colors from vindicating its right to redress antitrust harm.
the majority barely tries to explain why it reaches a contrary result.it notes that we have not decided this exact case before neglecting that the principle we have established fits this case hand in glove.and it concocts a special exemption for waivers ignoring that this case concerns much more than that.throughout,the majority disregards our decisions central tenet an arbitration clause may not thwart federal law,of exactly how it does so.because the court today prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory rights,i respectfully dissent.
start with an uncontroversial proposition we would refuse to enforce an exculpatory clause insulating a company from antitrust liability say,merchants may bring no sherman act claims even if that clause were contained in an arbitration agreement.see ante,at.congress created the sherman act private cause of action not solely to compensate individuals,but to promote the public interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws.lawlor national screen service.accordingly,courts will not enforce a prospective waiver of the right to gain redress for an antitrust injury,whether in an arbitration agreement or any other contract.see mitsubishi motors soler,and.the same rule applies to other important federal statutory rights.see penn plaza llc pyett,age discrimination in employment act brooklyn savings bank,fair labor standards act.but its necessity is nowhere more evident than in the antitrust context.without the rule,a company could use its monopoly power to protect its monopoly power,by coercing agreement to contractual terms eliminating its antitrust liability.
if the rule were limited to baldly exculpatory,however,a monopolist could devise numerous ways around it.consider several alternatives that a party drafting an arbitration agreement could adopt to avoid antitrust liability,each of which would have the identical effect.on the front end the agreement might set outlandish filing fees or establish an absurd,statute of limitations,thus preventing a claimant from gaining access to the arbitral forum.on the back end the agreement might remove the arbitrator authority to grant meaningful relief,so that a judgment gets the claimant nothing worthwhile.and in the middle the agreement might block the claimant from presenting the kind of proof that is necessary to establish the defendant liability say,by prohibiting any economic testimony good luck proving an antitrust claim without that.or else the agreement might appoint as an arbitrator an obviously biased person say,the ceo of amex.the possibilities are endless all less direct than an express exculpatory clause,but no less fatal.so the rule against prospective waivers of federal rights can work only if it applies not just to a contract clause explicitly barring a claim,but to others that operate to do so.
and sure enough,our cases establish this proposition an arbitration clause will not be enforced if it prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory rights,however it achieves that result.the rule originated in mitsubishi,where we held that claims brought under the sherman act and other federal laws are generally subject to arbitration,at.by agreeing to arbitrate such a claim,we explained,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.ibid.but crucial to our decision was a limiting principle,designed to safeguard federal rights an arbitration clause will be enforced only so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.at.if an arbitration provision operated as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies,we emphasized,we would condemn it,at.similarly,we stated that such a clause should be set aside if proceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult that the claimant will for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court.at internal quotation marks omitted.and in the decades since mitsubishi,we have repeated its admonition time and again,instructing courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement that effectively even if not explicitly forecloses a plaintiff from remedying the violation of a federal statutory right.see gilmer lane,vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,penn plaza,at.
our decision in green tree financial.randolph,confirmed that this principle applies when an agreement thwarts federal law by making arbitration prohibitively expensive.the plaintiff there seeking relief under the truth in lending act argued that an arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it create d a risk that she would have to bear prohibitive arbitration costs in the form of high filing and administrative fees,at internal quotation marks omitted.we rejected that contention,but not because we doubted that such fees could prevent the effective vindication of statutory rights.to the contrary,we invoked our rule from mitsubishi,making clear that it applied to the case before us.see,at.indeed,we added a burden of proof w here,as here,we held,a party asserting a federal right seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.at.randolph,we found,had failed to meet that burden the evidence she offered was too speculative.at.but even as we dismissed randolph suit,we reminded courts to protect against arbitration agreements that make federal claims too costly to bring.
applied as our precedents direct,the rule furthers the purposes not just of laws like the sherman act,but of the faa itself.that statute reflects a federal policy favoring actual arbitration that is,arbitration as a streamlined method of resolving disputes,not as a foolproof way of killing off valid claims.rodriguez de quijas express.put otherwise what the faa prefers to litigation is arbitration,not de facto immunity.the rule furthers the statute goals by ensuring that arbitration remains a real,not faux,method of dispute resolution.with the rule,companies have good reason to adopt arbitral procedures that facilitate efficient and accurate handling of complaints.without it,companies have every incentive to draft their agreements to extract backdoor waivers of statutory rights,making arbitration unavailable or pointless.so down one road more arbitration,better enforcement of federal statutes.and down the other less arbitration,poorer enforcement of federal statutes.which would you prefer or still more aptly which do you think congress would 
the answer becomes all the more obvious given the limits we have placed on the rule,which ensure that it does not diminish arbitration benefits.the rule comes into play only when an agreement operate s as a prospective waiver that is,forecloses not diminishes a plaintiff opportunity to gain relief for a statutory violation.mitsubishi,at.so,for example,randolph assessed whether fees in arbitration would be prohibitive not high,excessive,or extravagant,at.moreover,the plaintiff must make that showing through concrete proof s peculative risks,unfounded assumptions,and unsupported statements will not suffice,at,and.with the inquiry that confined and the evidentiary requirements that high,courts have had no trouble assessing the matters the rule makes relevant.and for almost three decades,courts have followed our edict that arbitration clauses must usually prevail,declining to enforce them in only rare cases.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.the rule has thus operated year in and year out without undermining,much less destroy ing,the prospect of speedy dispute resolution that arbitration secures.ante,at.
and this is just the kind of case the rule was meant to address.italian colors,as i have noted,alleges that amex used its market power to impose a tying arrangement in violation of the sherman act.the antitrust laws,all parties agree,provide the restaurant with a cause of action and give it the chance to recover treble damages.here,that would mean italian colors could take home up to.but a problem looms.as this case comes to us,the evidence shows that italian colors can not prevail in arbitration without an economic analysis defining the relevant markets,establishing amex monopoly power,showing anticompetitive effects,and measuring damages.and that expert report would cost between several hundred thousand and one million dollars so the expense involved in proving the claim in arbitration is ten times what italian colors could hope to gain,even in a scenario.that counts as a prohibitive cost,in randolph terminology,if anything does.no rational actor would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands.
an arbitration agreement could manage such a mismatch in many ways,but amex disdains them all.as the court makes clear,the contract expressly prohibits class arbitration.but that is only part of the problem the agreement also disallows any kind of joinder or consolidation of claims or parties.and more its confidentiality provision prevents italian colors from informally arranging with other merchants to produce a common expert report.and still more the agreement precludes any shifting of costs to amex,even if italian colors prevails.and beyond all that amex refused to enter into any stipulations that would obviate or mitigate the need for the economic analysis.in short,the agreement as applied in this case cuts off not just class arbitration,but any avenue for sharing,shifting,or shrinking necessary costs.amex has put italian colors to this choice spend way,way,way more money than your claim is worth,or relinquish your sherman act rights.
so contra the majority,the court below got this case right.italian colors proved what the plaintiff in randolph could not that a agreement,taken as a whole,renders arbitration of a claim prohibitively expensive.at.the restaurant thus established that the contract operate s as a prospective waiver,and prevents the effective vindicat ion of sherman act rights.mitsubishi,at,and.i would follow our precedents and decline to compel arbitration.
the majority is quite sure that the rule does not apply here,but has precious little to say about why.it starts by disparaging the rule as having originated as dictum.ante,at.but it does not rest on that swipe,and for good reason.as i have explained,see supra,at,the rule began as a core part of mitsubishi we held there that federal statutory claims are subject to arbitration so long as the claimant effectively may vindicate its rights in the arbitral forum.at emphasis added.the rule thus served as an essential condition of the decision holding and in randolph,we provided a standard for applying the rule when a claimant alleges prohibitive costs where,as here,see supra,at,and we then applied that standard to the parties before us.so whatever else the majority might think of the rule,it is not dictum.
the next paragraph of the court decision the third of part iv is the key it contains almost the whole of the majority effort to explain why the rule does not stop amex from compelling arbitration.the majority first move is to describe mitsubishi and randolph as covering only discrete situations the rule,the majority asserts,applies to arbitration agreements that eliminate the right to pursue statutory remedies by forbidding the assertion of the right as addressed in mitsubishi or imposing filing and administrative fees so high as to make access to the forum impracticable as addressed in randolph.ante,at emphasis deleted internal quotation marks omitted.those cases are not this case,the majority says here,the agreement provisions went to the possibility of proving a statutory.ante,at.
but the distinction the majority proffers,which excludes problems of proof,is one mitsubishi and randolph and our decisions reaffirming them foreclose.those decisions establish what in some quarters is known as a principle when an arbitration agreement prevents the effective vindication of federal rights,a party may go to court.that principle,by its nature,operates in diverse circumstances not just the ones that happened to come before the court.see supra,at.it doubtless covers the baldly exculpatory clause and prohibitive fees that the majority acknowledges would preclude an arbitration agreement enforcement.but so too it covers the world of other provisions a clever drafter might devise to scuttle even the most meritorious federal claims.those provisions might deny entry to the forum in the first instance.or they might deprive the claimant of any remedy.or they might prevent the claimant from offering the necessary proof to prevail,as in my no economic testimony hypothetical and in the actual circumstances of this case.see supra,at.the variations matter not at all.whatever the precise mechanism,each operate s as a prospective waiver of a party federal right s and so confers immunity on a wrongdoer.mitsubishi,at.and that is what counts under our decisions 
nor can the majority escape the principle we have established by observing,as it does at one point,that amex agreement merely made arbitration not worth the expense.ante,at.that sugges
