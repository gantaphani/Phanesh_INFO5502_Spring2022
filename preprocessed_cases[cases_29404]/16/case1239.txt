coretel virginia,llc coretel,a telecommunications company,has entered into interconnection agreements with verizon virginia,llc and verizon south,collectively verizon in accordance with the telecommunications act of,stat.codified at et.in this second appeal arising out of a disagreement between coretel and verizon over their respective obligations under those interconnection agreements,coretel disputes the district court determination that it owes verizon for the use of verizon telecommunications facilities and in fees.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the telecommunications act of the act provides the context for this dispute between coretel and verizon.as we explained more fully in our first opinion,the act requires incumbent local exchange carriers such as verizon to allow competitive local exchange carriers such as coretel to connect with end users over the incumbent network.see coretel,llc verizon,llc,cir coretel i.using the procedures set out in section of the act,carriers negotiate private agreements with each other that establish the rates and terms under which their networks will be interconnected.this case involves two such interconnection agreements one between coretel and verizon virginia,and one between coretel and verizon south the icas 
the icas govern,among other aspects of interconnection,coretel use of verizon physical telecommunications facilities.in coretel i,we addressed the parties dispute over what rates coretel must pay to use verizon facilities.see at.verizon took the position that it was entitled to charge the rates set out in its tariffs filed with state and federal regulatory agencies,and billed coretel accordingly.coretel believed that the icas entitled it to purchase access to verizon facilities at a lower total element incremental cost,or telric rate coretel declined to pay not only the amounts set out in verizon bills,but also the amounts coretel contended should have been billed.
verizon sued for breach of contract,bringing two claims associated with coretel refusal to pay its bills.first,verizon sought a declaratory judgment that,if coretel failed to pay,verizon was entitled to terminate coretel service.second,verizon sought damages associated with coretel breach of the icas.
in coretel i,we held that verizon should have billed coretel for facilities at telric rather than tariff rates,and that therefore coretel was entitled to summary judgment in its favor on verizon claim for declaratory relief relating to verizon facilities charges.at.we did not,however,resolve verizon claim for damages associated with coretel breach of the icas.rather,we remanded that claim so that the district court could apply the proper telric rates to calculate what coretel owes verizon for use of verizon facilities.id.
on remand,the district court held a bench trial,during which verizon presented the monthly bills it had issued to coretel and the pricing attachments to the icas.the monthly bills detail what facilities verizon provided to coretel whether the facility was provided by verizon virginia or verizon south and,if split between those two,the percentage of the facility in each company service area and for transport facilities billed by the mile,the number of transport miles provided.the icas pricing attachments set out the telric rates associated with each type of facility.pricing is the only term on which the verizon virginia ica and the verizon south ica differ the icas are otherwise identical in all relevant respects.
from that evidence,verizon developed a summary spreadsheet containing an entry for every facility it provided to coretel with the specific amount owed for each at telric rates.the entries,in total,reflected debts of for verizon virginia facilities and for verizon south facilities,for a total of in damages.
verizon also contended that it was entitled to fees of per month on the facilities charges under the icas.to calculate the amount,verizon presented another summary spreadsheet detailing the total unpaid facilities charges accrued,the principal for each month and the total late fees associated with those unpaid facilities charges.the late fees totaled.
coretel raised numerous objections to verizon proposed damages calculation,each of which the district court rejected in entering judgment in favor of verizon for the full amount it sought in facilities charges and in late fees.this appeal followed.
under virginia law t he elements of a breach of contract action are a legally enforceable obligation of a defendant to a plaintiff the defendant violation or breach of that obligation and injury or damage to the plaintiff caused by the breach of obligation.ramos wells fargo bank,na,citation omitted.coretel has never disputed that the icas are valid contracts that require it to pay for its use of verizon facilities,that it has in fact used verizon facilities without paying for that use,or that its failure to pay has injured verizon.
the sole question in this appeal is whether the district court properly calculated verizon damages for coretel breach as we instructed.coretel argues that the district court violated our mandate in coretel i by awarding as damages any facilities charges at all that even if verizon can recover such facilities charges,the district court made several errors in calculating the total amount owed and that the district court further erred in calculating the late fees coretel owes under the icas.in addressing coretel arguments,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see helton v.at t,cir.
as we clarify during our discussion,several of coretel arguments suffer from the same underlying flaw a misperception of the mandate rule.the mandate rule is merely a specific application of the law of the case doctrine.united states pileggi,cir citation omitted.it prohibits lower courts,with limited exceptions,from considering questions that the mandate of a higher court has laid to rest.moore bennette,cir citation omitted.
coretel appears to believe that our opinion in coretel i froze not only the law of the case but also all the underlying facts.our remand order in coretel i,however,contemplated that the district court would conduct additional to determine what coretel owes verizon for facilities at telric rates.the only matter our mandate in coretel i laid to rest with regard to verizon facilities claims is that telric rates should apply,not tariff rates.the district court faithfully followed that ruling.
we first address coretel argument,under the guise of the mandate rule,that our opinion in coretel i precludes verizon from recovering as damages any facilities charges at all.essentially,coretel interprets that opinion to have mandated complete summary judgment in coretel favor on verizon claims,leaving verizon without a live claim on which to seek damages.thus,coretel argues,the district court violated our mandate when it nonetheless awarded damages.
coretel misunderstands both coretel i and verizon claims.as we explain above,verizon brought two claims related to its provision of facilities to coretel a claim and a claim for damages associated with a breach of the icas.in coretel i,we held that coretel was entitled to summary judgment in its favor on verizon claim for declaratory relief relating to verizon facilities charges,because we agreed with coretel that verizon was limited to charging the telric rates for its facilities.at emphasis added.but we expressly did not resolve verizon claim for damages associated with coretel breach of the icas.rather,we remand ed to the district court for consideration of verizon damages claim.id thus,the district court did not violate our mandate when it considered verizon damages claim 
we turn next to coretel challenges to the district court calculation of the outstanding facilities charges coretel owes verizon.to understand coretel arguments,some background information about the icas is helpful.under the icas,the parties are to establish interconnection points ips at particular,locations.see ica.when a coretel customer calls a verizon customer,coretel is responsible for delivering that call to the relevant verizon ip,either by using its own facilities or by purchasing access to verizon facilities at the telric rates set out in the icas.see id.each party is responsible for delivering its terminating traffic to the other party relevant ip.
once coretel delivers the call to the ip,verizon is responsible for delivering it the rest of the way to the call recipient.coretel pays verizon for doing so through a reciprocal compensation charge.see coretel i,at.in fact,the icas define interconnection point to mean the point at which a party who receives traffic originating on the network of the other party assesses reciprocal compensation charges for the further transport and termination of that traffic.ica.
the icas label the point at which coretel traffic passes from facilities onto facilities as the point of interconnection poi when coretel is able to use its own facilities to deliver traffic all the way to the relevant verizon ip,the poi and the ip are necessarily at the same location.but when coretel uses verizon facilities to which it has purchased access to deliver traffic to the verizon ip,the poi and the ip are distinct.
for such situations,the icas the rule that the mode of compensation does not switch from facilities charges to reciprocal compensation until the traffic passes the ip.see ica,to the extent the originating party poi is not located at the terminating party relevant ip,the originating party is responsible for transporting its traffic from its poi to the terminating party relevant ip.in other words,coretel must pay facilities charges for any verizon facilities it uses to transport traffic between the poi and the relevant verizon ip.
with that background in mind,we now turn to coretel specific objections to the district court damages calculation.coretel contends that the district court erred by including in its damages calculation any facilities charges associated with verizon south at all using the national exchange carrier association fcc tariff neca tariff to allocate charges for facilities jointly provided by verizon virginia and verizon south using verizon south telric rate to calculate damages for a multiplexer previously billed at verizon virginia lower telric rate including in its damages calculation charges for transport between verizon serving wire centers and its ips imposing of the telric rate for certain facilities for which verizon had previously billed coretel only a percentage of its tariff rates and failing to apply the statute of limitations set out in a.we address coretel arguments in turn below,ultimately rejecting each and affirming the district court calculation of the facilities charges coretel owes verizon.
coretel first argues that it should not owe any facilities charges at all to verizon south because coretel traffic always entered the verizon network via verizon virginia facilities,even when the traffic terminated with verizon south.according to coretel,it should have to pay only verizon virginia,through whose facilities coretel traffic enters the verizon network.if coretel traffic thereafter uses verizon south facilities,coretel contends that verizon virginia,not coretel,should have to compensate verizon south for that use.
the icas,however,make clear that coretel must pay verizon virginia for use of verizon virginia facilities and verizon south for use of verizon south facilities,regardless of where coretel traffic enters the verizon network.under section of the icas,e ach party is responsible for delivering its terminating traffic to the other party relevant ip.moreover,the verizon virginia ica expressly covers services in verizon virginia service territory only,and the verizon south ica expressly covers only services in verizon south service territory.thus,the district court properly included verizon south facilities charges where coretel used verizon south facilities.
coretel also contends that the district court erred by using neca tariff to determine how to calculate charges for facilities located partially in verizon virginia territory and partially in verizon south territory.neca tariff is an industry standard methodology used to establish,for telecommunications facilities located in multiple companies territories,what percentage of a particular facility should be billed by each company.it does not establish actual tariff rates to be charged by those companies.
coretel does not contest that,as a general matter,neca tariff provides a proper methodology for apportioning charges for jointly provided facilities.instead,it argues that the district court reliance on neca tariff was improper because this court has ruled that the ica rates,terms and any verizon to the facilities verizon provided.appellant br.at.neca tariff,however,is not a verizon tariff it is a tariff filed by the national exchange carrier association.thus,the district court use of neca tariff did not contravene our ruling in coretel i that verizon tariffs do not apply here.
moreover,the icas provide no guidance as to how billing should be apportioned for facilities jointly provided by verizon virginia and verizon south.when the parties to a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties,the court supplies a term which is reasonable in the circumstances.restatement second of contracts.here,the district court decision to rely on an industry standard methodology was eminently reasonable 
we next address coretel contention that the district court erred by using verizon south telric rate rather than verizon virginia to calculate what coretel owes verizon for coretel use of a multiplexer located in great bridge,virginia.great bridge is in verizon south territory.but between january and march,verizon monthly bills identified that multiplexer as being provided by verizon virginia.at trial,verizon introduced evidence that this was a mistake and that the multiplexer should always have been associated with verizon south.accordingly,in its damages request,verizon billed the great bridge multiplexer at the verizon south telric rate which is substantially higher than the verizon virginia rate,except for the months for which its bills had affirmatively associated the multiplexer with verizon virginia.for those months,verizon gave coretel the benefit of the purported billing error and charged the lower verizon virginia rate.
as coretel president conceded at trial,there is no dispute that the great bridge multiplexer is located in verizon south territory.see.nevertheless,coretel contends that verizon did not catch this mistake in previous estimates of the damages coretel owes it,and should not be permitted to change the facts at its whim,after remand.appellant br.at.
coretel argument is without merit.verizon was entitled to present its evidence at trial that the great bridge multiplexer should always have been billed at verizon south rate,just as coretel was entitled to counter with verizon monthly bills and prior damages calculations that showed the great bridge multiplexer being associated with verizon virginia at times.the district court considered both parties evidence,and it did not clearly err in finding that verizon was more persuasive,particularly given coretel president concession that the great bridge multiplexer is in verizon south territory.
we turn next to coretel argument that the district court erred by including in its damages calculation charges for transport between verizon serving wire centers and the relevant verizon ip.this is essentially a dispute about the definition of the term entrance facility.the icas define entrance facility to mean the facility between a party designated premises and the central office serving that designated premises.ica.coretel contends that when it purchases use of an entrance facility,transport to the relevant verizon ip is included in that purchase.verizon,on the other hand,contends that an entrance facility ends at the verizon switch nearest to coretel calls this the serving wire center and that coretel therefore must purchase additional transport to get its traffic to the relevant verizon ip.
verizon interpretation adheres more
