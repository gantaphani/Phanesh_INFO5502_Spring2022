hartford underwriters insurance company hartford appeals the district court order denying hartford motions for declaratory judgment and partial summary judgment.in denying hartford motions and dismissing hartford suit,the district court held that the substantive law of mississippi,not louisiana,applies to a dispute between hartford and magnolia healthcare,magnolia involving reimbursement for attorney fees.after conducting our own choice of law analysis,we agree with the district court that mississippi law applies.
background and facts 
foundation health services,foundation is a louisiana corporation that,through its subsidiaries,owns and operates healthcare facilities and nursing homes in seven states.one of its subsidiaries is magnolia,which itself owns and operates four nursing homes in mississippi.magnolia is a mississippi corporation but maintains its corporate offices in louisiana.
in and,hartford issued several insurance policies to foundation predecessor,lunch,lunch the policies provided liability coverage for the operation of each lunch subsidiary,including magnolia.the insurance policies named lunch as the insured,and despite hartford arguments to the contrary,the record confirms that the policies named magnolia as an additional insured.the insurance policies also separately identified the location of magnolia four nursing homes by their mississippi address.it is undisputed that lunch,and not magnolia,applied for and procured the policies and that the policies were delivered to lunch in louisiana,where lunch paid the policy premiums.
while the insurance policies were in effect,magnolia was sued in fourteen civil actions in mississippi state court,with each suit arising out of magnolia operation of its nursing home business in mississippi.pursuant to its duties under the insurance policies,hartford defended magnolia in each case,but did so under a reservation of rights magnolia also independently retained counsel in the fourteen lawsuits.thereafter,magnolia sought reimbursement from hartford for legal fees incurred by its counsel.hartford declined to pay the fees.
magnolia and foundation then filed suit against hartford in mississippi state court on october,asserting breach of contract and various tort claims in an effort to recover the legal fees incurred by its counsel.on december,hartford removed to federal court in the northern district of mississippi on the basis of diversity.however,prior to learning of the suit,hartford filed its own action against foundation in louisiana federal court on october.hartford suit sought a declaration that it had no duty to pay the legal fees incurred by magnolia counsel.pursuant to foundation motion,the louisiana federal court transferred hartford suit to the northern district of mississippi where the suit brought by magnolia and foundation was pending.
following the transfer,the district court considered the two cases together,although they have never been consolidated.the district court limited discovery in both cases to the issue of which state law should apply to the attorney fee dispute.eventually hartford filed a motion for declaratory judgment and partial summary judgment in both cases,and foundation and magnolia moved for partial summary judgment in the case they originally filed.on november,the district court filed a written order concluding that mississippi law applied to the dispute.consequently,the court granted partial summary judgment to foundation and magnolia,and denied hartford motions in each case.in the case originally brought by hartford,the denial of hartford motion for declaratory judgment resulted in a final judgment dismissing that case.hartford has timely appealed the dismissal and we presently consider that appeal here.the appeal in the case originally brought by magnolia and foundation,case number,is disposed of in a separate opinion.
discussion 
standard of review and choice of law principles 
this court reviews questions of law,including conflicts of law questions,de novo and district court factual determinations for clear error.abraham state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.we also review de novo the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action when the dismissal is based on a question of law.sobranes recovery pool i,llc todd hughes constr,cir.
magnolia is seeking reimbursement for attorney fees incurred by its counsel in suits where hartford defended magnolia under a reservation of rights.mississippi law requires an insurer defending an insured under a reservation of rights to provide the insured with independent counsel because of the conflict that is created.twin city fire ins.city of madison,cir applying moeller am.guar.liab.ins,so d.conversely,louisiana law does not require an insurer to furnish independent counsel merely because it defends an insured under a reservation of rights.see trinity universal ins.stevens forestry,cir applying louisiana law see also union fire ins.of pittsburgh,circle,cir a n insurer does not automatically breach its duty to defend merely because it reserves the right to deny coverage under the policy.applying louisiana law because foundation would have a viable cause of action to recover the attorney fees under mississippi law,but not under louisiana law,we must conduct a choice of law analysis to determine which law applies.see zurich am.ins.goodwin,so d,choice of law analysis arises only when there is a true conflict between the laws of two states,each having an interest in the litigation.see also chapman thrasher trucking,considering a choice of law analysis necessary only for conflicts hav ing a significant effect on the outcome of the case.
sitting in diversity,we apply the choice of law rules of the forum state to determine which state substantive law applies.in re katrina canal breaches,cir.the forum state,mississippi,resolves choice of law issues by applying the following steps determine whether the laws at issue are substantive or procedural if substantive,classify the laws as either tort,property,or contract and look to the relevant section of the restatement second of conflict of laws.see zurich,so d at.
regarding the first step,we conclude that this issue is substantive in nature.t he law of the forum determines whether an issue in the action is substantive or procedural in nature.actions.in mississippi,few laws are classified as procedural and for choice of law purposes the mississippi supreme court has labeled as procedural only rules of evidence and procedure,statutes of limitations,and awards of attorney fees and interest.see zurich,so d at.while this dispute generally involves reimbursement for attorney fees,the more precise issue is whether an insurer must provide an insured with independent counsel when defending them under a reservation of rights.because resolution of this issue determines whether foundation has a viable cause of action,and not merely whether a party is entitled to attorney fees for prevailing in a particular case,the issue is substantive.see hancock watson,so d,see also zurich,so d at.
second,the parties assert,and we agree,that this issue is contractual in nature.finally,regarding the third step,mississippi courts seek to determine the center of gravity of a dispute and apply the law of the place which has the most significant relationship to the event and parties or which,because of the relationship or contact with the event and parties,has the greatest concern with the specific issues zurich,so d at internal quotation marks omitted.in applying this approach,mississippi has embraced the restatement second of conflict of laws.ingalls shipbuilding fed.ins,cir.three restatement sections are potentially relevant here sections,and.
application of the relevant restatement sections 
magnolia urges us to analyze this case under section,which applies to all kinds of insurance contracts,except those providing life insurance.see boardman united servs.auto.ass n,so d.section states that the rights created by such a contract 
are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy,unless with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in to the transaction and the parties,in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.
restatement second of conflict of laws.the location of the insured risk will be given greater weight than any other single contact in determining the state of the applicable law provided that the risk can be located,at least principally,in a single state.id.cmt.however,where the policy covers a group of risks that are scattered throughout two or more states the location of the risk has less significance.id.
it is undisputed that the insurance policies at issue cover risks in seven states.section comment f allows separate consideration of risks for the purpose of determining the principal location of the insured risk when a policy insures multiple risks in several states that require a special statutory form to be incorporated into the policy.id.cmt.relying on this provision,some courts treat virtually any policy insuring multiple sites as a separate policy as to each insured location,regardless of whether there is an identifiable single principal of the risk.employers mut.cas.lennox int l,d,collecting cases.although it is not clear how mississippi would interpret comment f,this court has held that is pertinent only if there is,in fact,a single state which can be identified as the principal location of the risks insured by a policy.id.for example,in sandefer oil gas,aig oil rig of texas,we refused to separately consider each insured risk and held that s ection is inapplicable here because the insured risk was located in various states texas,oklahoma,and louisiana,cir.
without controlling authority to the contrary,we feel compelled to apply the plain language section,which speaks in terms of one principal location of the insured risk.see restatement second of conflict of laws.it is inescapable that the policies at issue insure risks in several states.employers,d at t here is no question but that when the policies are viewed as a whole,as they should be,there is no principal location of the risks insured.thus,the location of the insured risk has less significance and section does not compel us to apply mississippi law.see restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.
next,restatement section provides that the law that has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties should be applied.restatement second of conflict of laws.section lists several factors to be considered in determining which state has the most substantial relationship to the parties and the dispute 
a the place of contracting,
b the place of negotiation of the contract,
c the place of performance,
d the location of the subject matter of the contract,and 
e the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.
id.the mississippi supreme court has not applied this test in a mathematical or mechanical fashion,and uses the factors as a practical way to determine the center of gravity of a contract issue.see zurich,so d at see also boardman,so d at.importantly,these factors are to be applied to determine the law applicable to an issue and the contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to th at particular issue.restatement second of conflict of laws emphasis added see zurich,so d at applying the law that has the greatest concern with the specific issues raised see also boardman,so d at focusing on the contacts only as they related to the question.the particular issue to be decided here is whether hartford must provide independent counsel for magnolia when defending magnolia under a reservation of rights in mississippi state court with that specific issue in mind,we consider the relevant factors.
regarding the place of contracting,we agree with hartford and the district court that the place of contracting was most likely louisiana.further,the contract negotiation,to the extent there was any,likely occurred in louisiana.courts in mississippi and elsewhere have recognized that these factors can be the most relevant in determining the law applicable to contract formation disputes and disputes involving pure contract interpretation,including those concerning an insurer duty to defend.see employers mutual,d at duty to defend case see also sandefer oil gas,at finding the place of negotiation and place of contracting particularly important to the issue of determining coverage under a policy see also indep.petrochemical aetna cas.sur,concluding,in a dispute over what law determined the effect of an insured failure to disclose pending litigation when applying for insurance,that the place of negotiation and formation of the contract was paramount.
we recognize that the place of contracting and place of negotiation are often relevant to disputes involving contract interpretation.further,we acknowledge that,to some extent,whether hartford has a duty to provide independent counsel to magnolia is related to the scope of hartford contractual duty to defend.however,this case is different from the typical contract interpretation case.typically,a duty to defend provision can be interpreted without reference to where the underlying defending is taking place,because the task of pure contract interpretation merely requires the court to ascertain the parties intent from the language of the contract itself and,at times,the circumstances surrounding formation of the contract.see one south,hollowell,so d,discussing contract interpretation principles.this case is different because the issue of whether hartford owed a duty to provide magnolia with independent counsel is closely connected to the court where the defending took place.the court where a case is tried has a substantial interest in preventing conflicts of interest.in other words,the court where a claim is tried has little interest in whether an insurer duty to defend is triggered under an insurance contract,but it does have a significant interest in whether independent counsel is provided to avoid a conflict of interest.see moeller,so d at.thus,although the critical issue is,in a broad sense,related to interpretation of an insurance contract,we find that the place of negotiation and contracting are not of primary importance in determining the law to be applied to this narrow issue.
considering the place of performance factor,the performance required by these insurance contracts was the payment of premiums by foundation for certain insurance coverage to be provided by hartford,which included the duty to defend suits brought against the insureds.foundation performance may have occurred in louisiana where it paid the policy premiums,but hartford performance,at least as relevant to the specific issue presented here,occurred in mississippi where it defended magnolia in fourteen lawsuits under a reservation of rights.we find this to be the salient factor in our analysis and find it helpful to distinguish several similar types of cases.
first,when an insurer performance is limited to the payment of policy proceeds,the place where those proceeds are to be paid is often ignored or simply not considered the place of performance.see zurich,so d at see houston cas.certain underwriters at lloyd london,d,the insured obligation under the parties agreement was to pay a premium the insurer obligation was to indemnify certain losses.where the losses occurred did not affect either obligation.the rationale is that when the performance is limited to payment of proceeds,the place where the payment is made seems,in truth,of no particular consequence.houston cas,d at.however,in this case,hartford relevant performance was its defense of magnolia in mississippi state court.the location of that performance is relevant because it implicates mississippi moeller rule,requiring provision of independent counsel for litigation in mississippi courts.see moeller,so d at.
second,courts interpreting a provision in an insurance contract often do not find it necessary to look to the place where the underlying conduct occurred.see,zurich,so d at.for example,in zurich the relevant issue required interpr
