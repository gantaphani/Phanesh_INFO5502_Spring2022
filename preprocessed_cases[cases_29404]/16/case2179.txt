this is an appeal of a grant of summary judgment.apj associates ap,a manufacturer representative firm,signed a series of agreements with north american philips philips,a microprocessor supplier.after philips terminated the agreement,ap brought suit,claiming it is entitled to sales commissions due to fraudulent inducement,promissory estoppel,and the michigan sales representative act.comp.laws ann.for the reasons set forth,this court affirms the district court.
procedural and factual background 
ap signed the first of the manufacturer representative contracts with philips in.philips,through its subsidiary signetics,manufactured electronic components for automobile cruise control systems and wanted to become a supplier for general motors gm.philips hired ap to develop a business relationship between philips and gm,with the goal of eventually landing a contract to supply circuits for cruise control in gm automobiles.ultimately philips did execute a contract with gm,but it also terminated its representative agreement with ap.
the sales representative agreements 
ap was a manufacturer representative firm with a reputation for developing business relationships with several companies,including gm.an ap electrical engineer named ron michalak began working with gm microprocessor unit,ac rochester,in.it was allegedly because of this contact and ap reputation for being successful at introducing companies to gm that philips sought ap services.
in december,ap and philips negotiated a sales representative agreement the agreement.this agreement included a termination clause either party may terminate the agreement for its convenience upon at least thirty days prior written notice of termination.at.addendum c to the agreement set forth a schedule for commissions,which would be based on sales solicited and orders received by customer location within representative territory at.the contract further provided that philips would provide ap a budget to perform its work and would pay ap commissions on a variable rate.
in the termination clause,the agreement stated that unless there was a negative backlog in payments there would be no commissions paid on sales.at.the agreement also contained an integration clause which was also included in the subsequent agreements,stating that the written contract constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relative to the sales representation and supercedes sic and replaces all prior or contemporaneous agreements,written and verbal at.the contract made no mention of any specific tasks such as introducing philips to gm.
the agreement only ran days,expiring on december.in january,the parties executed another agreement,with similar provisions,for a term the agreement.the agreement provided for commissions to be paid based on all shipments of product made to and developmental charges paid by customers within representative territory at.the agreement contained the same termination for convenience clause.at.
before signing the agreement,ap president jim alexander complained to philips sales manager rich lesinski about the termination clause.lesinski agreed to bring it up with his superiors.at.however,philips did not allow any change in the terms of the agreement,and alexander signed it as written.alexander testified that he did so,despite his objection to the termination clause,because he was told that the contract was corporate policy and you had to accept it.at.according to ap,the representatives from philips informed alexander that,while the written contract came from the home office and was not negotiable,ap need worry because the oral agreement they negotiated was the actual agreement ap also alleges that alexander was told that no sales representative of philips was ever terminated as long as sale targets were met,and that philips policy was that sales equal commissions.
in january,the parties signed another agreement.the agreement contained a termination clause to which alexander objected but nonetheless signed.in january,the parties executed yet another agreement,again with a termination clause.the agreement changed the way commissions would be paid it substituted a flat commission rate for the previous system of a variable commission rate and a budget.alexander again objected to the termination clause but was told it was not negotiable.alexander declined to bring the matter up with senior officials at philips,testifying that it was not a politically correct thing to do.at.
ap work and termination 
in march,ap arranged a meeting with representatives of philips and gm.according to ap,ron michalak dedicated about one and days per week to the project.throughout,ap continued to arrange meetings and generally acted as the liaison between philips and gm.on february,gm sent a letter to philips confirming that philips had been chosen to develop a cruise control module for production years beginning in.at.this was a momentous occasion for philips.through,ap continued to act as the facilitator for communications between philips and gm.
on september,philips notified ap that it was terminating the representative agreement effective november.according to ap,this came as a complete shock,because the relationship seemed to be progressing well.just two weeks earlier,on september,gm had asked philips for a quote on a proposed new microprocessor.the termination letter stated that c ommissions will be paid in accordance with the agreement.at.
philips decided to terminate ap in order to assume the management of the gm account itself.ap alleges that it was philips policy unknown at the time to ap to take all accounts that reached a certain size under something called a major accounts program.a former philips employee testified that while philips did sometimes decide to take over the management of its accounts from representative firms,there was no set policy or account size for triggering such a decision.rather,philips decided which accounts to manage by itself on a basis.at.
in february,philips sent ap a check for as a final reconciliation and a letter stating that the endorsement of the check verifie d the completion and acknowledgment of the relationship and released philips of all obligations.at.ap deposited the check.ap did no further work for philips after the termination letter.gm subsequently purchased the microprocessors from philips,and they have been installed in gm cars since.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.hammon dhl airways,cir.in doing so,we must view the evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the nonmovant.keever city of middletown,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the written agreements 
ap contends that equitable estoppel prohibits philips from relying on the four corners of the contracts,that extrinsic evidence is necessary to interpret the terms of the agreements between the parties,and that the district court committed error by holding that the written documents constituted the entire agreement.
under michigan law,a court may not consider extrinsic evidence where the terms of the agreement are clear and unambiguous.sault marie tribe of chippewa indians engler,cir.here,the terms of all four agreements are neither unclear nor inconsistent.the termination clause,included over alexander repeated objections and ratified in the three subsequent agreements,does not indicate any question as to whether the relationship could be terminated at the will of either party.the very fact that alexander protested the clause every year shows that he was only too well aware of its implications.since philips continually refused to make any modification to that term,and since ap continued to sign the contract,it may not supplant those agreements with evidence of contemporaneous assurances of a relationship.see,novak nationwide mut.ins.
