two telecommunications carriers,coretel virginia,llc and verizon virginia,llc,dispute their respective responsibilities under their interconnection agreement ica,a contract which governs how the carriers connect their networks and exchange data.each party contends that the other improperly billed it for various services.the district court granted summary judgment in verizon favor on each claim.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the district court decision with respect to verizon facilities claims,but affirm as to the others.
ironically,in pursuit of its preferred result,the dissent does exactly what it accuses the majority of doing.as we explain in greater detail below,the dissent interprets the ica as the dissent imagines it should have been written,and not as it was.with no textual support,and in contravention of the cardinal rule that a contract must be interpreted as a whole,giving effect to all its terms,the dissent elevates to an isolated and independent status,renders superfluous the only provision that specifically deals with interconnection,and altogether ignores,which explicitly provides that headings are to have no substantive effect on the agreement meaning.
the at issue here is a private contract that implements duties imposed by the telecommunications act of,stat,codified at et.we therefore begin with a brief discussion of the relevant provisions of the telecommunications act and the key provisions of the parties ica before turning to the procedural history before us.
the telecommunications act seeks to foster competition in the telecommunications market by reducing the competitive advantages enjoyed by the telecommunications carriers,known as incumbent carriers,that enjoyed a monopoly in the market at the time the statute was enacted.the act requires incumbent carriers to share their physical networks with new market entrants,known as competing carriers,to mitigate the prohibitive cost of building a new network.this appeal implicates two of the duties imposed on incumbent carriers under.
first,c allows a competing carrier to lease components of an incumbent carrier physical network for any purpose if an incumbent failure to provide these elements would impair the competing carrier ability to provide services.c,d b.an incumbent carrier must provide these network elements at rates,known as telric,as opposed to higher tariff rates c,d b see also implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of local competition order.these network elements also must be unbundled,meaning that they must be offered individually,and not only as part of a broader package of services.c talk.bell,local competition order.
second,c promotes interconnection,the physical link between two telecommunications networks that allows each carrier customers to call the other.the fcc has interpreted c to require,among other things,that an incumbent carrier lease a competing carrier entrance facilities required for interconnection at telric see unbundled access to network elements remand order,review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exch.carriers triennial review order,see also talk.at.
until,the fcc had also interpreted c to require incumbent carriers to provide all entrance facilities at telric.however,the fcc reversed course in its triennial review order and remand order.it concluded that because entrance facilities are less costly to build,are more widely available from alternative providers,and have greater revenue potential,an incumbent carrier failure to provide access to these facilities would not impair the viability of competing carriers.remand order,the fcc determined,therefore,that incumbent carriers need not provide entrance facilities on an unbundled basis at telric rates under c.id.at.
significantly,however,the fcc did not alter incumbent carriers duties under c,the provision that specifically governs interconnection.id.at.therefore,while an incumbent carrier no longer has a general obligation to provide entrance facilities at telric under c,it remains obligated to provide entrance facilities at telric when they are used for interconnection under c.see talk.at remand order,triennial review order.
with this regulatory framework in mind,we now turn to the ica between verizon,an incumbent carrier,and coretel,a competing carrier.a close examination of the ica is necessary because the duties discussed above are not directly enforceable.see c,a.instead,these duties only apply if they are incorporated into an ica.see core commc ns,sbc commc ns,vacated on other grounds by sbc commc ns fcc.
the interplay between the ica and the relevant statutory provisions is further complicated by the fact that the ica is an adoption of an existing ica under i.because the original ica took effect before the fcc reinterpreted c in its triennial review order and remand order,the adoption agreement that accompanies the ica contains a provision meant to clarify verizon duties in light of the changed regulatory backdrop.see ica adoption agreement.b.section.b of the adoption agreement provides that,adoption of the ica does not include adoption of any provision imposing an unbundling obligation on verizon that no longer applies to verizon under the triennial review order and remand order.
to aid in our analysis,we will discuss four provisions of the ica.section addresses interconnection,addresses the leasing of network elements,sets out a compensation regime for local calls,and exhibit a lists the rates that apply to the agreement.we now address each briefly in turn.
ica,interconnection and physical architecture,addresses the physical interconnection of the parties two networks.this section provides that coretel may specify one of three physical methods to connect with verizon at an interconnection point.ica.one of the methods allows coretel to lease an entrance facility from verizon id.coretel may request any of the listed interconnection methods at the rates and charges,set forth in this agreement,in any applicable tariff s,or as may be subsequently agreed to between the parties.ica.the ica provides verizon analogous rights to interconnect with coretel.ica.
ica,unbundled access,enumerates the network elements,including entrance facilities,that verizon will provide to coretel on an unbundled basis.this section primarily consists of a detailed list of network elements,expressed in highly technical terms,and the parameters under which they may be ordered id.
ica,reciprocal compensation and other intercarrier compensation arrangements,provides a distinct billing regime for local calls originating within verizon network and terminating within coretel network,local calls from verizon customers to coretel customers,and vice versa.these calls are billed per minute of usage as reciprocal compensation by the recipient carrier.see ica,a,ica exhibit a.
finally,ica exhibit a lists telric rates for various network elements and includes rates for leasing entrance facilities under the heading unbundled transport.ica exhibit a.it also includes rates for reciprocal compensation.ica exhibit a.
soon after the parties agreed to their ica,a dispute arose regarding the rates coretel is required to pay for interconnection entrance facilities.verizon insisted that coretel pay tariff rates and coretel refused.this dispute continued until when verizon finally threatened to terminate coretel service.coretel brought suit seeking to enjoin verizon threatened service termination.verizon filed various counterclaims,and coretel amended its complaint to add still more claims.the district court ultimately divided these claims and counterclaims into four broad categories verizon facilities claims relating to its bills to coretel for the entrance facilities coretel leased coretel facilities claims relating to its bills to verizon for the entrance facilities that coretel contends verizon leased verizon reciprocal compensation claims and verizon claims that coretel improperly billed it for services under coretel tariffs.
the district court granted summary judgment in verizon favor on each issue,but on liability only.it reserved the question of damages for trial.the parties then jointly moved for a final judgment reflecting the stipulated damages that are required by the district court summary judgment ruling to expedite an appeal.joint motion.the district court entered the final judgment,and this appeal followed.
each of the issues discussed below was resolved on motions for summary judgment.accordingly,we review each under the same familiar standard 
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the nonmoving party.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

on appeal,coretel challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in verizon favor on all claims.for clarity,we adopt the district court categorization of the claims,and address each category in turn.
we first address verizon claims relating to the applicable rates for entrance facilities.verizon contends that.b of the adoption agreement eliminated its obligation under the ica to provide entrance facilities at telric for any purpose.as a result,verizon has billed coretel for its interconnection entrance facilities at tariff rates since the adoption of the ica.coretel has refused to pay those rates,maintaining that the ica permits it to pay the lower telric rates.
we agree with the dissent that this is,ultimately,a contract dispute and,as with any contract,we interpret the ica according to its terms.but the dissent ignores both the cardinal principle of contract construction that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,and the fundamental rule that,when the written terms of an agreement are clear,evidence of the parties intent is utterly inadmissible.moran prather.
as discussed above,ica is the only provision of the ica that deals specifically with interconnection.within that section,authorizes coretel to order an entrance facility leased from verizon for interconnection.ica then provides that coretel may order this entrance facility at the rates and charges,set forth in this agreement,in any applicable tariff s,or as may be subsequently agreed to between the parties.id.exhibit a of the ica lists,in turn,the schedule of rates for various network elements and services,including telric rates for entrance facilities.ica exhibit a.though verizon contends otherwise,the most natural reading of these provisions is that the telric rates listed at exhibit a.are the rates and charges,set forth in this agreement referred to in ica.
verizon advances an alternative interpretation of the ica.ica,it contends,does not give rise to any independent obligation to make entrance facilities available at telric but,instead,simply indicates that entrance facilities may be leased under for interconnection.in verizon view.b of the adoption agreement eliminates its obligation under to provide entrance facilities at telric for any purpose.it contends that entrance facilities are therefore unavailable at those rates under.
simply put,no provision of the ica indicates that relies upon in the way verizon suggests.as explained above,ica imposes an obligation on verizon,independent of,to offer entrance facilities at the telric rates listed in exhibit therefore we need not consider the impact of.b of the adoption agreement on the services available under.section.b of the adoption agreement does not affect our analysis of ica because verizon duties under ica arise under the specific interconnection provisions of c.these duties were unaltered by the triennial review order and the remand order,the fcc orders incorporated by the adoption agreement.
we further note that our conclusion in no way renders the entrance facility provisions of ica superfluous.ica permitted coretel to purchase entrance facilities for purposes not addressed by ica,such as backhauling.see talk.at.
verizon and the dissent arguments based on the ica drafters intent are similarly unavailing.verizon argues,and the dissent accepts,that the drafters of the ica would never have suspected that c imposed a duty,independent of c,to provide entrance facilities for interconnection at telric because the fcc first explicitly articulated that obligation after the ica was drafted,in the triennial review order.thus,verizon argues,there is no reason to think the drafters intended to write such an obligation into the ica.
this contention fails for at least two fundamental reasons.first,like any contract,an ica is interpreted according to its written terms.cent.of,at.if a contract language is clear,we may not choose to supplement it with evidence of the drafters intent.see moran,at.as explained above,we find the language of the ica sufficiently clear to establish that verizon must offer entrance facilities at telric for interconnection,without resort to the intent of its drafters.
second,we find verizon speculation about the drafters subjective views unpersuasive.contrary to verizon and the dissent contentions,there are indications that the drafters of the ica regarded c as imposing an independent duty to provide entrance facilities for interconnection at rates.the most obvious indication is the very existence of.this section would have been curiously redundant if c and ica already required that entrance facilities be provided at rates for interconnection but c did not.moreover,this obligation flows clearly from the text of the telecommunications act itself and longstanding fcc regulations.section c requires incumbent carriers to provide interconnection at any technically feasible point within the carrier network,and the fcc had long interpreted the carrier network to include its entrance facilities.see talk.at local competition order.therefore,s ince the enactment of the act,the fcc has consistently construed c to mean that an incumbent may be required to provide facilities to a competitor in order to link the two carriers networks.brief for the united states as amicus curiae supporting petitioners at,talk.bell.
we therefore conclude that the ica entitles coretel to order entrance facilities for interconnection at telric accordingly,coretel was entitled to summary judgment in its favor on both its and verizon claims for declaratory relief relating to verizon facilities charges.we remand to the district court for consideration of coretel claim for injunctive relief and verizon damages claim in light of this conclusion.
we next turn to coretel facilities claims.after coretel initiated this case,coretel submitted new more than verizon for facilities charges beginning in.these charges,coretel contends,are for trunk ports and used to handle calls delivered by verizon to coretel.coretel concedes that verizon provided its own means of reaching coretel switch.but it contends that the ports and multiplexers that it provided on its side of the interconnection point qualify as entrance facilities and,accordingly,may be billed to verizon under ica and 
we agree with verizon that the multiplexing and trunk ports at issue are not entrance facilities under the ica.ica therefore provides no basis for coretel facilities charges.
as it is defined in the ica,an entrance facility is a facility connecting and,crucially,lying between the interconnecting carrier premises and the other party central office.ica.but the trunk ports and multiplexers coretel provided lay within coretel central office,not between coretel central office and verizon premises.thus,verizon facilities,not coretel,spanned the distance between verizon premises and coretel central office.accordingly,the facilities coretel provided were not entrance facilities under ica 
coretel also contends that it was entitled to bill verizon for its use of these facilities because they were necessary to the use of verizon facilities.but coretel points to no provision of the ica that authorizes coretel to simply levy facilities charges for any piece of equipment that handles verizon traffic.instead,the ica provides that coretel is to be compensated for the use of these facilities,on its side of the interconnection point,exclusively under the rubric of reciprocal compensation.
we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on coretel facilities claims.
we next address verizon reciprocal compensation claims.as discussed above,when a local call is generated on one party network and terminates on the other network,the party on whose network the call terminates may bill the originating party for reciprocal compensation.see ica,a.however,the ica exempts two categories of traffic from this scheme traffic and interlata traffic.see ica a c.
verizon claims that coretel violated these provisions by charging it reciprocal compensation for and interlata calls.coretel does not contest this allegation.instead,coretel argues that verizon should have to pay reciprocal compensation charges for a call when it does not provide emi data for it,data coretel claims is needed to properly categorize every call.
however,neither the ica nor the fcc order on which coretel seeks to rely,cavalier telephone llc,support this conclusion.simply put,there is no provision of the ica that requires verizon to provide emi data for every call delivered over the trunk at issue.in addition,cavalier telephone is not controlling.cavalier telephone was an arbitration order under u.e relating to a separate interconnection agreement between verizon and cavalier telephone.it required only that a provision be inserted into that particular ica regarding verizon duty to provide emi data to cavalier telephone,not that all carriers provide emi data independent of the terms of their icas.see id.adopting coretel argument would frustrate the regulatory approach articulated by the fcc in its core commc ns order by allowing carriers to enforce duties not embodied in their own icas.see core commc ns,
we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in verizon favor on coretel reciprocal compensation claims.
we now address verizon claims that coretel improperly billed it for services under its tariffs.verizon contends that it is entitled to recoup,under the doctrine,amounts that it paid to coretel for switched access because the description of that service in coretel tariff was inaccurate the doctrine requires that,to charge for services under a tariff,a carrier must provide its services in exactly the way the carrier describes them in that tariff.bryan bellsouth commc ns,cir brown mci worldcom network,cir 
coretel state and federal tariffs provide that coretel switching service will include terminations in the end office of end user lines.fcc tariff.scc tariff,c.the fcc has held that this tariff language carries a specific and established meaning a physical transmission facility that provides a connection between a customer premises and a telephone company office.at t ymax comm.ymax,f.to provide terminations in the end office of end user lines,a carrier must provide physical transmission facilities that establish connections between the premises of parties and the carrier equipment.ymax.
the undisputed evidence establishes that coretel does not provide the physical infrastructure over which calls are delivered from coretel premises to its customers.instead,as in ymax,coretel converts incoming calls into a data stream once they reach its office and then delivers these calls to its customers over the public internet.see ymax,k,q r,t w.this evidence makes clear that coretel has not deployed its own physical facilities to connect it to its customers and,accordingly,does not provide terminations in the end office of end user lines as required by its tariffs.
it is no mere technicality that the language of coretel tariff requires that coretel itself provide the facilities.switching charges are among the highest recurring charges in any carrier tariff,a price that is ordinarily justified by the need to allow local exchange carriers to recover the substantial investment required to construct the tangible connections between themselves and their customers throughout their service territory.ymax.a carrier that finds a way to deliver incoming calls to its customers without building physical connections to each of them has far less infrastructure investment to recoup.
coretel argues in the alternative that its tariffs,unlike those in ymax,explicitly permit it to charge for switchedaccess service provided using ip technology.see fcc tariff.but this language only appears in coretel general definition of service.id.the language interpreted in ymax,discussed above,appears in coretel more specific definition of the particular type of switched access service at issue,switched access.id.at.the specific governs the general.see radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank.the language of coretel switching service does not permit that specific tariff rate to be applied when coretel delivers calls to customers over the public internet rather than using a physical facility owed by coretel 
we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in verizon favor on verizon claims.
for the reasons above,the judgment of the district court is 
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded with instructions.
this is a straightforward contract dispute between two telecommunications companies,coretel and verizon,over the fees each agreed to pay the other in interconnecting their networks.when verizon pressed coretel to pay over in amounts for entrance facilities that coretel leased from verizon,coretel commenced this action.
while each party has disputed various amounts payable to the other,the principal dispute,on which i disagree with the majority,is whether coretel agreed to pay verizon a tariff rate or a lower rate for lease of verizon entrance facilities for the purpose of interconnection.reading the contract as a whole and in context,i conclude that it clearly required coretel to pay tariff rates,as the district court also concluded.
i respectfully submit that the majority has rewritten this private agreement to bring it in line with what coretel might have been able to obtain through negotiations when it signed the contract,based on changing interpretations of the telecommunications act of,which regulates such agreements.that is,it focuses on what coretel could have demanded under the law,not on what coretel actually agreed to accept when it executed the written contract.no one contends that the written contract was or is unenforceable or not in compliance with the telecommunications act.indeed,the telecommunications act itself allows the parties to negotiate the rates and fees to be paid for connecting networks.see.
thus,i would enforce the contract according to its terms and affirm the judgment of the district court.
verizon referring collectively to verizon virginia llc and verizon south is an incumbent local exchange carrier incumbent lec that has been providing telephone exchange services throughout virginia since before the enactment of the telecommunications act of.in enacting that act,congress sought to introduce competition in the telecommunications market by lowering the barriers to entry for competitors.to this end,the act requires incumbent lecs to share their networks with any competitive local exchange carrier competitive lec and allow the competitive lec to lease from the incumbent lec unbundled network elements,a la carte network elements enabling the competitive lec to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch,talk.bell,and to interconnect with the incumbent lec network.
these obligations are codified in two statutory provisions.section c of the act requires incumbent lecs to provide competitive lecs with nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis.c emphasis added.and,in a similar vein,c requires an incumbent lec to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the local exchange carrier network for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access.id.c emphasis added.for such unbundled network elements and interconnection,the incumbent lec may only charge rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.id.c d,c.but the telecommunications act makes clear that those rates,terms,and conditions are subject to negotiation by the parties.see id.a.
coretel virginia,llc,is a competitive lec that,like verizon,serves customers in virginia.when it requested unbundled network elements and interconnection from verizon,the parties entered into an agreement on november,adoption agreement,which adopted the terms and conditions of an earlier,arbitrated interconnection agreement between verizon and cox virginia telcom,interconnection agreement.the adoption agreement incorporated all the terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement with several modifications,including a modification that the adoption agreement did not include adoption of any provision in the interconnection agreement imposing an unbundling obligation on verizon because,as the adoption agreement explained,that obligation no longer applied to verizon as a result of a fcc order,in re review of section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exch.carriers triennial order,fcc rcd,and subsequent related decisions.
with respect to the entrance facilities that are at issue in this case,the interconnection agreement authorized coretel to interconnect through,among other options,an entrance facility leased from verizon in accordance with terms and conditions,including without limitation,rates and charges set forth in this agreement,in any applicable tariff s,or as may be subsequently agreed to between the parties.interconnection agreement.the rates and charges set forth in this agreement were those described in exhibit a,entitled detailed schedule of itemized charges.exhibit a included a category of rates called unbundled transport,under which it specified rates for entrance facilities,as are at issue here.and the terms for unbundled transport were set forth in of the agreement.the parties agree that exhibit a rates and charges were costbased.under the terms of the adoption agreement,however,verizon unbundling obligations were eliminated,leading verizon to bill coretel for entrance facilities not as unbundled elements under the rate in exhibit a,but as entrance facilities under verizon tariff rates.
although verizon thus billed coretel each month over the course of some eight years for entrance facilities at tariff rates,coretel maintained that it should only have been charged rates and refused even to pay those rates,making only a single payment of in february.by the time of this litigation,it had run up a bill of over,based on verizon billings at tariff rates.
when verizon sent coretel notice of default and threatened to terminate service,coretel commenced this action.while the parties have fought over various amounts owed,the main issue presented to us on appeal is whether the interconnection agreement,as modified by the adoption agreement,entitled coretel to pay only rates for entrance facilities for the purpose of interconnection instead of the tariff rates that verizon billed.
the district court concluded that the interconnection agreement did not give coretel a right to lease entrance facilities for interconnection at rates,even though coretel could have insisted on such rates when the adoption agreement was executed.despite this legal right,the district court noted that coretel was bound by the terms of the contract to which it actually agreed.the court thus entered judgment in favor of verizon.
based on the contract as written,i agree with the district court and conclude that coretel was required to pay tariff rates for entrance facilities,as verizon billed it.
the structure of the obligations between the parties is readily apparent from the agreement taken as a whole.section of the interconnection agreement authorized coretel to specify any of three different methods by which to connect with verizon network,including through an entrance facility.and provided that the rates and charges for such facilities were as set forth in this agreement,set forth in any applicable tariff s,or as may be subsequently agreed to between the parties.but critically,did not directly refer to any rates.in fact,the only rates for entrance facilities actually set forth in the agreement,were referenced in,which governed only unbundled access.section addressed interoffice transmission facilities and provided that verizon shall provide coretel with dedicated local transport,common local transport in conjunction with unbundled local switching,unbundled interoffice transmission facilities,and other services in accordance with exhibit interconnection agreement,emphasis added.and part ii of exhibit a listed rates for unbundled elements,including a rate for entrance facilities.id.exhibit a,part.no other part of exhibit a mentioned entrance facilities they were listed only under unbundled transport.
in short,the interconnection agreement provided that entrance facilities were to be billed either at tariff rates or,if leased as unbundled elements,at rates as set forth in exhibit those rates were the only rates and charges set forth in the interconnection agreement.thus,under the agreement,if charges for entrance facilities were not payable in accordance with exhibit a,they were only payable at tariff rates.
the interconnection agreement provisions allowing for purchase of unbundled network elements at rates were,at the time in,necessitated by c,which required verizon,as an incumbent lec,to provide any requesting competitive lec,such as coretel,unbundled network elements at a reasonable,nondiscriminatory rate.and that rate was established by the fcc,in interpreting c,to be its telric rate standing for total element long run incremental costs a rate based on the hypothetical construction and operation of the most efficient local network conceivable.gte south,morrison,cir.
after the interconnection agreement was executed,however,the law regarding c unbundling requirements changed.the fcc,in its triennial order,interpreted c not to require incumbents to provide competitive lecs with entrance facilities as unbundled network elements at costbased rates.instead,the fcc concluded that entrance facilities must be provided at rates only for the limited purpose of interconnection 
we conclude that our previous definition of c was overly broad.as we explain in this part,competitive lecs often use transmission links including unbundled transport connecting incumbent lec switches or wire centers in order to carry traffic to and from its end users unlike the facilities that incumbent lecs explicitly must make available for section c interconnection,we find that the act does not require incumbent lecs to unbundle transmission facilities connecting incumbent lec networks to competitive lec networks for the purpose of backhauling traffic.
in reaching this determination we note that,to the extent that requesting carriers need facilities in order to interconnect with the incumbent lec network,section c of the act expressly provides for this and we do not alter the commission interpretation of this obligation.
