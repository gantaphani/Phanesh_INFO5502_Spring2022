defendant ahl shipping company ahl contaminated a portion of the oil cargo it transported for plaintiff bp north american petroleum bp while discharging the fuel from its vessel,the solar.following a bench trial,a damage award was ordered in favor of bp.bp appeals the amount of the award.it argues that,in ordering a modified expected profit award,the district court employed an improper formula in calculating damages.we agree and hold that the traditional measure of damages in damaged goods market value have been applied in this case.because this formula was not utilized,we remand the case to the district court for a determination of damages using an estimated market value of the damaged oil on the discharge date.
we begin with the facts.bp owned a cargo of diesel oil and regular unleaded gasoline.ahl owned and operated the solar.bp contracted to sell the oil to colonial oil for per gallon.ahl agreed to deliver the cargo from corpus christi,texas,to the colonial oil terminal in savannah,georgia.the cargo was uncontaminated when it was delivered to ahl and placed in the solar on august.
upon reaching savannah,the solar began discharging the diesel oil on august.during the discharging process,a portion of the diesel oil was contaminated with unleaded gasoline.the evidence later revealed that the contamination was the direct result of negligence on the part of ahl and the solar 
the market price of sound diesel on the day of contamination was per gallon.on september,about two weeks after the contamination,a richmond slop reprocessor offered to purchase the contaminated oil from bp at a discount of below market value,not including freight costs.including freight,bp could have sold the contaminated fuel for per gallon below the market price of sound oil.according to bp,it could not accept the offer because no transportation for delivery of the oil was available at that time.
on october,about seven weeks after the contamination,bp sold the contaminated oil for per gallon.however,the market value of uncontaminated diesel oil had risen to per gallon since the original date of contamination.therefore,during the time that bp held the contaminated oil,the price of oil had risen by about per gallon.
immediately after discovering that its cargo of diesel oil was contaminated,bp traded in the futures market in order to hedge against market price fluctuations in oil pending bp disposition of the contaminated oil specifically,bp sold futures contracts in the identical number of gallons of oil that had been contaminated in an attempt to the value of this oil pending disposition.the purpose of this transaction,of course,was to prevent bp from losing money if the market price of oil had fallen before it could sell the contaminated shipment.however,because the market price rose by twenty percent,bp suffered a loss on these futures contracts equal to the change in the price of oil per gallon.at the same time,however,bp was able to take advantage of this increase in the price of oil by selling the contaminated oil for a higher price in october.
bp sued for damages and was awarded only the difference in the initial contract price for sound oil minus the price bp eventually received seven weeks later for the contaminated oil an award of only per gallon.bp now appeals the district court calculation of damages,contending that the district court neglected to calculate bp actual losses by miscalculating the fair market value of the contaminated oil and,in the alternative,by failing to consider bp losses in the futures market.
as we have just noted,the district court calculated bp loss by subtracting the profit bp eventually received for the polluted oil from the profit bp would have received under its original colonial contract.stating that the goal is to place the injured cargo owner in the same position it was in before the damage,the court found that bp was not required to speculate in the futures market as a result of the oil contamination,and refused to award bp additional damages.in essence,the district court awarded bp damages based on its profit expectations at the time it made the contract,ignoring the fact that oil prices had risen dramatically between the time bp oil was contaminated and the time bp eventually sold the polluted oil the district court further ignored bp losses in the futures market.
bp argues that the district court,in assessing damages,should have calculated the difference between the market value of the sound oil and the market value of the polluted oil at the date of discharge,instead of using the price at which bp actually sold the contaminated oil seven weeks later.because the price of oil rose twenty percent over those seven weeks,the price at which bp eventually sold the contaminated oil was almost equal to the price of sound oil at the time of discharge.in the alternative,bp contends that it should be reimbursed for its futures losses and not be punished for attempting to hedge its position by trading on the futures market.it argues that the district court misunderstood the nature of hedging,consistently referring to bp activities as speculation.bp says it did nothing more than protect itself from price fluctuations,and in doing so prevented itself from both taking a loss or making a profit.
ahl,in turn,argues that the district court calculation was correct because there was no market for contaminated oil at the time of discharge,and it is therefore difficult to calculate the price of polluted oil at that time.ahl contends that the district court use of the price that bp eventually received for the contaminated oil was a reasonable means of determining bp loss at the time of discharge.ahl further asserts that,had bp not engaged in futures trading,it would have been placed in the same position it was in before the contamination.ahl argues that it should not be forced to pay for bp losses in the futures market.
both parties argue the issue of bp losses in the commodity futures market,with ahl arguing that these losses are unrecoverable and bp asserting that it should be compensated for those losses because they are legitimate related losses inasmuch as hedging is an acceptable form of risk reduction for an oil producer.the district court disagreed with bp,finding that its futures trading was speculation and concluding that bp was not required to speculate in the futures market as a result of the contamination.the court reasoned 
in engaging in speculation in the oil futures market,bp was taking a chance in the hopes of recouping a profit.had the market moved in the other direction,it would certainly not have offered to pay its futures market profits to ahl.
the district court characterization of bp futures trading was somewhat inaccurate,and this mischaracterization was the starting point from which the court jettisoned the traditional method of calculating damages in damaged cargo cases and awarded damages based on a more ad hoc calculation of bp expected profits.first,bp was a hedger in the futures market,not a speculator,as the district court asserted in its opinion bp actions were designed only to protect itself from financial loss after ahl contaminated the diesel oil.had bp not hedged its position,and the price of oil had dropped twenty percent pending disposition,bp would have lost considerable money by retaining the oil while the price fell.as a hedger,bp could not have profited from its futures trading,as the district court suggests,in the sense that any money made in futures trading would have been offset by an equivalent fall in the price bp received for the contaminated oil on the date of disposal.
although the district court mischaracterized the hedging activity by bp and the relevance of those futures transactions to a damages calculation here,bp is also mistaken in its argument that it must be compensated for futures losses.indeed,we think that under established law,bp futures trading is irrelevant to a proper calculation of damages in this case.we turn now to discuss the proper method of calculating damages in diminution of cargo value traditional market value rule.
we think that the law in this circuit is settled th
