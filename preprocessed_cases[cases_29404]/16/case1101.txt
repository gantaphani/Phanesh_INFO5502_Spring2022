plaintiff janelle frederico,for herself and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons,appeals a judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey that dismissed her complaint against the home depot.alleging fraud and breach of contract,the complaint was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to rules b and b,federal rules of civil procedure.
her action was originally filed in the superior court of new jersey,law division,middlesex county.home depot then removed the case to the district court for the district of new jersey.frederico made no motion to remand to state court.the district court decided that jurisdiction was proper under d,pursuant to the class action fairness act of cafa.after the matter reached us,we raised the issue of jurisdiction sua sponte and offered the parties an opportunity to respond by letter to our concerns.
a threshold matter requires our attention we must first decide whether the district court dismissal without prejudice meets the finality requirement of to vest this court with jurisdiction.we will decide that matter in the affirmative and proceed to consider which party has the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction in the removal process the extent of that party burden of proof and whether diversity jurisdiction is established by the record before us.after finding federal jurisdiction,we will address the merits of the case.for the reasons that follow we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
on saturday,august,frederico rented a flatbed truck from a home depot store located in south plainfield,new jersey,owned and operated by defendant.home depot regularly provides leases of trucks to customers to assist customers with the transportation of large purchases.during the transaction,frederico signed a vehicle delivery agreement agreement that provided date and time out pm and date and time due in pm.app.at.according to the agreement,frederico was to rent the truck for a total of minutes.the district court summarized other relevant terms of the agreement 
plaintiff truck was due back to the store at pm on august.
the rental rate for the truck was for the first minutes and for each additional fifteen minutes.
the vehicle must be returned to the home depot location where rented,on the date and at the time specified if not,a cleaning charge,drop charge,rate change may apply.
the vehicle must be returned to the store before closing on the day of rental.
the store hours listed were on saturdays.
the agreement does not permit rental of the vehicle for more than one day or past the time at which the home depot demands return of the vehicle.
frederico alleges that she returned the truck to home depot on august,but was informed by defendant that the rental department was closed,that home depot had no rental facilities or procedures,and to the truck the following morning.compl.she returned the next morning and paid,of which represented the thirteen hours and minutes that she possessed the vehicle.
frederico subsequently filed a class action complaint in state court,alleging that home depot breached its contract,violated the new jersey consumer fraud act,et.njcfa,and committed common law fraud.her complaint states 
the proposed class consists of i all new jersey individual consumers ii who rented a vehicle from a home depot store with no afterhours rental return facilities or procedures,iii who were unable to return the vehicle to home depot,and iv who were charged late rental return fees for the period during which no vehicles could have been returned.
sua sponte,we raised the question of whether this court has jurisdiction over the district court judgment here entered without prejudice.frederico invoked the jurisdiction of this court pursuant to,which grants this court jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of district courts.appellant br.at.
we conclude that the district court march,order granting home depot motion to dismiss,from which frederico appeals,is a final order,notwithstanding its without prejudice modifier.guided by the supreme court directive that we employ a practical rather than a technical construction of finality requirement,we have held that a dismissal with leave to amend will be treated as a final order if the plaintiff has elected to stand upon the original complaint.shapiro ujb financial,cir quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.see also berke bloch,cir concluding that it is in the court of appeals for the third circuit that an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is final if the plaintiff has elected to stand on his complaint.proceeding with appellate review here is consistent with the goal of the final judgment prevent piecemeal,if plaintiff can not or will not bring a second action,there is no risk of multiple litigation.pittsburgh bank,cir.
under this standard,the dismissal of the complaint is final and appealable because frederico clearly indicated an intent to stand on the original complaint.at no time during the district court consideration of home depot motion to dismiss,which included initial and supplemental briefing as well as oral argument,did frederico offer or seek to amend the complaint to address the pleading deficiencies noted by home depot.instead,she repeatedly asserted that the allegations contained in the complaint were legally sufficient.see,plaintiff memorandum in law in opposition to the defendant motion to dismiss,frederico home depot,at,wl january,the claims contained in plaintiff complaint are sufficient as a matter of law,and should not be dismissed.
after the district court dismissed the complaint and the clerk office officially terminated the action,frederico did not seek to amend the complaint.her only response was to file a notice of appeal.on appeal,she continues to argue that the factual allegations contained in her complaint are sufficient.see,appellant br.at the lower court opinion is premised on the mistaken assumption that the should have pled the evidence and facts underlying her complaint.because frederico has elected to stand on her original complaint rather than amend or refile it,the order dismissing the complaint without prejudice is final.see,lucas township of bethel,cir dismissal without prejudice was final and appealable because plaintiff chose to stand on the complaint batoff state farm ins,cir holding that plaintiff elected to stand on complaint by failing to amend within specified time period tiernan devoe,cir finding appellate jurisdiction over dismissal without prejudice based on statements made in letter brief filed after appeal was initiated letter from william crutchlow,counsel for appellant janelle frederico,to the office of the clerk,united states court of appeals for the third circuit july,in the instant matter,stands by her complaint.
we now must decide whether this class action case removed to a federal court as a diversity matter properly meets the requisite amount in controversy set by cafa.it is now settled in this court that the party asserting federal jurisdiction in a removal case bears the burden of showing,at all stages of the litigation,that the case is properly before the federal court.kia motors america,cir see also morgan gay,cir under cafa,the party seeking to remove the case to federal court bears the burden to establish that the amount in controversy is satisfied.our standard of review for issues of subject matter jurisdiction,including cases arising under cafa,is plenary.morgan,at.
we are aware that the quantum of proof to be used in ascertaining the requisite amount in removal cases sounding in diversity has caused some disagreement among the district courts of this circuit we also note the concern that c ourts in the third circuit have been unencumbered by consistency in their characterization of a defendant burden of proving the amount in controversy on a motion to remand,at quoting irving allstate indemnity,d.since that concern was first voiced,two cases decided by this court sought to bring clarity and consistency to the jurisprudence in our circuit,at class action removal case arising prior to the enactment of cafa,and morgan,at class action removal case arising under cafa.it is to these cases we now turn.
decided prior to the enactment of cafa,articulated a template for addressing subject matter jurisdiction challenges by examining two supreme court cases paul mercury indemnity red cab,and mcnutt general motors acceptance of indiana.
in red cab,the plaintiff filed suit in state court and,in response to defendant removal of the case,subsequently reduced its claim below the requisite amount.at.holding that events occurring subsequent to removal which reduce the amount recoverable,whether beyond the plaintiff control or the result of his volition,do not oust the district court jurisdiction once it has attached.the supreme court articulated what has become known as the legal certainty test,observing that when a case is brought in federal court,the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.id.at.the case will be dismissed only if,from the face of the pleadings,it is apparent,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed,or if,from the proofs,the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount.id.at.
in mcnutt,the plaintiff brought suit in federal court and defendant contested the assertion in the complaint that the requisite matter in controversy was involved.mcnutt,at.the supreme court held t he court may insist that the jurisdictional facts be established or the case be dismissed,and for that purpose the court may demand that the party alleging jurisdiction justify his allegations by a preponderance of evidence.id.at.
this court,in,disentangled the legal certainty and preponderance of the evidence approaches of mcnutt and red cab by distinguishing them on the grounds of whether the jurisdictional dispute surrounded factual matters in mcnutt,although a challenge to the amount in controversy had been raised in the pleadings,no evidence or findings in the trial court addressed the issue.in that respect red cab differs because these factual findings had been made,at.as a result,in the many cases where disputes over factual matters are involved,the mcnutt preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate for resolving the dispute.by contrast,in those cases when relevant facts are not in dispute or findings have been made,the district court should adhere to the legal certainty test cited in such cases as meritcare paul mercury insurance,cir packard provident bank,cir bloom barry,cir and nelson keefer,cir,at.under the legal certainty test,as it appears in those cases,w hen it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff was never entitled to recover the jurisdictional amount,the case must be dismissed.packard,at see also meritcare,at when it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff was never entitled to recover the minimum amount set by section,the removed case must be remanded bloom,at t he court properly applied the legal certainty test with respect to the jurisdictional amount announced in red cab.nelson,at citing red cab for the proposition that to determine good faith,i t must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal citing jaconski avisun,cir.
as judge norma shapiro observed in valley state farm fire and cas.
all these cases cited by cite to and rely upon the red cab legal certainty standard the legal certainty standard established by the court of appeals in is the same standard established by the supreme court in red cab.
under red cab,a case must be dismissed or remanded if it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff can not recover more than the jurisdictional amount of.the rule does not require the removing defendant to prove to a legal certainty the plaintiff can recover substantially different standard.this reading of the legal certainty test is supported by meritcare,bloom,packard,and nelson.none of these cases require the defendant to prove the jurisdictional amount to a legal certainty in order to remain in federal court.
d,internal citations omitted.
two years after,this court was presented with our first class action diversity removal case brought under cafa,morgan gay,at.morgan came to our court on an appeal from a district court order granting plaintiff motion to remand to state court,on the grounds that the amount in controversy required to support a diversity action under d,an amount in excess of million,had not been demonstrated id.at.in morgan,the plaintiff expressly limited the amount in controversy to an amount lower than the jurisdictional requirement,stating in the complaint that the total amount of such monetary relief for the class as a whole shall not exceed million in sum or value.id.
the claims in,red cab and mcnutt did not involve such a limitation.the different circumstances in morgan called for a different approach to determine whether there was federal jurisdiction.against the backdrop that the plaintiff is the master of her own claim and thus may limit her claims to avoid federal subject matter jurisdiction,the panel concluded that where the plaintiff so limits her claim,t he party wishing to establish subject matter jurisdiction has the burden to prove to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory threshold.id.at.this legal certainty standard differs from that of the cases cited by.in those cases,the challenger to subject matter jurisdiction had to prove,to a legal certainty,that the amount in controversy could not exceed the statutory threshold see packard,at meritcare,at bloom,at nelson,at.
in morgan,by contrast,we held that where the plaintiff expressly limits her claim below the jurisdictional amount as a precise statement in the complaint,applying the maxim that the plaintiff is the master of her own complaint,the proponent of the federal subject matter jurisdiction is held to a higher burden that is,the proponent of jurisdiction must show,to a legal certainty,that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory threshold.
thus,morgan does not conflict with the reasoning and holding of.the dichotomy still paves the basic procedural avenue in many cases disputes over factual matters may be involved.in resolving those issues,the mcnutt preponderance of the evidence standard would be appropriate.once the findings of fact have been made,the court may determine whether red cab legal certainty test for jurisdiction has been met.at.
morgan provided a more complete roadmap.first,it added a precept that may be applied to all diversity class actions that have been removed because the complaint may be silent or ambiguous on one or more of the ingredients needed to calculate the amount in controversy,a defendant notice of removal serves the same functions as the complaint would in a suit filed in federal court.morgan,at quoting brill countrywide home loans,cir.second,morgan erected guideposts in those cases where the plaintiff complaint specifically and not impliedly and precisely and not inferentially states that the amount sought in a class action diversity complaint for the class as a whole shall not exceed million in sum or value.id.at.in such cases t he party wishing to establish subject matter jurisdiction has the burden to prove by a legal certainty that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory threshold.id 
the distinction between a case governed by morgan and a case governed by red cab and is crystal clear.morgan applies where the complaint specifically avers that the amount sought is less than the jurisdictional minimum.there,a defendant seeking removal must prove to a legal certainty that plaintiff can recover the jurisdictional amount.by contrast,applies where the plaintiff has not specifically averred in the complaint that the amount in controversy is less than the jurisdictional minimum.there,the case must be remanded if it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff can not recover the jurisdictional amount.
against this framework,we turn to the case before us.
in removal cases,determining the amount in controversy begins with a reading of the complaint filed in the state court,at.here,frederico does not state an exact sum sought in her complaint.instead,her complaint seeks,inter alia,damages and compensation to all class members from the defendant,interest,punitive damages,costs of suit,treble damages and attorneys fees as permitted under the consumer fraud act,and any other damages deemed just and proper by the court.compl.the class size alleged is thousands,if not tens of hundreds of thousands,of individuals.id.frederico herself paid for her use of the rental vehicle.id.exhibit 
in addition,to determine whether the minimum jurisdictional amount has been met in a diversity case removed to a district court,a defendant notice of removal serves the same function as the complaint would if filed in the district court.morgan,at.thus,we examine home depot contentions set forth therein 
assuming that plaintiff payment of represents the average actual damages of each member of the putative class and the maximum punitive damages allowable under new jersey law were awarded see stat.a b,plaintiff need only prevail on behalf of class members for the class recovery to exceed.given that plaintiff has alleged a putative class consisting of thousands if not tens of hundreds of thousands of members,it is more likely than not that or more is in controversy in this case.see.see penn stores,d,in the absence of third circuit precedent on the issue of what the defendant needs to show to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement when the plaintiff alleges unspecified damages,the court will adopt the preponderance of the evidence standard.
moreover,plaintiff also seeks attorneys fees,which can exceed six figures in a class action and are properly aggregated and considered for purposes of determining the amount in controversy under cafa.see d in any class action,the claims of the individual class members shall be aggregated to determine whether the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.see also suber chrysler,cir moreover,in calculating the amount in controversy,we must consider potential attorneys fees.

in response to this court letter requesting that the parties address whether the allegations in the complaint and notice of removal that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of million dollars,exclusive of interest and costs,vested the district court with jurisdiction,both parties filed replies.letter from marcia waldron,clerk for the united states court of appeals for the third circuit,to counsel for janelle frederico and home depot june.
in its reply,home depot essentially restates the averments set forth in paragraphs and of its notice of removal.frederico reply states,in relevant part 
although home depot letter to the court in response to the court query as to jurisdiction quotes complaint that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of million dollars,exclusive of interests and costs,it should be noted that the complaint does not contain such a quote,does not contain any mention of the sum or value of the matter in controversy,nor,for that matter,does appellant complaint assert federal jurisdiction at all.
this suit was initially brought in state,new jersey superior court,middlesex county.thereafter,respondent asserted diversity and cafa jurisdiction,and removed the case from state court to federal court.as such,appellant leaves it to the respondent to explain respondent basis for asserting jurisdiction.
letter from william crutchlow,counsel for appellant janelle frederico,to the office of the clerk,united states court of appeals for the third circuit july,emphasis in original.
in morgan,the plaintiff expressly limited,in her complaint,the damages sought to less than the jurisdictional threshold.at.here,by contrast,frederico does not explicitly limit the amount in controversy to million or less.therefore,the case falls under the framework established by.
frederico response to the court query regarding jurisdiction supplies us with no useful information with which to calculate the amount in controversy.she is playing her cards close to the vest her answer neither agrees with the facts alleged in the removal notice nor contests them.nonetheless,home depot argument for jurisdiction is based on allegations made initially by frederico herself.accordingly,the present posture of the case is one where the relevant facts are not expressly in dispute between the parties.even where allegations are not challenged by the adversary,the court may still insist that the jurisdictional facts be established or the case be dismissed,and for that purpose the court may demand that the party alleging jurisdiction justify his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.mcnutt,at.
we do not believe such an insistence is necessary in this case.the district court accepted and relied on the facts alleged in home depot notice of removal when it concluded that it had diversity jurisdiction.app.at.furthermore,neither party contests the underlying facts and both instead rely upon them.mccann newman irrevocable trust,cir if a defendant does not challenge the jurisdictional facts alleged in the plaintiff pleadings,a court may rule on the rule b motion by accepting these allegations as true.we will therefore apply red cab legal certainty test to the facts alleged by frederico in her complaint and incorporated by home depot into its notice of removal.
here frederico is seeking in compensatory damages in addition,she is seeking punitive damages,which we must consider when calculating the amount in controversy.golden golden,cir.under new jersey law,frederico can collect punitive damages of up to five times the compensatory damages.b.thus,she can collect in punitive damages.combined with compensatory damages,the punitive damages bring frederico total damages to.
we must also consider attorney fees.see suber chrysler,cir.fees could be as much as thirty percent of the judgment.see in re rite aid.securities litigation,cir noting study done by the federal judicial center that found a median percentage recovery range of for all class actions resolved or settled over a period.thirty percent of a judgment is,bringing frederico total damages to.
finally,million,the jurisdictional threshold,divided by the total amount of damages sought for frederico herself,produces a requisite class size of individuals.see d in any class action,the claims of the individual class members shall be aggregated to determine whether the matter in controversy exceeds.this class size necessary to meet the requisite amount in controversy is well under the tens of hundreds of thousands of class members that appears in both frederico complaint and home depot notice of removal.
thus,we are satisfied that the red cab legal certainty test is met as it does not appear to a legal certainty that frederico can not recover the jurisdictional amount,the case need not be remanded and we may proceed to the substantive merits of this appeal.
in her complaint,frederico alleged that home depot violated the njcfa,committed common law fraud,and breached its contract with her.she contends that the district court erred in granting home depot motion to dismiss under rules b and b.

we conclude that frederico failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
we turn first to frederico contentions that home depot committed common law fraud and violated the njcfa by materially misrepresenting or omitting in the agreement the terms,conditions,and late fees associated with the return of rental vehicles,that the late fees were not grossly excessive,and that its vehicle rental return procedures were intended to enable home depot to illegally profit by causing delay in the return of rental vehicles.compl.
to state a claim for fraud under new jersey law,a plaintiff must allege a material misrepresentation of fact knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity intention that the other person rely on it reasonable reliance thereon by the other person and resulting damage.gennari weichert.realtors.

we agree with the district court that frederico fraud claim does not meet the stringent pleading requirements of rule b.frederico does not state with particularity the circumstances of the alleged fraud or otherwise inject the requisite precision into her allegations.in her complaint,she only makes generic references to home depot excessive late rental fees,compl,failure to disclose lack of rental return facilities or procedures,id,and false representation that vehicle rentals and late fees associated therewith would not accumulate beyond the time at which plaintiff and class members returned or attempted to return rented vehicles to home depot,id.none of these broad statements disclose the particular argument made on appeal as to the substance of the misrepresentation,namely,that home depot misrepresented the actual hours during which vehicles could be returned so as to avoid or halt the accumulation of late fees.appellant br.at.
frederico did not provide such information in her complaint and thus did not meet her obligation to put home depot on notice of the precise misconduct with which it is charged.lum,at.as the district court observed,frederico fail ed to allege that any particular statement made by defendant in the agreement was in fact false,app.at,and 
fail ed to allege when she attempted to return the truck to home depot and whether this attempted return was prior to the time it was due at pm or even before the store closed at pm.further,plaintiff does not allege who at home depot informed her that she could not return the vehicle at that unspecified time and that she should return the following morning.see,klein general nutrition,cir the complainant fails to attribute the statement to any specific member of gnc management.b requires,at a minimum,that the plaintiff identify the speaker of allegedly fraudulent statements.granite state ins.ujex,civ,wl,at july,dismissing fraud claim under rule b where complaint was utterly devoid of the averments required by rule b,including the identity of the alleged speaker.
we are mindful of frederico observation that without the benefit of discovery she could not learn the name of the employee with whom she interacted when attempting to return the truck.appellant br.at.nevertheless,her complaint only refers generally to being informed by defendant,compl,and does not disclose the circumstances surrounding her discussion with,or any information about,the particular individual who informed her that the rental department was closed furthermore,although frederico has subsequently stated in her briefs that her initial attempt to return the truck occurred prior to pm,see,appellant br.at a lthough the appellant returned the vehicle to the store before pm,home depot refused to accept the return.plaintiff memorandum in law in opposition to the defendant motion to dismiss,frederico home depot,at,wl january,same,we do not consider allegations in determining the sufficiency of her complaint under rules b and b.see commw.of ex.rel zimmerman pepsico,cir it is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.quoting car carriers,ford motor,cir unger national residents matching program,cir.
for the foregoing reasons,frederico common law fraud claim was properly dismissed.
to state a claim under the njcfa,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant engaged in an unlawful practice that caused an ascertainable loss to the plaintiff.cox sears roebuck.the district court found that frederico failed to state such a claim.we agree.
frederico fails to allege home depot engaged in an unlawful practice.the njcfa defines unlawful practice as 
the act,use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice,deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise,misrepresentation,or the knowing concealment,suppression,or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment,suppression,or omission,in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise 
unlawful practices fall into three general categories affirmative acts,knowing omissions,and regulation violations.cox,at.
the unlawful practice engaged in by home depot,alleged by frederico,is the instituti on and implement ation of business processes intended to delay the return of rental vehicles so as to enable home depot to profit from charging plaintiff and similarly situated consumers excessive late rental return fees.compl.
frederico does not contend that home depot charged her late fees at a rate higher than that agreed upon and disclosed in the agreement.instead,as discussed above,her argument on appeal is that,u nder the express terms of the rental agreement,the appellant was required to return the vehicle to the home depot store before that store closed,the store hours were listed,showing that the store was open until pm,and although she attempted to return the vehicle before pm,she learned that the rental department closes hours before the time listed on the agreement.appellant br.at.from this sequence of events,frederico argues that by refusing to accept the vehicle before the closing time listed on the agreement,and instead instituting an undisclosed condition that vehicles must be returned before the rental department closes,home depot deliberately made it impossible for consumers such as frederico to return the rental vehicles pursuant to the terms of the rental agreement,resulting in unexpected late fees,and that such a practice clearly falls within the deceptive,fraudulent,and unconscionable commercial practices prohibited by the nj cfa.id.at.
frederico complaint,however,does not provide such detail.as the district court observed 
in her complaint,plaintiff does not state when she attempted to return the truck to home depot and who told her that she could not return the vehicle at that time.see,bathgate,cir dismissing plaintiff njcfa and common law fraud claims under rule b where plaintiff failed to identify the speaker of the allegedly misleading statements and otherwise allege facts to support plaintiff charges.based on plaintiff sic bare allegations,the court can not conclude that defendant engaged in any unlawful practice.
app.at emphasis in original see also klein,at the complaint fails to attribute the statement to any specific member of management.b requires,at a minimum,that the plaintiff identify the speaker of allegedly fraudulent statements.
frederico merely asserts in her complaint that home depot violated the nj cfa by its use of false and misleading representations in connection with the terms,conditions,and late fees associated with the return of rental vehicles.compl.without information as to when frederico attempted to return the vehicle,whether before the closing listed on the agreement pm or after,the grounds for and contours of the alleged unlawful practice are unclear.as with the common law fraud claim discussed above,home depot is not placed on notice that the particular practice complained of is nondisclosure of the fact that there is a gap between the closing time of the store as listed in the agreement and the closing time of the rental department,and that late fees accrue if a customer attempts to return the vehicle between those two times.
frederic
