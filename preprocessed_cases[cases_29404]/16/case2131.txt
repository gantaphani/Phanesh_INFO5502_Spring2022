in the,gencorp,and olin corporation began a business relationship that defies easy categorization.by agreement of the parties,olin built a manufacturing plant with gencorp assistance that for more than a decade supplied gencorp with a chemical used to produce urethane foam.the manufacturing plant also produced hazardous waste.plant operators hauled the waste to an offsite landfill,which eventually landed on the epa national priority list of hazardous waste facilities and which generated costs of more than million.
olin sued gencorp under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,et,to recover a percentage of the costs and to obtain a declaratory judgment that gencorp bore responsibility for that same percentage of future costs.the district court granted the relief,concluding that gencorp was a c overed person under a of the statute because it arranged for disposal of hazardous substances and concluding that it was responsible for of the costs at the landfill.we agree with that conclusion and reject each of the parties other challenges to the district court decision except one olin claim that a declaratory judgment should have been entered.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment as to gencorp contribution liability and the apportionment of liability between the parties but remand the case to consider olin request for a declaratory judgment.
during the,gencorp once known as general tire and rubber company manufactured urethane material used in carpets and mattresses,among other a plant the pvc plant located in ashtabula,ohio.among other ingredients,the production of the foam required toluene tdi,which is a critical chemical ingredient in the process.ja.to minimize the financial risks of urethane production,gencorp sought a reliable and source of tdi.
olin corporation claimed to have a supply answer to this demand.having developed a process for producing tdi,which involved highly toxic chemicals,including phosgene or mustard gas,it began discussions with gencorp about building and operating a plant for manufacturing the chemical the tdi plant.on june,after lengthy negotiations,the parties concluded a final agreement the agreement.
as the contractual cornerstone of the agreement,olin agreed to erect or cause to be erected,at its sole cost and expense the tdi plant.ja.the parties agreed to locate the plant on land owned by gencorp,which was adjacent to gencorp own pvc plant where the tdi from olin new plant would eventually be converted into urethane foam,and agreed that olin would pay gencorp a year for the lease of the land.olin also agreed to build a second plant at its own expense to produce toluene diamine or tda a chemical needed in the tdi manufacturing to supply enough tda to meet the tdi plant requirements.
in return,gencorp agreed to purchase of the tdi plant output at cost,which included variable costs,fixed costs for the tdi plant and related facilities,and a for the tda supplied by olin to the plant.ja.both parties remained free to sell tdi to third parties without sharing any profits from these sales.gencorp also agreed to purchase hydrochloric additional byproduct of the tdi manufacturing olin and to supply steam from its pvc plant to meet the tdi plant requirements.
olin initially retained title to the tdi plant under the agreement and owned and operated the plant.ja.the parties agreed that at some later date olin would sell,convey and transfer title to the tdi plant to gencorp at olin book value for the plant.ja.gencorp agreed to advance olin up to one half of its total capital costs for the plant as earnest money towards its obligation to purchase and acquire the tdi plant.ja.that amount,it was agreed,would be credited by olin against the ultimate sale and purchase price due at the future sale.id.the parties affirmed in a separate agreement that gencorp had a definite obligation to take title to the tdi plant and had committed itself to this purchase through a substantial deposit against the ultimate purchase price.ja.in accordance with these future plans for ownership of the plant,the engineering specifications for the plant were subject to the approval of both gencorp and olin,ja,and olin agreed not to make any capital expenditures without gencorp approval after the plant.olin also agreed to insure the tdi plant for all risk of loss,liability and damage to property and facilities.ja.
to the ends of oversee ing the construction,operation and management of the tdi plant,the contract created a committee the tdi committee composed of two representatives of gencorp and two representatives of olin.in consultation with the committee,olin agreed to select a plant manager and other staff to supervise the operation of the plant.ja.olin also agreed to appoint a committee manager,who was the sole party authorized to instruct the plant manager on behalf of the committee.the agreement contained no guidelines for committee,specifying whether decisionmaking would occur by consensus or by majority vote,or how a deadlock would be rather allowed the committee to devise its own management rules which apparently were never created.
although not detailed in the agreement,gencorp supplied all of the tdi plant hourly workers,keeping them on its own payroll and negotiating a collective bargaining agreement for them.olin,on the other hand,supplied and paid many of the plant salaried,supervisory employees,including the plant manager and other departmental heads,although gencorp filled some management positions with its own employees.all employees ultimately reported to the plant manager.
the agreement did not address hazardous waste disposal.the tdi manufacturing process generated at least two byproducts that amount to hazardous waste for cercla purposes a residue waste and spent oils,both of which contain the toxic chemicals tdi,tda and chlorobenzene.early plant designs contemplated generation and disposal of the tdi residue.the tdi plant engineer told phillip sayre,a gencorp employee who reviewed the design specifications,that the tdi chemical residue would be drum med off and bur ied.ja.despite sayre concerns about the dangers of this plan,which he conveyed to his supervisors at gencorp,gencorp approved the plant designs and capital appropriation requests by olin.id.
after approving the plant designs,the tdi committee discussed tdi residue disposal and the gencorp committee members researched and recommended offsite locations for disposal sites in view of their greater familiarity with the ashtabula area.op.of july,at hereinafter.op.tdi employees disposed of some waste at the plant site itself,which the parties agree caused a release into the waterway known as fields brook that ran between the tdi and pvc plants on gencorp land a site that is the subject of this litigation but not this appeal.id.benjamin brenkus,a hauler apparently hired by the olin plant manager,carried other waste offsite.from the beginning of plant operations in through february,brenkus hauled waste to the big d site,all of which the tdi plant hourly employees had placed in metal drums and loaded onto brenkus truck for disposal.op.at.payment for brenkus hauling efforts required completion of a service requisition form,which on occasion gencorp employees in intermediate management positions signed.id.
over the years of the tdi plant operation,the committee addressed the issue of waste disposal in a variety of ways.tdi residue disposal,the hauling costs appeared as a line item on olin budget for the tdi plant,which the committee approved,and which gencorp paid for as part of the variable costs incorporated into the tdi price.the committee approved apparently without dissension capital expenditures aimed at reducing the volume of waste generated by the plant.op.at.gencorp committee member robert laundrie visited the big d site more than once,and he issued his criticisms of disposal methods to olin plant manager,id.at although the record contains no evidence as to whether olin acted upon these concerns.and gencorp and olin jointly funded golden tdi research,a program aimed fruitlessly,it turns out at finding commercial uses for the tdi residue in order to reduce the amount of waste shipped offsite.id.at.
despite the provision of the agreement,gencorp never purchased the tdi plant from olin.instead,on september,the parties signed a new agreement the agreement that terminated the agreement effective october.in the new agreement gencorp relinquished its right to purchase the tdi plant in exchange for a million payment from olin as reimbursement for its earlier earnest money.ja.gencorp also extended its lease of the land on which the plant was located for three additional terms.in a separate agreement signed on the same day,the parties agreed that gencorp would purchase not less than of its yearly tdi requirements at a price determined under a new formula supplied by the agreement essentially the lesser of market price or cost.ja.at the same time they signed these new agreements,the parties unwound earlier employment arrangements by transferring the gencorp employees working at the tdi plant to olin payroll and by dissolving the tdi committee.op.at.
in the late,olin began investigating toxic contamination at the big d site,identifying the property as an area of concern requiring further study.op.at.in may of,the ohio epa requested information from olin about disposal of waste from the plant.and in june of,the matter came before the federal epa,after olin filed a notification required by cercla that it had disposed of tons of waste at the big d site.the tdi plant ceased operations later that year,and olin began dismantling the facilities as well as performing clean up and decontamination of the plant site.
at its own initiative,but in consultation with state environmental officials,olin performed an project at the big d site in.the project increased the slope gradient of the landfill through the addition of topsoil and clay in order to redirect storm water,at a cost of over.op.at of which olin seeks to recover from gencorp.olin informed the state and federal environmental agencies about its efforts,claiming that the big d site is not a significant threat to human health or the environment and no further corrective action is required or warranted.ja.
the federal epa disagreed with this assessment.on september,after a period,it placed both the big d and fields brook sites on the national priority list for.in,the federal agency notified olin that it was a potential responsible party for the site and requested that olin provide information concerning the site and conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study for the landfill.op.at.negotiations for a remedial action plan for big d took place during and.when olin refused to yield on certain points in the negotiations,the federal epa issued a unilateral administrative order on march,under cercla,requiring olin to implement the agency remedial action plan for the site.op.at.olin formed a big d site team and in late began implementing the remedial action plan.id.at.
anticipating that olin would seek contribution for these remediation costs,gencorp filed a declaratory judgment action against olin on october,in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.gencorp sought a declaration that it was not liable under cercla for the costs at big d and fields brook,among other sites.olin counterclaimed,seeking its own declaration either that gencorp was jointly and severally liable with olin for the response costs or owed olin contribution for at least one half of the costs.the parties voluntarily dismissed gencorp claim in,but continued litigating olin counterclaim.gencorp eventually amended its response to olin counterclaim,claiming breach of contract to insure the tdi plant,among other claims.ja.
by consent of the parties,the district court transferred the case to magistrate judge david perelman for trial.the court initially denied both parties motions for summary judgment,determining that genuine issues of fact precluded any disposition of the claims.before trial,however,the district court reconsidered its decision in light of intervening case law and entered summary judgment against olin on one of its counterclaims.it determined that olin could not maintain its claim for joint and several liability under cercla because it was a potentially liable party itself and thus could seek only contribution from gencorp.see.mem.order of,at ja centerior serv.acme scrap iron metal,cir.
with respect to olin remaining contribution claim under f,the district court conducted trial proceedings in three phases.phase i dealt with the initial question of liability phase ii allocated liability between the parties on a percentage basis and phase iii assigned a dollar amount to these percentages.after a bench trial addressing the phase i and ii issues,the district court determined that gencorp was liable as an arranger of hazardous waste disposal under cercla either by virtue of its affiliation with olin in an association or commercial entity but not a joint venture such that the two companies constituted a single person under by virtue of its activities carried out in its own name.op.at.the court also determined that gencorp was liable as an owner and an operator of the land on which the plant was built.id.at.in addressing the parties respective shares of liability,the district court concluded that gencorp should bear of the costs of big d and olin and gencorp should bear of the costs of the fields brook site and olin.op.at.during phase iii,the district court determined that these liability shares translated into costs to gencorp of approximately million plus more than million in prejudgment interest and entered a judgment in that amount.op.of may,at judgment order at ja.
the district court did not finally resolve gencorp claims based on olin alleged promise to insure.it tabled the ultimate resolution of the claim in light of a pending dispute in the southern district of new york between olin and its insurers over the insurers responsibility to pay for the hazardous waste costs.the court determined that olin had satisfied its contractual obligation to gencorp,and if olin obtained any recovery from its insurers in the new york proceeding,that recovery would inure to the benefit of gencorp as well.op.of may,at.because that parallel proceeding had not concluded,the district court h e ld in abeyance a determination as to what share of any recovery in the new york litigation would be gencorp,but entered a final judgment in the remainder of the suit under federal rule of civil procedure b.id.
the appeal and from the district court judgment raise a host of questions does this court have jurisdiction over the suit does the statute of limitations bar olin claim is gencorp liable for response costs related to the big d site as an arranger for the disposal of hazardous waste generated by the tdi plant did the district court abuse its discretion in determining each parties proportionate responsibility for the costs did the district court err in awarding prejudgment interest and should the district court have granted olin request for declaratory relief regarding future costs 
as a matter of first priority,the court has jurisdiction over this appeal.under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,a district court may,w hen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action,direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims,provided that the court makes an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon express direction for the entry of judgment.compliance with the rule permits immediate appellate review of a district court judgment even though the lawsuit contains unresolved claims.see acquisition,gencorp,cir.
to comply with the rule,a district court initially must expressly direct the entry of final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims in the case.id.it then must determine whether the needs of the parties outweigh the efficiency of having one appeal at the conclusion of the case in its entirety,and it must spell out its reasons for concluding that prompt review is preferable.id.at.on appeal,we review compliance with the first requirement de novo,id.at,and compliance with the second requirement for an abuse of discretion,see also,d.
as to the first requirement,this case involves more than one claim and the district court permissibly entered final judgment as to all but one of the contract claim that olin failed to obtain insurance for the tdi plant.a claim under rule b denotes the aggregate of operative facts which give rise to a right enforceable in the courts even if the party has raised different theories of relief.acquisition,at quotation marks omitted.in this case,the district court had before it olin contribution claim as well as gencorp and other claims.olin contribution claim arises under cercla while gencorp contract claim arises under state law governing contractual rights and fiduciary responsibilities.the claims also do not share a single aggregate of operative facts.olin cercla claim arises from the disposal of hazardous waste at the big d landfill,while gencorp claim arises out of olin alleged duty to insure for risks related to the tdi plant.nor does the fact that olin recovery on its claim could be set off in full or in part by gencorp recovery on its claim impede the separability of these claims for appeal purposes.see,d reversing determination that certification of claim was improper because pending counterclaim could ultimately provide to liability.lastly,the district court resolution of the cercla claim satisfies the finality requirement of rule b and,as the court provided an ultimate disposition of the claim and addressed all forms of relief requested by olin.compare liberty mut.ins.wetzel,d concluding that district court finding of liability,which did not address any of the relief requested by the plaintiff,did not satisfy rule b acquisition,at determining that district court judgment resolving damages issue but not liability was not final.
as to the second requirement,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it would be efficient presently to dispose of all of the claims,save for gencorp claim.in arguing to the contrary,gencorp contends that the district court failed to make the required findings or to balance the factors that should be considered.gencorp mot.to dismiss at.in fact,however,the district court did explain why there was no just reason for delay.op.of,at.and its explanations for certifying the partial judgment for appeal in this suit made ample sense given that the only question remaining on gencorp claim was one that would be resolved by another court and given the likelihood that gencorp would appeal its cercla liability in view of its possible preclusive effect even if the amount owed was wholly offset by an insurance recovery.
gencorp next argues that olin failed to comply with the applicable statute of limitations in bringing its cercla contribution claim.we disagree.
as an initial point of reference,the parties share common ground that g of cercla,g,applies to this action.they agree with the district court that g not g entitled contribution applies to this case because olin incurred costs at big d not as the result of a court judgment or settlement with the government but as the result of a unilateral administrative order issued by the epa under.for this reason,the district court concluded,olin counterclaim constituted an initial action for recovery of costs under g.see.op.at sun,cir deciding that where a party bringing a contribution suit incurs costs by means other than a judgment or settlement,a unilateral administrative order,that suit is the initial action for recovery of costs under g see also geraghty miller,conoco,cir adopting rationale of sun centerior,at agreeing in dicta with sun.
having agreed that g governs this case,the parties dispute which portion of g applies.section g contains two different time limitations,and provides 
an initial action for recovery of costs must be commenced a for a removal action,within years after completion of the removal action and b for a remedial action,within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action,except that,if the remedial action is initiated within years after the completion of the removal action,costs incurred in the removal action may be recovered in the cost recovery action.
g.in gencorp view,the actions taken by olin in the early at the big d the slope of the land and adding topsoil at a cost of the initiation of remedial action for the statute of limitations,which means that the time for bringing a lawsuit has long since passed.in olin view,the limitations period did not begin running in the because these earlier efforts constituted removal but not remedial actions and because the work done in the early was separate and distinct from,and could not start the limitations period for,the work done in the in response to the epa orders even if the earlier work was remedial in nature.olin br.at.olin also argues that gencorp waived its defense,but we need not reach that question.
in resolving this issue,the district court looked to the national contingency plan regulations defining removal actions,and determined that olin work performed in the early falls within the parameters of removal actions.op.at.the district court noted that the short duration of the project and its relatively low cost indicated that the action constituted removal,not remediation.id.the work done in the,the court added,did not meet the test for remedial actions because it took place before the remedial investigation and feasibility study and before the epa unilateral administrative order implementing the final plan for the site.id.at.
we agree with this one elaboration.the salient point here is that cercla definition of remedial action imposes a separate requirement on the term remedial action encompasses only those actions consistent with the permanent remedy taken to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances,and unless remedial action meeting this requirement has begun,the event can not occur.emphasis added.critically,olin earlier actions at the landfill were not consistent with the permanent remedy for the,the final remedial plan implemented by the federal epa.indeed,in adding topsoil and clay covers to prevent soil erosion and in changing the slope gradient of the site,olin interim measure was inconsistent with the federal epa remedial plan.the final plan called for olin to dismantle its previous work at the site by removing the clay cap,excavating the site and removing and incinerating waste and contaminated soil from the site.op.at.for this reason,the prior work was not permanent as would be required for a remedial action,nor was it consistent with the remedy mandated by the epa in the unilateral order.id.
in addressing this issue,the ninth circuit has concluded that the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action under and g can only occur after the final remediation plan is adopted and that action taken before the plan adoption can not constitute remedial action for purposes.california ex rel.cal.dep t of toxic substances control neville chem,cir emphasis added see also outlining procedures for proposing and adopting a final remedial action plan.while other circuits have rejected this rule,they adhere to the principle that for a remedial action to begin,the work must be consistent with the permanent remedy.see geraghty miller,united states navistar int l trans,cir.we need not decide today whether to adopt the ninth circuit rule because it would not affect the outcome of this case.in this instance,olin work in the at big d was not consistent with the final remedial plan,irrespective of the timing of the work,and gencorp offers no argument otherwise.under these circumstances,olin actions in the did not trigger the statute of limitations for recovery of its costs related to its remedial actions over a decade later.
turning to olin contribution claim,the parties agree that several preconditions for cercla liability have been established the big d site is a facility under a release of hazardous substances the tdi residue occurred and the release caused olin to incur necessary costs of response,see a.see stip.of parties at ja centerior,at.the only element of cercla liability in dispute is whether gencorp falls into one of four categories of potentially responsible parties described in cercla a.
invoking a of cercla,the district court concluded that gencorp was an arranger of hazardous waste disposal a person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances.a.in reaching this conclusion,the district court embraced two alternative theories of arranger liability that the relationship olin formed with gencorp created a single person under as an association or a commercial entity such that olin actions regarding hazardous waste disposal could be attributed to gencorp and gencorp arranged for disposal of hazardous waste in its own right as a separate potentially liable person.op.at.
gencorp challenges each of these conclusions on appeal.because we conclude that gencorp arranged for hazardous waste disposal in its own capacity,we need not address the separate question whether the two companies formed an association or commercial entity under.
cercla imposes liability on any person who arrange s by contract,agreement or otherwise for the disposal or treatment or for transport for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that is owned or possessed by that person.a.while the legislation does not define what it means to arrange for disposal of waste,traditional definitions of the word,its statutory context and case law supply ample clues.to arrange for something means to plan or prepare for it,though not necessarily to implement the plan.webster ii new college dictionary.making such preparations,moreover,does not require a formal disposal agreement,as the statute provides that a person may arrange for hazardous waste disposal by contract,agreement or otherwise.a emphasis added.neither must the arrangements for waste disposal stem from a discrete event they may arise from a broader transaction.see united states,cir.
circuit precedent also makes clear that one may not become an arranger through inadvertence.the party must have some intent to make preparations for the disposal of hazardous waste,though that intent goes to the matter of disposing waste generally,not to disposing of it in a particular manner or at a particular location.see id.at o nce it has been demonstrated that a party possessed the requisite intent to be an arranger,the party can not escape liability by claiming that it had no intent to have the waste disposed in a particular manner or at a particular site.united states aceto agricultural chems,cir see also cpc int l,united states township of brighton,cir noting that it is no defense to operator liability that the actor was not responsible for a particular hazard.the requisite intent may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances,at,and need not depend on the parties own characterizations of their transactions,aceto,at of which makes this inquiry highly,at.
measured by these requirements,the district court correctly concluded that gencorp arranged for the disposal of hazardous waste from the tdi plant.gencorp and olin entered into the agreement to build a manufacturing plant that would convert tda which olin would produce into tdi which gencorp would purchase and use in its own production of urethane foam.the generation of toxic waste was a natural byproduct of this manufacturing process.and even if gencorp somehow did not realize that this process would generate hazardous waste when it entered into the contract because olin held the patent for the process,it necessarily appreciated this reality when it approved the plant design specifications and capital expenditure requests.the construction plans specifically provided that the hazardous waste generated by the tdi plant would be placed in drums and buried at an offsite location.
other facts found by the district court show that the parties business arrangements for the tdi plant encompassed plans or preparations for waste disposal the tdi committee whose membership included equal numbers of representatives from olin and gencorp discussed tdi residue disposal gencorp committee members in particular researched and recommended waste disposal locations the tdi committee approved methods to reduce the volume of waste sent offsite,to the big d landfill through capital improvements to the plant and olin and gencorp both funded research aimed at further reducing the volume of residue waste that needed to be disposed offsite.see.op.at.considered together,these facts amply show that gencorp intended to and actually did enter into a transaction that included an arrangement for the disposal of hazardous substances,at accord lumber dixie distributing,cir.
gencorp arguments to the contrary amount to variations on two themes gencorp did not actively participate in arranging for the waste disposal at big d and gencorp did not own or possess the hazardous waste.neither argument is convincing.
in advancing its first argument,gencorp leans heavily on united states bestfoods,d,and this court interpretation of the decision in,and in township of brighton.to gencorp way of thinking,bestfoods,and township of brighton require a party to actually dispose of hazardous waste,something that gencorp allegedly never did gencorp br.at.
this trio of cases does not bear the weight that gencorp places on them.bestfoods dealt with a parent company potential liability under a as an operator of a polluting facility owned and operated by its subsidiary.at.the court rejected the proposition that a parent corporation participation in and control over its subsidiary operations without more sufficed for operator liability.id.the court instead held that for liability to attach either the corporate veil must be pierced or the parent must independently meet the test for operator liability through actions in its own capacity,not its subsidiary.id.
took the logical next step of extending bestfoods to an individual corporate shareholder facing potential arranger liability under cercla a.at.in doing so,it concluded that the district court findings satisf ied the bestfoods requirement that an officer be actively involved in the arrangements for disposal before individual liability may be imposed.id.
township of brighton applied the bestfoods principle in the context of a governmental entity potential liability as an operator of a waste facility.it concluded that we apply the same standard articulated in bestfoods to any context,whether the defendant is acting in a corporate,governmental,or any other capacity.at.
the central lessons of these cases are that cercla does not alter the principle that,in the absence of a valid reason for piercing the corporate veil,a parent corporation is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries,and an alleged violator must independently satisfy the test for cercla for operator liability,as in bestfoods,or for arranger liability,as in.the cases,however,do not alter the basic principles for ascertaining arranger liability.the references in these cases to active involvement or actual control relate either to the substantive standard for operator liability,bestfoods,at.township of brighton,at,or refer to the notion that an entity must itself be involved as an operator or an arranger,at.nowhere in these cases is there any suggestion that a party must have been actively involved in arranging to dispose of hazardous waste at a particular location and in a particular manner.all of this means that even if olin rather than gencorp specifically engaged benjamin brenkus hauling services to carry the hazardous waste to big d,see gencorp br.at,that fact does not insulate gencorp from liability for arrang ing for the disposal of hazardous waste.
gencorp second argument fares no better.in claiming that it can not be liable as an arranger unless it owned or possessed the hazardous waste the contaminated residue and oils,gencorp p
