this case concerns the continuing liability of bowater,for the health benefits of some of the retired workers of its subsidiary,great northern paper,gnp,after bowater sold gnp to inexcon in.bowater claims that its responsibility for these benefits terminated either at the time of gnp sale or in,when bowater consolidated its benefit plans under an umbrella plan whose coverage did not extend to gnp retirees.a putative class of gnp retirees,whose claims for benefits bowater denied,assert that neither the sale nor the plan consolidation met the procedural requirements for terminating a benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act,erisa,which governs these benefit plans.they claim that plan coverage did not end until april 
in addition,gnp retirees who belonged to various unions raise a claim under the labor management relations act,lmra,arguing that bowater denial of benefits breached collective bargaining agreements cbas entitling them to lifetime health coverage.these plaintiffs argue that bowater termination of its responsibilities under erisa had no effect on its continuing responsibility under the cbas.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to bowater on the lmra claim.it granted partial summary judgment to bowater and partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on the erisa claim,concluding that bowater retained responsibility for the erisa plans beyond gnp sale,but only until its consolidated plan took effect on january.we agree with the district court and affirm.
we provide here only the most basic facts,reserving details for the particular discussions of each issue below.in,bowater acquired gnp from following the acquisition,both unionized and gnp employees received health benefits under erisa plans.at the time of the acquisition,the cbas between and gnp unionized workers were in the middle of their terms.bowater expressly adopted these cbas and it negotiated new contracts in.as part of the contract negotiations,the parties agreed to substitute a managed health care plan for the previous health plan.bowater was named as plan sponsor and plan administrator under both the original health plans and the managed care plan.in addition,each of these plans,described by a summary plan description as required by erisa,allowed the plan sponsor to modify,amend or terminate the plan at any time.because the plans are identical on these relevant characteristics,we do not distinguish between them in our analysis 
in august,bowater sold gnp to inexcon.bowater explicitly retained responsibility for the pensions of gnp workers who had retired between and the date of sale,as reflected in section of the stock purchase agreement spa,which stated seller shall retain any and all liabilities arising under the gnp pension plans.as we discuss in detail below,there is no equally clear language allocating responsibility for the health benefits of gnp retired workers.gnp paid these benefits after the sale and until about the time it declared bankruptcy in.when plaintiffs sought benefits from bowater thereafter,plan all claims,citing multiple grounds that gnp and not bowater was responsible for those benefits even before gnp sale to inexcon that the terms of gnp sale clearly stated that gnp and not bowater retained responsibility for its retirees health benefits and that a consolidation of bowater benefit plans effectively terminated any residual responsibility bowater retained under the plans.
on december,fifteen gnp retirees filed this action in federal court on behalf of themselves,their beneficiaries and a class of similarly situated retirees,seeking health benefits from bowater.plaintiffs raise claims under both erisa and the lmra under the erisa claim,workers who retired from both salaried and hourly positions seek health benefits from the date in when gnp refused to continue paying health benefits through april.see a.in addition,retired hourly workers have asserted a claim under of the lmra,alleging that bowater failed to honor its obligations under various cbas to provide them lifetime health benefits.because some of these workers retired under cbas and others retired under a cba adopted in contained substantially different language regarding health lmra claims are split into two counts 
on june,the court certified three classes a single class representing all retired workers seeking relief under the erisa claim and two classes representing former unionized hourly workers who retired before and after the adoption of the cba,respectively.
shortly after class certification,bowater filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims and plaintiffs filed a for summary judgment on the erisa claim.in a thorough opinion,the district court granted bowater motion on the lmra claims,having found that neither the cbas nor the cbas provided for lifetime benefits.it granted plaintiffs on the erisa claim through january,but granted summary judgment to bowater for the period thereafter,finding that bowater remained the sponsor of the health plans after gnp sale steps taken by bowater during the sale did not divest it of responsibility for these benefits and bowater january consolidation of benefits could reasonably have been viewed by the benefits program administrator as having terminated bowater responsibility to gnp retirees.the district court then approved a joint stipulation that the amount owed for the period prior to january,amounted to and entered its final judgment.both sides appealed 
bowater and plaintiffs find fault with the district court determination that bowater responsibility under erisa ended when it consolidated its benefit plans in.bowater insists that its responsibility ended in,when it sold gnp to inexcon.plaintiffs argue that bowater responsibility did not end until.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.int l strategies group,greenberg traurig,llp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.for the reasons we describe in section,we apply de novo review to the benefit plan administrator determination of eligibility for benefits under the terms of the plan,even though the plan documents themselves afford the administrator substantial deference.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where the administrator determination of eligibility depends upon an interpretation of documents in this case,the spa,our review is also de novo.firestone,at.
it is that erisa does not prevent employers from adopting,modifying or terminating welfare plans at any time and for any reason.schoonejongen,d however,it requires that employers meet certain procedural standards when they do so.id.at.in particular,erisa requires that qualifying benefit plans provide a procedure for amending such plan,and for identifying the persons who have authority to amend the plan,b.in addition,such plans must be maintained pursuant to a written instrument that provides for one or more named fiduciaries who have authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan,a,and the fiduciary must act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,a d.we have interpreted this language to require that the amendment or termination of written erisa plans be accomplished through a written document,bellino schlumberger,cir citing frank colt indust,cir,and executed by a party authorized to effect such amendment or termination,law ernst young,cir.
each of bowater benefit plans includes language allowing bowater to terminate or amend the plans at any time through various board resolutions,bowater authorized its chief executive officer,the vice president for human resources,and its chief financial officer to take such action these provisions do not specify any particular steps that must be taken to effectuate a termination or amendment.the supreme court has held that such general clauses meet the requirements of b,at.in so concluding,the court made several observations about the important goals served by erisa procedural requirements.in particular,they increase the likelihood that proposed plan amendments,which are fairly serious events,are recognized as such and given the special consideration they deserve.id.at.they also enable plan administrators to have a mechanism for sorting out,from among the occasional corporate communications that pass through their offices and that conflict with the existing plan terms,the bona fide amendments from those that are not.id.finally,requiring that every benefit plan be maintained pursuant to a written instrument enable s beneficiaries to learn their rights and obligations under the plan at any time.id.at.
in light of these goals,several circuit courts have held that only those written documents that clearly indicate that a plan is being changed or terminated meet erisa procedural requirements.the fifth circuit was the first court to articulate this principle in borst chevron,cir,where it explained the same reasons that an oral agreement can not sustain a cause of action under erisa neither can written modifications or promises which are not,and do not purport to be,formal amendments of a plan.see also kalda sioux valley physician partners,cir sprague general motors,cir.our precedent also recognizes that congress intended erisa insurers to speak clearly,in plain language,to plan recipients.glista unum life ins.of,cir.
the question before us is whether bowater actions in its sale of gnp or in its plan consolidation complied with erisa requirements and terminated its responsibilities for these erisa plans.the principles outlined above guide our review.
a.the effect of gnp sale to inexcon 
bowater advances two related arguments to support its position that its responsibility for benefits under erisa terminated when it sold gnp to inexcon in.first,it argues that the act of selling a and of a parent company responsibilities for such benefits.second,it argues that even if we reject such an automatic termination rule,the particular documents and actions through which bowater sold gnp ended its obligations.plaintiffs counter that the case law does not support a per se rule automatically terminating a parent company benefit responsibilities upon sale of a subsidiary and that such a rule would undermine the procedural protections afforded by erisa.in addition,they argue that neither the terms of the spa nor any other documents or actions related to the sale of gnp to inexcon fulfilled these procedural requirements.the district court adopted plaintiffs position on both contentions.we review these conclusions de novo.having conducted such review,we agree with plaintiffs and the district court that the sale did not terminate bowater responsibilities under its erisa health and benefit plans.
bowater begins its argument for an automatic termination rule by noting that erisa does not prescribe particular steps that must be taken to terminate a welfare plan.in this absence,bowater continues,courts have found that,when an employer action eliminates any of the features required by,mechanisms for administering and funding the action also terminates the plan.bowater concludes that because the sale of a subsidiary typically eliminates one or more requisite features of a welfare plan sponsored by the subsidiary former parent,the sale of the subsidiary generally terminates any such plan.bowater also invokes case law for the proposition that a parent company welfare plan is terminated by operation of law with respect to the employees of a subsidiary when the parent sells the subsidiary by means of a duly authorized written instrument,citing in particular chiles ceridian,cir.see also sejman,cir conkin cnf,wl,dist.lexis.may.finally,bowater argues that an automatic termination rule is consistent with erisa ultimate goal of encouraging employers to establish and maintain welfare plans.bowater contends that allowing employees of a former subsidiary to claim benefits under the former parent welfare plan might cause parent corporations to avoid offering such benefits in the first instance.
we disagree with each link in this logical chain.although bowater is correct that parent companies tend to terminate erisa plans when selling a subsidiary,there is nothing automatic about this correlation.indeed,the three cases bowater cites in support of an automatic termination rule are factually distinguishable from the instant case because each case involved the sale of a subsidiary with attendant circumstances that met erisa procedural requirements.
in chiles,the tenth circuit found that a parent company disability plan was terminated by sale of the subsidiary where the buyer instituted a replacement benefit plan,appointed new trustees to oversee the new plan,the buyer became the new plan administrator,the seller transferred money to fund the new plan and,after the transfer,the buyer assumed all of the seller obligations with respect to the plan beneficiaries.at.in addition,the court noted that the original plan master document clearly stated that the plan terminated for each participant on the date he or she ceases to be an employee of the parent or one of its subsidiaries.id.at.
in sejman,the fourth circuit found that a parent company did not retain responsibility for severance benefits to its former employees after selling its subsidiary where the parent specifically amended its plan to clarify that severance benefits would not be available to employees who had the opportunity to continue working for the acquiring company and the severance policy text specified that,in order to be eligible for benefits,the claimant had to be both an employee of the parent and terminated by the parent as a result of job elimination,work performance,or other reasons of the parent convenience.at emphasis omitted.because the the terminated the workers employment,this specific language established that the employees were not covered by the parent plan.id.at.
finally,in conkin,the district court found that the sale of a subsidiary terminated the parent welfare benefit responsibilities where an employee benefit matters agreement announced that the subsidiary employees immediately ceased participation in the seller benefit plans,the buyer set up new welfare benefits for its employees and the retirees of its new acquisition,and the seller transferred sufficient assets from its own retirement plan to the newly created retirement plan of the buyer to cover the accrued benefits of its plan participants.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
in none of these cases did the mere fact of a sale automatically terminate a parent company responsibility for its subsidiary employee welfare benefit plan.to the contrary,they illustrate that companies tend explicitly to terminate benefit plans in the process of selling a subsidiary.in each of these cases,the language of the agreements and the corresponding changes to plan documents were sufficiently clear to alert employees that the parent was terminating responsibility for its welfare benefits upon the sale of the subsidiary.thus,they met erisa minimal procedural requirements.as we will explain below,bowater did not meet these requirements when it sold gnp.
bowater argument that an automatic termination rule best serves erisa goals is also unpersuasive.while it is true,as bowater emphasizes,that o ne of congress intentions in enacting erisa was to encourage the growth of private employee benefit plans,wolf reliance std.life ins,cir,we have also held that congress intended that erisa plan beneficiaries receive clear information about their plans,see glista,at.bowater overreaches with its argument that requiring such clear information might discourage employers from adopting erisa plans for fear of unexpected outcomes.in our view,requiring parent companies to clarify their responsibility for welfare benefits upon the sale of a subsidiary is a modest requirement,fully compatible with erisa substantive and procedural aims.
gnp sale documents 
bowater next argues that,even if the sale itself did not end its benefit responsibilities,the spa governing bowater sale of gnp to inexcon clearly did so.because the spa was both written and signed by a party duly authorized to amend or terminate its benefit plan,bowater chief financial officer,bowater contends that it satisfies erisa procedural requirements.while plaintiffs agree that the spa was written and signed by a properly identified designee,they argue that the spa did not effectuate either a termination or amendment of bowater responsibility under the plans because it did not purport to do so.we agree.
bowater argues that the spa transfers the obligation to fund the erisa plans from bowater to gnp,thereby amending the plans.it relies on language in section of the spa,which reads 
no undisclosed liabilities.except as set forth in section of the disclosure schedule,and except for the retained liabilities,gnp has no known liabilities or obligations of any nature other than i the liabilities and obligations to the extent reflected in the base balance sheet or the net working capital certificate iv the liabilities and obligations in any of the documents specifically identified in any section of the disclosure schedule,except to the extent within the knowledge of seller after no inquiry by seller and not disclosed by seller herein or in the disclosure schedule collectively,with the exception of retained liabilities,the assumed liabilities.
section a of the disclosure schedule lists the benefit plans under which plaintiffs make their claims.taken together,bowater argues,these documents effectively transfer responsibility for gnp employees health benefits from bowater to gnp.bowater further argues that plaintiffs are wrong to suggest that a document must invoke the magic words amend or terminate in order to effectuate a change to a welfare benefit plan.
we agree with this principle however,irrespective of the failure to use the words amend or terminate,we find this spa language insufficient to meet erisa requirements because the spa fails to convey that the agreement is amending or terminating the plans.therefore,it does not enable the parties to sort out the bona fide amendments from those that are not,or allow them to learn their rights and obligations under the plan at any time,as the supreme court envisioned in,at.see also borst,at.
section of the spa reflects bowater understanding that inexcon was purchasing a liabilities and obligations specifically identified in any section of the disclosure schedule.the benefit plans at issue here are listed in section a of the disclosure schedule.however,the spa itself does not explicitly transfer those liabilities from bowater to gnp.it also does not expressly terminate bowater responsibility for those benefits.finally,even if this language more clearly terminated bowater responsibility for health benefits,the language is embedded in a disclosure provision,where one would not normally look for such a termination.upon reading this spa language,one might expect to find a separate document in which such a transfer or termination took place however,bowater points to no such document indeed,bowater concedes that it did not execute any than the amended or terminated its responsibility for the benefit plans in connection with the sale.
bowater argues that a document claiming to amend or terminate an erisa plan need not be labeled as such,citing a string of cases in support.see halliburton.benefits comm.graves,cir a provision in a merger agreement could amend a welfare plan,even if it is not labeled as a plan amendment.allison bank,cir holding that a plan advisory committee memorandum could serve as a plan amendment if it met the criteria of the plan amendment procedure aldridge,cir finding that adoption of a resolution by a corporation board of directors may terminate a plan horn berdon.defined benefit pension plan,cir holding that a resolution by the corporation board of directors can serve to amend a plan.while these cases support the proposition that a welfare benefit plan may be amended or terminated through a document not itself labeled as an amendment or termination,the pertinent language in each case clearly conveyed that such a change was occurring.that is not true here.
in aldridge and horn,the board resolutions met the erisa procedural criteria they were written documents,signed by parties with authority to amend or terminate the plans they followed the amendment or termination procedures laid out in the plans themselves and,most importantly,each resolution indicated exactly how it would alter the plan.see aldridge,at the resolution reads as follows ii.termination of the retirement plan whereas,the corporation deems it desirable to terminate the retirement plan now therefore be it resolved,that the retirement plan be and hereby is terminated horn,at the board adopted two resolutions in anticipation of the sale the first declared the plan would terminate the second amended the plan to provide each beneficiary with all benefits accrued as of a certain date,and to eliminate any additional benefits accruing thereafter.
more tellingly,halliburton and they found that a merger or plan advisory committee memorandum could amend a determined that the particular actions taken in those cases failed to qualify as plan amendments.in halliburton,the fifth circuit found that halliburton did not,through the merger agreement,assume all rights and responsibilities for the employee benefit plans of the corporation that had merged into its subsidiary.instead,the court concluded that the obligation arose three months later when halliburton entered a separate agreement through which it explicitly agreed to assume,adopt and amend the company employee benefit plans.at.in allison,the court determined that a unanimously approved advisory committee memorandum was insufficient to amend the plan to turn it into a plan where the plan contained specific procedures for such a conversion.instead,the court characterized the resolution as an insufficient step in performing the requirements laid out in the plan for converting to a plan.at.the court went on to say resort to a plan terms in the event of a dispute should not require the prescience of a clairvoyant as to whether an amendment has occurred.we have repeatedly rejected efforts to stray from the express terms of a plan,regardless of whom those express terms may benefit.id.at.
we also note that in bellino,at,we refused to consider a letter the company sent to workers that purported to explain its severance policy and that included new terms as an amendment to the company severance plan.there was no explicit statement that the letter itself was intended to change those terms.we thus drew a distinction between written documents that suggest an amendment or termination has occurred and documents that clearly purport to and actually succeed in amending or terminating an erisa plan.
while bowater is thus correct that it could have amended or terminated its plan in its spa with inexcon,the language of that document did not clearly do so.see also kalda,at rejecting the argument that the amendment of balance sheets reflecting the company plan constituted a plan amendment despite the fact that they were written and approved by an authorized party sprague,at rejecting plaintiffs written statements of acceptance that contained changed plan terms as plan amendments because the documents did not purport to amend the plan.moreover,the original plan named bowater as plan administrator and plan in place and no new responsible parties were identified by bowater.where the plan continued to list bowater as plan sponsor and administrator and the language of the spa did not expressly terminate bowater responsibility,the fact that bowater presumed in the spa a transfer of responsibility to gnp did not meet erisa requirements and therefore failed to accomplish such a transfer.
finally,we note that this outcome does not create an onerous burden on plan sponsors under erisa.as all parties here concede,bowater finally terminated its responsibility under these benefit plans on april,when bowater board of directors amended its benefit plan to clarify that 
no individual who is an employee or former employee of gnp shall be eligible to participate in the plan or any separate benefit program under the plan such plan,benefit program,predecessor and other programs and arrangements,as applied to gnp being terminated as of the date of the sale of gnp to inexcon.
thus,while erisa does not require employers to meet difficult standards in order to amend a welfare benefit plan,it does provide for minimal procedures that must be followed.that is,an erisa plan amendment must be in writing it must be executed by a party authorized to amend the plan the language of the amendment must clearly alert the parties that the plan is being amended and the amendment must meet any other requirements laid out for such amendments in the plan governing documents.this insistence on specificity ensures that disputes between employees and their employers may be resolved by reference to the documents that govern the plan.
c.the consolidation of bowater benefit plans 
bowater is a large corporate conglomerate that employs roughly people and operates pulp and paper mills and related operations at several locations in five different states as well as internationally.effective january,bowater established the bowater incorporated benefit plan bibp as a unified plan to replace the various plans under which its employees received health and welfare benefits.at least in part,this consolidated plan was adopted to ease the administrative burden of filing separate tax returns and forms for each of bowater benefit plans bowater,as plan administrator,determined that bibp adoption effectively terminated its liability under its previous health and benefit plans.the district court,reviewing this decision under the traditional abuse of discretion standard,affirmed that decision.plaintiffs argue that bibp language can not reasonably be construed to effectuate such a termination.before delving into this debate,we must determine the correct standard under which we review bowater decision in light of recent developments in this circuit relating to the standard of review in erisa cases such as this one.
standard of review 
we have traditionally reviewed a denial of benefits under an erisa plan for abuse of discretion where the plan document itself grants the plan administrator discretion to determine eligibility or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone,at.where the plan administrator operates under a conflict of interest,where the plan administrator is also the plan sponsor and therefore stands to gain from each dollar of benefits it denies to claimants,we have reviewed the administrator interpretation of plan terms and eligibility for abuse of discretion,but with more bite,placing special emphasis on reasonableness.doyle paul revere life ins,cir.
however,since the district court issued its decision in this case,we have issued a decision,denmark liberty life assur,cir,which calls into question the appropriate standard of review for erisa cases involving structural conflicts such as those that exist in this case.in denmark,two members of the court expressed their unease with the traditional standard of review in these cases and urged the court to reconsider this issue in an en banc proceeding.a petition for rehearing en banc that asks the court to reconsider the standard of review in erisa cases involving structural conflicts of interest is currently pending before this court.as we stated in a similarly situated case if we thought any change in the applicable standard of review and we are not intimating in any way that there will necessarily be such a change might affect the outcome of this appeal,we would defer a decision on this appeal until the en banc petition in denmark was resolved.kansky bottling,cir.however,as we describe below,we find that plaintiffs claim fails even under de novo review and so we need not delay our review of this issue.
reviewing the bibp 
plaintiffs and bowater agree that the key language with respect to plaintiffs claims is set forth in article i,section of the bibp,labeled benefit programs 
the separate benefit programs that are consolidated into the plan are listed in appendix separate program documents which describe the specific benefits provided by each benefit program,the individuals covered by each benefit program and the other terms and conditions of each benefit program,including any contract with an insurance company maintained in connection with a benefit program,as amended from time to time,shall be incorporated herein by this reference.the plan supersedes and replaces any program document defining the terms of or describing a benefit program that is not incorporated and made part of the plan.if there is a conflict between the specific terms of a program document and the terms of the plan,the program document shall control unless contrary to applicable law,except that any terms exclusively set forth in the plan document shall control.
emphasis added.
both sides agree that plaintiffs are not covered under the terms of the bibp.bowater contends that section,particularly the third underlined sentence,consolidates all of bowater benefit plans into a single plan and supersedes any plans not listed in appendix a plaintiffs plans are not listed in appendix a.plaintiffs disagree and argue that the only thing being superseded or replaced are informal documents describing benefit plans listed in appendix a.according to this reading,the excerpted language does not refer to,and thus has no effect on,plaintiffs benefit plans.
the bibp itself specifies that w henever capitalized and used in the plan,particular words and phrases shall have the respective meanings specified in this section unless the context plainly requires a different meaning.because two of these terms play an important role in plaintiffs interpretation of the bibp,we include their defined meanings here 
benefit program means a separate welfare program that is sponsored by an employer and which forms part of the plan and is incorporated herein by reference.
program document means the written summary of the terms of each separate benefit program,that may consist of a summary plan description,separate plan document insurance company contract or certificate.
the heart of the debate concerns the third sentence of section and,in particular,what is being superseded or replaced by its third sentence this question,as posed by plaintiffs,turns on whether the phrase that is not incorporated and made part of the plan modifies program document or benefit program.
plaintiffs interpretation 
plaintiffs argue that the phrase that is not incorporated and made part of the plan modifies the term program document and that what is being superseded are informal program documents that are not incorporated into the bibp.in making their case,they distinguish between the capitalized term,program documents,which they describe as formal program documents,and the uncapitalized term,program documents,which they characterize as informal program documents.they interpret the second sentence of section uses the capitalized incorporating into the bibp the formal program documents associated with the benefit programs listed in appendix a.they interpret the third purposefully employs the uncapitalized requiring that informal documents associated with the benefits programs listed in appendix a be superseded or replaced by the terms of the bibp.on this reading,the superseded materials are informal as information brochures and handouts describing plan distinguished from official program documents.thus,the overall effect of these three sentences is to incorporate into the bibp the formal program documents of all benefit programs listed in appendix a and to supersede any inconsistent terms and conditions contained in informal documents describing those same programs.according to plaintiffs,this language has no effect on any benefit those at issue in this are not listed in appendix 
plaintiffs also argue that their interpretation of the bibp preserves the defined meaning of the capitalized term benefit program.this is so because benefit program refers only to benefit programs listed in appendix a.if the phrase,that is not incorporated and made part of the plan modifies benefit program as bowater it strips the capitalized term of its contractually provided meaning because a benefit program can not be both incorporated under the bibp as the term capitalization suggests and not incorporated and made part of the plan as the modifying clause suggests.
plaintiffs construction of section reflects the proposition that it would be reasonable for a company to attempt to eliminate possibly inconsistent references to its plans,or imprecise use of plan terms,by limiting the relevant documents to those formally generated.see,health cost controls of,washington,cir noting that in erisa land often the terms of an erisa plan must be inferred from a series of documents none clearly labeled as the plan.however,such informal documents generally contain language clarifying that they contain merely a summary of the plan terms and that the actual agreement contains the operative terms.id.thus,the need expressly to exclude such documents from being considered part of the consolidated plan is not compelling.moreover,plaintiffs argument that the critical phrase that is not incorporated and made part of the plan modifies program document is weakened considerably by the fact that the modifying phrase comes after the intervening phrase defining the terms of or describing a benefit program.the grammatical rule of the last antecedent which was used by the supreme court in barnhart thomas,d,and which provides that a modifying phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,that the phrase modifies benefit program rather than program document.thus the sole virtue of plaintiffs interpretation is that it preserves the defined meaning of the capitalized term benefit program in the third sentence of this section.
bowater interpretation 
bowater reads the third sentence as providing that any benefit program not incorporated into the consolidated plan is superseded and replaced by the bibp.this reading has the effect of consolidating all outstanding bowater plans into a single plan under the terms and conditions of the bibp.thus,according to bowater,the superseded program documents are those describing unincorporated benefit programs,not informal documents describing incorporated benefit programs.because the plan supersedes and replaces the program documents describing unincorporated benefit programs,it effectively terminates those programs as well.bowater emphasizes that this interpretation squares with the intention stated on the first page of the establishment and purpose that a ll benefit programs offered under the plan shall constitute a single plan for purposes of the annual reporting requirements of the internal revenue code and erisa.its interpretation is also grammatically superior to plaintiffs because the modifying phrase that is not incorporated and made part of the plan directly follows benefit plan rather than program document,suggesting that the phrase is referring to benefit plans that are not being incorporated into the plan.
as plaintiffs point out,however,bowater interpretation seems to conflict with the bibp own definition of benefit program,which means a separate welfare program that is sponsored by an employer and which forms part of the bibp.nonetheless,as the plan itself explains,such capitalized terms shall have the respective meanings defined in the contract unless the context plainly requires a different meaning.here,bowater argues that we must read the term benefit program in the context of the modifying phrase that is not incorporated and made part of the plan.
finally,bowater casts doubt on the sharp distinction plaintiffs draw between formal program documents and informal program documents.this distinction is at the heart of plaintiffs argument that the contested sentence of the bibp intends the bibp to supersede and replace informal program documents of benefit programs incorporated in appendix a.this distinction is not borne out by the definition of program documents,which includes any written summary of the terms of each separate benefit program,and specifies that such a summary may consist of a summary plan description,separate plan document insurance company contract or certificate.while the second sentence of this definition refers to an array of formal documents,the definition contemplates a mix of formal and informal documents.thus,while plaintiffs interpretation may preserve the proper usage of the defined term benefit program in the third sentence of section,its reliance on a sharp distinction that seems inconsistent with the definition of program document significantly weakens its appeal.bowater also offers a plausible alternative account for its use of the uncapitalized term program documents in the contested sentence.rather than signaling that informal documents were being superseded and replaced,bowater explains that program documents remains uncapitalized because the capitalized term refers only to the program documents associated with benefit plans listed in appendix because the third sentence refers to program documents associated with benefit programs that are not incorporated into the bibp,the more inclusive,uncapitalized term was necessary.
c.the more persuasive interpretation 
we find bowater arguments significantly more persuasive than plaintiffs for the following reasons 
given that the modifying phrase directly follows benefit program rather than program document,bowater argument is consistent with the rule of the last antecedent 
plaintiffs textual argument relies on the shaky foundation of a strict dichotomy between formal and informal program documents that is not supported by the bibp own definitions of program document 
plaintiffs argument based on the plan capitalization scheme ignores the important language in the plan itself explaining that the defined terms should not be given effect where context requires otherwise 
plaintiffs account of what the third sentence of section and replacing informal unpersuasive,given that such informal documents tend explicitly to state that,where their terms conflict with the terms in the actual program documents,the latter are controlling 
bowater any program documents related to plans not incorporated in the bibp were superseded and replaced by the terms of the more logically consistent with the purpose behind the bibp adoption to consolidate bowater many benefit plans into a single plan and 
focusing on the plain language of the disputed provision and putting aside for the moment the technical arguments of the parties,that provision expressly states that it supersedes and replaces program documents associated with unincorporated benefit is,any benefit program that is not listed in appendix a to the terminating those unincorporated benefit programs.the benefit programs at issue here are not listed in appendix hence,by the plain language of the disputed provision,the benefit programs at issue have been superseded and replaced.without intending or implying any criticism of the skillful advocacy of plaintiffs,the fact that advocacy can muster arguments that seem to impugn the clarity of such plan language does not mean that the document language is insufficiently clear for erisa purposes.see foisy royal maccabees life ins,cir explaining,in the context of contract interpretation,that a mere controversy over interpretation is not,by itself,enough to create ambiguity.the plan at issue here conveys with the clarity required by erisa that program documents related to unincorporated benefit plans like plaintiffs health plans and those plans as superseded and replaced by the bibp.for all of these reasons,we affirm the district court ruling that bowater plan consolidation effectively terminated its responsibility for plaintiffs health benefits 
in addition to the erisa claim applicable to all class members,retirees who were employed on an hourly basis under union contracts also seek lifetime health benefits that they claim were promised to them under the terms of their cbas with bowater.our conclusion that the bibp ended bowater responsibility for the benefit plans on january,under erisa has no effect on these claims,which arise under the lmra.we consider each subclass claims in turn.as this issue requires us to interpret a labor contract under the lmra,our review is de novo,bath marine draftsmen ass nlrb,cir,and it is governed by substantive federal law,textile workers union lincoln mills,d.
a provision in each of the cbas states that health and welfare benefits will be provided d uring the term of this labor agreement.this provision applies equally to active employees during the term of the cba and to employees who retire during the term of the cba despite this clear durational language,plaintiffs contend that all parties understood these cbas to provide lifetime health benefits to gnp employees.plaintiffs argue that bowater statements and actions support this shared understanding and create a latent ambiguity that requires us to look beyond the clear language of the contracts to construe the cbas.plaintiffs remind us that,because we are reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment,we must reverse if we find that plaintiffs have established a genuine issue of material fact that a reasonable jury could resolve in their favor.see,cir.even under this standard,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have failed to identify any such ambiguity.
we have stated that a n unambiguous contract must be enforced according to its terms,under both the common law and labor law.senior nstar gas,cir.however,in the exceptional case,a latent ambiguity in seemingly clear contract language may require us to consider extrinsic evidence to determine the actual object of the parties agreement.see rci ne.servs.div.boston edison,cir.an ambiguity is latent when the language employed is clear and intelligible and suggests but a single meaning,but some extrinsic fact or extraneous evidence creates a necessity for interpretation or a choice among two or more possible meanings.moore.castle energy,cir.for example,a contract may refer to an object by a name that denotes more than one actual thing or the parties may use a term that,while signifying one thing in common parlance,designates something particular within the industry jargon.see am int l,graphic mgmt,cir giving examples of both scenarios.the classic case of latent ambiguity is raffles wichelhaus,hurlstone coltman,eng.ex,in which a contract respecting a shipment of cotton to arrive from a certain port on the ship peerless was found ambiguous when the parties discovered that two ships named peerless had departed from the same port.we review de novo whether a contract is ambiguous.senior,at.
mindful that a court may not deprive the contracting parties of the protection they sought when they embodied their agreement in writing,courts have generally allowed only objective evidence to establish such a latent ambiguity.that includes evidence of ambiguity that can be supplied by disinterested third parties,am int l,at,and evidence that is uncontested between the parties,rossetto pabst brewing,cir it excludes the testimony of one party to the contract as to what the contract really means,id.
here,plaintiffs seek to introduce extrinsic evidence of bowater statements and actions indicating that both parties understood that the cbas provided lifetime benefits.in doing so,plaintiffs do not provide a plausible alternative meaning for the durational language in the contracts.instead,they argue that the language does not mean what it says this argument goes well beyond the parameters of latent ambiguity jurisprudence,which recognizes that there must be either contractual language on which to hang the label of ambiguous or some yawning void that cries out for an implied term.extrinsic evidence should not be used to add terms to a contract that is plausibly complete without them.bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc see also am int l,at t he ambiguity is in the reference,that is,the connection between the word and the object that it denotes.plaintiffs reject this approach as unduly narrow,arguing that rossetto teaches that a contract is latently ambiguous not only in the cases like raffles,but whenever anyone knowledgeable about the context of the agreement would realize that it might not mean what it says.rossetto,at.
we do not agree that rossetto authorizes such a broad approach in that case,the seventh circuit found a latent ambiguity in a labor contract,due to its silence on the duration of the employer commitment to provide welfare benefits.id.while the lack of a durational term would ordinarily carry no special meaning,the seventh circuit found that an ambiguity arose when the contract was compared to a labor contract between the same employer and a second union that was identical to the first labor contract except that it included a clear limitation on the duration of the employer obligation.id.at.thus rossetto seems to fall into the category of cases in which extrinsic evidence is allowed to fill a yawning void that cries out for an implied term.it provides no support for using extrinsic evidence to ignore a clear term stated in the contract.indeed,the seventh circuit refused to consider extrinsic evidence to establish a latent ambiguity in a labor contract with clear durational language in the subsequent case of cherry auburn gear,cir.focusing on the language of the contract,the court explained that i solated comments by company officials do not allow us to look beyond the written contracts agreed to by the parties,id.at statements in letters sent to employees signifie d nothing concerning the meaning of the contract itself,and statements made by the employer during an arbitration action are limited by the clear language of the contract,in which lifetime benefits are only operable so long as they are provided for in the current cba,id.at.
indeed,the seventh circuit rejected a similar argument that a clear durational term was latently ambiguous where plaintiffs could provide no plausible alternative meaning for the phrase 
plaintiff strives mightily to persuade us that the phrase for the term of this agreement is one of those contractual terms that may seem clear on its face but in reality is ambiguous,rather like the ship peerless or the use of specialized trade jargon.examination of defendant own negotiators notes would prove,according to plaintiff,that neither party intended to destroy the retirees right to lifetime medical benefits when they introduced that phrase for the first time into the contract.instead,it had a private,specialized meaning.but plaintiff argument breaks down at that point.neither in his brief,in the department of labor amicus brief,or at oral argument,was anyone able clearly and succinctly to tell us definitively what that specialized meaning might be.

b.the cbas 
the cbas were negotiated in anticipation of gnp sale to inexcon.accordingly,they provided that,u pon the date of sale,all bowater contractual obligations except those referred to in the inexcon offer under pensions shall cease.in the section on pensions,the agreements stated bowater will retain liability for retirement benefits earned and accrued through the day of sale.they also provided that,unless modified by the agreements themselves,the terms of the cbas would remain in full force and effect.thus,since we have already determined that the cbas provided no lifetime health benefits,plaintiffs must show that the cba provided such benefits for the first time.
plaintiffs rely on two sources in arguing that the cbas entitle workers to lifetime health coverage from bowater.they begin with language from the section of the cbas discussing bowater responsibility for pension benefits,arguing that a fact finder could rea
