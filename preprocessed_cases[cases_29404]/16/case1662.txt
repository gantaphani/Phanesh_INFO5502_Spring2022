in response to the petition for rehearing filed by defendants aetna healthcare and aetna life insurance company,and having duly considered the response and the reply,we withdraw the prior panel opinion,in its entirety and substitute the following 
the bank of louisiana the bank appeals a summary judgment for the defendants aetna healthcare and aetna life insurance company collectively aetna.the issue on appeal is whether the bank state law claims of detrimental reliance,breach of contract,and misrepresentation are preempted by the employee retirement income security act,et.erisa.
in,the bank entered into two contracts with aetna.first,the bank entered into an administrative services contract asc with aetna to administer the bank employee benefit plan the plan second,the bank purchased from aetna a insurance policy for the plan the policy provided an individual or specific amount of and an aggregate amount of the coverage was scheduled to terminate on december.
the bank,however,reached the aggregate amount in.late in that year,the parties met to form a new contract that would provide coverage commencing on january.the bank also purchased an extension on its coverage that would apply to claims incurred in and for which benefits would be paid during the first three months of.in a letter from account representative stacy mcmahon,aetna stated that the extension would mean that the bank would have no additional claim liabilities for and no additional fund transfers would be requested.mcmahon further stated that aetna would start wiring the bank account for claims paid during the runoff period and the bank would be reimbursed at.during the three month period,the bank submitted in net claims incurred by plan members in.aetna drafted the bank account for these claims over the course of and.five of these drafts occurred during the extension period,totaling.nevertheless,aetna declined to reimburse the bank.
the bank filed a complaint alleging that aetna had negligently or fraudulently misrepresented that,pursuant to the extension,aetna would reimburse the bank for the that it drafted from the bank account.in particular,the bank first claimed that aetna misrepresented the value and benefit of its payment to aetna for the extension to the policy.second,the bank alleged that aetna misrepresented the scope of the extension and that the bank had detrimentally relied on these representations.third,the bank alleged that aetna breached express and implied contracts,including a contract to reimburse the bank for claims that were paid or should have been paid during the extension period.fourth,the bank alleged that aetna breached its fiduciary duties as plan administrator by administering the plan in such a fashion as to delay the processing of claims in order to remove them from coverage under the extension.finally,in an amended complaint,the bank alleged that aetna had violated louisiana revised statutes and 
aetna moved for summary judgment on the ground that the bank claims were preempted by erisa.in a series of briefs,aetna argued that erisa preempted claims between an employer and a plan administrator.the bank responded that its claim of detrimental reliance and a claim for attorney fees under louisiana revised statute,the latter of which it had not pled were not preempted because they exclusively involved parties providing services to an erisa plan in a capacity.the bank withdrew its breach of fiduciary duty and abandoned its claims under louisiana revised statute.the district court held that erisa preempted all of the bank remaining claims and granted summary judgment for aetna.
in reviewing a summary judgment,we apply the same standard as the district court.martin alamo community coll,cir.we affirm only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.for a defendant to obtain summary judgment on an affirmative defense,it must establish beyond dispute all of the defense essential elements.id.we review the district court legal determination that erisa preempts a state law claim de novo.bullock equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,cir.
erisa preemption clause,a,states that with certain exceptions,erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan the supreme court has observed repeatedly that this broadly worded provision is clearly expansive.egelhoff egelhoff ex rel.breiner,d quoting state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.the court has held that a state law relates to an erisa plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.id.at.quoting shaw delta air lines,d.simultaneously,however,the court recognizes that,given its broadest reading,the phrase relate to would encompass virtually all state law,and that its connection with and reference to interpretations are scarcely more restrictive.id.at.the court has,therefore,declined to apply an uncritical literalism to the phrase and instead takes the the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
congress objectives in enacting erisa were to 
protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto,by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans,and by providing appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.
b.to this end,erisa preemption provision is intended to establish a uniform administrative scheme,which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.egelhoff,at.quoting fort halifax packing coyne,d.a uniform administrative scheme serves to minimize administrative and financial burdens by avoiding the need to tailor plans to the peculiarities of the law of each state.mcclendon,d.
in light of these statutory objectives,this court applies a test to the defense of erisa preemption.a defendant pleading preemption must prove that the claim addresses an area of exclusive federal concern,such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of the plan and the claim directly affects the relationship among traditional erisa employer,the plan and its fiduciaries,and the participants and beneficiaries.mayeaux.health serv.and indem,cir.because erisa preemption is an affirmative defense,aetna bears the burden of proof on both elements.see metro.life ins.taylor,d erisa preemption is a defense settles golden rule ins,cir defendant bears burden of proving erisa preemption kanne.life ins,cir same.
aetna argues that the bank claims require inquiry into the administration of the area of exclusive federal some of the drafts on the bank account were for benefit claims paid after the extension expired.aetna contends that the bank intends to prove that these drafts nonetheless fall within the extension because they arise from benefit claims that aetna improperly delayed processing.to the extent that the bank intends to prove its breach of contract claim through evidence that aetna improperly delayed processing and paying benefit claims,aetna is correct that it would require inquiry into an area of exclusive federal concern.see hollis provident life and accident ins,cir right to receive benefits under an erisa plan is an area of exclusive federal concern hubbard blue cross blue shield ass n,cir claim that would require inquiry into how benefit claims were processed implicates area of federal concern.
the bank has asserted,however,several other claims that do not require inquiry into aetna processing of benefit claims or administration of the plan.for example,to the extent the bank breach of contract claim is premised on aetna failure to reimburse it for amounts actually paid during the extension period,the claim does not depend on proof that aetna improperly
