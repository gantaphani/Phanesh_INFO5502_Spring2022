in this suit involving personal injuries on a drilling platform on the outer continental shelf off the coast of louisiana,the district court granted summary judgment to the platform owner and two independent contractors whom the owner had hired to monitor the drilling operation.holding as a matter of law that appellees are not subject to strict liability,are not guilty of negligence,nor responsible for the negligent acts,if any,of the drilling contractor another independent contractor not appearing in this appeal,or for loss of evidence,we affirm.
anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko as principal contracted with parker drilling offshore corporation parker as drilling contractor to complete a well on anadarko stationary platform.plaintiff employer,llc,was under contract with anadarko to provide filtration services for the project.carl fruge was operating a filter unit on the platform when a discharge hose which was part of parker rig ruptured and injured him.
the ruptured hose was not produced for examination despite plaintiff demands.the hose is lost.the supervisors saw the ruptured hose at the time of the accident and several times after the accident.those supervisors were employees of stokes spiehler usa,and greg zielinski,with whom anadarko had contracted to provide company men for supervision.
fruge sued parker,anadarko,stokes spiehler,and zielinski,among others.anadarko,stokes spiehler,and zielinski moved for summary judgment on the basis that they were not negligent and did not exercise operational control over parker drilling operations so bore no responsibility for parker alleged negligence.
the district court granted all three motions.fruge claims against parker remain in the district court 
this court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the.coulter texaco,cir coleman houston indep.sch,cir.
federal jurisdiction is predicated on the outer continental shelf lands act oscla,et.ocsla adopts the law of the adjacent state louisiana as surrogate federal law,to the extent that it is not inconsistent with other federal laws and regulations.bartholomew cng producing,cir a a.thus the law applicable is federal law,supplemented by state law of the adjacent state.rodrigue aetna cas.sur,d.
bearing in mind these principles,we are first asked to determine whether federal regulations create civil liability beyond the liability under state law as enunciated in coulter texaco.applying louisiana negligence law,coulter held that a principal is not liable for the actions of its independent contractor unless the principal retained operational control over the contractor work discussed infra or expressly or impliedly approved its unsafe work practice that led to an injury.coulter,at.
fruge argues that coulter is not an appropriate precedent because it did not deal with federal minerals management service mms regulations enacted after coulter.those regulations,according to plaintiff,place primary responsibility on the mineral lessee anadarko and its agents zielinski and stokes spiehler for supervising the operations and maintaining safety over the operations and any regard to operational control or authorization of an unsafe work practice.if a mineral lessee establishes that it did not maintain operational control,according to fruge,it has necessarily violated the federal regulations,creating liability as a matter of law.the key regulation,in plaintiff view,charges that the lessee,the operator,and the person actually performing the activity are jointly and severally responsible for complying with the offshore mms regulations.a c.this regulation further allows the regional supervisor to require any or all to fulfill obligations under the regulations or the lease,if the designated operator fails to fulfill obligations under the regulations.id.b 
the mms regulations in place at the time of coulter similarly carried the concept of responsibility on the parts of both the lessee and the operator for obligations under the lease and the regulations the secretary has considered the law to have provided for joint and several liability of and the operator since the enactment of ocsla and the common law,through the present date although the regulations have been modified a number of times,the regulations and commentary mainfest the intention to retain this shared liability over the years.nothing in the regulations preempts coulter,and coulter is therefore still precedent.
additionally,this court has held that a violation of the mms regulations does not give rise to a private cause of action.romero mobil exploration producing north america,cir.the regulations govern the parties joint and several liabilities the government not amongst themselves this principle also defeats fruge contention that anadarko had a duty under the regulations to use the best available and safest technology to test the hose.under the drilling contract,the obligation to maintain and repair parker equipment and to comply with applicable safety regulations rested on parker shoulders the ocsla regulations do not create an independent duty under louisiana negligence law.dupre chevron,cir.therefore,we will follow the guidance of coulter and romero,finding nothing in the mms regulations to preempt their application.
fruge next argues that,regardless of the mms regulations,under the coulter standard,the evidence left a question of fact whether anadarko and its company representatives retained operational control over the work of its independent contractor,parker.to determine whether the exception for operational control makes a principal liable,we first examine the extent to which anadarko contractually reserved the right to control the work.coulter,at.
under the contract between parker and anadarko,parker was responsible for the maintenance and repair of all its own equipment.master domestic daywork drilling contract.parker also was responsible for the operation and control of the drilling unit,including supervision and having final authority and responsibility for the safety and operation of all systems and all personnel associated with the drilling operation.contract a.when the contract assigns the independent contractor responsibility for its own activities,the principal does not retain operational control.coulter,at.
operational control exists only if the principal has direct supervision over the process of accomplishing the work such that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.lejeune shell oil,cir mccormack noble drilling,cir.here,parker was exclusively responsible for controlling the details of the work it performed the contract provided that parker shall be an independent contractor with respect to performance of all work hereunder.anadarko shall have no direction or control of parker or parker personnel except in the results to be obtained.contract emphasis added.
the summary judgment evidence shows anadarko provided supervision per day,via various independent contractors whose employees reported to anadarko staff engineers on a daily basis.the physical presence of a representative of a principal is not sufficient to show supervision or control.ainsworth shell offshore,cir,cert.denied,d,graham amoco oil,cir.periodic inspections by a principal company man do not equate to that principal retaining control over the operations conducted by a drilling crew.ainsworth,at.in short,absent an express or implied order to the contractor to engage in an unsafe work practice leading to an injury,a principal can not be liable under the operational control exception.coulter,at.
summary judgment is appropriate because plaintiff has failed to present facts sufficient to distinguish his case from coulter.see celotex catrett,d summary judgment is appropriate unless plaintiff can present evidence to support each essential element of his claim.this court has consistently held on similar facts that a principal,such as anadarko,who hires independent contractors over which he exercises no operational control has no duty to discover and remedy hazards created by its independent con
