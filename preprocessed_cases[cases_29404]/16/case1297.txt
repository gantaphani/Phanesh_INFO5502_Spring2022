this case presents two questions,each born of the efforts of capital one,a credit card issuer,to defer significant tax liability.the first question is whether capital one can retroactively change the method of accounting used to report late fees on its and tax returns in such a fashion as would reduce its taxable income for those years by roughly.the second is whether capital one can deduct the estimated costs of coupon redemption related to its milesone credit card program before credit card customers actually redeem those coupons.we can not accept capital one views on either of the questions herein.for the reasons that follow,we shall affirm the judgment of the tax court.
capital one is a publicly held financial and bank holding company.its principal subsidiaries,capital one bank cob and capital one,fsb,provide products and issue visa and mastercard credit cards.capital one earns part of its income from a variety of fees associated with its lending services,including late fees charged to customers who do not make their payments on time,overlimit fees charged to customers who exceed their credit limits,interchange fees on purchase transactions,and cash advance fees.in and,late fees comprised a larger percentage of capital one annual income than any other single type of fee.
in its tax return,capital one changed its tax treatment of income from certain fees in response to the taxpayer relief act of the tra,stat,partially codified at a.the tra extended original issue discount treatment for federal income tax purposes to certain credit card revenues,or any pool of debt instruments the yield on which may be affected by reason of prepayments.a c iii.original issue discount oid is defined in the code as the excess if any of a debt instrument stated redemption price at maturity,over the issue price.a.under the code,the gain from oid is included in gross income as interest over the obligation duration,rather than entirely at the time the debt instrument is issued or is redeemed.see a.with respect to certain credit card fees that capital one historically included as income when charged to the customer,changing to an oid accounting method would spread the fee income over the period between when the fee was first charged and when it was reasonably expected to be collected from the credit card holder.see a.
to change accounting methods,a taxpayer must first obtain the consent of the secretary.see e a taxpayer who intends to change his method of accounting shall,before computing his taxable income under the new method,secure the consent of the secretary.to request the secretary consent,a taxpayer typically files a form,application for change in accounting method.see reg.e i.with respect to the tra,revenue procedure clarifies that a taxpayer can secure automatic consent to change accounting methods due to the enactment of a c iii as long as the taxpayer timely files and correctly fills out form.proc,app.
cob,but not fsb,did file a form with its income tax return.in its form,cob stated capital one bank cob,a domestic corporation,requests permission under section of proc.to change its method of accounting for interest and original issue discount that are subject to the provisions of section of the taxpayer relief act of.in the form,the taxpayer is required to provide a detailed description of the pool s of debt instruments and the proposed accounting method to be adopted.proc,app.cob specified that the pool of debt instruments consists of all credit card receivables held by the taxpayer and t he proposed method is to account for interest and oid as required by section a.adopting this proposed change in accounting method,capital one reported income from overlimit fees,cash advance fees,and interchange fees as oid in its and returns.
capital one did not,however,report income as oid in those returns.rather it continued to recognize this income under the method,meaning at the time those fees were charged to cardholders.had capital one treated late fee revenue as oid it would have deferred millions of dollars of tax liability by distributing the revenue over the period between when the fee was charged and when the customer was expected to actually pay the fee.
at the same time,capital one in began its milesone program.in exchange for an annual membership fee,participants were issued visa and mastercard milesone credit cards and earned miles for every dollar charged on a miles one credit card account.participants could earn up to an additional miles for balances transferred to their milesone account and were limited to a maximum of miles earned per billing cycle.once sufficiently accumulated,these miles were redeemable for airline tickets purchased by capital one.
in and,capital one estimated future redemption costs related to its milesone program and deducted this amount on its tax returns for those years.an taxpayer such as capital one is generally prohibited from deducting estimated future costs,see h,with an exception when a taxpayer issues trading stamps or premium coupons with sales and such stamps or coupons are redeemable by such taxpayer in merchandise,cash,or other property,reg.a.where the exception applies,the reasonable estimated redemption costs are deducted from gross receipts with respect to sales with which trading stamps or coupons are issued.id.capital one relied on this exception when it claimed current deductions for estimated liability for future airline tickets in the amount of for and for.upon audit,the commissioner disallowed the deductions on the basis that the rewards program reserve estimates did not qualify for the exception.
capital one brought suit in the tax court contesting,inter alia,the commissioner disallowance of deductions claimed for estimated miles redemption costs.in an amended petition,capital one also sought to change its accounting method for late fees for and.seven years after filing its and tax forms capital one sought to retroactively report late fees as oid and so reduce its taxable income by for and by for.the commissioner and capital one filed for partial summary judgment with respect to the late fees issue taxpayers motion was limited to cob and the tax court granted the commissioner motion.
the tax court held that capital one could not retroactively change its treatment of cob and fsb income for and because it would be an impermissible change in method of accounting under e.capital one fin.comm r,wl.according to the court,capital one was required to secure the commissioner consent to change its accounting method and it failed to do so with respect to its treatment of income on its and returns.the court emphasized that the consent requirement serves an important purpose,to assure consistency in the method of accounting used for tax purposes and thus prevent distortions of income which usually accompany a change of accounting method and which could have an adverse effect upon the revenue.id.at.
after a bench trial,the tax court also disallowed capital one deduction of estimated costs associated with the rewards program.the court held that the taxpayers milesone program did not constitute sales as required by treasury regulation.rather,capital one lending provide s a service,but that service does not transform a loan into a sale for purposes of.capital one fin.comm r,wl.interpreting,the tax court explained that t he regulation encompasses a sale of services,but it does not follow that every provision of services is a sale of services.id.in addition,the court held that capital one did not have gross receipts under the regulation from which to deduct the estimated costs because capital one did not issue miles with respect to the revenues capital one earned.id.at.
this appeal by capital one followed.we review the tax court decision under the same standard as district court civil bench trials.ripley comm r,cir.the grant of the commissioner motion for partial summary judgment on the late fees issue is reviewed de novo.see henson liggett,cir.questions of law and statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo and findings of fact for clear error.waterman comm r,cir.
we shall review in this section the late fees issue and then in the next section address the milesone program.as will be explained,to accept taxpayers position on either issue would invite uncertainty and confusion in tax administration.
as to income,capital one seeks to retroactively change accounting methods years after it selected and implemented an alternative method.the purported change would reduce capital one taxable income for and by approximately.to allow such changes without the prior consent of the commissioner would roil the administration of the tax laws,sending revenue projection and collection into a churning and unpredictable state.belated attempts to change accounting methods would require recomputation and readjustment of tax liability for subsequent years and impose burdensome uncertainties upon the administration of the revenue laws.pac.welch.for that reason,the supreme court has held that once a taxpayer has reported income according to a particular method it must live with that choice the taxpayer has made an election that is binding upon it and the commissioner.id.at.
in its and returns capital one accounted for late fees under the method and did not report late fees as oid.at the time,treasury had yet to clarify exactly which credit card revenues were to be treated as oid under a and it was not until that the irs informed taxpayers that late fees may be treated as such.see proc.starting with its tax return,capital one began and has continued to report late fees as oid.although the commissioner concedes that as a general matter income may be treated as oid,the question is whether capital one may retroactively treat such income in that fashion on its and returns.we hold that it may not.
the critical problem for capital one is that it never secured the necessary consent to make the change.both statute and regulation require a taxpayer to secure consent to change accounting methods and to do so prior to calculating taxable income.section e of the code instructs that a taxpayer who intends to change accounting methods,shall,before computing his taxable income under the new method,secure the consent of the secretary.e emphasis added see reg.e.
the consent requirement serves several valuable functions,equipping the commissioner with leverage to protect the fisc,to avoid burdensome administrative uncertainties,and to promote accounting uniformity.diebold,united states,aff,see barber comm r,wl.the requirement thus helps to regularize the collection of the revenue.it prevents distortions and inconsistencies in reporting and ensures that income does not get taxed twice or escape taxation altogether.see rankin comm r,cir.the commissioner is therefore vested with broad discretion to grant or withhold consent,see brown helvering,and may condition consent on the taxpayer agreement to make correcting adjustments in his income tax payments.witte comm r.such adjustments required for a change in method of accounting are made pursuant to a.
the law thus requires what common sense would suggest.section e prerequisite of prior consent forecloses precisely what capital one attempts prevents taxpayers from unilaterally amending their tax returns simply because they have discovered that a different method of accounting yields a lower tax liability than the method they originally chose.diebold,at.if unilateral changes were permitted the administrative costs would be severe the irs would be required to multiply its detection and examination efforts to prevent abuse of unconsented retroactive changes.diebold.at.moreover,retroactive change would become the exclusive tool of those seeking to reduce taxable income uniformity in accounting would become a function of financial advantage and the administrative difficulties of detecting unwarranted unilateral changes would be multiplied.fpl,comm r,wl.capital one effort to reduce its taxable income by roughly exemplifies the potential for abuse if we were to give the green light to retroactive changes without prior consent.
capital one claims,however,that it was not subject to the general consent requirement to change its tax treatment of income.this argument misfires in a number of ways.
capital one first contends that it did not need to secure consent because it was rectifying the use of an improper accounting method.capital one points to the language of a a,which directs that oid shall be determined with respect to any debt instrument to which the statute applies.capital one maintains that because the accounting changes provided for by the taxpayer relief act are mandatory,it was required to report late fees as oid and therefore does not need consent to retroactively comply with this requirement.
the alleged necessity of the change,however,is beside the point.regardless of whether capital one was required to change the tax treatment of income in and which is a matter of dispute,a taxpayer remains obliged to secure consent even when changing from an improper to a proper method.in diebold,for example,the court held that even if taxpayer were correcting an erroneous characterization the correction would still be considered a change in the method of accounting for which consent is required.at see also pac.enters.comm r,wl i t is not sufficient that petitioner merely show the correctness of a new method that fact alone can not justify a change without the secretary consent.reg.e i consent must be secured whether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the internal revenue code or the regulations thereunder.
revenue procedure,which provides the procedures for making changes in accounting to comply with the tra,specifically forbids a retroactive change in method of accounting without commissioner authorization.proc.this prohibition applies regardless of whether the change is from a permissible or an impermissible method,id.and with good reason.what is permissible or impermissible will often be a matter of interpretation or dispute as to which the taxpayer can not arrogate to itself the right to make a unilateral determination.moreover,as the circuit has recognized,the consent rules have equal vitality when the change in method is from an impermissible to a permissible one for the danger of distortion of income detrimental to governmental revenues exists regardless.witte,at.
while we appreciate capital one expressed enthusiasm for complying with the requirements of the tra,it is impossible to overlook its financial incentives to make the retroactive change.capital one insists that this case differs from diebold,where the taxpayer sought to change its returns simply because it discovered that a different method of accounting yields a lower tax liability than the method it originally chose.diebold,at.capital one maintains that it was not trying to obtain a better tax result but only to comply with the tra.capital one persistent effort in litigation to reduce its taxable income by approximately,however,speaks for itself.in all events,the alleged reason or motive for a change in method of accounting does not eliminate the need to obtain consent.
capital one secondly asserts that it did not need consent because the taxpayer relief act obviated the general consent requirement of e.it makes much of the automatic consent provision of the tra,which provides that a change in accounting method to comply with the new oid rules shall be treated as initiated by the taxpayer and such change shall be treated as made with the consent of the treasury,b.capital one complains that the tax court mistakenly gave short shrift to b merely because it was never codified.
taxpayers argument misses the mark for several reasons.section e requires that taxpayers receive consent before a change in accounting method except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.e emphasis added.as an uncodified provision not contained in the chapter,section b does not qualify as an exception under section e express language.but irrespective of the fact that b was not made part of the code,a taxpayer is still required to file a form where automatic consent applies.automatic consent is in fact something of a misnomer because it does not exempt taxpayers from filing requirements nor do away with the commissioner oversight of changes in accounting.see,ppl comm r,wl taxpayer made automatic method change by filing form.
rather,whereas a taxpayer must typically wait for the commissioner to grant a form application,automatic consent allows a taxpayer to assume consent once all predicate procedures such as filing a form are properly followed.see stanley langbein,federal income taxation of banks financial institutions explaining the form filing requirements for matters subject to automatic consent.the filing of the form remains,however,an indispensable part of the automatic consent process,which streamlines accounting method changes without compromising the commissioner supervisory role.the form puts the irs on notice and provides it an opportunity to review the change in method of accounting and to intervene if the taxpayer has not followed proper procedure for obtaining automatic consent.automatic consent procedures are therefore not meant to leave the commissioner in the dark or to undercut in any fashion the purposes of the consent requirement set forth above.
revenue procedure makes this clear with respect to automatic consent under the tra.it explains that a taxpayer can secure automatic consent to change accounting methods due to the enactment of the tra if the taxpayer timely files and correctly fills out form.proc,app.however,the change will be treated as initiated without the consent of the commissioner as required by e if the taxpayer does not comply with all the applicable provisions of th e revenue procedure.id.the district director may recommend that the change in accounting method be modified or revoked if upon review he discovers that it was based on inaccurate factual representations,that taxable income adjustments required for a change in accounting method were not made under a,or applicable procedures were not followed.id.thus,even where automatic consent governs,the aims promoted by the e consent requirement ensuring that changes are made accurately,and that revenue is reported consistently remain in place.
as the joint committee on taxation noted,b invited the irs to issue procedures for taxpayers to change methods of accounting under the tra.staff of comm.on tax n,general explanation of tax legislation enacted in jcs,at comm.print citing irs notice.the irs did so in revenue procedure,which is explicit that it provides the exclusive procedure for a taxpayer within its scope to obtain the commissioner consent.proc.capital one effort to the consent requirement with respect to late fees is therefore unavailing.
doubling back,capital one argues that even if it was required to secure consent,cob did so when it filed a form with its tax return in its form,cob proposed to change its method of accounting for interest and original issue discount that are subject to the provisions of section of the tra.the form also indicated that the pool of debt instruments consists of all credit card receivables held by the taxpayer and the proposed method is to account for interest and oid as required by section a.capital one argues that this application sufficed to secure consent to change the reporting treatment of income.
we are unpersuaded that cob filing was sufficient.as a threshold matter,cob income is a material item for which specific consent was necessary to change its accounting treatment.it is true that consent is required under e only for proposed changes to a method of accounting.but treasury regulation defines a change in method of accounting broadly to encompass a change in the overall plan of accounting for gross income or deductions or a change in the treatment of any material item used in such overall plan.reg.e ii a.a material item is in turn defined as any item that involves the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income or the taking of a deduction.id.to secure consent for a change the taxpayer must file a form and specify in the form all classes of items that will be treated differently under the new method of accounting.id.e i.
capital one would like to raise the level of generality for defining item of income.it argues that late fees are not their own item but merely a component of interest and oid,which were listed on cob form.but as the tax court recognized,d efining item in this way would severely undermine the reasons for section e.capital one fin,at.indeed,it is hard to imagine any other source of revenue that would qualify as an item,let alone a material item,if cob late fees do not.
late fees are earned each year and are listed as a separate item on capital one income statements.not only are late fees earned on a different basis than other types of fees,but they also comprised a larger percentage of taxpayers annual income than any other single type of fee.on cob and fsb consolidated return in,for example,income amounted to approximately percent of the gross receipts and percent of the total income reported.see pac,at holding that an item was material,in part,because of the large dollar amount involved wayne bolt nut comm r,wl same.for all these reasons,the tax court was correct to conclude that late fees constitute a material item for which independent consent was necessary to change accounting methods.
the burden is on the party seeking consent to make both its intentions and its requests to change a material item clear.at best,the language in cob application served to obscure rather than clarify.the language was broad and ambiguous respecting which fees,if any,cob was treating as oid.capital one claim that cob form was clear rings hollow when one realizes that cob filing failed even to mention income,the very item for which a change in accounting method is now sought.what is more,cob dispelled any ambiguity by the way it effectuated the change in accounting method after it filed the form.in and cob reported income from overlimit fees,cash advance fees,and interchange fees as oid.yet it continued to recognize income under the method.it is ironic that capital one now expects us to interpret the form in a manner that not even the author of the form intended it at the time.
cob actual practice is fatal to its claim in another respect.had cob received consent to treat income as oid,that consent would have been vitiated by continued use of the method.treatment of a material item consistently in two or more consecutively filed tax returns constitutes a method of accounting for which consent is required to change even if that treatment is erroneous or an incorrect application of a chosen method.see reg.e iii examples rul,see also huffman comm r,cir.therefore,the fact that cob reported income consistently for and under the method would operate to nullify whatever consent it asserts it had received when it filed its nebulous form with its return.
even so,capital one argues that,once it changed its accounting method for certain other fees to oid in and,a retroactive change in the treatment of income is mere error correction to account for late fees consistently with those other fees.capital one relies on treasury regulation,which provides that the correction of mathematical or posting errors,or errors in the computation of tax liability is not a change in accounting method for which separate consent is required.reg.e ii b.
cob desired retroactive change,however,falls well beyond the bounds of this limited exception for the correction of inadvertent error.the reporting of late fees under the method is not some mere mathematical error,which is an error in addition,subtraction,multiplication,or division.huffman comm r,wl,aff,cir quoting g a.and it is certainly not a posting error,which is a mistake in the act of transferring an original entry to a ledger.fpl,at internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore can not accept capital one tortured reading of the regulation,which would transform a narrow provision into carte blanche to reverse a deliberate accounting choice.see comm r clark,d in construing a statute in which a general statement of policy is qualified by an exception,we usually read the exception narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision.
capital one made an el
