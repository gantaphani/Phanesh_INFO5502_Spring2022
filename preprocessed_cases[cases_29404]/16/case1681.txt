appellant william peace,a citizen of the united kingdom,appeals the district court denial of his summary judgment motion and grant of appellee halliburton company halliburton summary judgment motion.the court held that peace breach of contract claim was preempted by the employee retirement income security act,et erisa.it treated that claim as a nonpayment of benefits under erisa.we disagree and hold that peace claim is not preempted by erisa.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case.
factual background and procedural history 
on january,peace sued halliburton and american general life insurance company american general in the state district court of harris county,texas for breach of contract halliburton subsequently removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.on november,peace and halliburton filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted halliburton and denied peace motions for summary judgment.peace timely appeals.
in,peace was the general manager of the westinghouse synthetic fuels division.at that time,kellogg rust,kellogg rust,a predecessor in interest of halliburton,purchased westinghouse synthetic fuels division.peace alleges that kellogg rust induced him to remain with the division by agreeing to purchase an annuity to replace the pension amount he would lose by leaving westinghouse.kellogg rust purchased a joint,annuity from american general and retained ownership of the annuity until when ownership was transferred to peace.peace claims he was promised a monthly amount of when he became age.allegedly relying on this agreement,he stayed on as general manager and became of the division.he attained the age of in august.peace has requested that his monthly payments begin but has not received any money.
the district court held that the annuity was an employee benefit plan under erisa.looking to whether a plan existed,the court applied the supreme court ongoing administrative scheme test and concluded that such an administrative scheme existed.see fort halifax packing coyne,d.the court noted that halliburton considered the type of investment vehicle to utilize calculated the amount to invest perused the market purchased the annuity monitored the annuity value and eventually would have had to make regular payments.the court concluded that these activities constituted an administrative scheme on the part of halliburton in providing the annuity benefit.looking to the same facts,we come to the opposite conclusion.we hold that no administrative scheme existed,and therefore peace claims are not preempted by erisa.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews summary judgments de novo in erisa cases,applying the same standards as a district court.see baker metropolitan life,cir.
iii.discussion 
under erisa,the terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan mean any plan,fund,or program which was established or maintained by an employer that provides retirement income to employees.a.we utilize the test set out in meredith time,cir,for determining whether an employee benefit arrangement is an erisa plan we consider whether the plan exists the plan falls within the provision established by the department of labor and the employer established or maintained the plan with the intent to benefit employees.id.at.if any part of the inquiry is answered in the negative,the submission is not an erisa plan.id.here,we do not proceed further than the first inquiry because we conclude that no plan existed.
requirement of an ongoing administrative scheme to effectuate a benefit plan 
an employee benefit encapsulated in an erisa plan differs from a employee benefit.the supreme court created the distinction between mere benefits and plans after examining the purpose of erisa.see fort halifax,at.according to the court,congress implicitly recognized that an employer must establish a uniform administrative scheme to effectuate a host of employee benefit obligations.id.at.erisa enables an employer to establish and maintain one scheme instead of developing numerous systems,each congruent with individual state regulations.see id.at.given that purpose,the court concluded that only when there is an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer obligation does a plan exist under erisa.id.at.where no such administrative scheme exists,preemption is nonsensical because there would be nothing to regulate.see id.at.
no ongoing administrative scheme 
following fort halifax,we consider whether halliburton was engaged in an ongoing administrative scheme to determine whether a plan existed see,fontenot nl industries,cir.as evidence of ongoing administrative activities,halliburton states that it chose a funding mechanism,calculated the required contributions to the annuity,shopped for and purchased the annuity,and ensured the eventual payment of benefits.the first three activities all took place before or at the time of purchase.they were not continually choosing a funding mechanism,calculating required contributions or shopping for and purchasing the annuity.moreover,halliburton discretionary process for choosing a funding mechanism has nothing to do with how the plan is administered once the company decides to put it in place.nelson gmc,wl.lexis cir.july,unpublished similarly,the fourth activity was executed only if payment was,peace turned.each of these activities was performed only once or over a brief period of time and never performed again.therefore,these were not part of an ongoing administrative scheme 
the lack of ongoing administrative activity makes this annuity benefit akin to a severance benefit.this court has held that severance payments do not constitute an employee benefit plan under erisa.see,wells general motors,cir holding that lump payment was not a plan even where employees could elect a installment payment option.we have concluded that a lump sum payment,contingent upon an event that may never materialize,create s no need for an administrative program to process claims and pay benefits and therefore is not a plan.fontenot,at.in this case,halliburton made a payment into an annuity,after which there was no subsequent demand on its assets.cassidy akzo nobel salt,cir holding that a plan may be an erisa plan if the delivery of its benefits creates an demand on the employer assets.the eventual payment of the benefit was contingent upon peace reaching the age of,an event which may not have materialized.see fontenot,at.
this case most closely resembles tinoco marine chartering,cir.in tinoco,the company established a health care benefit for employees who elected to voluntarily retire early.id.at.subsequently,the company was sold,and some employees received the benefit as a severance benefit.id.at.notably,the benefit was available either as a payment or a stream of payments.id.at.the tinoco court held that the benefit,even when paid over time,did not amount to an administrative scheme.id.here,halliburton purchased a annuity,which guaranteed a amount after a certain number of years,and it made no additional payments on the annuity.if the trigger event materialized,the benefit was to be paid out by american general not halliburton on a monthly basis.see fort halifax,at.to do little more than write a check hardly constitutes the operation of a benefit plan.in short,the theoretical possibility that halliburton would ensure that american general sent checks each month from the monies accrued on a annuity does not require the creation of an ongoing administrative program 
halliburton argues that,as owner of the annuity for a brief period of time,it could have made various discretionary decisions.however,it is insufficient to provide a benefit and then create an unnecessary administrative scheme around it to invoke erisa.the supreme court clearly has stated that a need for such scheme must be created.see fort halifax,at.stating that the legislative concern for regulatory uniformity only arises with respect to benefits whose provision by nature requires an ongoing administrative program a obligation in the future simply creates no need for an ongoing administrative program emphasis added.halliburton was not required to create an administrative scheme to provide the annuity benefit.see tinoco,at appellees provide no evidence that the plan requires an administrative scheme to make ongoing discretionary decisions based on subjective criteria.emphasis added.therefore,the fact that halliburton could have developed an unnecessary administrative scheme or performed unnecessary,ongoing administrative tasks is irrelevant to our analysis.
finally,halliburton,in a footnote,states that its alleged agreement to provide peace with deferred compensation in the form of a single premium annuity qualifies as a top hat plan under erisa,citing a.we decline to address halliburton assertion because it is inadequately briefed halliburton fails to explain how the annuity qualifies as a top hat plan.see peavy,cir this issue,raised in a footnote,is not adequately briefed.emphasis in original.
erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.here,we have determined that no employee benefit plan is at issue.therefore,peace benefit claim is not governed by erisa.see tinoco,at 
iv.conclusion 
the district court erred in holding that a plan existed for purposes of erisa.halliburton has failed to offer evidence of an ongoing administrative scheme to effectuate the annuity benefit.therefore,no employee benefit plan exists.accordingly,peace claims are not preempted by erisa.
the district court judgment is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
through this suit peace is seeking to obtain or enforce pension benefits.he asserts that his agreement with kellogg rust entitled him to an annuity under which he would receive monthly payments from the date he reached age until his death.ongoing obligations of this sort require administration.his contention,and the majority conclusion,that they do not is inherently inconsistent.
the district court wrote a detailed,thoughtful memorandum and order in this case that correctly applies the law to the facts on which william peace relies.the district court concluded that kellogg rust obligations to peace and another,executive constituted an erisa pension plan,the plan was terminated as to peace when kellogg rust transferred ownership of the annuity at issue to peace in,and peace claims against halliburton are barred by limitations.i would affirm the district court.i therefore respectfully dissent.
halliburton,which is kellogg rust successor,and peace both moved for summary judgment,and the district court rendered judgment in favor of halliburton.considering the evidence in the light most favorable to peace,as we must,the record reflects that at the time kellogg rust acquired westinghouse electric corporation synthetic fuels division in,peace asked that his executive pension supplement,called the supplemental employee retirement plan serp under westinghouse pension plan,be replaced in exchange for his agreement to leave westinghouse and become an employee of the kellogg rust affiliate,krw energy systems,that would operate the former westinghouse facility.another westinghouse executive made the same request.at the time,peace was years old,and he told representatives of kellogg rust,including frank shipman,that if he remained at westinghouse another years,he could retire at age,and the westinghouse serp would pay him per month for the rest of his life.peace wanted the equivalent of this serp benefit irrespective of how long he remained in the employ of krw energy systems.frank shipman affidavit reflects that kellogg rust promised to replace the equivalent value of the westinghouse serp,and peace deposition testimony reflects that frank shipman promised me that kellogg would make up the executive pension supplement that i be losing with westinghouse.there was no discussion of an annuity or how the westinghouse serp would be ma d e up or funded at that time.no specifics were discussed,and nothing was committed to writing.
with these oral assurances in hand,peace left westinghouse and became a kellogg rust employee in april or may of.thereafter,on more than one occasion,he reminded dave bartlett,a representative of kellogg rust,about the negotiations regarding the replacement of the westinghouse serp and was assured it would be taken care of.in july,kellogg rust supervisor of pension administration sent peace a letter enclosing an application for an annuity from american general life insurance company and asking peace and his wife to complete and return the american general application,which they did.also enclosed with the annuity application was a piece of paper with the following typed on it 
the purpose of this application is to provide advance funding for a joint annuity on the lives of peace,iii and spouse.
the annuity would become payable at peace retirement at age.the annuity amount of monthly will reduce to of that joint amount upon the death of either joint annuitant.
all values cease upon the death of the last surviving annuitant.the ownership and control of all annuity values prior to the retirement age are vested in kellogg rust.

press firmly with ball point 
the parties agree that the foregoing was written by american general.although it is fair to infer from this description that the annuity would provide income of per month when peace attained age,the actual terms of the annuity did not so provide.at the time the annuity was issued,on july,it guaranteed only monthly income for life with payment guaranteed for years at per month,and the annuity guaranteed a maturity value of only,based on a guaranteed interest rate of for the first year,but only thereafter.the annuity provided that the guaranteed benefits will be increased by interest which we may credit to the contract in excess of.kellogg paid a premium of to purchase this annuity.peace did not,however,receive this information about the annuity when he completed the application.on the same day american general issued the annuity covering peace,it issued a annuity to peace coworker who had also left westinghouse to join the krw energy systems management team.kellogg rust paid for that annuity.
kellogg rust was the owner of the annuity it purchased for peace.peace and his were the beneficiaries.kellogg rust had the right under the terms of the annuity to change the beneficiaries or cash in the annuity at any time.peace had no vested rights in the annuity.
by september,a little more than a year after the annuities were purchased for peace and his and less than three years after peace had left westinghouse to work for krw energy systems,peace decided to leave krw for other employment.as he was preparing to leave,peace had heard from other employees that kellogg rust was not going to provide him with the pension supplement replacement.he wrote a memo to dave bartlett on krw energy systems letterhead that said,among other things,
i recall specifically a conversation i had with you in which you told me that kellogg had decided to purchase a paid up annuity and would take a chance that i might later leave kellogg.i want to be very clear about this at no time was the purchase of the annuity conditioned on my continued employment with kellogg in fact,the purchase specifically contemplated that i might leave kellogg.
i fully expect to be given custody of the annuity.i have no problem with kellogg benefitting from interim holding of the equity as long as i have an unconditional claim on the pension at age.if this is not acceptable to kellogg,i intend to litigate.
peace terminated his employment with krw in september.one month later,peace received a letter from american general notifying him of a change in the annuity interest rate for the next year to.the letter also informed peace that the new interest rate would be guaranteed for twelve months and that the value of the annuity was.
in april,kellogg rust asked american general to reissue the annuity certificate in peace name.in september,a year after peace had written the memo to dave bartlett demanding custody of the annuity,american general wrote a letter to peace that said,we acknowledge the receipt of your request for a change of ownership and duplicate policy on the above policy.we have changed the ownership designation on the above referenced policy and an endorsed copy of the recorded change form is enclosed.on the same date,american general sent an endorsement to peace that reflected the ownership of the annuity had been changed to peace,and american general sent a certificate of lost policy.a contract information sheet,which peace says he may have received at the same time but can not remember,reflects the that the guaranteed monthly annuity benefit was only.an affidavit from the custodian of american general records states that its records reflect that this contract information sheet was attached to the certificate of lost policy that was sent to peace in september.
at least from through,peace received information about his annuity from american general each year.he may have received statements from through.however,he had moved to england and does not remember whether he received the annual information for those years.the statements he admits receiving reflected the total contract value and the interest rate for each year.peace acknowledged in his deposition that he reviewed the statements as they arrived,including the statement,and testified,i do recall being somewhat concerned about the annuity value.the amount of the annuity looked a little low to me.the statement,which peace received,reflects the value of the annuity was at that point in time and that the interest rate was.
when he reached age in,peace requested that american general pay him per month.he was concerned about the value of the annuity and its adequacy to fund per month for the remainder of his life,but peace testified in his deposition that he assumed that his contract with kellogg,the parent company of kellogg rust,had been passed through to american general.peace request for a month was not honored by american general,and he sued that company and halliburton,as kellogg rust successor,in.
american general is no longer a party to these proceedings.the other former westinghouse executive who became a krw energy employee and received an annuity from kellogg rust exercised one of several options under his annuity and received a lump sum payment of in august.he has not sued halliburton or american general.
peace characterization of his agreement with kellogg rust has been mercurial.in his complaint,he alleged,to induce peace to stay with the business and become a krw energy systems employee,kellogg rust,agreed to purchase an annuity to replace the pension amount that peace lost by leaving westinghouse.the evidence is undisputed that the purchase of an annuity was not discussed until after peace had left westinghouse and was already a krw employee,but the evidence does reflect that thereafter,kellogg decided to purchase an annuity to fund kellogg rust obligations to peace,and peace was in accord.
after peace deposition had been taken in this litigation,his characterization of the agreement with kellogg rust changed somewhat.in a declaration prepared as part of his response to halliburton motion for summary judgment,peace asserted that to persuade me to continue to work at the westinghouse facility under new ownership,kellogg and kellogg rust promised,among other things,to pay me per month,for life,beginning at age,to cover the feared loss of benefits under the westinghouse pension plan.halliburton moved to strike this latter assertion,and the district court held i t is well settled that a party can not defeat a motion for summary judgment or create a genuine fact issue by using an affidavit that impeaches,without explanation,his deposition testimony.
but regardless of how the agreement between peace and kellogg rust is characterized,it was a pension plan as defined by erisa,a,which provides 
except as provided in subparagraph b,the terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan mean any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan,fund,or program 
i provides retirement income to employees 
to meet its obligations to peace,kellogg rust maintained a plan or a fund to provide retirement income to peace,and ongoing administration was necessary.the fact that kellogg rust delegated administration to american general by purchasing an annuity does not take kellogg rust agreement with peace or the annuity out of erisa ambit.employers routinely purchase insurance to fund welfare or pension plan benefits and retain third parties to administer employee benefit plans indeed,this court held in memorial hospital system northbrook life insurance that the purchase of an insurance policy covering a class of employees was substantial evidence that a plan,fund,or program has been established,although it is not conclusive evidence that case involved welfare benefits but the rationale of memorial hospital applies equally to pension benefits the employer had purchased a group policy providing life,accidental death,medical and other insurance for its employees the employer paid of the premiums the other was funded by employee contributions this court held that the evidence clearly show ed the employer intent to provide its employees with a welfare benefit program through the purchase and maintenance of a group insurance policy.significantly,the court held t he fact that the employer administrative functions under the policy are minimal is perfectly in keeping with its intent that the insurer administer the plan as well as insure it.
in administering the obligations set forth in the annuity for peace benefit,american general was required to decide upon an interest rate each year,not less than,and apply that rate to the initial and all accrued interest.under the terms of the annuity,american general had some discretion as to what interest rate it would pay each year.once the beneficiary reached age,american general was required to honor the beneficiary choice among several payment options.there were at least six options from which to choose,including,inter alia periodic payments for life,periodic joint and survivor payments,payments for a specified period,or a lump sum.if peace died before all benefits were paid,american general would be required to determine if he had a surviving spouse.if peace had remarried since the annuity was issued,american general would be required to determine who the proper payee would be upon peace death.in fact peace divorced the woman to whom he was married when the annuity was issued and married another in.as long as there were funds to be distributed under the annuity,american general was required to invest,administer,and account for those funds and to pay them to the proper beneficiary.these types of administrative responsibilities are no different than those regarding other pension plans.
the obligation that kellogg rust undertook to provide retirement income to peace is distinctly different from the statutory obligation to make payments to employees upon termination of employment at issue in fort halifax packing,coyne when the obligation is to make a,payment triggered by a single event t he employer assumes no responsibility to pay benefits on a regular basis,and thus faces no periodic demands on its assets that create a need for financial coordination and control.that is not the case with the plan kellogg rust provided for peace and his.although kellogg rust made payments to american general,the plan it agreed to provide for peace benefit was that american general would perform all the necessary administrative tasks and would be responsible for financial management to insure retirement benefits would be paid to peace each month after he reached age or to his spouse if he died,or pursuant to any of the other options the beneficiary might choose under the annuity.this is more than making a single set of payments to employees at the time the plant closes,as was the case in fort halifax 
in fort halifax,the supreme court explained what it is that makes a plan a plan.one of the parties had argued that death benefits sometimes involve a payment to beneficiaries.the court reasoned that such a obligation was a plan under erisa notwithstanding that only a single lump sum payment might be made 
while death benefits may represent a payment from the perspective of the beneficiaries,the employer clearly foresees the need to make regular payments to survivors on an ongoing basis.the ongoing,predictable nature of this obligation therefore creates the need for an administrative scheme to process claims and pay out benefits,whether those benefits are received by beneficiaries in a lump sum or on a periodic basis.this is borne out by the fact that death benefits are included in appellant retirement plan,with instructions on how eligibility is to be determined,benefit levels calculated,and disbursements made.by contrast,appellant statutory obligation did not prompt the establishment of any payment program,since there were no ongoing benefits to be paid 
the pension plans for peace and his have the same characteristics as death benefits,even those that involve only a payment.
the majority relies in part on this court decision in tinoco marine chartering,in tinoco the early retiree health care plan at issue offered appellees the choice of a payment or a stream of payments until they reached the age of.this court found it significant that r egardless of how appellees chose to receive those payments,the total amount to be paid was based on a calculation using a fixed formula.that is not the case here.american general was to choose an interest rate each year,with a floor of,and had other administrative obligations,as outlined above.the plan before us today is likewise distinguishable from certain other severance benefits this court has held were not erisa plans because they required scant administration and no discernment by the administrator 
the agreement between peace and kellogg rust was much like the agreement at issue in whittemore schlumberger technology,in which we held that the argument that the schlumberger plan is and thus does not require administration is to no avail.we concluded that the severance pay in lieu of provision at issue was an erisa plan,holding we perceive nothing about the schlumberger plan to take it out of the ordinary definition of an erisa plan t he plan plainly required some sort of an administrative in order to make payments to employees.
the supreme court decision in fort halifax tells us that in deciding whether a state law relate s to an employee benefit plan we must consider erisa purposes these include protection afforded participants by eliminating the threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation.preemption of claims relating to the retirement benefits agreement between peace and kellogg rust furthers that purpose.the threat of conflicting and inconsistent state regulation existed regarding the latitude in the selection of an interest rate each year and the property rights of a spouse upon divorce or death of the annuitant.many other state laws might apply,such as those regarding creditors rights to pension benefits and laws that automatically revoke the designation of a spouse as beneficiary upon divorce 
permitting state law claims to be asserted with regard to the pension plan kellogg rust established for peace also implicate s the regulatory concerns of erisa itself.the supreme court explained in fort halifax that erisa was enacted because congress found it desirable that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment,operation,and administration of employee benefit plans,and that congress intended that erisa standards would safeguard employees from such abuses as,imprudent investing,and misappropriation of plan funds.the need for such regulation applies with equal force to the pension scheme at issue today.kellogg rust and american general,as the administrator and insurer of the plan,should not be excluded from erisa regulatory obligations.
if we were to credit peace contention that kellogg rust agreement was not just to provide an annuity,but that kellogg rust agreed to pay him per month from age until his death,i strongly suspect that the majority would conclude that such a pension scheme is within erisa definition of a pension plan.an agreement to make monthly retirement payments of a set amount requires administration as well as financial planning and management to meet that obligation.this is the essence of any pension plan and why congress believed erisa,with its attendant regulations,was needed.the fact that american general was engaged to discharge kellogg rust obligations in the form of an annuity,and american general was thus the administrator and insurer of pension benefits,should not change the analysis.
the supreme court has said that in interpreting erisa,the department of labor views and regulations merit the judiciary respectful consideration.regulations have been promulgated to clarif y what constitutes an employee benefit plan within the meaning of erisa and to provide a general principle which can be applied to a large class of plans to determine if they are erisa plans these regulations includes a provision that describes when benefits guaranteed by an insurance contract or certificate are not an employee pension plan it follows that unless benefits provided through an insurance certificate have all the attributes set forth in this regulation,the benefits constitute an erisa pension plan.there would be no need for this regulation if an employer could provide benefits by means of an insurance contract that did not meet this section requirements and thereby avoid erisa and its attendant financial and regulatory obligations.until an employee has an enforceable right against a licensed insurance company,the employer promise to maintain insurance to fund benefits is a hollow one,fraught with financial risk for the employee.the benefits kellogg rust provided to peace in the form of an annuity owned by kellogg rust,in which peace had no legally enforceable rights at his sole choice against the insurance company,did not meet the requirements of d ii until,when the annuity was and peace became the sole owner.until that date,kellogg rust maintained an erisa pension plan that covered peace.
peace claim to recover the difference between what the annuity will pay him and what he alleges he was promised the annuity would pay him is a claim that relate s to an employee benefit plan within the meaning of a and is preempted peace does not argue to the contrary.he effectively concedes that if his agreement with kellogg rust was a pension plan,his breach of contract claim is preempted.he maintains,however,that his erisa claims still have vitality,even though he did not file suit until.
halliburton moved for summary judgment,contending that peace claims are erisa claims that are barred by limitations.the parties agree that erisa borrows the texas statute of limitations and that a statute of limitations applies to any erisa claims against halliburton the majority does not reach the limitations issue because of its conclusion that all of peace claims are claims,rather than erisa claims.
in analyzing the limitations issue,it is important to understand precisely what peace is claiming.in his initial brief in this court,peace asserted,the agreement was to purchase an annuity that would pay monthly payments of to peace upon reaching age.he further contended,halliburton could have purchased another annuity that would have fulfilled its obligation to peace at any time before peace turned on august.in that same brief,peace maintained that his statement in a declaration that kellogg rust promised,among other things,to pay me per month,for life,beginning at age is consistent with his characterization of the agreement with kellogg rust he explained,peace deposition testimony does not say that that sic halliburton agreed to replace these westinghouse benefits with anything other than a annuity.however,in his reply brief,peace shifted his claim somewhat,asserting for the first time in this court that his agreement can be viewed in two,alternative ways,as an agreement to pay per month at age or an agreement to purchase an annuity paying that amount.
i agree with the district court that peace alternate description of the agreement as an unconditional one to pay per month,rather than one to purchase an annuity that would provide a benefit in that amount,is foreclosed by the evidence.peace viewed the annuity purchased for him as the ultimate result of his negotiations with kellogg rust.by september,peace looked only to the annuity as embodying his agreement with kellogg rust regarding the replacement of benefits he might have received from westinghouse.as peace was leaving kellogg rust employ,he demanded custody of the annuity,nothing more.the ownership of the annuity was transferred to him,and he made no further demand of kellogg rust until this suit.peace asked for and received an unconditional claim on the paid up annuity that kellogg had decided to purchase,equating it with the executive pension supplement.the district court properly ruled that peace declaration,stating that kellogg rust had agreed to pay him per month for the remainder of his life commencing on his birthday,should not be considered as evidence of his agreement with kellogg rust because peace declaration was contrary to his deposition testimony and should be disregarded.peace testified during his deposition that this annuity was meant to fund the promise of the executive supplemental pension benefit,and when he speak s of the executive supplemental pension that he was promised,in his mind that means this annuity,referencing the american general annuity.the evidence supports a claim that the annuity kellogg rust provided was inadequate to generate pension income of per month,but it does not support a claim that kellogg rust made a promise to pay peace once he attained age.
the district court further correctly concluded that kellogg rust terminated its erisa plan or fund as to peace when it transferred ownership of the annuity to him in.peace does take issue with this holding.he does not even address it.nor does he address the district court holding that when the annuity was reissued in plaintiff name,he ceased to be a participant covered under an employee pension plan.the district court cited and relied upon a provision in d ii that says 
ii an individual is not a participant covered under an employee pension plan or a beneficiary receiving benefits under an employee pension plan if 
a the entire benefit rights of the individual 
are fully guaranteed by an insurance company,insurance service or insurance organization licensed to do business in a state,and are legally enforceable by the sole choice of the individual against the insurance company,insurance service or insurance organization and 
a contract,policy or certificate describing the benefits to which the individual is entitled under the plan has been issued to the individual or 
b the individual has received from the plan a distribution or a series of distributions of cash or other property which represents the balance of his or her credit under the plan 
peace benefit rights were contained solely in the annuity,and the transfer of ownership of the annuity in satisfied all the requirements of this provision.peace participation in kellogg rust pension plan ceased in.he was no longer covered under a pension plan.when peace reached the age of,he had no plan from kellogg rust to which to look.this does not mean that peace was without a remedy when kellogg rust failed to structure the pension plan as agreed.
prior to its termination in,peace pension plan had called for the purchase of an annuity that would provide benefits of a month.when ownership of the annuity was transferred to peace in,he had a cause of action against kellogg rust for failing to provide a plan that conformed to their agreement.he could have sued under a b to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan or under a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.what he can not do in,seventeen years after the plan was terminated and its assets were distributed to him,is sue for benefits under that plan.
peace argues that this court held in paris profit sharing plan for employees of howard wolf,that for purposes of erisa a cause of action does not accrue until an application for benefits is denied.first and foremost,it must be borne in mind that peace requested a disbursement of all the plan assets to which he was entitled in in lieu of awaiting the future receipt of benefits under an employer plan.disbursement of the plan assets to peace meant there was no longer a plan from which to seek benefits.as will be discussed below,peace knew or should have known in that the annuity did not guarantee that he would receive a month commencing at age for the rest of his life and,accordingly,that the annuity was inadequate to provide all the benefits he was promised the plan would include.his causes of action under erisa regarding benefits and all other rights associated with the plan accrued when he accepted ownership of the annuity and knew or should have known that it terms differed from those contemplated.the decision in paris is inapposite.
the court in paris began by noting that t he action the plaintiffs protest,and the one we must review,is the trustee interpretation of the profit sharing plan.only with that decision did it become clear that the plaintiffs would be denied benefits.the issue in paris was whether employees who had worked for an employer on june,but were terminated or resigned before february,were entitled to benefits under a profit sharing plan that was created on february,but had a retroactive effective date of june,the court observed that the adoption of this plan resulted in substantial confusion and the status of the plaintiffs was fraught with uncertainty.the former employees claims for benefits were denied in,and they argued that was the date their causes of action accrued,while the defendant argued that the accrual date was february,when the plan was adopted and established eligibility or for these employees the accrual date determined whether the cause of action accrued before or after erisa effective date,which was january,and therefore whether there was jurisdiction in federal court this court held that the date the trustees construed the plan and denied benefits controlled,explaining,to hold otherwise would put an almost intolerable burden on employees covered by pension plans.it would require individuals who are unversed in the law to be constantly vigilant moreover,claims filed before a pension actually has been denied might be challenged for lack of ripeness.this reasoning applies to an ongoing plan,but not a plan that has been terminated and its assets distributed.
paris did not purport to establish an inflexible rule for all erisa cases.the paris decision pointedly cited the first circuit decision in cowan keystone employee profit sharing fund the facts of which are similar to the ones presently before us.in cowan there had been a shortfall of contributions by an employer to a pension plan for several years.thereafter,an employee negotiated a termination provision with his employer and was allegedly told there was no possibility that the company would make up the contribution shortfalls the company allegedly concealed the fact that a plan had been adopted in an amendment to the pension plan that expressly excluded the employee and others similarly situated just days before this employee signed a termination agreement in november final payment of benefits under this termination agreement occurred in the employee learned of the amended plan provisions in and was denied additional benefits at that time the first circuit held that the employee cause of action arose in when the plan was adopted the first circuit re
