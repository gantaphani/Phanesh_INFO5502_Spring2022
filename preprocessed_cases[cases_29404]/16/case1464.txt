from until,quemetco,quemetco,a subsidiary of rsr corporation,operated a lead smelter on harbor island,near seattle,washington.during that time,harbor island suffered substantial environmental damage.in december,the environmental protection agency epa announced that it planned to place harbor island on its national priorities list npl in,the epa determined that quemetco was a potentially responsible party for the pollution.on may,the epa filed an action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla seeking recovery from rsr corporation for the costs it had expended in cleaning up harbor island,as well as for expected future costs.
meanwhile,on february,international insurance company international sued rsr corporation,quemetco,quemetco metals limited,and quemetco realty,collectively,rsr,seeking a declaratory judgment that international had no obligations to rsr under four environmental impairment liability environmental policies which international predecessor in interest had sold to rsr in.an initial jury trial was held to resolve certain coverage issues,while other coverage and damages issues were reserved for future resolution.at the conclusion of this initial trial,the district court entered judgment for rsr,holding that international environmental policies obligated it to indemnify rsr for remediation costs incurred by the epa at harbor island,to the extent those costs were not excluded by the policies.we affirmed the district court judgment on september.int l ins.rsr,cir.
rsr and international were realigned on july,afterwards,international raised additional defenses which had been unavailable to it at the time of the prior judgment or which had been reserved in the initial jury trial.on october,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted international motion and dismissed rsr claims,holding that rsr could not recover from international because an other insurance clause in international environmental policies limited rsr recovery to sums it had already received from settlement agreements with several other insurance companies and alternatively,because texas one recovery rule barred rsr from collecting money from international when it had already been fully compensated for its harbor island liability through its settlement agreements with other insurance companies.
rsr now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment.for the following reasons,we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
in,the north river insurance company north river issued four environmental policies to rsr,which provided successive layers of coverage up to million,with a per claim limit of million,subject to certain terms and conditions.the policies provided coverage for multiple locations,including rsr facilities on harbor island.in,international succeeded the interests of north river in these policies.
under the environmental policies,north river agreed to 
i ndemnify the insured against all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay for compensatory but not punitive or exemplary damages by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law on account of 
a personal injury,including death at any time resulting therefrom 
b property damage 
c impairment or diminution of or other interference with any other environmental right or amenity protected by law 
caused by environmental impairment in connection with the business of the insured and in respect of which a claim has been made against or other due notice has been received by the insured during the policy period.
the policies defined environmental impairment as 
a the emission,discharge,dispersal,disposal,seepage,release or escape of any liquid,solid,gaseous or thermal irritant,contaminant or pollutant into or upon land,the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water 
b the generation of smell,noises,vibrations,light,electricity,radiation,changes in temperature or any other sensory phenomena but not fire or explosion 
arising out of or in the course of the insured operations,installations or premises 
however,condition of each policy provided that 
this policy shall not be called upon in contribution and no liability shall attach hereunder for any injury,loss,damage,costs or expenses recoverable under any other insurance insuring to the benefit of the insured except as regards any excess over and above the amounts collectible under such other insurance provided always that this clause shall not apply to any policy that is specifically arranged by the insured to cover limits in excess of those stated in this policy.
additionally,each environmental policy excluded coverage for liability resulting from a sudden and accidental happening or a fire or explosion.
rsr also purchased comprehensive general liability cgl insurance policies from many other insurance companies that covered multiple sites,including the harbor island site.some of those cgl policies contained exclusions for environmental claims,with exceptions to the exclusions for sudden and accidental events.other cgl policies excluded environmental claims,but had exceptions to those exclusions for hostile fires.and other cgl policies did not exclude environmental claims,but only covered accidents and occurrences.
in,rsr sued of its cgl insurance providers in the district court for the judicial district of harrison county,texas.in that action,rsr asserted claims against the cgl insurers for refusing to cover environmental cleanup costs and personal injury claims relating to more than sites,including the harbor island site.in,several cgl insurers made international a defendant in the harrison county action and sought contribution.rsr also asserted claims against international in the harrison county action for breach of the environmental policies,violations of the texas insurance code,and recovery of attorney fees.
in the harrison county action,rsr asserted that the cgl insurers were obligated to reimburse it for environmental costs because the pollution had been accidental.rsr argued that accidental pollution satisfied the cgl policies sudden and accidental exception to the exclusion of environmental claims.although the cgl insurers contested this assertion by arguing that the sudden and accidental exception could only be triggered by pollution that was both sudden and accidental,the harrison county court adopted rsr reading of the policies in a letter ruling dated march.
between and,rsr entered into separate settlement agreements with its cgl insurers,from which it received an aggregate payment of.it dismissed the rest of its cgl insurers from the harrison county action.it also dismissed international.following the execution of the last of the settlements,rsr the harrison county action.
in the meantime,international had initiated the present action in federal court in february,seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligations to rsr under the environmental policies in connection with the harbor island site or with another site in west dallas,texas.in august,rsr and international tried certain coverage issues relating to the harbor island claim before a jury,while reserving unripe coverage and damages issues for future resolution.issues relating to the west dallas site were severed into a separate trial and were later settled after the jury returned its verdict on the harbor island issues,the district court entered judgment for rsr,declaring that international was 
contractually obligated to indemnify rsr for any remediation costs and expenses that rsr is or becomes obligated to pay to the united states environmental protection agency epa with respect to the epa remediation activity at the harbor island site to the extent such remediation costs and expenses are covered by the eil policies and are not otherwise excluded by the terms of the policies 
the district court also determined that the epa had made a claim against rsr,that rsr had not waived its right to coverage with respect to the harbor island site,that rsr harbor island lawsuit against international was not barred by the statute of limitations,and that rsr should take nothing on its common law bad faith and texas insurance code claims against international.we affirmed this judgment on september.int l ins,at.
in march,rsr moved to reopen the same federal district court case under.subsequently,international requested leave to amend its complaint to assert new coverage and damages defenses which had not been ripe at the time of the trial.in february,the district court granted both motions.international then amended its complaint to assert new defenses,among them that condition of its policies,an other insurance clause,precluded coverage of rsr harbor island claims because rsr had already been fully compensated for this liability through its settlements with the cgl insurers in the harrison county state court case.international also asserted that,even if the other insurance clause did not encompass the cgl policies,no recovery could be had on the harbor island claims,due to the texas common law one satisfaction rule,because the cgl settlements had fully compensated rsr for its losses.
on july,the parties were realigned.rsr filed its original complaint on march,seeking approximately million as its allegedly remaining liabilities on the harbor island claims,and international filed its answer on april.on october,rsr and international filed motions for summary judgment.the district court held that the terms of condition of the environmental policies prevented rsr from recovering from international,because it had already recovered fully for the cleanup costs of the harbor island site from its settlements with its cgl insurers.alternatively,the district court found that the texas common law one satisfaction rule also barred recovery,due to the fact that rsr had been fully compensated for its liabilities at the harbor island site.accordingly,the district court granted international motion for summary judgment on march,and entered a judgment in its favor.rsr timely filed its notice of appeal.
discussion 
rsr argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to international because,as a matter of law,the other insurance clause in international policy can not properly be read to bar recovery based on the settlements with the cgl insurers,and because the common law one satisfaction rule is inapplicable outside of tort cases in texas.we need not address the applicability of the one satisfaction rule to an insurance contract,because we agree with the district court that international other insurance clause deprived rsr of any right to recover more than it had already obtained from its settlements with the cgl insurers.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.goodman harris county,cir,cert.denied.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.t here is no material fact issue unless the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.douglass united servs.auto.ass n,cir en banc quoting anderson liberty lobby.

ii.other insurance 
where a liability covered by the environmental policies is also covered by other insurance,condition prevents recovery unless the other insurance has been exhausted,in which case the environmental policies can serve as excess insurance.condition is triggered where any injury,loss,damage,costs or expenses are recoverable under any other insurance insuring to the benefit of the insured.thus,for condition to have been applicable in this case,rsr must have had other insurance insuring to its benefit,and rsr must have been able to recover under this other insurance for the same injury,loss,damage,costs or expenses it sought to recover from international.
the district court held that rsr cgl policies were other insurance under which rsr successfully recovered for the full amount of its harbor island liabilities pursuant to its settlement agreements with the cgl insurers.therefore,it concluded that condition of international environmental policies barred any further recovery.rsr argues that the district court erred because its cgl policies were not other insurance within the meaning of condition for two major reasons.first,rsr argues that a payment pursuant to a settlement agreement is not insurance and therefore does not qualify as other insurance under the plain language of the policy.second,it argues that,even if a settlement payment could be considered insurance,condition would only apply if the environmental policies issued by international covered the same liabilities as the cgl policies.rsr contends that the environmental policies and the cgl policies covered different liabilities.the district court held that rsr was judicially estopped from making this argument,because rsr had argued successfully in the harrison county action that the cgl and environmental policies covered the same liabilities.rsr argues that the district court abused its discretion by finding that judicial estoppel was appropriate.
settlement payments as other insurance 
rsr contends that the district court erred by holding that a payment pursuant to a settlement agreement could be other insurance within the meaning of condition.see generally squibb sons,accident cas.ins,civ.jsm,wl,at may,aff,cir holding that settlement agreements are not contracts of insurance.this argument is beside the point.by its plain language,the triggering of condition requires only the existence of other insurance insuring to rsr benefit and overlapping coverage between that other insurance and international environmental policies.the means by which actual recovery might be achieved under the other insurance in question,whether by settlement agreement or by judgment,is irrelevant to condition applicability.the existence of other insurance that covers the same liability as the environmental policies is what triggers the condition,whether or not recovery under this other insurance is actually sought.
there is no dispute that rsr cgl policies were insurance.thus,the relevant question for the purposes of determining condition applicability in this case is not whether rsr settlements were insurance.the relevant question is whether rsr sought to recover for liabilities under its environmental policies that were also recoverable under its cgl policies.
recoverable under other insurance 
rsr also argues that the district court erred by finding that condition barred recovery under the environmental policies,because it asserts that the cgl and environmental policies covered different liabilities.if this assertion were correct,condition would be inapplicable,since one of its triggering requirements is that other insurance cover the same injury,loss,damage,costs or expenses for which recovery is sought under the environmental policies.however,the district court held that rsr was judicially estopped from asserting that the cgl and environmental policies covered different liabilities,because it had argued successfully in the harrison county action that the cgl and environmental policies covered the same liabilities at harbor island.rsr argues that this application of judicial estoppel was an abuse of discretion.
the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.ergo science,martin,cir.although texas law governs substantive matters in this case,we apply federal principles of judicial estoppel.hall ge plastic pac.pte,cir.for a party to be judicially estopped from asserting a position,two requirements must be met.ahrens perot systems,cir.first,it must be shown that the position of the party to be estopped is clearly inconsistent with its previous one and second,that party must have convinced the court to accept that previous position.hall,at quoting ahrens,at brackets in original.we review a district court application of judicial estoppel for abuse of discretion.id.a district court abuses its discretion if it misapplies the law or bases its decision upon erroneous findings of fact.latvian shipping baltic shipping,cir mcgary scott,cir.
some of rsr cgl policies excluded coverage for environmental liabilities,with the exception of environmental liabilities resulting from sudden and accidental events or hostile fires,while the other cgl policies did not exclude environmental liability claims,but only covered accidents and occurrences.international environmental policies only covered environmental liabilities,but excluded coverage for liabilities resulting from sudden and accidental happening s or fire s or explosion s.thus,a plain reading of the terms of the cgl and environmental policies supports rsr assertion that their coverage did not overlap.
however,in the harrison county action,rsr took a very different position.there,rsr argued that the cgl policies exception for sudden and accidental occurrences could be satisfied by an occurrence that was not sudden,so long as it was accidental.rsr argued that the cgl policies covered all forms of emissions causing pollution liabilities,except for those resulting from intentional pollution.emphasis in original.it urged the harrison county district court to hold that the cgl policies covered all damages from unexpected and unintended releases,discharges,dispersals,escapes of pollution.in a letter ruling dated march,the harrison county district court granted rsr request and held that the sudden and accidental exception provides coverage for all unexpected and unintended pollution.
in the present case,rsr attempted to avoid judicial estoppel by arguing that the environmental policies covered routine environmental pollution,while the cgl policies covered pollution.the district court rejected this argument for two reasons.the first was that the terms routine and do not appear in either set of policies.the second reason was that rsr has never alleged that the pollution at harbor island was expected or intended.we decline to find an abuse of discretion in the district court holding for the same reasons.the environmental policies have nothing to do with whether or not the pollution in question can be characterized as routine.their exclusions are triggered only where pollution occurred in a manner that was both sudden and accidental.see primrose operating am.ins,cir uœnder texas law,the sudden and accidental clause contains a temporal element in addition to the requirement of being unforeseen or unexpected.the sudden and accidental requirement unambiguously exclude s coverage for all pollution that is not released quickly as well as unexpectedly and unintentionally.quoting guar.ins.vic,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted material in braces added material in brackets in original.thus,the environmental policies covered pollution that was accidental,but not sudden.
rsr clearly alleged in state court that its cgl policies covered all accidental pollution,whether or not it was sudden.rsr has not alleged that any of its pollution at harbor island was intentional therefore,by implication,all of the pollution at harbor island was alleged to be accidental.because rsr original interpretation of the cgl and environmental policies allowed accidental pollution to be covered under both policies,and because the only pollution alleged to have occurred at harbor island was accidental,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding that rsr was estopped from arguing that the cgl and environmental policies covered different liabilities.
possible excess 
if rsr harbor island liabilities were only partially covered by its cgl settlements,condition would allow the environmental policies to serve as excess insurance for the uncovered portion.thus,the final issue we must confront in our analysis of the district court dismissal under condition is whether or not the cgl settlements compensated rsr fully for its harbor island liabilities.rsr argues that it was not fully compensated for these liabilities by the cgl settlements.international responds that,even if this were true,it was rsr burden under texas law to allocate the settlement proceeds.because rsr failed to do this,international argues that texas law presumes that the full amount of the cgl settlements must be allocated to liabilities that would also be covered under the environmental policies.international collected over million from its settlements with the cgl insurers.it only seeks million from international for its harbor island liabilities.therefore,if international is correct about texas presumptive allocation,then there is no excess to be covered under condition,and we must affirm the district court judgment.
while the supreme court of texas has not confronted the precise issue before us,we conclude that its opinion in mobil oil ellender,indicates how it would rule in this case.in ellender,the family members of an independent contractor who died from exposure to benzene sued multiple parties whom they believed were responsible for his death.id.at.all of the defendants except mobil settled.id.the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs.id.at issue on appeal was the proper amount of the settlement credits that had to be subtracted from this verdict.id.at.specifically,the supreme court of texas had to determine which side bore the burden of allocating the settlement amounts between actual and punitive damages id.the court began its analysis of the issue by noting that settling plaintiffs are in a better position than nonsettling defendants to insure that the settlement award is allocated between actual and punitive damages.id.at.it expressed concern that w ithout an allocation,mobil,who was not a party to the settlement,had almost no ability to prove which part of the settlement amount represented actual damages.nonsettling parties should not be penalized for events over which they have no control.id.it then examined the hazards inherent in the opposite rule 
when the settlement agreement does not allocate between actual and punitive damages,requiring a nonsettling party to prove the agreement allocation before receiving a settlement credit not only unfairly penalizes the nonsettling party but also allows settling parties to abrogate the one satisfaction rule settling parties could prevent nonsettling parties from receiving settlement credit by refusing to allocate between actual and punitive damages in settlement agreements the better rule is to require a settling party to tender to the trial court,before judgment,a settlement agreement allocating between actual and punitive damages as a
