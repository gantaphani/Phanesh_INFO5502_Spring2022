appellee sheldon adelson brought this declaratory action to determine rights under an oral contract that he had negotiated with appellant moshe hananel.in the district court hananel argued that the agreement,pursuant to which he was employed by a company owned by adelson,entitled him to obtain a twelve percent investment in adelson casino venture in macau.adelson claimed that their agreement was not so broad as to contemplate the macau investment option.rather,the contract limited hananel to reaping twelve percent of net profits from sector investments in israel that had been discovered,recommended and supervised by hananel,and that were realized while he was employed by adelson company.
in a prior appeal of this matter,adelson hananel,cir adelson i,we reversed the district court forum non conveniens dismissal,but we did uphold the court determination that,under the prima facie standard,hananel was subject to specific personal jurisdiction.after a bench trial on remand,the district court ruled in favor of adelson,declaring that hananel did not hold an option to obtain a twelve percent interest in adelson macau casino.adelson hananel,d adelson ii.hananel appeals from this judgment,arguing that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction,erroneously assigned to him the burden of proof,abused its discretion regarding a missing witness,and made factual errors regarding the formation and performance of the contract.we affirm.
background 
hananel is a native,citizen,and resident of israel.adelson is a citizen and a permanent resident and domiciliary of nevada,where he votes,owns property,and holds a driver license.adelson is also a native of massachusetts and a current massachusetts homeowner.he has worldwide business connections and investments,and he owns a warren of businesses known as the interface group.
on the basis of the disputed oral contract negotiated with adelson,hananel worked for one of adelson companies,interface partners international,ipi,from approximately to.ipi is a delaware corporation that adelson founded in for the purpose of investing in israel,with a particular focus on israel sector.
during the time period relevant to this case,ipi had offices in needham,massachusetts,and ramat gan,israel.hananel was based in israel and was responsible for seeking investment opportunities there.although ipi did not have regular employees working in needham,it received ongoing legal and financial advice through frequent communications with one of the interface group companies there,interface group massachusetts igm.igm personnel in the needham office who provided such advice included igm general counsel paul roberts,who also described himself as counsel to igi,and igm cfo stephen.there was testimony at trial that ipi funding customarily came from adelson personal account in las vegas,nevada,but not before passing through the ipi massachusetts office as a capital contribution to ipi massachusetts that was then lent to ipi israel.hananel made periodic calls to the needham office and sent fax transmissions there at least monthly,including budget proposals for approval.he made one brief visit to the needham office in late,just before commencing his duties for ipi,and he later attended a meeting in massachusetts to seek business opportunities in his role as chairman of a company in which ipi had invested.
the parties evidence about the terms of hananel compensation was irreconcilable.as the district court accurately described the testimony 
in the discussions regarding hananel employment,it is undisputed that adelson and hananel agreed he would have a salary of a year.they also agreed that hananel would somehow receive of the investments with which he was involved while at ipi adelson and hananel have different memories of the details of the twelve percent.adelson testified that they agreed that hananel would receive of the net profits only of high tech investments in israel that hananel found,recommended,and supervised and which came to fruition while he was employed by ipi,but only so long as he remained employed there.hananel testified that they agreed that he would receive options of up to percent on any investment he or the israeli office initiated outside the united states without any other geographic or time limitations so long as hananel put up the proportionate costs of the investment at any point.
adelson ii,d at.
in this appeal,hananel argues,as to jurisdiction,that differences between the prima facie facts determined before the first appeal and the facts as later found by the district court at the merits trial undermine our previous decision on personal jurisdiction.he draws attention to prior references,by both the district court and by us,to adelson being a resident of massachusetts when in fact he was a resident of nevada,and he emphasizes that at trial the district court concluded that the contract was formed in israel rather than in massachusetts.as noted,hananel also presses claims that the district court erred in assigning the burden of proof to him rather than to adelson that it should have ordered an adverse inference based on the missing witness rule and that the court misapprehended the facts surrounding both the formation of and his performance under the contract.
ii.jurisdiction 
general jurisdiction over hananel was not alleged,and he argues that the district court also lacked specific jurisdiction over him.we review the jurisdictional issue de novo.barret lombardi,cir.we concluded in adelson i that the district court had personal jurisdiction over hananel under the prima facie standard,and that massachusetts was not an inconvenient forum.adelson i.we are not persuaded that the facts as found at trial undermine our previous decision,and we conclude that hananel massachusetts contacts support the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction.
to establish specific personal jurisdiction over hananel,adelson must demonstrate that the massachusetts statute grants jurisdiction over hananel and that the exercise of that jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the fifth amendment.adelson i,at internal citation omitted.we have construed the massachusetts statute as being coextensive with the limits permitted by the constitution.we thus turn directly to the constitutional test for determining specific jurisdiction,see daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir,which has three distinct components,namely,relatedness,purposeful availment sometimes called minimum contacts,and reasonableness,hannon beard,cir internal citation omitted.see also astro med,nihon kohden america,cir.
relatedness 
to demonstrate relatedness,adelson must show a demonstrable nexus between his claims and hananel activities,such that the litigation itself is founded directly on those activities.hannon,at quoting.sch.of law at andover am.bar ass n,cir.t he relatedness test is a flexible,relaxed standard,laminate sales,davis,cir quoting pritzker yari,cir,and the analysis focuses on the relationship between the defendant and the forum.hannon,at citing sawtelle farrell,cir see also goodyear dunlop tires operations brown,slip op.at,wl,at june,specific jurisdiction depends on an affiliatio n between the forum and the underlying controversy mcintyre machinery,nicastro,slip op.at,wl,at june,kennedy,quoting helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.because this is a contract dispute,in examining the defendant relationship to the forum we look to whether the defendant activity in the forum state was instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its breach.adams adams,cir quoting adelson i,at.we may also consider whether the defendant was subject to substantial control and ongoing connection to massachusetts in the performance of the contract.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted hahn vermont law school,cir less than substantial contacts are required to support jurisdiction when the cause of action arises from the defendant contacts with the forum than when it does not.
here,hananel contacts to the forum are directly related to his fulfillment of the terms of his employment contract as he claims them to be.as the district court recognized 
r egardless of the contract core terms,the parties actual course of dealing connects the contract to massachusetts hananel was in regular contact with interface employees in massachusetts,the money that funded hananel work came through massachusetts,and hananel budgets were routinely faxed to the office in massachusetts this is enough to satisfy the relatedness prong.
adelson ii,d at.
in addition,the record shows that hananel visited the massachusetts interface office prior to beginning formal,full time employment with ipi in january.later,while employed by ipi,hananel attended a board meeting in massachusetts as a direct result of an ipi investment 
although hananel does not deny that as manager of the ipi israel office he had regular contact with the needham office,he argues that his massachusetts activities were minor administrative tasks insufficient to warrant jurisdiction.this argument understates his managerial role in ipi and the importance of the massachusetts funding connection to the finances of ipi israel.as discussed in greater detail below,we disagree with hananel characterization of his massachusetts activities as purely incidental contacts and agree with the district court that they evince the relationship between hananel actions under the oral contract and the forum of massachusetts.
purposeful availment 
for there to be personal jurisdiction over hananel,his contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in massachusetts,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of massachusetts laws and making his presence before massachusetts courts foreseeable.daynard,at see also mcintyre machinery,slip op.at,wl,at specific jurisdiction calls for plaintiff to establish that defendant engaged in conduct purposefully directed at the forum id.the question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign,so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.
hananel directed regular administrative and financial conduct toward massachusetts,and his contacts with the state were voluntary and the result of more than just a single event or transaction.we see no reason to deviate from our previous conclusion that given that it was hananel who sought this employment contract with a company whose key officers were all located in massachusetts and whose financial accounts were all administered out of massachusetts,the court properly concluded that hananel had purposefully availed himself of massachusetts law.adelson i,at mcintyre machinery,slip op.at,wl,at no specific jurisdiction where defendant had no office in the forum,never sent any employees to the forum and does not have a single contact with the forum short of the sole piece of equipment at issue in the suit.
that hananel december trip to massachusetts was brief and its purpose was not found to be substantially related to negotiation of the agreement does not detract from the conclusion that the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate.hananel need not have been physically present in massachusetts in order to have transacted business there for purposes of establishing minimum contacts.hannon,at citing fairview mach.tool,oakbrook,d,holding that even though defendant had not been physically present in massachusetts,contacts that he would have had to make to arrange for prisoner transfer to massachusetts are sufficient to constitute transacting business under the statute 
here,as in hannon,there was purposeful availment where hananel business activities for ipi involved,inter alia,communication and interaction between him in israel and staff in massachusetts.see hannon,at.affirming the district court relevant factual findings,we conclude that hananel faxes,money transfers,and meetings demonstrate sufficient communications and interactions with massachusetts to satisfy us that hananel had at least minimum contacts with the forum and that these contacts were not random,isolated or fortuitous.see adelson i,at.
reasonableness 
to examine reasonableness,we consider the gestalt factors hananel burden of appearing,massachusetts interest in adjudicating the dispute,adelson interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the judicial system interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy,and the common interests of all 
sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.adelson i,at see also laminate sales,at citing burger king rudzewicz.
first,because hananel has not demonstrated a special or unusual burden in staging a defense in massachusetts over and above that of doing so in any foreign jurisdiction,we conclude that this factor does not weigh against jurisdiction.see pritzker,at i nsofar as staging a defense in a foreign jurisdiction is almost always inconvenient costly,we think this factor is only meaningful where a party can demonstrate some kind of special or unusual burden.
second,hananel emphasizes the fact that both the district court and this court in the previous appeal were mistaken when they concluded that adelson was a massachusetts resident and domiciliary,when in fact he was a resident and domiciliary of nevada.in presenting this argument,hananel stakes too much on the importance of adelson state of residence to the personal jurisdiction analysis.although this factual conclusion may have contributed to our original weighing of massachusetts interest in hearing the matter,adelson residency and domicile are not alone dispositive of personal jurisdiction and there are other facts that support massachusetts interests in the matter.
when previously we connected adelson assumed massachusetts residency with massachusetts interests in the case,we also noted that massachusetts interest is further heightened by the involvement of ipi executive officers who are employed in massachusetts and of funds which are held and managed in massachusetts.adelson i,at.besides,given the relatedness and purposeful availment demonstrated here,the weight of this one factor within reasonablenss is slight.sawtelle,at internal quotation marks omitted t he weaker the plaintiff showings on the first two prongs relatedness and purposeful availment,the less a defendant need show in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.the reverse is equally true an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing of relatedness and purposefulness.
third,adelson demonstrated his interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief through the federal courts in massachusetts by bringing his suit there,and nothing about this case suggests that those courts will have any difficulty rendering effective relief if adelson declaratory action is affirmed.see jet wine spirits,bacardi,cir.
fourth,although the district court noted that the existence of prior lawsuits in israel make this case an inefficient burden on the judicial system,it concluded that this is insufficient to tip the constitutional balance on the facts of this case.adelson ii,d at quoting adelson i,at we agree.
as to the fifth and final factor,we do not see how a finding of jurisdiction here would speak one way or another to the common interests of all sovereigns in advancing a particular social policy.
even if the last two factors weighed against jurisdiction,this alone would be insufficient to tip the constitutional balance on the facts presented here.adelson i,at see also ticketmaster new york,alioto,cir the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a sliding scale.we conclude that the sum of the gestalt factors weigh in favor of jurisdiction.
given the reasonableness of exercising jurisdiction,the relatedness of the dispute to the forum,and hananel contacts with the forum,we affirm the district court assertion of personal jurisdiction over hananel.
iii.burden of proof
