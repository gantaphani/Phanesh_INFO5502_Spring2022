procedural background 
yomar vázquez filippetti was standing on a sidewalk withdrawing money from an atm when josé toro rodríguez,driving a mercury grand marquis,struck her from behind.vázquez sustained severe injuries as a result,including the loss of her right leg.toro was insured under a policy written by cooperativa,to a limit of for bodily injury to any one person.the car belonged to toro brother,félix toro rodríguez,who was the named insured.
vázquez,her mother,and two siblings brought a diversity action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against the toro brothers,cooperativa,and the bank that owned the atm.the plaintiffs alleged that the bank had negligently designed its atm facility,and that the remaining defendants were liable for toro negligent driving.a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,awarding them a total of six million dollars in damages.the jury apportioned percent of the liability to the bank and percent to cooperativa and its insureds.
the district court entered judgment for the plaintiffs on march.consistent with the jury apportionment of liability,the bank was ordered to pay million dollars and cooperativa and its insureds million dollars.the judgment was amended on august,to specify that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the judgment.
cooperativa and its insureds did not appeal the judgment.on september,cooperativa paid into the court,the remainder of its policy limit the plaintiffs responded with an emergency motion that notice be taken of the waiver of insurance policy limits by cooperativa.before the district court reached the merits of that motion,the bank filed an appeal of the substantive verdict.we reversed the judgment against the bank on grounds.see vázquez filippetti banco popular de,cir.
with the bank out of the picture,the plaintiffs renewed their efforts to hold cooperativa responsible for the full judgment,despite its policy limit.they argued that cooperativa had waived its policy limit by failing to raise the issue in a specific and timely manner.the district court rejected that contention as being belied by the record.the plaintiffs appealed the ruling,and we affirmed.see vázquez filippetti cooperativa de seguros múltiples.
in the meantime,the district court amended the judgment,holding the toro brothers and cooperativa liable for the six million dollars in damages after losing the battle to set aside the policy limit,the plaintiffs sought to compel cooperativa to pay postjudgment interest on the full judgment.the court denied the motion on the grounds that it was untimely,and that the policy did not provide coverage for postjudgment interest.this order is the subject of the instant appeal.
cooperativa policy 
the relevant terms and conditions of cooperativa policy are as follows the policy part a civil liability coverage contains two relevant sections.the first section,titled insurance agreement,obligates cooperativa to 
pay the damages for bodily harm or property damages for any insured that is legitimately liable as a result of the automobile accident.the damages include the interest that is ordered against the insured.w e will payout or defend,as we deem appropriate,any claim or legal complaint that requests the payment of these damages.in addition to our liability limit,we will pay all the defense costs in which we may incur.our duty to payout or defend ends when our liability limit has been exhausted regarding this coverage.
the following section supplementary payments provides in pertinent part 
in addition to our liability limits,we will pay on the insured behalf t he interests accrued after having issued a ruling in any judicial claim we defend.our duty of paying interests ends when we offer to pay the corresponding part of the ruling that does not exceed our liability limit for that coverage.
the term liability limits is defined in part a as t he liability limit that appears in the statements for this coverage,which is our maximum liability limit for all the resulting damages of any automobile accident.liability limits for bodily injury are listed in the statements section as for each person and for each accident.
the plaintiffs challenge the district court determination that cooperativa is not responsible for paying postjudgment interest.they argue that,under the policy and the laws of puerto rico,cooperativa is liable for postjudgment interest on the judgment from the date of the entry of the original judgment until it pays such interest in full in response,cooperativa maintains that the plaintiffs forfeited any entitlement to postjudgment interest by failing to request it in a timely manner.whether the plaintiffs are entitled to postjudgment interest presents a legal issue that we review de novo.see radford trust first unum life ins.of,cir.
to begin,the plaintiffs tell us that the laws of puerto rico require cooperativa to pay postjudgment interest.yet it is well established that federal law governs the entitlement to postjudgment interest in any federal civil suit,including a diversity suit such as the instant action.tobin liberty mut.ins,cir cummings standard register,cir.section a of the judicial code entitles the prevailing party in federal court to postjudgment interest from the date of the entry of the judgment at the rate fixed in the statute.a.the statute aims to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,internal quotation marks omitted.because postjudgment interest follows as a legal incident from the statute providing for it,waggoner mcgray,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the court has no discretion to deny it 
the district court denied the plaintiffs request for postjudgment interest as untimely.the court agreed with cooperativa that local rule b required the plaintiffs to request postjudgment interest within ten days of cooperativa deposit of the policy limit.because they did not seek interest until june,nearly five years after cooperativa deposited the funds,the court held that the plaintiffs waived any entitlement thereto.we disagree.the cited rule relates to the timeliness of an objection to a motion by the opposing party,and says nothing about the time frame for a successful party to request postjudgment interest.
not surprisingly,cooperativa cites no authority for the proposition that postjudgment interest is waived absent a timely objection to a deposit of funds.requiring the plaintiffs to take affirmative steps to preserve their right to postjudgment interest,when such interest runs automatically by operation of law,makes little sense in the circumstances of this case.indeed,the prevailing plaintiff is entitled to postjudgment interest regardless of whether the judgment provides for its payment,united states michael schiavone sons,cir,and even if the plaintiff fails to appeal its omission,tinsley sea land,cir.that the plaintiffs here waited until the extent of cooperativa liability on the judgment became clear does not preclude them from collecting any postjudgment interest due.
to determine the extent of cooperativa liability for postjudgment interest,we turn to the language of the policy.we interpret the policy in accordance with the laws of puerto rico.velez gomez sma life assurance,cir.article of the puerto rico insurance code provides that e very insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy.laws ann.tit.absent an ambiguity,we must interpret the insurance contract according to its plain meaning,as a whole,and in harmony with the general purposes of the policy.jewelers mut.ins.barquet,cir.if the wording of the contract is explicit and its language is clear,its terms and conditions are binding on the parties.nieves intercontinental life ins.of,cir.
the supplementary payments provision in part a of cooperativa policy says that,in addition to the liability limits,cooperativa is responsible for interests accrued after having issued a ruling in any judicial claim we defend.this type of provision is referred to as a standard interest clause.see fratus republic ins,cir a clear majority of the courts,including the supreme court of puerto rico,interpret a standard interest clause as obligating insurers to pay postjudgment interest on the entire amount of the judgment against an insured,even though the policy limit may cover only a portion of the judgment.id.at see roldán medina serra,offic.trans.
the plain terms of the policy leave no doubt that cooperativa obligated itself to pay postjudgment interest on the entire judgment against its insureds,notwithstanding the policy limit.cooperativa insureds are liable for the full judgment accordingly,cooperativa is responsible for postjudgment interest on six million dollars.
that leaves us to determine the duration of cooperativa obligation to pay postjudgment interest.under section,postjudgment interest ordinarily begins to accrue as of the date of the original entry of judgment.cordero de jesus mendez,cir.cooperativa deposited the policy limit in september,approximately five months after the entry of the original judgment.according to the policy,cooperativa duty of paying interests ends when we offer to pay the corresponding part of the ruling that does not exceed our liability limit for that coverage.this plainly tells us that cooperativa must pay postjudgment interest for the period before it deposited the policy limit 
the plaintiffs argue that the deposit of the policy limit was insufficient to stop the clock on the accrual of postjudgment interest because cooperativa failed to pay interest accrued as of the date of deposit.as cooperativa has yet to pay postjudgment interest,the argument goes,interest on the full judgment continues to accrue against it.the clear and unambiguous terms of the policy preclude the plaintiffs argument.
to terminate its obligation for postjudgment interest,cooperativa had to offer to pay the part of the judgment owed under its liability limit for that coverage.plainly,that coverage is part a civil liability coverage.the term liability limit can not include postjudgment interest,because postjudgment interest is a supplemental obligation under part a of the policy,i n addition to the liability limits.
as the surrounding provisions make clear,liability limit refers to the applicable policy limit for damages.cooperativa chief obligation under part a is to pay damages for bodily injury or property damage until its liability limit has been exhausted regarding this coverage.the term liability limit is defined in part a as cooperativa maximum liability limit for all the resulting damages of any automobile accident,as provided in the statements.liability limits for bodily injury are listed in the statements as per person and per accident.included in the damages is prejudgment interest.by contrast,postjudgment interest is not part of the damages but a separate and independent obligation.by definition,it is a supplementary payment i n addition to the liability limits.
to conclude,then,that cooperativa had to pay accrued postjudgment interest to satisfy payment for the liability limit would eviscerate the plain language of the policy.the payment of the policy limit was sufficient under the policy to terminate cooperativa obligation to pay postjudgment interest accruing after the date of the deposit other courts interpreting nearly identical policy language have come to the same conclusion,cox peerless ins,white auto club inter ins,
in sum,cooperativa is responsible for postjudgment interest for the period between march,the date of the entry of the original judgment,and september,the date of the deposit of the policy limit,at the rate provided in section.under the plain terms of the policy,once cooperativa paid the policy limit into the court,representing the portion of the judgment owed under the policy,its duty to pay additional postjudgment interest abated even though it had not paid interest accrued to that point.
for the aforementioned reasons,we reverse the denial of the plaintiffs request for postjudgment interest and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
cooperativa had already paid to vázquez father to settle a state suit arising out of the same accident.
this most recent amended judgment provides that the toro brothers and cooperativa are jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs for the full amount of the judgement.the judgment was entered three days after the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside cooperativa policy limit.to the extent that the judgment can be read to suggest that the plaintiffs could nonetheless collect the full judgment from cooperativa,an argument that the plaintiffs do not make,for aught that the record discloses,this is a clerical error subject to correction at any time pursuant to.a.see bowen,carneiro donuts,cir a motion under rule a is appropriate where the judgment failed to reflect the court intention.internal quotation marks omitted.

to date,cooperativa has not paid any postjudgment interest.
given the mandatory terms of section,the plaintiffs failure to cite the federal statute does not result in a forfeiture of the statutory entitlement.see bell,boyd lloyd tapy,cir.
the district court docket entry denying the plaintiffs motion for postjudgment interest incorrectly stated that the policy at issue did not have a standard interest clause.the court referred to a concession to that effect by the plaintiffs,who apparently maintain that view of the policy on appeal.their brief makes no reference to the supplementary payments provision.nonetheless,in evaluating the plaintiffs claim to postjudgment interest,we can not ignore the policy plain language.
although the original judgment obligated the insureds to pay million dollars in damages,the judgment was corrected to indicate that all the defendants bore joint and several liability for the judgment.when we reversed the judgment against the bank,the insureds remained liable for the full judgment.
cooperativa argues that it is not liable for postjudgment interest for the period because the original judgment was deficient,as there is no indication that the clerk obtained the court approval before entering the judgment,in violation of.cooperativa makes this argument for the first time on appeal,and thus we need not consider it.see mccoy.inst.of,cir it is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court can not be surfaced for the first time on appeal.although we may affirm the district court judgment on any basis apparent from the record,the record is at worst ambiguous.we decline to assume irregularity under such circumstances.
of course,postjudgment interest accrued after cooperativa deposit of the policy limit remains the obligation of cooperativa insureds.
