tradewinds environmental restoration,tradewinds appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tammany park,llc stp.for the following reasons,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
stp owned an apartment complex in covington,louisiana,that was damaged by hurricanes katrina and rita the hurricanes.stp was advised by its insurer,colony insurance company colony,to begin mold remediation immediately after the hurricanes to avoid any additional damage.following the recommendation of one of its contractors,stp contacted tradewinds.the parties negotiated and executed an agreement dated september,by which tradewinds would provide emergency remediation and restoration.stp paid tradewinds a deposit at the time the contract was signed.
stp alleges that tradewinds provided to stp pricing lists for different types of work and equipment,but that stp never accepted those quotes.nevertheless,tradewinds completed the work contemplated by the contract by september.for the most part,this work consisted of delivering,installing,and operating industrial air dryers to extract moisture from the complex.tradewinds submitted three invoices to stp,for a total of approximately,and stp paid an additional on top of the deposit.however,stp refused to pay the remainder of the bill,allegedly because tradewinds failed to provide documentation justifying the invoiced amount.
in february,tradewinds filed this action against stp and one of stp principals,brian campbell based on diversity jurisdiction,to recover the balance due on the invoices.stp filed a counterclaim against tradewinds and a complaint against its insurer colony.stp moved for summary judgment against tradewinds,arguing that the requirements for the formation of a contract were not met,the alleged contract lacked an agreement as to price,and the contract was null because tradewinds was not a licensed contractor in louisiana.
the district court granted stp motion for summary judgment based on the third ground,finding that tradewinds provided mold remediation services in violation of louisiana licensing requirements.it held that the contract with stp was absolutely null and tradewinds could only recover the costs of the materials,services,and labor provided.following entry of the summary judgment order,stp and tradewinds stipulated that,subject to tradewinds appeal,the already paid by stp covered tradewinds costs in performing the contract,and that tradewinds owed no refund to stp.accordingly,the district court entered final judgment awarding no damages to either party 
tradewinds now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment.also before this court is stp motion to strike certain portions of the record excerpts submitted by tradewinds that are otherwise not part of the record on appeal.

discussion 
the louisiana legislature has enacted a broad licensing scheme for contractors within the state,designed for the protection of the health,safety,and general welfare of all those persons dealing with persons engaged in the contracting vocation,and the affording of such persons of an effective and practical protection against the incompetent,inexperienced,unlawful,and fraudulent acts of contractors with whom they contract.pursuant to,it is unlawful for any person to engage or to continue in this state in the business of contracting,or to act as a contractor as defined in this chapter,unless he holds an active license as a contractor under the provisions of this chapter.a contractor is defined broadly,as 
any person who undertakes to,attempts to,or submits a price or bid or offers to construct,supervise,superintend,oversee,direct,or in any manner assume charge of the construction,alteration,repair,improvement,movement,demolition,putting up,tearing down,or furnishing labor,or furnishing labor together with material or equipment,or installing the same for any building for which the entire cost of same is fifty thousand dollars or more when such property is to be used for commercial purposes 
the revised statutes also contain specific licensing requirements for individuals and entities that perform mold remediation.see.section thus provides that b eginning july,no person shall engage in or conduct,or advertise or hold himself out as engaging in or conducting the business of,or acting in the capacity of a person who conducts mold remediation unless such person holds a mold remediation license as provided for in this chapter.the term mold remediation is defined as the removal,cleaning,sanitizing,demolition,or other treatment,including preventive activities,of mold or matter that was not purposely grown at that location.like the general licensing provisions,the mold remediation requirements were expressly designed to protect the public.see.the legislature hereby declares that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the state to require the licensure and regulation of those persons who perform mold remediation.
under the louisiana civil code,p ersons may not by their juridical acts derogate from laws enacted for the protection of the public interest.any act in derogation of such laws is an absolute nullity.see also.a contract is absolutely null when it violates a rule of public order,as when the object of the contract is illicit or immoral.louisiana courts have long recognized that statutory licensing requirements were enacted to protect an interest vital to the public order,and have relied on these civil code articles to invalidate contracting agreements entered into with unlicensed contractors.hagberg john bailey contractor,so d,see also baton rouge parish sch.bd.ray,so d,holding that a contract for architectural services was invalid because the architectural firm had not secured a license to practice architecture from the louisiana board of architectural examiners.contrary to tradewinds contention,this rule of absolute nullity is not limited to public works contracts,and has been equally applied to void agreements between private parties.see,alonzo chifici,so d,nullifying a renovation agreement between a restaurant owner and an unlicensed contractor touro infirmary,preferred continuum orleans,lp travelers prop.cas.of,wl,at,unpublished holding that a contract to repair katrina damage entered into between a hospital and an unlicensed contractor is an absolute nullity and thus deemed never to have existed.
tradewinds concedes that it applied for a louisiana mold remediation license on september,and that it did not receive the license until february.it is therefore undisputed that tradewinds was not licensed as a contractor or a provider of mold remediation services at the times that it executed and performed the agreement with stp.nor does tradewinds properly challenge the district court finding that it performed mold remediation services for stp accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that louisiana rule of absolute nullity for a contracting agreement entered into without the benefit of a contractor license would typically limit stp recovery to the actual cost of materials,services and labor.alonzo,so d at.
tradewinds however contends that the decision of the louisiana state licensing board for contractors the licensing board to loosen its enforcement of the licensing statutes in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes protects its agreement with stp from this general rule of absolute nullity.tradewinds relies on an affidavit by charles marce
