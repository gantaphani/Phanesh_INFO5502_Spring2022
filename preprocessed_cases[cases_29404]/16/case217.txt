gemini investors gemini sued ameripark,ameripark alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.gemini,having lost at trial,asserts that the district court erred in instructing the jury.we affirm.
facts background 
ameripark owns and runs valet service operations at restaurants,hotels,and shopping centers across the country.it was founded by robert patterson,who led the company until.at the time relevant to this litigation,greenfield partners,greenfield owned percent of ameripark james nix was greenfield vice president and ameripark primary contact at greenfield.
on january,ameripark and mile hi valet services,mile hi,a competing valet services company,executed a letter of intent indicating that ameripark would acquire mile hi for sixteen million dollars.although much of the letter of intent was,the parties agreed to be bound by an exclusivity clause prohibiting mile hi from negotiating for its sale with anyone other than ameripark for a day period.
to facilitate its purchase of mile hi,ameripark sought financing from gemini,a private equity firm.gemini managing director,james rich,took the lead in negotiations with ameripark.on march,ameripark and gemini executed an outline of key transaction terms outline,which specified the terms pursuant to which gemini would finance the mile hi acquisition,as well as some conditions for completion of the deal.because the outline contemplated a recapitalization of ameripark and a redemption of greenfield shares,ameripark needed greenfield approval to move forward with the financing as specified in the outline.
among other terms,the outline included the following language this outline does not constitute a commitment by gemini to complete the financing and,other than the section sic entitled exclusivity and confidentiality,is on either party hereto.that is,the only terms of the outline that bound gemini and ameripark were the exclusivity and confidentiality provisions.
the exclusivity provision read 
in consideration of gemini commitment to expend significant time,effort and expense to evaluate the possible investment,ameripark and any officers,directors or representatives of ameripark agrees not to discuss this opportunity or reach any agreement with any person or entity regarding financing for this transaction or the pursuit of any sale or major other financing until april,provided that the exclusivity shall be automatically extended to the date that mile hi extends their exclusivity with ameripark either verbally or in writing.
emphasis added.the confidentiality provision read 
this outline is delivered to you with the understanding that neither it nor its substance shall be disclosed by you to any third party except those in a confidential relationship with ameripark such as directors,senior executive officers,legal counsel and accountants.disclosure to investment banking firms,mezzanine,venture capital or private equity funds or any other individual investors is strictly prohibited.
emphasis in original.
importantly,as indicated in the language,the outline exclusivity period was essentially coterminous with the exclusivity period created by the ameripark mile hi letter of intent.consequently,when mile hi later agreed to an extension of the letter of intent exclusivity period,the outline exclusivity automatically extended as well.
in april,after the parties signed the outline but before the exclusivity provision expired,patterson asked nix if greenfield would be interested in financing the mile hi acquisition in lieu of the financing also during this period,patterson approached robert stroup,the chief executive officer and sole shareholder of mile hi,about the possibility of seller financing.after some negotiation,stroup agreed to finance the acquisition and,on may,ameripark purchased mile hi using this seller financing.
on june,gemini sued ameripark in massachusetts superior court alleging that ameripark breached the outline exclusivity provision by pursuing financing for the mile hi acquisition from both greenfield and stroup.the suit was removed to federal court,and eventually went to trial 
at trial,the parties had competing views about the meaning of the exclusivity provision.ameripark argued that the phrase any person or entity referred to the persons or entities expressly set forth in the confidentiality banks,private equity funds,therefore ameripark discussions with greenfield and stroup did not constitute a breach of ameripark contractual obligations.gemini,on the other hand,contended that the exclusivity provision was unambiguous and prohibited discussions with any person or entity,including greenfield and stroup.accordingly,gemini requested the following jury instruction under the exclusivity agreement,ameripark agreed not to discuss with any person or entity the proposed transaction with mile hi or to reach any agreement with any person or entity regarding any major financing until the exclusivity period expired.
over gemini objection,the district court concluded that the exclusivity provision was ambiguous and instructed the jury about its meaning in part as follows 
y ou got to look at the language of the exclusivity provision y ou got to figure out what does that private law require each party to do 
you use the plain and ordinary meaning of the words that the parties used,having in mind the commercial context having in mind what the parties,what their commercial goals were,what did they have in mind when they entered into this deal,so that you can understand what the language they put down in that exclusivity agreement means 
i telling you that the law is that if the plain and ordinary meaning of the words that they used tell sic us how they should have behaved,you follow that that what they put down in a contract.what they say about it afterwards does count.
now,if you are not clear on the point,if you think that there any ambiguity in those words,start with this.what were they trying to do and while what they think later may bear on that,its not what they think later,it bears only to tell you what they thought they were doing when they agreed.
later in the instructions,the district court further clarified you going to interpret the contract,which means you going to decide what it requires.
as for causation and damages,gemini argued that the mile hi acquisition would have occurred with gemini financing but for ameripark breach of the exclusivity provision,and therefore gemini was entitled to expectation damages for the profits it would have realized had the deal been completed.as an alternative theory of causation and damages,gemini,citing air technology general electric,urged the district court to instruct the jury on what gemini called a lost opportunity theory.specifically,gemini argued that,even if it could not prove by a preponderance that ameripark breach was the but for cause of the deal falling through,the jury could still award damages for gemini lost opportunity to negotiate with ameripark to finance the deal.this lost opportunity,gemini claimed,could be calculated by assessing the value of the transaction to gemini had it gone forward,and then decreasing that value based on the possibility that the deal would have fallen through for some reason other than ameripark breach.
the district court refused to issue gemini lost opportunity instructions instead,it instructed the jury on causation and expectation damages in part as follows 
gemini,since they sic want the benefit of the bargain,they sic got to prove that but for the breach this deal would in fact have gone through and they would have made money 
a reasonable approximation of damages will suffice,but its got to be proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence.
this is largely a matter of judgment committed to the jury taking into account relevant factors,including what you conclude would have been the approximate net amount realized by gemini from the deal going through.
after closing,the district court gave the jury a general verdict form,despite ameripark previous request for a special verdict.during deliberations,the jury asked the following question please redefine question.did breach cause gemini losses do we assume sic contract would have gone through if it was not breached the district court responded by essentially reiterating its causation instruction and stressing that it was for the jury to determine if the breach caused the deal to collapse.later that same day,the jury returned a verdict in favor of ameripark.
ii.discussion 
gemini essentially raises two issues on appeal first,did the district court err by refusing to instruct the jury on gemini lost opportunity theory of causation and damages second,did the district court err in its instruction to the jury about the meaning of the exclusivity provision 
this court reviews jury instructions de novo.sec happ,cir.where an objection is properly registered below jury instructions are reviewed to see whether there was error and,if so,whether that error was harmless.sheek asia badger,cir.we reverse the giving of an instruction if it was misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law,and adversely affected the objecting party substantial rights.happ,at quoting sheek,at.similarly,refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.seahorse marine supplies,sun oil,cir.
the district court failure to instruct on gemini lost opportunity theory 
under massachusetts law to recover expectation damages for breach of contract the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance that an agreement existed,the agreement was breached,and the breach caused the plaintiff to suffer damages.see charles kender,see also salvas wal mart stores,contract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party expectation interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain by awarding him a sum of money that will,to the extent possible,put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed.quoting restatement second of contracts,cmt.a abrams reynolds metals,damages may be awarded for a breach of contract for the net amount of the losses caused and gains prevented by the defendant breach.internal citations omitted schwartz travelers indem,noting that a claim of breach of an implied contract will not go to the jury without any evidence supporting an inference that the harm which befell plaintiff followed as a natural consequence of the breach.internal marks omitted.
the causation element generally requires the plaintiff to prove that but for the defendant breach the plaintiff would have realized some gain or avoided some loss see taylor int l.
gemini does not dispute the fact that but for causation is usually a prerequisite to recovering expectation damages.nonetheless,gemini appeals the district court failure to instruct the jury on its alternative lost opportunity approach to causation and damages.specifically,gemini asserts that,pursuant to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc holding in air technology,t he district court should have instructed the jury that gemini could show that it was harmed by proving that ameripark breach caused it to lose the exclusive opportunity to negotiate a final contract with ameripark.under this approach,gemini contends that the jury should have been instructed that it could determine the value of gemini lost opportunity by discounting gemini expected profit from the potential transaction with ameripark by the uncertainty that a final agreement would have been reached.
air technology holding and facts are confusing,but we recount them here as clearly and succinctly as possible in the early,the general electric company ge sought a contract from the air force to assist with the establish ment of installations in north america for detecting and determining the direction and yield of nuclear detonations by methods including the use of electromagnetic em sensors.air,at.to bolster its efforts,ge considered assistance from air technology corporation at.id.at.in a meeting between representatives of the two companies,at proposed a system for the em sensor portion of the air force project.id.eventually,ge and at agreed that at would become a team member on ge bid.id.at.team membership,the sjc concluded,was intended to mean more to at than opportunity to bid in the program rather,if ge received a prime contract at,subject to air force approval,would receive a subcontract for the em sensor.id.internal marks omitted.thereafter,at personnel helped ge prepare and present its proposal to the air force.id.at.
the air force subsequently awarded the prime contract to ge.id.at.among other things,this contract required that all ge subcontracts receive air force approval.id.at.to at dismay,ge refused to acknowledge its obligation to award a subcontract to at for the design and manufacture of the em sensor,and instead sought competitive bids for the job.id.at.
the sjc held that ge,by failing to press for at continuing participation in the program and by competing for the em sensor work,committed total breaches of its duties to at.id.at.as for damages,the sjc remanded for a determination of the value of at lost opportunity,id.at,explaining 
t he detailed terms of at subcontract were never determined beyond the expectation that the subcontract would cover the em sensor and enable at to recover its costs and a reasonable profit.whatever uncertainty may have existed about the subcontract does not preclude recovery by at.what at lost by ge breaches of contract was a business opportunity.the problem is to determine the value of that opportunity 
id.at internal citations omitted.the sjc rejected the master decision to use at subcontract proposals to measure damages in part because 
the master computation of damages seems to have been made by allowing to at the whole of what it would have received on the basis of its bids,less the cost to at of performing such a subcontract.that computation did not in any degree reflect the potential effect of bargaining or the possibility that the air force would not have approved such a subcontract without competition.
id.at internal citation omitted.
the court therefore concluded 
the master or a judge must appraise the fair value of at lost opportunity in the light of the uncertainties.this will be largely a matter of judgment,taking into account relevant factors,including what the trier of the fact concludes would have been the approximate net amount realized by at from a subcontract,if one had been negotiated,and the probability of successful negotiations and air force approval.
id.internal citation omitted see also miller allstate ins,so d,in approving a similar damages theory,concluding that recovery will be allowed where a plaintiff has been deprived of an opportunity or chance to gain an award or profit even where damages are uncertain wachtel alfalfa journal,iowa where defendant breached contract by restricting plaintiff ability to compete in contest in which she was likely to win a prize,holding that defendant could be held liable for the plaintiff lost chance of winning a prize.but see wright mary med.ctr.of evansville,d,rejecting loss of chance theory because,among other reasons,indiana had rejected a similar doctrine in medical malpractice cases and t here is less basis for denying recovery for loss of a chance in tort cases as compared to contract cases phillips pantages theatre,where court assumed that defendant breached contractual duty to allow plaintiff to enter final round of contest,affirming dismissal because w ithout either the winning or substantial proof that she would have won had she been permitted to enter,no recovery can be had.
