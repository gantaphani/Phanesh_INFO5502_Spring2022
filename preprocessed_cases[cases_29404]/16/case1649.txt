dextel terrebonne terrebonne appeals the district court september,november,and december,orders granting the motion of transportation corporation to compel arbitration,denying terrebonne motion for rehearing of that order,and granting motion to confirm the june,arbitration award and denying terrebonne motion to set aside the september order to compel.for the following reasons,we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
in november,terrebonne worked for as a crew member aboard its tug maryland.on november,while the tug was in bridgeport,connecticut,terrebonne overexerted himself when lifting a pump in the tug port propeller shaft alleyway.terrebonne reported the incident on november,complaining of abdominal pain.he was diagnosed with a left inguinal hernia,and underwent hernia repair surgery on december,returning to work on january.
on march,terrebonne and executed in new york a written partial release and claims arbitration agreement.pursuant to that agreement,the parties partially settled terrebonne claims arising out of the november,incident for.specifically,the agreement settled all rights,claims,liens,remedies or causes of action for any damages that he terrebonne has incurred from to march.terrebonne reserved the right to seek recovery for damages that may develop after the date of this agreement that are related to the alleged incident on the tug maryland on or about,but agreed to arbitrate any such future claims in new york 
in further consideration of this partial settlement,dextel terrebonne agrees to submit any claims related to the alleged incident on the tug maryland on,for damages that develop after the date of this agreement,arising under the theory of unseaworthiness,jones act,or any other applicable law to arbitration in new york pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties and any united states district court shall have the jurisdiction to enforce this agreement,to enter judgement on the award and to grant any remedy provided by law in respect of the arbitration proceedings.
according to uncontradicted affidavits,terrebonne reported a recurrence of his prior hernia on april or,while working on the tug.terrebonne continued to work until may,when he complained that his prior hernia had developed again.after may,he underwent medical treatment for the reinjury.
on may,terrebonne instituted this suit against in the court below.his complaint demands trial by jury,alleges that it is filed under the jones act for negligence,and under the general admiralty and maritime law for unseaworthiness,maintenance,care and wages.it further asserts that plaintiff was an employee of defendant serving as a crew member aboard its vessels,and that 
on or about november,plaintiff was in the course of employment when he was required to engage in awkward positioning and the lifting of heavy weights excessive for a single person when as a result of said unseaworthy condition and failure to provide a safe place to work he was injured and suffered on or about april,when he was required to move air plane tires in awkward positions resulting in excessive lifting and overexertion because of said failure to provide a safe place to work and unseaworthy condition.
the complaint next alleges that defendant tortious acts aforesaid caused or contributed to plaintiff damages.the complaint makes no reference to the march,settlement agreement or the payment pursuant thereto.no amended complaint has been filed or sought to be filed.
moved to stay further proceedings in this matter pending completion of the arbitration of terrebonne claims pursuant to the march,agreement.terrebonne opposed the motion,arguing that his april injury was a separate injury from his prior hernia that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under section one of the federal arbitration act faa,because it involves a seaman employment contract that the jones act,by virtue of its incorporation of section five of the federal employers liability act fela,voided the agreement and that the agreement is also void under.a 
over terrebonne objections,the district court granted motion to compel on september,the order was entered on september,the court concluded that terrebonne second hernia was a recurrence of the first hernia that the march,agreement is clearly separate and independent from terrebonne employment contract that terrebonne argument was unsupported by case law and further undermined by the fact that the agreement does not exempt from liability and that.a is inapplicable as it only deals with passenger vessels.on october,terrebonne filed a motion for rehearing which the district court denied on november,treating the motion as one under rule b and concluding that terrebonne had not provided any clarification of issues or new evidence warranting reconsideration.
thereafter,terrebonne,on march,filed suit in louisiana state court against respecting the same matter.responded by moving the district court to enjoin prosecution of the state court suit and to require terrebonne to abide by the court orders compelling arbitration.before the district court ruled,however,terrebonne agreed to a consent order which the district court approved,signed and entered may.that order recites that terrebonne and his counsel agree to dismiss the louisiana state court action,agree to abide by this court order dated september,compelling arbitration of this dispute and agree to proceed forthwith with the arbitration before the american arbitration association.the consent order also dismisses,as moot request for injunction.
arbitration began in new york in june.terrebonne and made various submissions and attended a evidentiary hearing in october,where there were over exhibits and pages of testimony.following submissions,the hearings were declared closed on april,with a deadline of june,for the panel to render its award.the new york arbitration panel issued its award on june,denying all of terrebonne claims,but awarding him arbitration costs in the amount of to be paid by 
on august,moved to reopen this suit,and to enter judgment confirming the arbitration award and dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice and to deposit the awarded terrebonne with the court,per terrebonne on august,filed an opposition to and also moved to set aside the district court september order.he argued that enforcing the arbitration award would violate public policy and that the agreement violated section five of the fela.on december,the district court granted motion and denied terrebonne request to set aside the september order because the request assert ed the same arguments that th e court ha d taken to be borderline frivolous twice before.this last order further provides that plaintiff claims against the defendant are hereby dismissed,with prejudice.
terrebonne timely appealed.
discussion 
the gist of terrebonne arguments on appeal is that the march arbitration agreement is unenforceable.he secondarily asserts that,if the agreement is enforceable,his falls outside the agreement scope.terrebonne does not contend that the arbitration panel erred.rather,he attacks the district court orders compelling arbitration and confirming the arbitration award in effect,he argues that his claims should not have been subjected to arbitration in the first place.we disagree,and affirm the district court orders,finding the arbitration agreement both enforceable and broad enough for the district court to compel arbitration and allow the arbitrators to determine the agreement scope.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
this court has jurisdiction over the instant appeal by virtue of and the parties both assume that the fact that this appeal is from the district court december,order confirming the award and dismissing terrebonne suit with than from the september order compelling arbitration,staying the action and stating this case is closed for statistical purposes does not of itself preclude terrebonne from challenging the validity of the september order we accordingly proceed on that assumption.

ii.terrebonne arguments and applicable law 
enforceability of the arbitration agreement 
terrebonne focuses his appeal almost entirely on the district court september order to arbitrate and the validity or enforceability of the march arbitration agreement.specifically,he makes two challenges against the agreement first,he asserts that the arbitration agreement is subsumed into his employment contract and therefore unenforceable per section one of the faa,which excludes contracts of employment of seamen from the faa purview.second,terrebonne contends that the agreement is void under section five of the fela,which is applicable here by virtue of the jones act.section five of the fela provides in relevant part that a ny contract,rule,regulation,or device whatsoever,the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this chapter,shall to that extent be void.we consider each argument in turn below.
section one of the faa 
the faa compels judicial enforcement of a wide range of written arbitration agreements.circuit city stores,adams,d.accordingly,the faa generally declares valid and enforceable written provisions for arbitration in any maritime transaction freudensprung,at.this is consistent with the faa purpose,which was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.gilmer lane,d.
section one of the faa,however,provides that nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.terrebonne argues that this exclusion applies in the instant case because the march agreement is subsumed into his employment contract.we find this argument unpersuasive.
first,we note that the agreement here only partially settles claims for benefits and damages related to terrebonne november injury.it does not purport either to employ terrebonne or to modify terrebonne contract of employment in any way.thus,on its face,the agreement does not appear to fall within section one exception for contracts of employment of seamen.
terrebonne,however,argues that the march agreement is subsumed into his employment contract because the agreement covers his maintenance and cure claims.because maintenance and cure are inseparable from a seaman employment,he contends,the agreement necessarily constitutes part of his employment contract,such that the agreement falls within section one exception 
the march agreement indeed covered terrebonne maintenance and cure claims up to the time that the agreement was entered into.we reject,however,terrebonne assertion that these maintenance and cure claims necessarily implicate his employment contract.certainly,there is case law using generalized language connecting maintenance and cure to the seaman employment contract.see,aguilar standard oil of.in the united states maintenance and cure has been recognized consistently as an implied provision in contracts of marine employment.tate am.tugs,cir the right of an injured seaman to maintenance is a form of compensation that arises out of the contract of employment.yet,we have clarified that maintenance and cure is an intrinsic part of the employment relationship,separate from the actual employment contract 
m aintenance and cure differs from contractual rights.the court,in cortes baltimore insular line,held that maintenance and cure is imposed by the law itself as one annex to the employment contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin,but given the relation,no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.wood diamond m drilling,cir concluding that recovery of maintenance and cure is not subject to the same mitigation limitations that govern recovery based on ordinary contractual rights 
in other words,maintenance and cure is an essential part of the seaman employment relationship that can not be contracted away the duty to provide maintenance attaches once the seaman enters the service of the ship and it is a duty that no private agreement is competent to abrogate.baldassaro united states,cir quoting de zon am.president lines.it is true that collective bargaining agreements may validly set the rate of maintenance and cure.see id.at the right to maintenance can not be abrogated,but it can be modified and defined by contract.but we do not accept that this in turn means that maintenance and cure is part of the employment contract.further,while the march agreement states that is obligated to pay maintenance and cure,it does not purport to change anything regarding that obligation or regarding terrebonne employment with.thus,we conclude the agreement is not subsumed into terrebonne employment contract,and does not fall under section one exception to the faa coverage 
section five of the fela 
we also reject terrebonne assertion that because this is a jones act case,the arbitration agreement is invalid for the reason that it violates section five of the fela.in passing the jones act,congress did not specifically enumerate the rights of seamen,but extended to them the same rights granted to railway employees by fela.withhart otto candies,cir.section five of the fela invalidates a ny contract,rule,regulation,or device whatsoever,the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this chapter.
for his argument,terrebonne relies heavily on boyd grand trunk western.per curiam.in boyd the railroad employee,having been injured on the job,agreed,in exchange for his employer cash advances against whatever settlement or recovery was later achieved,that any suit to be filed on account of the injury would be filed only in a district or county that was either his residence when injured or in which the injury occurred.both such locations were in michigan,but the employee filed suit in the supreme court of cook county,illinois.the railroad sued the employee in michigan state court to enjoin his prosecution of the illinois suit,and the michigan supreme court ruled for the railroad.the united states supreme court reversed,holding that the illinois suit was in a venue specifically authorized under section of the and that hence fela section voided the agreement excluding that venue provided for in section.
for several reasons,we are not persuaded that boyd controls here.
to begin with,the venue provisions of section of the boyd held protected by fela section not apply to the jones act,which has its own venue provision contained in the last sentence of section a see note,supra,and provides for venue in a district where the defendant employer resides or his principal office is located.venue of a jones act case is hence not provided for in section,or in any other provision,of the fela.we directly so held in pure oil suarez,cir,affirmed on other grounds,d.there,the plaintiff seaman brought a jones act and general maritime law suit against his employer,pure oil company,in the southern district of florida.the defendant moved to transfer the case to the northern district of illinois,it being undisputed that it was incorporated in ohio and had its principal office in illinois,although it did do substantial business in the southern district of florida when the suit was commenced.the district court denied the motion to transfer,but certified its ruling to this court under b.we noted that t he relevant language of the jones act.provides for venue in the district in which the defendant employer resides or has its principal office,and that in the absence of a statutory directive to the contrary,the residence of a corporation for venue purposes is limited to the state of its incorporation.id.at.we stated that appellee seaman makes two arguments in support of the district court denial of the motion to transfer,describing the first of these as follows appellee argues that the special venue provisions of the federal employers liability act,under which venue against pure oil would undoubtedly be proper in the instant case,are applicable to a civil action under the jones act.id.at footnote omitted characterizing this argument as one which can be disposed of in short order,we emphatically rejected it,stating 
however,this argument does not adequately accommodate the and eminently logical canon of statutory construction that the specific provisions of a statute control exclusively over the broader and more general provisions of another statute which may relate to the same subject matter in the absence of a clear manifestation to the contrary by the legislature citations omitted.as one court has stated,the short answer to appellee argument is that congress has seen fit to impose different venue requirements in jones act cases.to now hold that the venue requirements under the federal employers liability act are controlling would negate the plain language of.rodriguez united fruit.id.
having rejected the first argument,we proceeded to consider his second,characterized as a far more appealing argument,which was that the definition of the term residence which was added to the general venue statute in,c,should be read into the jones act.id.at under the terms of section c,as added in,any judicial district in which a corporation is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.agreeing with appellee second argument,we held that this definition of a corporate defendant residence in section c applied to determine the district in which the corporate defendant employer resides as provided in section,and on that basis affirmed the district court denial of the motion to transfer.id.at.in this latter connection we considered and rejected the contention that the supreme court decision in fourco glass transmirra prods,d holding section c did not define a corporate defendant residence under b applicable to patent infringement suits dictated a contrary result.id.at et.
the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the issue concerning section c,section,and the fourco case,and ultimately affirmed this court,holding that the section c definition of corporate residence applied to determine the district in which the corporate defendant employer resides as provided in.pure oil suarez.the supreme court did not mention our holding that the venue provisions of section of the fela did not apply to the jones act we note,however,that the section c question would not have any practical importance if jones act venue included whatever venue would be proper under section of the fela because section c embraced no venue not authorized by section.
because,under our decision in pure oil,the venue provisions of section of the fela are inapplicable to jones act cases,it necessarily follows that nothing in section of the fela is applicable to jones act venue.hence,neither boyd nor section dictate the result here 
boyd is also to be distinguished because it did not in any way involve the faa or,indeed,an agreement to arbitrate.there was no federal statute authorizing or providing for the enforcement of the type of agreement involved in boyd.in gilmer lane,d,the court upheld an agreement to arbitrate governed by the faa,specifically distinguishing prior cases on the ground,inter alia,that those cases were not decided under the faa,which,as discussed above,reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.id.at quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d.see also,express mcmahon,d the arbitration act thus establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration inside quotation marks and citation omitted.here,in contrast to boyd,the faa is involved and thus the issues must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.gilmer.at emphasis added inside quotation marks and citation omitted 
terrebonne answers this argument solely by relying on wilko swan.wilko was a suit by a customer against a brokerage firm alleging the firm sold him certain securities by misrepresentations.the suit was pursuant to sections and a of the securities act of,a,which respectively provide that under certain circumstances the seller making such misrepresentation shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him,who may sue in any court of competent jurisdiction,to recover the consideration paid,and that the united states district courts have jurisdiction over such suits,with venue in a district where,inter alia,the defendant is found or transacts business or where the sale took place but precluding removal of state court suits.the defendant moved under section of the faa to stay trial of the suit pending completion of arbitration,relying on the arbitration provisions of the plaintiff margin agreement with the brokerage firm executed prior to the challenged sale.the supreme court noted that section of the securities act,a,provided that a ny condition,stipulation,or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this subchapter shall be void.id.at.it went on to hold that the arbitration agreement was invalid because 
the words of,void any stipulation waiving compliance with any provision of the securities act.this arrangement to arbitrate is a stipulation,and we think the right to select the judicial forum is the kind of provision that can not be waived under of the securities act.
id.at,and that congress must have intended to apply to waiver of judicial trial and review.id.at.
the wilko court then continued by stating 
this accords with boyd grand trunk western,we there held invalid a stipulation restricting an employee choice of venue in an action under the federal employers liability act,et.section of that act permitted suit in any one of several localities and forbade a common carrier exempting itself from any liability under the act.section had been adopted to avoid contracts waiving employers liability we said the right to select the forum is a substantial right and that the agreement,restricting that choice,would thwart the express purpose of the statute.id.footnotes omitted.
however,over a decade ago the supreme court,in rodriguez de quijas express,d,expressly overruled wilko,and held that a predispute agreement to arbitrate was validly applicable to a claim under section of the securities act and was not invalidated by section thereof rodriguez observed that wilko characterization of the arbitration process was pervaded by the old judicial hostility to arbitration which had become outmoded and had fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes.id.at.it rejected the wilko holding that did not permit waiver of the right to select the judicial forum,id.at,on the ground that b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it likewise held,with reference to the procedural litigation provisions contained in the securities act,such as the statute broad venue provisions,nationwide service of process and concurrent jurisdiction in the state and federal courts without possibility of removal,that there is no sound basis for construing the prohibition in on waiving compliance with any provision of the securities act to apply to these procedural provisions.id.these holdings are similarly applicable here.under the arbitration agreement,terrebonne does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the jones act and the general maritime law,he only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.
terrebonne argues in his brief see note supra that rodriguez is restricted to business transactions.that argument,however,is clearly refuted by gilmer,which relied on,inter alia,rodriguez,to enforce under the faa a arbitration agreement as applied to an individual employee claim under the age discrimination in employment act.see gilmer.at,
in this connection,terrebonne further passingly contends,in a most conclusory fashion,that requiring arbitration of a seaman jones act claim is contrary to public policy.but,as noted above,the faa establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration.mcmahon.at.the burden is on terrebonne to show a contrary and compelling public interest.gilmer.at.terrebonne has made no such showing.having made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.gilmer at citation and inside quotation marks omitted the only such indication on the part of congress is the concluding clause of section of the faa which expressly exempts from the faa,and from the binding effect it gives to contracts to arbitrate,contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or other such transportation workers.beyond that express exemption,there is certainly no more public policy reason to exempt seamen from the binding effect of than contracts of arbitrate jones act or general maritime law claims against their employer than there is to exempt employees protected by the various civil rights or employee protection statutes from the binding effect of contracts to arbitrate claims under such statutes against their employer.see gilmer and note supra.
this comports with our decision in freudensprung offshore technical services,cir,where we affirmed the district court orders staying litigation of the plaintiff jones act claim pending arbitration.id.at.we noted that the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,governs concurrently with the faa in this case.id.at.we held that even assuming arguendo that the consultant agreement by which the defendant retained the plaintiff is a seaman employment contract,the arbitration agreement contained therein is nonetheless enforceable pursuant to the convention id.we rejected the plaintiff argument 
that a agreement to arbitrate rather than litigate his personal injury claims is inherently unfair because he could not have made an informed decision concerning his remedies before his injury had occurred and before any medical advice was available to him.the difficulty with this argument is that the same could be said of any advance agreement to arbitrate personal injury claims,and it is by now beyond cavil that such agreements are presumptively enforceable.as noted above,freudensprung and otsi agreed to arbitrate any dispute arising out of the consultant agreement.it is o nly by rigorously enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms,do we give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties,without doing violence to the policies behind the faa.ford nylcare health plans of gulf coast,cir quoting volt information,bd.of trustees of leland stanford junior,d.id.at.
the plain implication is that if the agreement was not contained in a seaman contract of employment it would be enforceable under the faa.
we observe that,beyond vague references to the unfairness of arbitration agreements of seamen and of others generally and generically,terrebonne has never asserted in this case or urged on this appeal that the march,agreement here was invalid because it was not or was not shown to be sufficiently voluntary,informed and understood on his part,or because the amount paid for damages incurred up until march,was not or was not shown to be fair and adequate,or because the agreement was not otherwise sufficiently fair or shown to be so.terrebonne public policy arguments lack merit.
scope of the arbitration agreement 
in addition to challenging the arbitration agreement enforceability,terrebonne asserts that if the agreement is enforceable,his is separate from his prior hernia and thus outside the agreement coverage.we hold that the district court did not err in compelling arbitration or confirming the arbitration award on this basis the agreement was sufficiently broad for the district court to compel arbitration and allow the arbitration panel to determine its scope.
the agreement clearly states that it encompasses any claims related to terrebonne november injury.terrebonne complaint in this action is for damages for both his accident and his april.terrebonne has nowhere asserted that he is only or even mainly asking for damages for his reinjury.further,terrebonne has not explained anywhere how these two are different.thus,in light of terrebonne lumps together the november and april arbitration agreement was broad enough to be submitted to the arbitrators for determination of whether terrebonne reinjury fell within the agreement scope.see in re complaint of hornbeck offshore,cir stating that this court distinguishes between broad and narrow arbitration clauses,and explaining,if the clause is broad,the action should be stayed and the arbitrators permitted to decide whether the dispute falls within the clause.we conclude that the arbitration clause is broad.see,hornbeck offshore at any dispute is broad and beiser weyler,cir relates to has a plainly broad meaning.terrebonne has not attacked the award rendered by the arbitration panel nor has he attacked the arbitrators decision that the reinjury fell within the agreement scope.
conclusion 
terrebonne has shown no valid basis on which to reverse the district court decision to compel arbitration.the district court judgment is accordingly 
plaintiff damages are alleged to include pain and suffering,past,future mortification,humiliation,fright shock and embarrassment loss of earnings and earning capacity hospital,pharmaceutical and other cure expenses aggravation of prior condition,if any there be inability to engage in social,recreational,and other pursuits previously enjoyed mental anguish found maintenance,cure,and wages.
on appeal,terrebonne does not argue that the agreement is void under.a,which by its terms applies only to passenger vessels.
the order concludes by reciting that the defendant motion to compel arbitration and stay litigation is granted and this case is closed for statistical purposes the order does not direct,and motion did not request,that the suit be dismissed.
then attempted to pay terrebonne the,but his attorney informed by a july,letter that terrebonne would not accept the as such would be inconsistent with the intention to contest the viability of enforcement of the arbitration award.
award of arbitrators confirmation jurisdiction procedure,states,in pertinent part if the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration,and shall specify the court,then at any time within one year after the award is made any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award,and thereupon the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated,modified,or corrected 
terrebonne opposed motion to confirm the arbitration award and moved to set aside the september order under frcp b.the district court considered terrebonne motion under rule b through because these were the only bases for b relief when sought more than one year after the challenged order was entered.
