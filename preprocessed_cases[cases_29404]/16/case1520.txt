this contract case,governed by texas law,comes to us on appeal from summary judgment in favor of mesa air group.aps argues that the district court erred in finding an enforceable contract on summary judgment,and in its award of damages.
mesa air group is a regional airline that,in the course of delta airline bankruptcy proceedings in the southern district of new york,was awarded an unsecured trade with a face amount of million against delta.aps capital corporation business is the purchase and resale of trade claims and bank debt.after mesa claim against delta was approved by the bankruptcy court,aps contacted mesa regarding possible sale of mesa claim to aps.after several weeks of intermittent contacts,discussions came to a head on april,a friday.steven kleckner,an aps employee who was charged with pursuing trade claim purchases and had initiated contacts with mesa,spoke several times that day with george murnane iii,executive vice president and chief financial officer of mesa.in these phone conversations,transcripts of which are in the record,aps informed mesa that it could offer a relatively good price cents on the dollar on the entire face value of mesa claim million dollars,and the parties reached an agreement on the transaction at that price at pm cst that afternoon,aps sent an confirming the agreement.the came from steven klenda,general counsel of aps,and its substance ran as follows 
please allow this to serve as a preliminary confirmation of our delta airlines,the debtor transaction with a trade date of april.you have verbally agreed to sell approximately face amount purchase amount general unsecured claims against the debtor at fifty eight cents on the dollar or of the purchase amount.
given the lateness of the hour here,i will on monday with a formal written trade confirmation with customary terms that will memorialize the key terms of this transaction and provide for the negotiation and execution of a more extensive agreement.
on tuesday,april,aps transmitted the promised draft formal transaction confirmation as an attachment,with klenda noting in his accompanying that he did not have the time today to draft the agreement personally or give it more than a cursory review,encouraging mesa to review it in this light,and asserting,w e look forward to working with you moving this transaction toward completion.
in addition to confirming the details already agreed upon a trade date of april,the identity of buyer and seller,the price and assets involved,the document included some significant terms that mesa objected warranty,and indemnification provisions a lengthy closure deadline and a condition precedent to the transaction aps finding a buyer for the claim it was to purchase from mesa.on april,through outside counsel,mesa responded with a draft of its own,removing or modifying the objectionable provisions.some language was consistent across both drafts,including multiple provisions to the effect that until the transaction actually was funded and closed,the agreement was and the transaction would be null and void.
the next afternoon,aps responded,with a new tone.citing mesa deletion of material terms from the proposed agreement,aps rejected the mesa draft and then effectively walked away from the negotiating table,rejecting any future dealing on what it characterized as the nascent transaction,declaring it null and void.further efforts failed to bring aps back to the table,and mesa counsel finally warned,late that afternoon aps can expect litigation in this matter.on monday,april,the next business day after mesa so advised,aps brought suit in the western district of texas,seeking relief under the texas and federal declaratory judgment acts mesa counterclaimed on breach of contract and promissory estoppel grounds.
on april,judge sparks decided the parties judgment motions in favor of mesa,holding as a matter of law that the parties formed an enforceable contract on april,which was breached by aps final repudiation of the deal on april.damages were argued at a bench trial,and the court ultimately awarded mesa in damages,plus interest and attorneys fees.the court reasoned that the phone calls and the unambiguously indicated an intent to be bound to all necessary terms in the was being sold,the purchase price,and the date of that as such the communications recorded an enforceable contract between the parties.
a number of aspects of the district court ruling are not challenged on appeal,including its rulings as to the inapplicability of the statute of frauds,aps affirmative defenses,and numerous aspects of his damages ruling,including the adequacy of mesa mitigation.the remaining disputes are over the existence of a binding agreement,and the date of the breach,which is relevant to damages.we turn first to the decisive issue of whether there was,as a matter of law,a binding contract made between the parties.
we review two aspects of the district court finding of a binding contract first,whether the parties intended their april agreement to be binding and,if so,whether the agreement on april was sufficiently definite to be an enforceable contract.
there is no doubt but that the parties achieved some agreement on april,memorialized in the of that afternoon.the parties dispute whether it was an enforceable contract with some customary terms to be supplied,or an agreement on a central price point only,with further negotiation over other key terms to follow.
aps advances the latter position,characterizing this as a case in which an agreement to agree went awry in the course of ongoing negotiations by contrast,with an able district court on its side,mesa characterizes this as a straightforward breach of contract,in which aps sabotaged what should have been the routine formalization of an contract with an unfair addition of terms followed by a precipitous exit from the negotiating table.in our de novo review of summary judgment we may only decide this dispute if there is no genuine issue of fact material to the answer.if the matter can not be decided as a matter of law,we must remand for.
the parties intent to be bound is the salient issue.the district court held that d espite the parties continued negotiation of the language for additional terms in a formal written instrument,the only objective evidence regarding the intent and purpose of the april,clearly and unambiguously indicates that an offer was made and accepted and a contract was formed.it cited language in the from aps that mesa had verbally agreed to the deal,and the absence of any language indicative of a desire not to be bound an agreement subject to other terms an explicit provision,as conclusively evidencing an intent to be bound.given this clarity,the court refused to look at the later,formal contract drafts,which included repeated and sometimes language specifying that the parties agreement was not binding unless it actually closed.it reasoned that these communications might express some of the parties subjective understandings of the status or nature of the transaction,but that subjective understandings can not,as a matter of law,controvert the unambiguous objective evidence in favor of finding a binding agreement as of april.
several circumstances give pause.first,there is the language used in the phone calls and of and before april.certainly,these communications could support a finding that the parties intended their agreement to be a binding contract.but,as aps points out,some of the language points in the opposite the inclusion of preliminary in the phrase preliminary confirmation,and the fact that the draft to be transmitted would provide for the negotiation and execution of a more extensive agreement.these bits of language stand in tension with the language that suggests intent to be bound.negotiations can fail,and preliminary confirmation of a deal may never be finally confirmed.this reading may be weaker than the district court,but ambiguity may arise even when two conflicting interpretations are not equally plausible,so long as both are reasonable in light of the evidence.
nor does the absence of language providing that this agreement was subject to further negotiatio
