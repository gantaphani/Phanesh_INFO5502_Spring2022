at stake in this case is the enforceability of a gold clause contained in a lease agreement.
in,salmon and samuel halle leased a parcel of land in downtown cleveland from its owner,realty investment corporation.the term of the lease was years through march,and the halle brothers and their successors in interest retained the option of renewing the lease for another,or years through as late as march.the lease agreement fixed the annual rent at for the first two years,then increased the rent in periodic intervals until it reached in the eleventh year,where it remained until the end of the lease.the lease also contained a gold clause,which provided that a ll of said rents shall be paid in gold coin of the united states of the present standard of weight and fineness.ja.at that time and up through the depression,such clauses commonly appeared in leases as a sort of mechanism to protect a lessor from the effects of inflation.trostel am.life cas.ins,cir trostel i,vacated on other grounds,d,reinstated by cir trostel ii.
in the early,as part of a series of measures designed to implement the roosevelt administration overhaul of american monetary policy,congress withdrew gold from circulation and banned nearly all private ownership of it.see id.at see also kenneth dam,from the gold clause cases to the gold commission a half century of american monetary law,chi.and in,congress passed a joint resolution that declared gold clauses to be against public policy,barred their inclusion in any future contract and suspended the operation of existing gold clauses by allowing all contract obligations to be paid in paper currency instead.see joint resolution of june,stat,originally codified at,recodified as amended at d providing that no gold clause shall be contained in or made with respect to any obligation hereafter incurred and that e very obligation,heretofore or hereafter incurred,whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto,shall be discharged upon payment,dollar for dollar,in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
four decades later,congress changed course.it repealed the ban on private ownership of gold in.and in,it amended the joint resolution,providing that the resolution shall not apply to obligations issued on or after the amendment date of enactment.act of,c,stat,originally codified at note,recodified as amended at d see also trostel i,at.although the amendment made clear that parties could include gold clauses in contracts formed after,congress choice of words authorizing obligations issued after the amendment generated a small stream of litigation regarding the amendment effect on gold clauses contained in contracts made prior to but transferred after that date.see,trostel i,grand partners,goodan,d,aff,cir fay bat holdings i,aff sub nom.fay frederick nelson seattle,cir per curiam nebel,bank of chicago,d,wells fargo bank,bank of am.nt sa,th,d.
in an effort to clarify the matter,congress passed a law in saying that owners could enforce gold clauses only if the parties to a new obligation issued after specifically agree d to include a gold clause in their new agreement.economic growth and regulatory act of,stat.just over a year later,however,congress repealed the statute.see treasury and general government appropriations act of,stat.
so far as the record is concerned,the gold clause in this contract never attracted anyone attention or at least never generated any disputes during the first years of its existence.since,when the current lessee,s r playhouse realty,assumed the lease,it has paid annual rent of in american currency.and there is no indication in the record that either the original lessees,the halle brothers or the other lessees prior to s r paid more than in the preceding years.nor is there any indication that the previous owners ever demanded more than.
that changed in,when the current owner,jamaica avenue,purchased the land for,then sought to enforce the gold clause,demanding rent equivalent to the value of gold dollar coins.the current lessee,s r,balked at the prospect of paying several multiples of what it had been paying,prompting jamaica avenue to file this action in federal court premised on diversity jurisdiction.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court ruled for the lessee,refusing to enforce the clause.
the parties share considerable common ground about how to resolve this dispute.they agree that the question at hand is whether the gold clause constitutes an obligation issued after october.act of,c,stat.at.they agree or at least do not seriously dispute that a gold clause may be an obligation issued after either because it is part of a contract written and signed after that date or because it is part of an earlier contract incorporated into a new contract formed after that date.they agree that the previous owner assigned the underlying lease to the current lessee in.they agree or at least do not seriously dispute that an assignment under state law by itself ordinarily would not suffice to make the gold clause enforceable.and they agree that an assignment combined with a novation,which substitutes a new agreement for a prior one and releases the obligations of the prior lessee,would suffice to satisfy the requirement.what the case boils down to,then,is whether the transfer of the lessee interest to s r amounted to a novation.
under ohio law,a contract of novation is created where a previous valid obligation is extinguished by a new valid contract,accomplished by substitution of parties or of the undertaking,with the consent of all the parties,and based on valid consideration.chicago title ins.magnuson,cir internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original see also lexford prop,llc lexford prop,ohio app d.the party invoking a novation here,the current owner,jamaica bears the burden of establishing its existence.see chicago title,at.
neither party disputes that the assignment amounted to a valid new contract supported by adequate consideration.what divides them is whether the owner at that time agreed to release the prior lessee halle.from its obligations under the lease and to substitute the new lessee s r in its place.under ohio law,the parties consent to a novation need not be express,see mcglothin huffman,ohio app d,but may be implicit from the circumstances or a party conduct,id.
the key piece to the puzzle,it seems to us,is that the underlying lease agreement lays out the rules by which the owner agrees in advance to permit the substitution of a new lessee under the contract for the old central benchmark of a novation.see hunter bps guard,ohio app d,miller,wl,at ohio.july,restatement second of contracts cmt.d.under the agreement,the lessee may assign or transfer the lease in one of two ways either by obtaining the owner written consent or by satisfying four conditions paying all rents and charges then due and satisfying all other relevant promises under the lease establishing that the new lessee has expressly assume d the lessee engagements under the lease recording the instrument of assignment in the appropriate recorder office and plac ing in the hands of the lessor for inspection during a period of ten days a legal and sufficient instrument of assignment and acceptance.ja.if the existing lessee satisfies one of these two routes for assigning the lease,the underlying agreement not only allows the assignment,but it also expressly releases the prior lessee from its obligations.a ll personal liability of the lessees upon this lease and for the performance of the covenants herein contained,it says,shall cease and determine upon an assignment hereof.id.a permitted assignment,the contract makes clear,also operates as a permitted novation.
no doubt,an assignment under ohio law by itself normally would not establish that a novation occurred.a lessee might sublet a property and still remain obligated under the original lease,acting in effect as a surety or guarantor of the underlying lease obligations.see house of larose cleveland,lakeshore power boats,wl,at ohio.june.that is not a novation.but here we have a l
