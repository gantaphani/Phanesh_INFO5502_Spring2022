appellants thomas and danielle francis the francises or appellants appeal an order of the district court granting summary judgment to appellee allstate insurance company allstate.in march,appellants brought this action in maryland state court seeking a declaration as to allstate duty under a renters insurance policy to defend and indemnify the francises in a tort suit brought against them,and others,in the circuit court for frederick county,maryland.meanwhile,in the tort suit,the state court entered a final judgment in favor of all defendants including the francises on april.thereafter,allstate filed a notice of removal,and this action was removed to the united states district court for the district of maryland on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.
after the district court denied appellants first motion to remand,allstate filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the francises renters insurance policy,issued in california,did not provide coverage for the claims asserted in the underlying tort action.in response,appellants moved a second time to remand,now on the ground that as they sought only the costs of their defense of the tort suit,rather than any potential indemnity the amount in controversy did not exceed the jurisdictional threshold,and thus the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.appellants also opposed allstate motion for summary judgment on the merits.
on april,the district court denied the second motion to remand and granted allstate motion for summary judgment,concluding that allstate did not have a duty to defend.francis allstate ins,d.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in march,danielle francis,a california resident,and her minor son thomas were sued by troy towers in the circuit court for frederick county,maryland the underlying action.towers worked as a resident aide at the maryland school for the deaf msd,which thomas francis attended the complaint in the underlying action asserted claims of defamation,invasion of light,malicious prosecution,civil conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the complaint alleged that thomas francis,with the assistance of his parents,made false statements about towers,claiming he had sexually abused and assaulted thomas francis and other students at msd.it further averred that the francises knowingly made the false and defamatory statements about towers,or in the alternative,that they negligently made them.criminal charges had been filed against towers based in part on the alleged statements but were later dismissed towers alleged that the statements injured his reputation in the community and at msd,that as a result of the statements he suffered mental anguish and humiliation,and that he had been temporarily suspended without pay from his employment.
appellants did not and do not deny making the alleged statements,but contend that francis made them for the sole purpose of protecting her son and without intent to slander towers or invade his privacy.appellants br.additionally,they argue that thomas francis made the statements to school officials,and later to police,solely for his own protection and not to defame or otherwise harm towers.id.at.
at the time of the allegedly defamatory statements,the francises were insured under a california renters policy the policy issued by allstate.the policy covered danielle francis residence in santa clara,california,and was mailed to her at that residence.the policy provided,in relevant part

the francises initiated this action in the circuit court for frederick county,maryland,contending that allstate had a duty to defend them,under the policy,against towers suit.the complaint for declaratory judgment asserted that,in addition to towers contentions,towers sustained bodily injury as a result of the francises alleged acts impotency.at the time the declaratory judgment action was filed,the francises by their privately retained counsel had already filed a motion for summary judgment in the underlying action.that motion was granted on march,and final judgment in favor of all defendants was entered april.at the conclusion of the underlying action,the francises had expended in attorney fees and costs for their defense.
on april,allstate timely removed the declaratory judgment action to the united states district court for the district of maryland on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the francises filed a timely motion to remand the case to state court on may,contending that the removal was untimely because the time limit for removal had expired.the district court found the removal timely and denied the motion to remand.
allstate filed a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action on october,asserting that it had no duty to defend the francises because,under california law,the statements made about towers did not constitute an accident,and therefore claims arising from them were not covered by the policy the francises filed a second motion to remand the case,which challenged the district court subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the threshold had not been met,and they also substantively challenged allstate denial of coverage of the underlying action.
on april,the district court denied the francises second motion for remand and granted allstate motion for summary judgment.this timely appeal followed.

appellants first contend the district court erred in rejecting their jurisdictional challenge because the requirement was not met.the removal of a civil case from state to federal court is governed by.that statute provides 
a generally.a defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action from a state court shall file in the district court of the united states for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal signed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,together with a copy of all process,pleadings,and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.

here,when allstate filed its notice of removal,according to the state court complaint,the object of the litigation was the francises request that allstate defend indemnify them in the underlying action for defamation and related torts.despite the fact that by the time allstate removed the case to federal court,indemnity was no longer at issue,the relief requested in the declaratory judgment complaint specifically included the costs and expenses to be incurred in the declaratory judgment action as well as defense costs in the underlying action.nevertheless,appellants now contend that the only amount that ought to be considered in ascertaining whether the amount in controversy exceeds is the total of the attorney fees incurred in defending against the underlying action.they contend that the costs of pursuing this declaratory judgment action are not a part of the amount of controversy calculation as they are not recoverable by statute or contract provision,and even if they were,a fact finding hearing would need to be conducted,to determine if the costs would exceed the gap between the defense costs for the underlying action and the threshold.appellants br.in other words,appellants argue with insight flowing from hindsight that the sole object of this litigation was the expended by the francises to defend against the underlying action.allstate asserts,to the contrary,that the value of the attorney fees likely to be incurred throughout the declaratory judgment action should also be included in the calculation.
generally,attorney fees are not included in the calculation,but courts have created two exceptions to this rule if the fees are provided for by contract or if a statute mandates or allows payment of attorney fees.moore federal practice,civil a.
appellants brought their declaratory judgment action under the maryland uniform declaratory judgment act with regard to the availability of attorney fees in a declaratory judgment action,the maryland court of appeals has held 
a n insurer is liable for the damages,including attorneys fees,incurred by an insured as a result of the insurer breach of its contractual obligation to defend the insured against a claim potentially within the policy coverage,and this is so whether the attorneys fees are incurred in defending against the underlying damage claim or in a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage and a duty to defend.

the district court reviewed the above authorities bearing on the maryland courts position on attorney fees in declaratory judgment suits and concluded that w hen maryland law permits recovery of attorneys fees,p otential attorneys fees should be considered in determining whether the amount in controversy in a diversity action exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.francis,d at citing gilman wheat,first,finding that a claim for relief under the maryland securities act authorizes recovery of attorney fees in certain situations,and concluding that potential attorney fees should be considered in the determination.after considering the expended in the underlying action,the district court concluded that e xperience and common sense suggest that the plaintiffs attorneys fees in the declaratory judgment case will exceed the difference between and the the plaintiffs spent in towers lawsuit.francis,d at.we agree.
we also agree with the district court that,as maryland case law allows for the recovery of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions,the attorney fees in the francises action are properly considered in the calculation here.as the complaint in this action did not seek a specific amount in damages,allstate need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum.de aguilar,at.
as the district court noted,t his action involves federal jurisdiction,contract interpretation,and choice of law issues that were not addressed in the underlying tort action.francis,d at.the complexity of the case is sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that the attorney fees likely to be incurred by appellants in this declaratory judgment action,when coupled with the amount they expended to defend the tort action,will exceed the jurisdictional threshold.thus,the district court did not err in its rejection of the appellants jurisdictional challenge 
appellants challenge to the merits of the district court coverage determination rests primarily on their contention that maryland law,rather than california law,applies to the issue of contract interpretation we reject that contention and affirm the district court application of california law for the reasons set forth within.
a federal court sitting in diversity is required to apply the substantive law of the forum state,including its rules.klaxon stentor.erie tompkins.maryland courts have long recognized the ability of contracting parties to specify in their contract that the laws of a particular state will apply in any dispute over the validity,construction,or enforceability of the contract.jackson pasadena receivables.such provisions trump the conflict of law rules that otherwise would be applied by the court.id.
the policy provision called for the application of california law,unless a covered occurrence took place outside of california,in which case 
claims or disputes regarding that covered loss to property,or any other covered occurrence may be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which that covered loss to property,or other covered occurrence happened,only if the laws of that jurisdiction would apply in the absence of a contractual choice of law provision such as this.
