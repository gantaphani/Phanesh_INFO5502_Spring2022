hempstead video,hv appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york thomas boyle,in favor of the defendant,the incorporated village of valley stream,and related officials and entities collectively valley stream or the village.the magistrate judge ruled that hv breached its settlement agreement with valley stream,and that valley stream was therefore released from its obligations of forbearance under the agreement.the judge also denied hv motion to disqualify valley stream counsel.we affirm.
background 
hv,a corporation owned by james alessandria,operates an adult video store in the village of valley stream.shortly after the store opened in,hv became involved in a permit and zoning dispute with the village.hv filed suit under in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,alleging principally that valley stream was selectively enforcing its mercantile permit requirement in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the parties reached a settlement agreement on april,which was by magistrate judge boyle.pursuant to the agreement,valley stream agreed to issue a mercantile permit and to treat hv in a manner substantially similar to other businesses.valley stream also agreed not to prosecute hv under its adult use ordinance,local law,as long as hv complied with the terms of the settlement agreement.hv agreed,among other things,to cover its windows so the interior of the store could not be viewed from the outside,to mark its store with only two signs reading adult store or adult shop,and to refrain from any form of outdoor advertising.the portion of the settlement agreement that is crucial to this dispute states 
hv may continue to operate its business at its present location within the village,provided that its business operation remains substantially the same as its current business operations.it is specifically understood that hv shall not have enclosed viewing rooms,live peep shows or live performances or similar type activities at the premises.
emphasis added.the agreement goes on to provide that if one party believes the other is in breach,the complaining party is required to give the other party notice of the alleged violation,and it allows twenty days from receipt of the notice within which to cure such violation or seek appropriate relief from the court.
i.the present dispute 
in january,valley stream received an anonymous tip that hv had installed several booths for viewing pornographic videos.an inspection revealed six booths,each closed by a door which could be locked from the inside.each booth contained a video monitor to display pornographic videos.each was also equipped with a paper towel dispenser on the outside.the booths were approximately inches wide,forty inches deep,and ninety to inches high.the walls of the booths did not go all the way to the ceiling,but rather stopped approximately eighteen inches below the ceiling.with the doors closed,one could not see into the booths.
valley stream informed hv by a letter dated january,that it considered hv in breach of the settlement agreement prohibition on enclosed viewing rooms.the letter stated 
pursuant to paragraph of the aforementioned settlement and order,the village hereby gives you written notice that you are in violation of paragraph of said settlement and order and have twenty days from receipt of this notice to cure such violation or seek appropriate relief from the court.
the letter demanded that hv permanently remove the booths.
the parties thereafter engaged in sporadic negotiations.hv suggested fitting the booths with dutch doors or with curtains.the village rejected the proposals,expressing the view that any barrier providing privacy and thus facilitating sex or masturbation on the premises would violate the agreement.
after nearly four months passed without resolution,valley stream wrote to the magistrate judge requesting a conference.at the conference,valley stream argued that by virtue of its breach of the settlement agreement,hv had forfeited its rights under the agreement,leaving valley stream free to prosecute under its adult use ordinance.the magistrate judge adjourned the proceeding,instructing valley stream to submit an order to show cause.that afternoon,hv removed the doors from the booths.
the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing on august,at which several witnesses testified,including elena winter,the former president and manager of hv,who testified for the village.the magistrate judge then took the case under advisement.
ii.the motion to disqualify valley stream counsel 
on november,while the case was still under consideration by the magistrate judge,hv moved to disqualify the village attorney,stanley camhi,and his firm of jaspan schlesinger hoffmann,llp jaspan.hv based its motion primarily on the fact that its counsel for labor matters,william englander,had become of counsel to the jaspan firm in july.hv also contended the jaspan firm should be disqualified because one of jaspan lawyers,jon santemma,had a telephone conversation with alessandria,the owner of hv,about a condemnation proceeding in a neighboring town.
englander connection with the jaspan firm had come about as follows.prior to july,englander was a solo practitioner,renting office space from the jaspan firm.he had periodically represented alessandria and his businesses on labor matters for more than twenty years.in april,he began assisting hv present counsel in defending against a complaint elena winter had filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that she was fired on account of her pregnancy.
englander,who was in his,decided to and work fewer hours.he proposed to turn the representation of several of his clients,particularly a local school district,over to the jaspan firm.he agreed to become of counsel to jaspan effective july,i n order to effect an orderly transition of those matters.as for the englander clients not being transferred to jaspan,which included alessandria and hv,englander continued to represent them in his individual capacity.jaspan had no access to those clients files.
at the time jaspan called winter as a witness against hv in this case,jaspan was unaware of englander representation of hv in the eeoc proceedings initiated by winter,and englander was unaware of jaspan representation of valley stream in this proceeding against hv.there had been no communication between englander and the jaspan lawyers about either case.
the potential conflict came to light on september,when englander,in connection with winter eeoc proceeding against hv,sent a letter to the eeoc written on jaspan letterhead and faxed a copy to his in that matter,who also represents hv in this suit.englander asserted in his affidavit that his use of the jaspan letterhead for that letter was an inadvertent error as jaspan had no involvement in the matter.in a separate incident additionally cited by hv to support its disqualification motion,a woman,who identified herself as being from the jaspan firm,later telephoned alessandria to ask for his fax number on englander behalf.
the alleged conflict involving jon santemma arose as follows.santemma,who specializes in tax certiorari and condemnation proceedings,joined the jaspan partnership in june.calls made to his number at his prior firm were automatically transferred to his phone at jaspan.alessandria phoned santemma in july,seeking advice about a condemnation proceeding being initiated by another town against another of alessandria stores alessandria and santemma spoke for approximately ten minutes.santemma was not retained and never opened a file on the matter.there is no suggestion in the record that hv owned or operated the business which was the subject of the condemnation proceeding or had any connection with that business beyond the fact that the owner of its stock also owned the other business.
iii.the magistrate judge decisions 
the magistrate judge granted valley stream motion for a declaratory judgment on january.he rejected hv contention that the booths were not rooms,as prohibited by the settlement agreement,as well as its argument that the booths were not enclosed because of the gap between the tops of the walls of the booths and the ceiling.the magistrate judge found as well that hv failure to remedy its breach or seek relief from the court within twenty days of its receipt of notice released valley stream from its promise not to enforce local law against hv.he rejected hv argument that valley stream was estopped from seeking release from its obligations by virtue of its participation in negotiations with hv between january and june.
the magistrate judge also denied hv motion to disqualify the jaspan firm.he concluded that englander had represented hv in his capacity as a solo practitioner and was affiliated only loosely with jaspan in a manner too attenuated to merit imputation of the conflict of interest.he also concluded that the brief phone conversation between alessandria and santemma,which did not result in the retention of santemma,was similarly insufficient to support disqualification.
hv brought this appeal.
discussion 
e nclosed viewing rooms 
hv contends that its installation of six booths with doors that locked from the inside for viewing pornographic videos did not violate the settlement agreement prohibition of enclosed viewing rooms.the argument relies on the purported distinction between a booth and a room,and the contention that,by virtue of the space between the top of the booths and the ceiling,the booths were not enclosed.we find these highly formalistic arguments unpersuasive.they depend on distinctions which do not conform to the apparent meaning of the settlement agreement.
hv asserted distinction between booths and rooms is not supported even by dictionary definitions.among the definitions of room found in webster third new international dictionary is a part of the inside of a building,shelter,or dwelling,usu ally set off by a partition.webster third new international dictionary definition.this definition covers the booths installed by hv.
we also reject hv argument that the gaps at the tops of the walls rendered the rooms not enclosed.it seems clear that the prohibition of enclosed rooms was designed to ensure that patrons would not have access to private areas sheltered from the sight of others to indulge in sex acts,whether in solitude or with a partner the booths permitted exactly that.we can see no reason to consider them beyond the scope of the prohibition.of course,resort to the most stringent definition of enclosed would exclude even an airhole.it is quite clear the agreement did not use the word in so narrow and restrictive a sense as to exclude booths enclosed on all four sides,merely because they left an gap above eye level at the tops of the walls.hv has submitted no evidence to support such a strained,unnatural interpretation of the agreement.
even if we found merit in hv purported distinctions between its booths and the enclosed viewing rooms prohibited by the agreement,it would not affect our judgment.the settlement agreement permitted hv to continue to operate its business only on the condition that its business operation remains substantially the same as its current business operations.regardless of whether the booths with video viewing equipment fall within the prohibition of enclosed viewing rooms,there can be no doubt that the introduction of viewing booths represented a substantial change in the way hv conducted its business operations and therefore a violation of the settlement agreement.
the settlement agreement gives a party receiving notice of a potential breach twenty days from receipt of the notice within which to cure the violation or seek appropriate relief from the court.hv contends that valley stream participation in settlement negotiations led it to believe that the deadline for remedying its breach or seeking judicial relief had been suspended valley stream,however,took no affirmative steps,as far as the record discloses,to foster this belief.valley stream initially warned hv about the deadline and never told hv that it considered the deadline suspended.it was hv that initiated the settlement negotiations,and the negotiations consisted largely of hv making proposals,which valley stream rejected.hv has pointed to nothing in valley stream repeated negative responses to its proposals that would have reasonably induced hv to conclude that it need not comply with the deadline.under the terms of the agreement,therefore,valley stream is released from its contractual obligation not to enforce its adult use ordinance.
ii.the disqualification motion 
the authority of federal courts to disqualify attorneys derives from their inherent power to preserve the integrity of the adversary process.bd.of educ.nyquist,cir.in exercising this power,we have attempted to balance a client right freely to choose his counsel against the need to maintain the highest standards of the profession.gov t of india cook,cir see also emle,patentex,cir.although our decisions on disqualification motions often benefit from guidance offered by the american bar association aba and state disciplinary rules,see,fund of funds,arthur andersen,cir silver chrysler plymouth,chrysler motors,cir,such rules merely provide general guidance and not every violation of a disciplinary rule will necessarily lead to disqualification,see nyquist,at disqualification is only warranted where an attorney conduct tends to taint the underlying trial,because other ethical violations can be left to federal and state disciplinary mechanisms internal quotation marks omitted.
one recognized form of taint arises when an attorney places himself in a position where he could use a client privileged information against that client.the standard for disqualification varies depending on whether the representation is concurrent or successive.in cases of concurrent representation,we have ruled it is prima facie improper for an attorney to simultaneously represent a client and another party with interests directly adverse to that client.cinema,cinerama,cir.the attorney must be prepared to show,at the very least,that there will be no actual or apparent conflict in loyalties or diminution in the vigor of his representation.id.in cases of successive representation,we have held that an attorney may be disqualified if 
the moving party is a former client of the adverse party counsel 
there is a substantial relationship between the subject matter of the counsel prior representation of the moving party and the issues in the present lawsuit and 
the attorney whose disqualification is sought had access to,or was likely to have had access to,relevant privileged information in the course of his prior representation of the client.
evans artek,cir.
an attorney conflicts are ordinarily imputed to his firm based on the presumption that associated attorneys share client confidences.for example,new york disciplinary rule states while lawyers are associated in a law firm,none of them shall knowingly accept or continue employment when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so under specific ethics rules,including those governing conflicts arising from concurrent and successive representations.comp.codes regs.tit,d disciplinary rule.as discussed below,however,attorneys with limited links to a firm are not always considered to be associated with the firm for purposes of conflict imputation.
although some courts have treated the presumption that confidences are shared within a firm as irrebuttable,see,in re american airlines,cir,there is a strong trend,which we join,toward allowing the presumption of confidence sharing within a firm to be rebutted,united states ex rel.lord titan pac.constr,citing cases see also,manning waring,cox,james,sklar allen,cir novo terapeutisk laboratorium baxter travenol,cir en banc roberts schaefer,recognizing trend but criticizing it kassis teacher ins.annuity ass n,solow grace.
prior to july,englander operated an entirely independent law firm,which leased space from jaspan.he maintained separate files for his clients and there is no reason to believe he shared client confidences with jaspan.jaspan would not have been disqualified during this period by reason of englander representation of the adversary of one of its clients.
in july,the relationship between englander and jaspan changed,but only to a limited degree.englander was given the title of counsel and began to share a limited number of clients with jaspan.in all other respects,englander continued to operate a separate firm in the same manner he had before acquiring the new title.the question is whether this relationship requires disqualification of the jaspan firm in this case.
the case before us does not fit easily within the existing framework for analyzing conflict imputation from an attorney to his firm.the first step in that framework is to determine whether an attorney is associated with the firm.if he is,a rebuttable presumption arises that the attorney and the firm share client confidences,and the court then proceeds to the second step,which involves determining whether that presumption has been rebutted.if the attorney is not associated with the firm,no presumption of confidence sharing arises,and,in the absence of other evidence demonstrating taint of the proceedings,the firm will not be disqualified.this framework functions most smoothly in cases where the relationship between the attorney and the firm is clear.
it is not altogether clear whether englander should be deemed,for purposes of this binary rule,to be associated or not associated with the jaspan firm.the magistrate judge placed englander in the latter category,holding that his relationship with jaspan was sufficiently limited that conflicts arising from his private representation of hv should not be imputed to the firm.in reaching this conclusion,however,the magistrate judge emphasized that the jaspan firm has been effectively screened from any knowledge that englander may have regarding plaintiff and the danger of any unintentional transmission of client confidences is rather minuscule.the magistrate judge thus blended the first step in the traditional framework whether the attorney is associated with the firm with the second whether the presumption of shared confidences has been rebutted.on the facts of this case,we find no error.
whether an attorney is associated with a firm for purposes of conflict imputation depends in part on the existence and extent of screening between the attorney and the firm.see new york state bar ass comm.on prof l ethics,w e believe screens should be accepted as a means of ensuring that part time lawyers are not deemed to be associated with a law firm.an of counsel attorney,who handles matters independent of his firm and scrupulously maintains files for his private clients separate from the files of the firm,is less likely to be considered associated with the firm with respect to those clients than another attorney in the same position whose client files are not effectively segregated from those of the firm.similarly,whether the screening between an attorney and his firm is considered adequate to rebut the presumption of shared confidences depends in part on the closeness and extent of the relationship between the attorney and the firm.
with these considerations in mind,we examine englander situation under both the first and second steps of the traditional framework,cognizant of the interrelationship between the two in the case before us.
imputation of the conflicts of an of counsel attorney to a firm 
englander,of course,could not have represented valley stream against hv while simultaneously representing hv before the eeoc,see comp.codes regs.tit,a,in the absence of client consent,see id.c.but englander did not represent valley stream against hv.valley stream was represented by the jaspan firm,with which englander had an of counsel relationship.we must consider whether englander potential conflict should be attributed to jaspan by reason of his of counsel relationship.
at least two federal courts have adopted a per se rule imputing conflicts between all of counsel attorneys and their firms.see roberts schaefer.at interpreting a rule governing lawyers associated in a firm see also atasi seagate,interpreting a rule governing a partner,or associate,or any other lawyer affiliated with him or his firm.ethics opinions issued by the new york state bar association and the aba have also recommended imputing conflicts from of counsel attorneys to their firms.see new york state bar ass comm.on prof l ethics,i f a lawyer acting alone would be disqualified from a particular representation based on any of the rules enumerated in dr d,then that disqualification is imputed to a law firm with which that lawyer has an of counsel relationship.aba comm.on ethics and prof l responsibility,formal there can be no doubt that an of counsel lawyer or firm is associated in and has an association with the firm or firms to which the lawyer is of counsel,for purposes of the general imputation of disqualification.but see new york state bar ass comm.on prof l ethics,where an attorney is considered a contract lawyer rather than of counsel,imputation of conflicts depends upon whether the relationship of the contract lawyer to each employing law firm rises to the level of an association with the firm,which depends on the facts and circumstances of the employment.
a per se rule has the virtue of clarity,but in achieving clarity,it ignores the caution that w hen dealing with ethical principles,we can not paint with broad strokes.the lines are fine and must be so marked.silver chrysler,at quoting united states standard oil.given the wide variation in the nature and substance of relationships lumped together under the title of counsel,a per se approach is to respect appropriately both the individual right to be represented by counsel of his or her choice and the public interest in maintaining the highest standards of professional conduct.hull celanese,cir.it also risks elevating the label assigned to a relationship over the substance of that relationship.see fund of funds,at w e have never believed that labels,clerk,control our decisions in so sensitive an area.
we believe the better approach for deciding whether to impute an of counsel attorney conflict to his firm for purposes of ordering disqualification in a suit in federal court is to examine the substance of the relationship under review and the procedures in place.the closer and broader the affiliation of an of counsel attorney with the firm,and the greater the likelihood that operating procedures adopted may permit one to become privy,whether intentionally or unintentionally,to the pertinent client confidences of the other,the more appropriate will be a rebuttable imputation of the conflict of one to the other.conversely,the more narrowly limited the relationship between the of counsel attorney and the firm,and the more secure and effective the isolation of nonshared matters,the less appropriate imputation will be.imputation is not always necessary to preserve high standards of professional conduct.furthermore,imputation might well interfere with a party entitlement to choose counsel and create opportunities for abusive disqualification motions.
several district courts have followed this functional approach to disqualification motions involving of counsel attorneys,as did the magistrate judge in this case.in renz beeman,wl,dist.lexis,the court declined to impute an of counsel attorney conflict to his firm where the attorney worked outside the firm as counsel to a company became of counsel for the sole purpose of obtaining the firm assistance in representing his few remaining private clients accepted no assignments from the firm dealt with a single contact person at the firm shared a secretary and visited the firm only once every week or two.in regal marketing sonny son produce,civ,wl,dist.lexis,the court declined to impute a firm conflict to an of counsel attorney where the attorney leased space on the same floor as the firm and occasionally collaborated with the firm or used one of the firm secretaries to expedite a task conducted most of his work separately maintained separate professional liability insurance and maintained separate phone,fax,and billing systems.in gray memorial medical c
