the issues to be determined in such an action are whether the franchisor notice of termination was issued with due cause and in good faith.the burden of proof shall be upon the franchisor to prove that due cause and good faith exist.the franchisor shall also have the burden of proving that all portions of its current or proposed sales and service requirements for the protesting franchised new motor vehicle dealer are reasonable.
the determination of due cause shall be that there exists a material breach by a new motor vehicle dealer of a reasonable and necessary provision of a franchise if the breach is not cured within a reasonable time after written notice of the breach has been received from the manufacturer or distributor.
