this is an appeal from the district court decision confirming and enforcing,in part,and remanding,in part,a labor arbitration award.because the arbitration award in this case does not present circumstances that warrant vacating the award under section of the federal arbitration act or section of the labor management relations act,we affirm the district court decision to confirm and enforce the arbitration award.the district court also remanded the arbitration award to the arbitrator for further clarification of whether the make whole with award should be offset by interim income.because the company failed to timely present the offsets issue to the arbitrator for review,we hold that the arbitration award was unambiguous and therefore,reverse the district court order remanding the issue for clarification.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
troy guidry guidry,a member of the international chemical workers union council,local of the united food and commercial workers,union,was employed by the international chemicals company company as a bead operator at the company north bend plant.guidry worked at the company for approximately two and one half years before he was discharged.on november,guidry was caught sleeping during working hours by his supervisor,timothy tyler tyler.the next day guidry was discharged by charles ardoin ardoin,the general manager of the plant.guidry filed a grievance with the company claiming that he was wrongly terminated.consistent with the collective bargaining agreement agreement or cba between the company and guidry representative,the union,the dispute was presented for arbitration.
the union and the company selected arbitrator barry baroni to preside over the arbitration.the issue to be arbitrated was whether proper cause existed for guidry discharge and if not,what is the appropriate remedy.on april,after a hearing,the arbitrator found that guidry was sleeping on the job on november,but that the company discipline scheme was inappropriate for the nature of the offense.thus,the arbitrator concluded that proper cause did not exist for the discharge.the arbitrator fashioned the following remedy 
it is,hereby,ordered that the discharge be reduced to a day suspension and grievant be reinstated to his former position with the company,and be made whole with back pay,benefits,seniority.grievant records are to be expunged of all references to the discharge,and appropriate entry of the suspension be noted.
grievant is,hereby,admonished that he is now under formal progressive discipline and any further sleeping violations will result in further discipline,including discharge.
it is disputed whether the company reinstated guidry on may,nonetheless,he appeared at the plant on that date where he was again suspended for unrelated reasons.he was later terminated on may.additionally,correspondence between the parties reveals that guidry was paid for his employment and vacation between may and his termination on may.on may,the company requested information from guidry about his interim employment and financial gains in order to calculate the award ordered by the arbitrator.the core issue in the dispute over the award is whether the company can legitimately request this information after the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.
the union and guidry filed a motion and application to have the arbitration award enforced in part and vacated or modified in part in district court.applying the deferential standard of review of an arbitration award espoused in weber aircraft general warehousemen and helpers union local,cir,the district court confirmed the arbitrator award,but remanded the question of to the arbitrator for clarification.the district court found that the union motion to strike the affidavit of ardoin had merit,but ruled that it was moot because the district court reached its conclusion to confirm the arbitration award without reference to the affidavit.
the union appeals the district court opinion arguing that under section of the labor management relations act,lmra or section and the federal arbitration act,faa,the suspension and the finding that guidry was sleeping on november,should be vacated.the union also contends that guidry should be reinstated immediately with full.moreover,the union argues that the company waived its affirmative defenses to the award,and therefore,the award is not ambiguous so as to require clarification.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.hughes training cook,cir.we apply a highly deferential standard when reviewing arbitration awards.judicial review of a decision pursuant to a cba is very limited.courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties agreement.major league baseball players garvey,d.
ii.the arbitration proceedings 
the union contends that this arbitration,arising from the cba must be evaluated under both section and the faa.the district court appropriately relied only on the lmra when it confirmed the arbitration award because this case involves arbitration under a cba.the lmra applies to cbas and the faa applies to individual arbitration agreements.it is undisputed that the lmra is applicable to this case.the union further contends that the arbitrator operated outside of the scope of the cba and in violation of the lmra and the faa.we disagree with both contentions.
nevertheless,when reviewing a case involving a cba and arising under section,courts are not obligated to rely on the faa but may rely on it for guidance in reviewing an arbitration award.see united paperworkers int l union misco,d acknowledging that federal courts have often looked to the faa for guidance in labor arbitration cases,especially where section of the lmra applies bottling of new york soft drink brewery workers union local,int l brotherhood of teamsters,cir explaining that the body of law developed under section will at times draw upon provisions of the faa,but by way of guidance alone am.fed of television and radio artists,cir same.although historically,we have ruled on labor arbitration disputes involving cbas without reference to the faa,we have relied on the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements reflected in the faa.see moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d waverly mineral products united steelworkers of america,cir relying heavily on the strong presumption favoring arbitrability.regardless,we need not decide this particular issue because the union does not prevail under either the lmra or the faa.
review of an arbitration award under both the lmra and the faa remains extraordinarily narrow.see garvey,at.reviewing an arbitration award under the lmra misco,at.reviewing an arbitration award under the faa.under the faa 
a district court may vacate an award only if the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means there is evidence of partiality or corruption among the arbitrators the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct which prejudiced the rights of one of the parties or the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.an additional ground for vacating an arbitration award is that in making the award the arbitrator acted with manifest disregard for the law.
harris,at.where there is a cba which is governed by the lmra,courts have no business overruling the arbitrator because their interpretation of the contract is different from the arbitrator.united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.however,an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice.id.at.if we determine that the arbitrator has acted within the ambit of his authority as set by an arguable construction of the cba,we have no authority to reconsider the merits of the arbitration award,even if the parties argue that the award is based on factual errors or on misinterpretation of the cba.weber aircraft,at citing paperworkers misco,d.
