opinion of the court 
this appeal arises out of the claim allowance process in a chapter bankruptcy liquidation specifically,a liquidating trustee appeals an order dismissing his objections to a proof of claim.it is common practice in bankruptcy cases for to attack the validity and priority of the claims of creditors higher in the pecking order than they.two of the most common attacks are recharacterization seeking to treat an asserted debt as an equity interest and equitable subordination seeking to subordinate a claim priority because of inequitable conduct.these actions,while often asserted in tandem,are distinct.here,the trustee asserted both,but the bankruptcy and district courts ruled that he is barred from asserting them by the terms of a previous settlement that the court entered as a consent order the settlement agreement and the confirmed plan of reorganization the plan.
while we take a slightly different view of the settlement agreement than the bankruptcy and district courts,we nonetheless affirm.
facts procedural history 
the debtors are insilco technologies,and its subsidiaries insilco or the debtors,an erstwhile manufacturing enterprise and victim of a seemingly leveraged buyout lbo chad shandler is trustee of the insilco liquidating trust the trust,an entity created by insilco creditors that succeeded to all of insilco assets on confirmation of its plan.the trust exists to sell insilco assets and distribute the proceeds in accordance with the plan.as the successor of both insilco and the official committee of unsecured creditors the creditors committee,the trust may assert either entity causes of action.
the term c lenders are a group of limited partnerships managed by dlj merchant banking partners ii dlj thus,the term c lenders are known interchangeably as the dlj group.in,the dlj group gained control of insilco through an lbo.according to the trustee,the buyout was too leveraged it,in conjunction with an overly aggressive program of buying and selling subsidiaries,rendered insilco unable to service the debt it incurred.by,insilco was in serious financial distress,and the dlj group loaned the company an unsecured million.known as the term c loans,these debts were added to insilco omnibus credit facility with the consent of its secured lenders.
despite the loans,insilco financial situation continued to deteriorate.in december,it petitioned for chapter relief.only three months later,the creditors committee moved for the appointment of a trustee the parties resolved that motion through the settlement agreement,in which the secured creditors agreed to contribute money to the trust for payment of the unsecured creditors claims in return for a full release from the unsecured creditors challenges to their claims.in addition,by agreeing to the creation of a liquidating trust controlled by the creditors,the debtors management then acting as debtors in possession effectively agreed to cede control over the bankruptcy estate.
following approval of the settlement agreement,insilco filed the plan.it divides insilco creditors into seven classes and provides for the distribution of proceeds from the sale of insilco assets to each class.the plan impaired the claims of four classes of creditors general unsecured creditors,senior discount noteholders,senior subordinated noteholders,and the term c lenders.all four classes of impaired creditors voted to approve the plan,and the bankruptcy court confirmed it over the deemed rejection of the equity holders.
in order to recover against a bankruptcy estate,creditors typically must file proofs of claims see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick,d.similarly,equity holders file proofs of interests.see distinguishing between claims and interests.the term c lenders filed proofs of claims for a total of in principal and interest due under the term c loans.the trustee timely filed an objection to those claims,arguing that they should be recharacterized as equity investments and,if not,they should be subordinated to all other claims.the bankruptcy and district courts ruled that section of the settlement agreement precluded the trustee from bringing both actions,and he now appeals to us 
ii.discussion 
a.the settlement agreement and plan 
this dispute centers on the meaning of two sections of the settlement agreement.its essential bargain is the unsecured creditors agreement not to seek the appointment of a trustee to administer the estate or to challenge the validity,perfection,or priority of the secured creditors claims in return for the secured creditors agreement to remit some of their recovery to the unsecured creditors and to waive any rights to pursue deficiency claims.the term c lenders did not participate in the settlement agreement as such though their interests likely were represented by insilco,as it was still controlled by the dlj group at that time.
in section of the settlement agreement,the debtors and unsecured creditors agreed that t he senior lenders claims against the debtors are fully and finally allowed in the amount of.footnote of the settlement agreement stipulates that the term c lenders are included as senior lenders for purposes of section.hence,it was agreed that the term c lenders could assert allowable claims against the estate.in the bankruptcy code,claim is a term of art.it is defined as a right to payment or right to an equitable remedy.similarly,allowed is a term of art,referring to the bankruptcy court determination that a claim is valid and in line for distribution.see.the concept of an allowed claim lies at the heart of the bankruptcy process,for only those who possess allowed claims are entitled to distribution from the bankruptcy estate.in re johns,cir an allowed claim is one that will serve as the basis for distribution.
in section of the settlement agreement,the debtors and the creditors committee released the senior lenders and term c lenders from liability on a variety of actions.the releases are worded as follows 
release by the debtors and creditors debtors and the creditors committee,on behalf of themselves and the estates of the debtors the releasing estate parties,hereby fully waive,release,and forever discharge the senior lenders released lender parties from any and all manner of actions,causes of action,in law or in equity,suits,debts,liens,contracts,agreements,promises,liabilities,claims,damages,losses,controversies,trespasses,remedies,defenses,surcharges,costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever,known or unknown,fixed or contingent,which the releasing estate parties have had,now have,or may hereafter have against the released lender parties,by reason of any matter,cause or thing whatsoever,from the beginning of time through and to the settlement effective date provided however,that nothing in this paragraph releases any parties obligations or agreements pursuant to this settlement agreement,or bars claims directed solely at enforcing the provisions of this settlement agreement.
limitation on release of term c releases and waivers contained in paragraph of this settlement agreement for the benefit of the released lender parties shall also apply to the term c lenders only in respect of the term c loans under the credit agreement as defined therein and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,the term c lenders shall not otherwise be released or deemed released.nothing contained herein shall be deemed to discharge,impair,or otherwise affect any claim,action,cause of action or right against the term c lenders except as specifically set forth in the preceding sentence,provided however,that the reservation of claims,causes of action or rights in this paragraph shall not extend to the released lender parties.
boiled down,the debtors and creditors committee released the senior lenders from all manner of actions,while they released the term c lenders only from actions in respect of the term c loans.
on the surface,the in respect of language in section seems to preclude any objection to allowing and paying a claim based on the term c loans.it is puzzling,though,because the plan expressly contemplates the debtors or creditors committee filing an objection to that c
