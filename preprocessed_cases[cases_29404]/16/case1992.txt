in october,however,a sale of substantially all of the assets of bowie to the,appalachian fuels,was proposed.notice of the proposed sale and the purchase agreement was provided to the creditors of bowie,including perry.the purchase agreement was in all material respects identical to that previously proposed between bowie and jjm.included in the assets to be purchased by appalachian fuels were certain executory contracts,including the tva contract for the purchase and sale of coal.all assets were to be delivered free and clear of all liens except permitted liens pursuant to section and of the bankruptcy code the purchase agreement provides,in relevant part

b the buyer is assuming only the assumed liabilities and is not assuming any other liability or obligation of whatever nature,whether presently in existence or arising hereafter.all such liabilities and obligations shall be retained by and remain liabilities and obligations of the seller.
perry made no objection to the sale of bowie assets,and the bankruptcy court entered a final order authorizing the sale of assets,including the tva contract,free and clear of all liens,claims and encumbrances,with the exception of permitted liens.the order provides,in part 
upon the closing of the sale,buyer shall take title to and possession of the purchased assets and assumed contracts subject to the permitted liens.with the exception of the permitted liens,the transfer of title to the purchased assets and assumed contracts shall be free and clear of any and all liens,claims,interests and encumbrances,including without limitation b any demands or claims of creditors of,or claimants against,bowie 
the purchase agreement also provides that appalachian fuels will assume none of bowie debts not expressly set forth in the purchase agreement.

perry asserts that this is a simple case of contract interpretation and that the asset purchase agreement must necessarily be interpreted to find that appalachian fuels voluntarily assumed bowie liability to pay sales commissions under the agreed judgment and appalachian fuels is,therefore,indebted to perry for all commissions for sales of coal under the tva contract.perry argues that the commissions owed to perry relat e to and arise in connection with the tva contract,relying on a i of the purchase agreement approved by the bankruptcy court.
