the issue presented in this case is whether agfa corporation,the administrator of the agfa corporation severance pay plan the severance plan or plan,abused its discretion in awarding severance benefits to tom colucci.rejecting colucci claims that his severance benefits should have been calculated from his original employment date with agfa of january,agfa corporation determined that colucci employment commencement date,by which severance benefits were to be calculated,was the august date on which colucci was rehired by agfa after having voluntarily left agfa to work for the kodak corporation.
colucci commenced this action against the plan under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,challenging the plan determination to base severance benefits on the last period of his service.the district court agreed with colucci and held that the terms of the plan provided for severance benefits based on the first date that colucci ever worked for the date he returned to agfa from date.finding the plan terms unambiguous in this regard,the court concluded that the plan administrator abused its discretion by using the rehire date and reversed the plan determination.
because we find the severance plan language to be,at a minimum,ambiguous,we conclude that the district court should have deferred to the administrator interpretation because the plan gave it discretion to resolve such ambiguities.accordingly,we reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the plan.
tom colucci began his employment in the communications group for the agfa corporation in ridgefield park,new jersey,on january.as an employee not covered by a collective bargaining agreement,colucci qualified for benefits under the agfa corporation severance pay plan when that plan was established on january.the plan provided generally for severance benefits for involuntary separation,calculated on the length of an employee years of service.severance benefits were not payable,however,upon an employee voluntary resignation from agfa.
following agfa acquisition of sterling diagnostics in greenville,south carolina,colucci transferred from agfa new jersey office to greenville to become head of agfa communications for north america.colucci,however,became dissatisfied with this move,and he voluntarily resigned from agfa on may,to take a job at kodak,in charge of global communications for one of its units.because of his voluntary resignation,colucci did not then receive any severance benefits under the severance plan.about three months after having left agfa,however,colucci quit kodak and returned to work for agfa on august,as head of global communications for agfa impax product.
on april,colucci was involuntarily terminated for economic reasons.upon his departure from agfa,the severance plan awarded colucci severance benefits calculated on the period of his employment from august,when he returned to agfa from kodak,to april,when his employment was terminated.believing that his severance payments should have been calculated from his first employment date in,colucci administratively appealed the decision to the agfa corporation benefit plan administrative committee the administrative committee.he contended that because of changes in his assignment and work circumstances in greenville,south carolina,his departure to kodak and resulting break in work from agfa was involuntary.as he explained,i felt like an outsider.i was disappointed by john glass a senior executive at agfa headquarters in belgium.i felt that the former sterling diagnostics had a plan.so i left.colucci concluded in his appeal papers,the main issue for now is the severance package i received only credit for two years,when in fact i had worked for agfa for nineteen.
the administrative committee,a separate body of agfa employees whose members were appointed by agfa board of directors,met on september,together with agfa outside counsel,glenn butash,to consider colucci appeal.according to the minutes of that meeting,the administrative committee found that when colucci was rehired after working for kodak,he made no special arrangement to have his employment commencement date adjusted to january,his original employment date with agfa.the administrative committee also found that colucci had been notified that it was company policy not to adjust employment commencement dates absent such a special arrangement.therefore,the administrative committee unanimously denied colucci appeal.in its letter of september,announcing its decision to colucci,the administrative committee stated 
you voluntarily resigned from the company and then were.at the time of your first termination of employment,you were not entitled to any severance benefit because you voluntarily resigned from agfa.thereafter,when you were,you had a new employment commencement date for purposes of the plan.
disagreeing with the administrative committee decision,colucci commenced this action against the plan to recover severance benefits,as well as attorneys fees,under erisa,a b and g.the parties stipulated to the material facts and agreed that the court could dispose of the matter,based upon the stipulation without need for formal filing of motions and without need for hearing,unless the court desires.
ruling on the papers submitted by the parties,the district court issued an order dated december,concluding that the administrative committee abused its discretion in interpreting the plan contrary to its plain and unambiguous language.the court held that the plan provided benefits calculated from the first day of employment and that an employee has only one first day of employment.the court noted that no language in the plan provides that the employment commencement date becomes the rehire date if an employee returns to work for agfa after voluntarily leaving.concluding that colucci began working for agfa on january,resigned voluntarily on may,was rehired by agfa on august,and was terminated involuntarily on april,the court ordered the plan to pay colucci benefits based on an employment period beginning on january,and ending april,less the period that he worked for kodak.from the district court judgment,the plan filed this appeal.
the parties have stipulated to the severance plan terms,and they argue on appeal only about their meaning and the standard of judicial review.
section of the plan states the plan purpose to provide eligible employees with certain severance pay benefits in the event of an eligible termination of employment.section a of the plan defines an eligible termination of employment to include an employee involuntary termination of employment due to declining business conditions,and provides that a severed employee will not be eligible for any severance benefit under this plan if his or her employment with an employer terminates for one of the following reasons a voluntary resignation.
under a,an eligible employee is entitled to a full severance benefit,in the amount determined under appendix a,based upon the severed employee full years of service.under appendix a,an employee whose full years of service is less than years receives weeks of compensation,and an employee with years receives weeks of compensation.severance pay depends entirely on an employee full years of service,which the plan defines in as 
t he number of months of employment during the period beginning with an employee employment commencement date and ending on his or her employment severance date,excluding any period of time not actively employed by an employer,divided by twelve.an employee who is i not actively employed by an employer,and ii eligible to receive benefits under the employer long term disability plan will be considered actively employed for purposes of determining full years of service under this plan.
therefore,to calculate an employee full years of service,of the plan requires a seemingly simple computation after identifying an employee employment commencement and severance dates and determining the number of months between them,one must subtract the number of months that the employee was not actively employed and then divide by.the calculation,however,is dependent upon identifying the relevant dates,which the plan defines as follows 
section employment commencement date.employment commencement date means the first day on which an employee is employed by an employer.
section employment severance date.employment severance date means the date the notice period provided for in section of the plan expires with respect to a severed employee or would have expired but for the severed employee receiving pay in lieu of the applicable notice.
section provides that agfa is the administrator of the plan and that it has retained responsibility for carrying out its provisions except insofar as administrative review is conducted by the administrative committee.
applying these provisions,agfa determined that colucci full years of service equaled two years because his first day of employment was august,his most recent date of hire after returning from kodak.the district court concluded that colucci first day was january,the first day that colucci was ever employed by agfa.accordingly,it directed the plan to compute colucci severance pay based on the periods that colucci worked for agfa both before he left for kodak and after he returned.
the parties agree that the severance plan is governed by erisa.see.even though an employee benefit plan is regulated by erisa,however,it remains a contractual type of document to be enforced by employing contract principles.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d booth stores,cir wheeler dynamic eng g,cir.accordingly,we begin with the general principle that erisa plans are interpreted by the courts de novo by looking to the terms of the plan and other manifestations of the parties intent.firestone,at.see also haley paul revere life ins,cir.
when a plan by its terms confers discretion on the plan administrator to interpret its provisions and the administrator acts reasonably within the scope of that discretion,courts defer to the administrator interpretation.firestone,at.booth,at.in those circumstances,a court will not disturb an administrator decision as long as it is reasonable.see firestone,at.de nobel vitro,cir.this is because the plan,in conferring discretion on a trustee with respect to a specific matter,deliberately yields to the trustee judgment on that matter,as long as it is reasonable.the plan thus recognizes that on such a matter,various reasonable decisions and interpretations could be made,and it accepts,as a contractual term of the plan,the range of decisions that a trustee could reasonably make.firestone,at.in determining the appropriate standard of review for actions under a b,we are guided by principles of trust law restatement second of trusts cmt.
yet,even as an erisa plan confers discretion on its administrator to interpret the plan,the administrator is not free to alter the terms of the plan or to construe unambiguous terms other than as written.see kress food employers labor relations ass n,cir noting that courts are bound to enforce contractual provisions as drafted booth,at listing the plan language as the first factor to consider in determining whether discretion is abused.interpretive discretion only allows an administrator to resolve ambiguity.see kress,at.thus,for instance,if a plan unambiguously provides weeks of compensation as a severance benefit for an employee who has worked for the company for years,the administrator abuses its discretion by reading the plan to provide weeks of compensation.even if the plan generally confers discretion on the administrator to interpret its terms,such discretion does not confer discretion to alter the plan terms or to read out unambiguous provisions.firestone,at.noting that courts construe terms in trust agreements without deferring to either party interpretation kress,at noting that discretionary authority is not implicated when the terms of the plan itself are clear davis burlington,cir if the plan language is unambiguous,however,we would not defer to a contrary interpretation by the board.
yet when the plan terms are ambiguous in the sense that its language gives rise to at least two different but reasonable interpretations and when the plan confers discretion on the administrator to interpret the plan and resolve ambiguities,a court defers to the administrator interpretation by reviewing it only for abuse of discretion.see firestone,at.de nobel,at.
we review the district court determination of its standard for reviewing the plan administrator decision and its interpretation of the plan language de novo.
in this case,the plan confers broad discretionary authority on the administrator to interpret the plan.section b states that agfa and the administrative committee shall be authorized and have full discretion to interpret this plan and to determine all questions arising in the administration,construction and application of the plan.consequently,if a plan provision is ambiguous,agfa and the administrative committee have discretion to resolve the ambiguity.booth,at involving similarly broad language.
the district court concluded,however,that the plan language was clear,plain,and unambiguous and that therefore the administrator exercised discretion beyond that which the plan conferred.see kress,at davis,at lockhart united mine workers of am pension trust,cir if the denial of benefits is contrary to the clear language of the plan,the decision of the fiduciary will constitute an abuse of discretion internal quotation marks omitted.the court pointed to the definition of employment commencement date in the plan,which provides that it is the first day on which an employee is employed by an employer.the court concluded that because the first day that colucci was employed with agfa was january,his severance benefits should have been computed from that date and not the date he was rehired by agfa after having voluntarily left to work for kodak.in short,the court concluded that the first day on which an employee is employed was and could only refer to the first day that colucci was ever employed by agfa.
while the district court found first day to be unambiguous,it unduly limited the scope of its inquiry and failed to recognize that,in the context of the entire plan,first day is a term of art that begins a discrete period of time defined by the plan as full years of service.a fuller reading of the plan discloses that the plan itself recognizes that a single employee can have multiple blocks of full years of service,each with a different employment commencement date,and consequently the employee can have multiple first days.section b of the plan states 
in the event the severed employee employment is terminated in a manner which causes the severed employee to receive a severance benefit under this plan within two years of the date he or she is reemployed or reinstated with an employer,the severed employee will receive a severance benefit under section of the plan,with his or her number of full years of service computed by adding his or her full years of service prior to reemployment or reinstatement to his or her full years of service after reemployment or reinstatement and subtracting the number of weeks already paid to the severed employee attributable to his or her termination of employment prior to reemployment or reinstatement 
because colucci voluntary departure from agfa disqualified him from receiving severance benefits for his full years of service prior to his departure,b does not apply to colucci specific situation.yet,the emphasized portion of this section crucially recognizes that a single employment commencement date is not logically required by the plan definition of full years of service.if colucci interpretation were correct,b would have been written more straightforwardly.it would not have commanded the administrator to add one full years of service with its own first day to a second full years of service also with its own first day,and then to subtract severance.instead,it would have commanded the administrator to begin with the one and only full years of service,tracing the period back to the first ever employment date and subtracting out from that larger figure the time already paid and the time not actively employed.
