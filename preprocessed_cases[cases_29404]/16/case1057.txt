this action grew out of business disputes marked by sharp disagreements over asserted trade secrets and contractual obligations.a jury resolved multiple issues leaving but one count which has been appealed.the principal questions before us are whether,under pennsylvania law,a fraudulent misrepresentation is to be treated as a tort or breach of contract and whether that point has been properly preserved for our review.we conclude that the issue was not waived in the district court and will remand for a new trial.
telechem international,a california corporation,provided technical assistance and hardware for use in microarray technology applicable in genetic screening or genotyping.the process allows microscopic spots of dna to be placed on glass slides for use in genetic research and testing.
pediatrix screening,a pennsylvania corporation,was engaged in traditional methods of genetic screening of newborn infants the company became interested in applying for a research grant,but needed a collaborator with expertise in microarray technology.after preliminary discussions during a trade show attended by representatives of both entities,an officer of pediatrix wrote to telechem to arrange a meeting with personnel from the two companies.in that letter,pediatrix set forth that the parties joint efforts might ultimately lead to a mutually beneficial relationship,which would require that significant effort be made by both parties.
on february,pediatrix sent a letter to telechem outlining a proposal.during phase one,telechem would assist pediatrix in performing a small pilot experiment using microarray technology and in preparing a grant application to the national institutes of health.phase two was envisioned as a study during which the parties would develop a microarray screening process for nearly a dozen genetic disorders.according to pediatrix letter,a ll of these proposals are achievable in the short term and will lead to long term commitments and mutual benefits.
telechem responded on march,that it fully accept ed and embrace d the february proposal in the hopes that telechem will benefit from the residual commercial uses arising out of the collaboration.following the outline of pediatrix overture,telechem agreed that all grant money would go to pediatrix and that telechem would forego a subcontract.telechem further agreed to devote million in commitments of personnel,research,use of capital equipment,and supplies and stated that it would build pediatrix a clean room if necessary pediatrix,with the support of telechem,secured the grants from nih in august and commenced its research.
at a meeting in october,pediatrix presented telechem with a proposal for a joint corporation to be named and in december,followed up with a suggested pre incorporation agreement.according to the draft,would be created to engag e in and maintain a business which develops and sells microarraybased genetic tests for newborn screening and other diagnostic purposes.telechem would own of the company stock pediatrix would possess.
the parties executed the agreement on april,promising to cause the corporation to be formed within thirty days.telechem signed the necessary incorporation papers and returned them to pediatrix.however,pediatrix did not file the documents with the appropriate authorities.unaware of the omission,telechem continued to work with pediatrix while touting at trade shows and providing additional promotional publicity.
on june,pediatrix wrote to telechem with complaints about its performance.after correspondence and meetings failed to resolve their differences,pediatrix terminated the pre incorporation agreement on july.telechem responded on august,that it decline d pediatrix request to terminate the agreement and would continue to operate as,and in the best interests of.
in the months following this exchange,the parties discussed future collaborations and the development of a business plan.telechem,with pediatrix encouragement,continued working on the microarray project.however,on november,telechem gave notice that pediatrix had breached contract two and demanded specific performance or return of consideration.pediatrix filed this suit six days later,seeking declaratory relief and asserting breaches of contracts one and two.
telechem counterclaimed,requesting declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages.in particular,telechem asserted a breach of contract two,as well as a number of claims sounding in tort,including fraudulent misrepresentation and misappropriation of trade secrets.telechem did not plead a breach of contract one,but averred that contract two had memorialized what it dubbed the oral agreement.pursuant to that understanding,telechem was to provide tools,skills and expertise thereby enabling pediatrix to qualify for and benefit from various research grants,while telechem would retain all commercial rights to any product developed.
pediatrix moved to dismiss the counterclaims under federal rule of civil procedure b,asserting,inter alia,that telechem tort counts were barred by pennsylvania economic loss doctrine.because that concept typically applied to products liability suits and was remarkably similar to pennsylvania gist of the action test the district court applied the latter label.observing that caution should be exercised in determining the gist of an action at the motion to dismiss stage,the court declined to dismiss the misrepresentation and other tort claims.
the gist of the action question apparently was not raised again until a june,conference,shortly before the trial began,when the court requested counsel to submit points for charge.addressing telechem as to which claims the jury should receive,the trial judge stated,
count is misrepresentation.and then,that brings to question,are you proceeding in tort,or are you proceeding in contract this is the issue what the gist of the action.my sense is the gist of this action is contract,breach of contract.so you need to tell me whether that in or out.
telechem counsel requested,and later was granted,an instruction listing the elements of a misrepresentation tort claim and a related damages charge.
at the conclusion of lengthy testimony,the case was submitted on special interrogatories.the jury responses set forth that there were two contracts at issue telechem had breached contract one,for which pediatrix would receive only nominal damages both pediatrix and telechem had breached contract two,resulting in a million award in liquidated damages for each and pediatrix was liable for fraudulent misrepresentation,for which telechem was granted in compensatory and million in punitive damages.in addition,the jury nullified the claims for asserted trade secrets.
after the district court entered judgment,pediatrix filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure,seeking post trial relief and to amend judgment with respect to defendant counterclaim.in that motion,pediatrix argued that the evidence of record did not support the misrepresentation claim,the gist of the action doctrine barred telechem from recovering for misrepresentation,and the punitive damages award was unwarranted and excessive.
after the parties briefed the issues,the court conducted a lengthy oral argument,during which the trial judge found that the misrepresentation here was with respect to fraud in the inducement.there was no separate duty under contract one that would have required pediatrix to actually commercialize the efforts on which they were collaborating.
the district court later issued an order denying pediatrix rule motion,stating that the fraudulent misrepresentation alleged by telechem did not concern the performance of contractual duties.in addition,the court held that pediatrix could not argue insufficient evidence,having failed to timely raise the issue.the damages awards were left undisturbed.
pediatrix timely appealed,asserting that the district court erred in failing to apply the gist of the action doctrine,that the punitive damage verdict was excessive,and that the recovery for misrepresentation was duplicative of the breach of contract award.telechem contends,inter alia,that pediatrix waived its challenge to the misrepresentation claim by failing to ask for judgment as a matter of law as prescribed by rule and disputes that the damages were inappropriate.
the jury verdict and parties arguments on appeal have effectively transformed the dispute from an action focusing primarily on whether pediatrix had wrongfully appropriated asserted trade secrets into a judgment for damages in favor of telechem for misrepresentation on the part of pediatrix.before we address the merits of pediatrix contention that the gist of the action doctrine precludes such an award,we must first consider the propriety of our review.
in unitherm food systems,d,the supreme court observed,significantly,that the broad grant of authority to the courts of appeals in to affirm,modify or reverse any judgment brought before it for review must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the federal rules of civil procedure as interpreted by this court.at.in wielding our general statutory power of review,therefore,we are to take due account of the limitations and restrictions set forth in the rules of civil procedure.the former practice of appealing directly from an adverse judgment in a jury without filing motions in the district court has been altered,at least insofar as the movant requests judgment as a matter of law based on insufficiency of the evidence.
telechem argues that pediatrix waived its challenges to the judgment for misrepresentation.focusing at length on rule and the law governing the preservation of sufficiency of the evidence claims,telechem asserts that pediatrix failure to file motions seeking judgment as a matter of law under rule precludes our review of pediatrix arguments on appeal.
under rule,a party may move for judgment as a matter of law at any time before the case is submitted to the jury,and the court may enter judgment if it finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.if the motion is not granted,it may be renewed n o later than days after the entry of judgment and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under rule.b.the court may,on consideration of the renewed motion,enter judgment as a matter of law for the moving party,leave the jury original verdict undisturbed,or order a new trial.id.if a party seeks a judgment in its favor based on insufficiency of the evidence,he must file for judgment as a matter of law both before the case is submitted to the jury and after a verdict is returned.unitherm,at.
telechem contends that pediatrix failure to follow the dictates of rule waived any claim challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.in the circumstances before us the district court properly declined to enter judgment as a matter of law against telechem on that ground.see id.at.that conclusion,however,does not foreclose all and appellate relief available to pediatrix,especially since it does not now contest the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the misrepresentation judgment.
pediatrix filed a motion purporting to be in accordance with rule.the district court was asked to amend the judgments,and pediatrix specifically argued not only that the evidence failed to support the verdict for misrepresentation,but also that the judgment for misrepresentation should be stricken as legally barred by the gist of the action doctrine.
neither rule nor contain the term stricken.rule,however,permits the court,on the motion of a party or sua sponte,to grant a new trial for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.a a.under the rule,a party may also move to alter or amend a judgment.e.a rule motion to alter or amend judgment m ay rely on the need to correct clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.north river ins.cigna reinsurance,cir second alteration in original quotation marks and citation omitted.
unlike rule,the text of rule does not require any motions.further,although unitherm stated that a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court,at,that case addressed an insufficient evidence challenge under rule,and the court specifically noted the absence of a rule motion.id.at.courts of appeals that have examined the issue generally have concluded that unitherm holding is limited to rule and insufficiency of the evidence.they do not,with one exception,preclude the ability to review relief under rule 
telechem also observes that pediatrix did not challenge the fraud claim at any point during the trial by objecting to its submission to the jury or requesting any gist of the action instruction.those arguments miss the mark.the issue here is whether the misrepresentation claim,even if supported by sufficient evidence,is nevertheless precluded by the gist of the action doctrine.
that legal dispute is clearly set forth in pediatrix rule b motion,filed early in the litigation,to dismiss the tort counterclaims.the denial of that motion was not appealable until the district court entered its final judgment.t he general rule is that on appeal from a final judgment,all previously unappealable orders merge in the judgment and are subject to review.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed.that includes rulings under rule b.see murray commercial union ins,cir grant of rule b motion appealable after final judgment entered see also pennbarr ins.of,cir denial of summary judgment appealable after adverse verdict.
telechem was not ambushed by pediatrix argument concerning gist of the action,nor confronted by the reanimation of a lifeless corpse.the district judge specifically inquired at a pretrial conference whether the alleged misrepresentation was a breach of contract or a tort.telechem elected to treat the claim as a tort and was on fair notice that the gist of the action defense was still pending at that point.the legal issue was neither withdrawn nor transformed into a factual issue to be resolved by the jury.
as judge becker colorfully expressed in a similar circumstance,i t would be unfair to penalize a party for failing to jump up and down or labor an objection that the district court had placed in the record,ellwood group,cir.nor would we require such calisthenics from pediatrix when its objection had already been preserved for appeal.
the rule motion filed by pediatrix was fully briefed by both parties and supplemented by the extensive oral argument in the district court.counsel explored such matters as the gist of the action,the contract as to which the misrepresentation occurred,whether the misrepresentation amounted to fraud in the inducement,what the evidence at trial had demonstrated,and whether either party had waived its contentions.in short,the parties presented a complete review of the case,aided by the active and thoughtful participation of the district judge.
the supreme court advised courts of appeals to avail themselves of the benefit derived from a district court proceedings.see unitherm,at.given the length and breadth of the district court examination of the issues and the opportunities extended to both parties to present their arguments,we are satisfied that pediatrix gist of the action challenge was fully aired in the district court and preserved for appellate review.
the principal issue on the merits is whether the court erred in its disposition of the gist of the action question.although that legal issue is tied to factual matters,pediatrix does not now contest the sufficiency of the evidence as to commission of the misrepresentation but the legal ruling allowing tort recovery for conduct that arguably was a breach of contract.
sounding in diversity jurisdiction,the misrepresentation claim and the gist of the action defense are governed by the substantive law of pennsylvania.although its supreme court has not expressly adopted the gist of the action doctrine,it recognized decades ago the difficulties inherent in allowing a party to proceed with both tort and contract claims for harm that arose in connection with a contractual relationship.see glaze
