intracomm,and baback habibi collectively,appellants appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of ken bajaj,jack pearlstein,steven hanau,and corporate defendants digitalnet holdings,bae systems north america,bae systems information technology,llc,and bae systems it holdings,collectively,appellees on appellants claims for,inter alia,breach of contract and fraud.appellees the district court partial grant of summary judgment in favor of appellants on appellants claim that appellees failed to pay appellant habibi minimum wage in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.the district court held that habibi was not exempt from the flsa requirements under the flsa combination exemption,and therefore was owed minimum wage for approximately hours he worked without direct compensation.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm both the district court grant of summary judgment to appellees on the claims and its grant of summary judgment to habibi on the flsa claim.
habibi is one of the founders of intracomm,an information technology company,and is the creator of a software integration system known as.appellee bae systems information technology,llc bae it llc,formerly known as digitalnet government solutions,llc digitalnet llc,is an information technology service provider.bae it llc is a subsidiary of appellee bae systems it,bae it,formerly known as digitalnet.bae it is a subsidiary of appellee bae systems it holdings,bae it holdings,formerly known as digitalnet holdings,digitalnet holdings.bae it holdings is a subsidiary of appellee bae systems,bae.
appellees bajaj and pearlstein held positions within digitalnet llc and digitalnet holdings during periods relevant to this case.appellee hanau was president of digitalnet llc.
in spring,habibi suggested to bajaj and pearlstein that habibi be allowed to use digitalnet llc name to market,the software integration system he created.thereafter,digitalnet llc and intracomm entered into an agreement the assignment agreement that provided that digitalnet llc would have the exclusive right to sell,use and license for a period and an option to buy for million.additionally,the assignment agreement provided for the employment of certain intracomm and three digitalnet llc.
on the same date,digitalnet llc and habibi entered into an employment agreement.this agreement provided the terms and conditions of habibi employment with digitalnet llc.appellants were represented by intracomm outside legal counsel in negotiating the employment agreement and the assignment agreement.
in summer,bae began confidentially negotiating a purchase of the outstanding shares of digitalnet holdings.neither intracomm nor habibi were advised of the bae acquisition before entering into the assignment agreement and the employment agreement.the bae acquisition was completed in october,at which time the digitalnet firms changed their names to reflect bae purchase.bajaj and pearlstein left bae it llc,formerly digitalnet llc,after bae acquisition,while hanau remained with the company.
during habibi employment with bae it llc,he did not sell any licenses to bae it llc customers or potential customers.therefore,habibi did not receive any sales commissions and only received a per hour salary,as contemplated in the employment agreement.habibi,however,maintains that he was instructed not to report hours he worked in excess of forty hours per week and that the bae it llc system prohibited him from doing so.additionally,habibi claims he received no compensation for a period of two weeks in may.indeed,the parties have stipulated that habibi was not paid for hours he actually worked during his employment with bae it llc.these contentions form the basis of habibi claim that he was not paid minimum wage,in violation of the flsa.
in early,habibi demanded that bae it llc exercise its option to buy for million and threatened to discontinue his efforts at marketing unless bae it llc agreed to do so.after negotiations with habibi failed,bae it llc informed habibi that it would not exercise its option to buy.habibi retained legal counsel and sent a demand letter to bae it llc.the parties met but could not resolve the issues between them.bae it llc decided to terminate habibi employment and did so just after habibi filed this lawsuit against appellees in state court in fairfax county,virginia.
in the lawsuit,appellants alleged failure to pay minimum wage in violation of the flsa,breach of contract,and various other claims.appellees removed the action to federal district court.the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over appellants claims,and granted appellees motion for summary judgment on all claims save habibi flsa claim.the district court partially granted habibi motion for summary judgment on his flsa claim,finding that he was a employee but also that bae it llc violation of the flsa was not willful.the instant followed.
we first address appellants argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction over this action because the assignment agreement contained a clause.we review de novo the district court jurisdiction determinations.lontz tharp,cir.
appellants maintain that the clause in the assignment agreement mandates that all disputes be resolved in fairfax county,virginia in state court.the assignment agreement contains a clause that states,in the event that such good faith negotiations do not result in a resolution of a dispute,either party shall be free to pursue its rights at law or equity in a court of competent jurisdiction in fairfax county,virginia.emphasis added.appellees respond that this clause is permissive,providing merely that either party may litigate in fairfax county,virginia and operating as a consent to personal jurisdiction there by both parties.
a general maxim in interpreting clauses is that an agreement conferring jurisdiction in one forum will not be interpreted as excluding jurisdiction elsewhere unless it contains specific language of exclusion.john boutari son,wines spirits,attiki imp.and,cir emphasis in original internal quotations omitted.in spite of this general rule,appellants rely on excell,sterling boiler mechanical,cir,in arguing that the assignment agreement requires resolution in virginia state courts.
however,the clause at issue in excell stated,jurisdiction shall be in the state of colorado.id.at.that clause was mandatory,the court explained,as it contained clear language stating that jurisdiction was only appropriate in colorado,the designated forum.id.at.by contrast,the excell court cited the following as an example of a permissive clause the parties agree that the courts of the state of michigan shall have personal jurisdiction id.internal quotations omitted.although both clauses,like the one in the instant case,use the word shall,the word meaning differs with context.
considering context here,we believe that the clause in the assignment agreement is more like the permissive clause noted by the excell court in that it permits jurisdiction in one court but does not prohibit jurisdiction in another.the phrase shall be free to is scarcely,if any,more restrictive than the word may.because the assignment agreement does not preclude federal jurisdiction,the district court had jurisdiction over habibi flsa claim pursuant to and properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over appellants state law claims pursuant to.we therefore conclude that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction in this case having so concluded,we turn next to appellants arguments that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.leblanc cahill,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.although in their brief appellants argue that the district court granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on all counts was erroneous,at oral argument appellants focused on their breach of contract claim against appellees 
appellants maintain that appellees breached the assignment agreement by exercising the option to purchase from appellants but failing to follow through on their obligation to purchase.appellants argue that appellees exercised the option to purchase by filing a provisional patent application for the software and exercising dominion and control over by marketing the software.the assignment agreement provides that the option is exercised upon payment of the purchase price.virginia law holds that the language of an option determines the method of the required acceptance.hart hart.
despite appellants arguments to the contrary,we are unconvinced that the plain and clear language of the assignment agreement allowed for any other means of acceptance of the option to purchase than by tendering of the purchase price.it is undisputed that bae it llc never paid the purchase price of million for.however,even if bae it llc could have exercised the option by some other method,appellants identify no facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that bae it llc did so 
we now address appellees.appellees contend that the district court improperly held that habibi was a employee under the flsa and therefore granted partial summary judgment to habibi on his flsa claim.again,we review de novo the district court summary judgment determinations.leblanc,at.
we begin with an overview of the categories of employees who are statutorily exempted from the flsa requirements and the regulations defining such categories.the flsa generally entitles covered employees to a minimum wage and compensation at one and times the regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.a,a.specific categories of employees are,however,excluded from coverage.under a of the flsa,any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity or in the capacity of outside salesman is exempt from these and overtime pay requirements.a.
congress has granted the secretary of labor secretary broad authority to define and delimit the scope of these exemptions.auer robbins,d.pursuant to her authority,the secretary has promulgated regulations defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive,administrative,professional,outside sales,and computer employees.part.each individual exemption is defined in part by the nature of the employee primary duty.an employee primary duty is the principal,main,major or most important duty that the employee performs.thus,for example,to meet the primary duty test of the outside sales exemption,the employee must be customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing sales.a.
some of the individual exemptions have other requirements as well.the most common additional requirement,relevant here,is a salary test.to qualify as exempt under the executive,administrative,or professional exemptions,employees generally must,in addition to meeting the primary duty tests,be paid on a salary or fee basis and receive compensation of at least per week.the outside sales exemption,however,does not contain a salary test.see c.
in addition to the individual exemptions just described,the secretary has also crafted a hybrid exemption.this combination exemption provides 
employees who perform a combination of exempt duties as set forth in the regulations in this part for executive,administrative,professional,outside sales and computer employees may qualify for exemption.thus,for example,an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt administrative work and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption.in other words,work that is exempt under one section of this part will not defeat the exemption under any other section.
emphasis added.it is the interrelationship of the individual exemptions and the combination exemption that concerns us here.
it is undisputed that habibi is not exempt under the independent tests of the individual exemptions.he does not meet the salary requirement of the administrative exemption,the one that most closely approximates his job duties,because he was paid an hourly wage and never made or more per week.nor does he appear to qualify for the outside sales exemption.appellees do not challenge the district court finding that habibi did not customarily and regularly sell outside its place of business indeed,the record reflects that he only went on four sales calls during his ten months of employment,and primarily worked at bae it llc headquarters 
the question then arises as to whether habibi can qualify for the combination exemption,having failed to fully satisfy the requirements of the individual exemptions.the district court held that he could not.it concluded that because habibi did not qualify for either the administrative or the exemptions as defined by the regulations,he could not qualify for the combination exemption,either appellees failure to pay habibi a minimum wage was therefore a violation of the flsa.appellees challenge this conclusion on appeal,arguing that the combination exemption does not require that habibi meet the administrative exemption salary test.to aid in the decisional process,this court requested that the secretary of labor file an amicus brief explaining her interpretation of the regulation 
because the secretary has proffered her interpretation of the regulation,we do not analyze it de novo.rather,the secretary interpretation of her own regulation in opinion letters and in her amicus brief to this court is entitled to deference and is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.internal quotations omitted deferring to the secretary of labor interpretation of the regulation in amicus brief see also acs detroit edison,cir opinion letter interpreting secretary of labor regulation entitled to controlling deference we now turn to an analysis of the regulation in light of the secretary interpretation.
we begin our consideration of the scope of the combination exemption with the language of the regulation itself.we bear in mind,as we must,the supreme court guidance that the exemptions are to be construed narrowly against the employer seeking to assert them,arnold ben kanowsky,d,and that the employer bears the burden of proving that employees are exempt,idaho sheet metal works,wirtz,d.
by its terms,the regulation focuses solely on the employee job duties.that is,it is the combination of exempt duties that may qualify an employee for exemption.the example provided by the regulation highlights this singular focus an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt administrative work and exempt executive work may qualify for the exemption.id.the regulation does not expressly include or exclude any of the other requirements,such as salary tests,of the individual exemptions.
the silence of the regulation regarding the other requirements of the individual exemptions yields two possible interpretations.the first,as suggested by appellants,reads the regulation to provide an alternative method for satisfying the test,without abrogating the other requirements needed for the exemption to attach.this interpretation gives full effect to the textual focus of the regulation on job duties only and also comports with the maxim that exemptions are to be construed narrowly against the employer seeking to assert them.arnold,at.the other interpretation,proffered by appellees,is that the combination exemption creates a new and independent exemption for any employee whose job duties represent a hybrid of the individual exemptions,regardless of whether the other requirements of those individual exemptions are satisfied.
in her amicus brief,the secretary asserts her longstanding support of the first interpretation.according to the secretary,the combination exemption addresses the situation that exists when an employee does not meet the requirement of any individual exemption.in such cases,an employee may nonetheless be exempt from the flsa requirements pursuant to the combination exemption,which permits considering different exempt duties together for purposes of meeting the test.thus,an employee performing duties that fall under more than one individual exemption,none of which separately rep
