this case involves the sale of a business which went awry.peter perry and michael bordick we will refer to them hereafter collectively as perry brought this action against john and barbara wolaver the wolavers seeking to enforce various default provisions under the relevant agreements.the district court granted summary judgment largely in favor of the wolavers,and both sides appealed.
the basic facts are essentially undisputed.perry sought to sell two businesses,perry transport,llc and perry transport logistics services,llc the companies,and the wolavers agreed to purchase the companies.the parties signed a letter of intent which outlined the essential terms of the transaction and acknowledged that perry would retain the cash and certain personal vehicles as well as certain liabilities from the companies after sale.the parties closed on the transaction on february,and they executed several agreements,which are the focus of this dispute.the purchase and sale agreement psa provided for a purchase price of,with to be paid in cash at closing and the balance provided by a promissory note note for.further,the psa provided for an adjustment of the actual sale price after closing to reflect changes in the net assets on the balance sheet between and the date of closing.this purchase price adjustment ppa,which the parties were required to agree upon within days of closing,would be determined as follows 
a the purchase price shall be adjusted i upward by the excess,if any,of the total value of the assets net of liabilities on the books of the companies as of the closing date the net assets exceeds three hundred thousand nine hundred dollars the baseline amount,or ii downward by the excess,if any,of the baseline amount over the net assets 
the note required the wolavers to pay perry on the first of every month until march,when the remaining balance was due.the note provided for a range of consequences if the wolavers failed to make payments as scheduled,including late fees and increased interest the most significant sanction under the note,however,was acceleration of principal 
if any installment under this note is not paid within fifteen days of its due date or borrowers fail to perform any of the terms,agreements,covenants or conditions contained in the pledge agreement commercial lease agreement between these same parties,a certain promissory note from the wolavers to holders in the amount of,all of near or even date herewith,or other instruments given as security for this note,not cured within any applicable cure period,a default shall be deemed to have occurred under this note,and then,or at any time thereafter during the continuance of any such default,the entire unpaid balance of the note together with any interest accrued thereunder,shall,at the election of the holders,and without notice of such election and without demand or presentment,become immediately due and payable,and the principal balance together with any interest accrued thereunder shall thereafter bear the simple interest at the default rate until paid.the failure of the holders to promptly exercise their rights to declare the indebtedness remaining unpaid hereunder to be immediately due and payable or the acceptance of one or more installments from any person shall not constitute a waiver of any of holders rights while any default continues nor a waiver of holders rights in connection with any subsequent default.the holders may exercise this option to accelerate during any default by the undersigned regardless of any prior forbearance emphasis in original.
under additional terms,perry also reserved broad rights to modify the note terms,including reducing the payments,extending the term,or otherwise modifying the note provisions.the note in turn was secured by the pledge and security agreement pledge.
the pledge gave perry a security interest in of the membership units of the companies.the pledge also contained what the parties have characterized as a cure provision,which required perry to provide fifteen days prior written notice to the wolavers after a default before utilizing any remedy under the pledge.the most significant default under the pledge was failure to pay any of the obligation secured hereby the note when due not cured within any applicable cure period the most significant remedy under the pledge was the transfer of ownership of the membership units back to perry.
in late march,perry broker calculated the ppa,but he disregarded the formula provided for in the psa.the broker instead recalculated the assets not including cash and cash equivalents and liabilities as of and closing,determined the change in each,and concluded that there was an increase in net assets of.the broker error was not noticed at the time,and the parties accepted this figure and entered into an oral agreement for the wolavers to pay off the ppa in monthly installments to perry 
for approximately a year,all went smoothly.however,in early,the wolavers discovered the error in the calculation of the ppa and concluded that a proper calculation would have resulted in a substantial reduction in purchase price.the parties began negotiating the matter.
during the negotiations,the wolavers paid both the april and may payments after the grace period each month,and neither payment included late fees or the increased interest.perry accepted these payments without comment.however,when the june payment did not arrive on time,perry sent a notice letter,dated june,stating that the wolavers were in default under the note because the wolavers failed to make their june,payment on a timely basis.the notice letter also advised that 
interest on that note is now increased to twelve percent per annum,the default interest provided in the note.additionally,you now owe late fees for that note for the months of march,april,may and june as the note provides.
lastly,the notice letter cautioned that 
your default of your obligations on the promissory note also constitute sic a default of the pledge and security agreement dated february,securing the promissory note.this letter shall serve as your fifteen day notice to cure under that agreement.your failure to cure within the cure period will trigger all of my clients rights to the membership interests in both limited liability companies.
emphasis in original.
further negotiation yielded a extension to the cure period,and the wolavers tendered the june and july checks within the extended cure period.but perry did not cash them because they failed to include late fees and interest.instead,perry sent a default letter dated july,notifying the wolavers that the extended cure period had expired and that perry was accelerating the note and demanding immediate payment.
shortly thereafter,perry brought this action in district court claiming breaches of the note,oral agreement,and pledge and seeking reformation of the psa.the wolavers counterclaimed,seeking a declaratory judgment that the ppa was overstated and that they were not in breach or default of the note.they also sought recision of the oral agreement and reformation of the note.both sides moved for partial summary judgment.
the district court first held that perry had waived interest and late fees for the april and may payments.the court further concluded that the note and pledge ought to be read together and that the cure period in the pledge was incorporated into the note.the court then held that the wolavers had cured the defaults under the note by tendering their june and july payments within the extended cure period,cutting off perry right to accelerate the note or claim remedies under the pledge.as to interest and late fees for the june and july payments,the court stated that these penalties were intended to be added to the principal and not paid with the late installments.
in addition,the district court recalculated the ppa,using the formula provided in the psa.significantly,the district court excluded the cash and other assets to be distributed to perry held by the companies at closing in determining net assets at the time of sale the district court concluded that the wolavers were entitled to a revised ppa of in their favor plus the return of their prior payments on the oral agreement.the district court denied summary judgment as to the remaining claims and denied the wolavers motion for attorney fees.the parties then settled the remaining claims so the district court could enter final judgment,and this appeal followed.
perry argues that the district court erred in holding that the wolavers were not in default of the note and that the court grossly miscalculated the ppa.on,the wolavers contend that the district court erred in denying their motion for attorney fees.we reject each of the claims.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.hodgkins new england telephone,cir.summary judgment is warranted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.pro.c.we may affirm a summary judgment decision on any basis apparent in the record.uncle henry plaut consulting,cir.

breach of the note 
perry asserts four grounds for his argument that the wolavers were in default of the note,entitling him to accelerate payment of the principal.first,he argues that the note automatically accelerated with the first late payment in april.second,perry asserts that there was no waiver of late fees or interest for the april and may payments moreover,in light of the no waiver clause,perry could accelerate the note based on these continuing defaults.third,he maintains that there is no right to cure under the note,and the note did not incorporate the cure provision in the pledge.fourth,even if there was a right to cure under the note,the wolavers failed to do so because their june and july payments failed to include interest.perry also says that as a consequence of that default,the wolavers were also in default on the pledge,triggering the remedies therein.we examine these contentions in turn and find all of them lacking.
perry assertion that the late april payment automatically and with no notice required accelerated the principal is a nonstarter.this position is expressly contradicted by the note,which makes accelerating the principal merely an option perry could affirmatively elect in the event of a default.moreover,perry own conduct makes it obvious that perry did not accelerate the note or believe that the note had been automatically accelerated in april.notably,perry notice letter only sought interest and late fees as a sanction for the late payments.there was no hint that perry anticipated anything other than the continuation of installment payments.
perry claim that interest was not waived for the april and may payments is also refuted by the record.perry notice letter specifically provided that interest was triggered by the late june payment,not before.significantly,the notice letter explicitly sought late fees as the only sanction for the tardy april and may payments in addition,perry reliance on the provision is misdirected.under the note,a forbearance by perry regarding a default does not waive perry right to any remedy under the note during any continuing or subsequent default.that,however,is beside the point.the real issue is whether perry could choose to excuse a specific default and waive the penalty for that specific default.on that score,perry had that both the default clause and the broadly worded additional powers exercised it for the late april and may payments.
perry next claims that there is no right to cure in the note and no such right could be imported from the pledge.this contention also does not bear scrutiny.as noted by the district court,the relevant documents were collectively directed to accomplishing the sale of the companies,and thus properly construed together under maine law.see crowe,at.the conclusion that the documents were intended to be interrelated is buttressed by the fact that both the note and pledge expressly refer to each other,and events under one trigger consequences under the other 
further,a full and fair reading of the note language indicates that there is a right to cure defaults under the note.for example,the note default clause includes the qualification,not cured within any applicable cure period,strongly suggesting that defaults need not be fatal.the default clause also includes such phrases as while any default continues and during any default language which anticipates that defaults can be remedied.moreover,the pledge expressly provides that a default would include failure to pay any of the obligation note secured hereby when due not cured within any applicable cure period while it is conceivable that this is a conditional catchall provision,we will not rush to such an interpretation,which would render the language surplusage if defaults under the note are incurable.see crowe,at contracts must be interpreted to avoid rendering terms meaningless,nonsensical,or mere surplusage.in addition to the linguistic problems with perry position,there is a logical one as well.the only default that triggered the pledge was the default on the note,and the only way to cure the default under the pledge was to cure the default under the note.but,if defaults under the note are incurable,we are at a loss to understand to what cure the june,notice letter refers.accordingly,we reject perry argument on this issue as well.
lastly,perry claims that,even if the wolavers had the opportunity to cure,they failed to do so because the tendered june and july payments did not include interest at the default rate,which was automatically triggered by the late april payment.we have already rejected this thesis about the april payment.in addition,the district court noted that there was no default because,like late fees,the interest was to be added to the principal balance,not the individual monthly payments.moreover,pursuant to perry own decree in the notice letter,the was not activated until june,the date of the notice letter.but the notice letter simultaneously triggered the cure period,which,as noted above,permits any defaults under the note to be remedied.all these approaches lead to the same conclusion the wolavers cured the defaults by tendering the june and july payments within the extended cure period,and therefore perry had no basis for invoking the acceleration clause.
the parties concede that the agreements are not models of clarity.at the end of the day,we are left with the district court reading of the agreements,which is plausible,and perry interpretation,which is not.because there is no room for any reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the agreements,crowe,at emphasis in original,the district court holding stands.see,global naps,verizon new england,et,wl,at cir,affirming interpretation where,faced with cloudy contract language and a contingency that the parties may not have fully thought through,the decision could be squared with the language of the contract and no linguistic solution offered by the appellants was more obviously correct.
calculation of ppa 
perry also argues that the district court erred by calculating the ppa using a comparison date other than the closing date in contravention of both the psa and the parties expectations.perry also asserts that the excluded cash and other assets were assets of the companies on the closing date,and therefore should be included in the net asset amount for purposes of calculating the ppa.we reject this challenge.
