defendants cummins engine,wartsila nsd north america,cummins wartsila engine,and case credit collectively cummins appeal the district court denial of their motion to stay a case pending arbitration and to compel arbitration.inland bulk transfer inland bulk contracted with cummins to purchase two naval propulsion engines.after some problems with those engines developed,inland bulk filed this lawsuit against cummins,asserting claims of breach of contract,breach of warranty,negligence,and fraud.cummins filed a motion to compel arbitration of these claims pursuant to its contract with inland bulk and to stay the suit pending arbitration.inland bulk argues that the contract did not contain an arbitration provision,and argues in the alternative that the arbitration provision was unenforceable because it called for foreign arbitration.
the district judge in this case denied the motion to stay the judicial action pending arbitration and to compel arbitration.we hold that the arbitration provision was enforceable and that the district court therefore erred in denying the motion to stay the action pending arbitration.because district courts only have the power to compel arbitration within their own districts and the arbitration agreement called for arbitration in france,however,the district court did not err in denying the motion to compel arbitration.we therefore affirm the district court denial of the motion to compel arbitration,reverse the district court decision denying a stay pending arbitration,and remand the case with instructions to the district judge to stay the case to allow the parties to proceed on their claims in arbitration.we also deny inland bulk motion to supplement the record.
background 
inland bulk began considering the purchase of naval propulsion engines from cummins in july of.on july,wartsila nsd north america,sent inland bulk a copy of quotation quotation,which was an offer to sell the two engines under certain conditions and with certain specifications.the warranty section of the quotation stated that wartsila nsd warranty obligations are as specified in the wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions.joint appendix at.the last section of the quotation stated,in all other respects,wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions will apply.at.no terms and conditions,however,were sent with the quotation.
on august,wartsila nsd sent inland bulk a revised offer labeled revision at.revision a offered to sell inland bulk the engines for,and stated that the offer would expire at the end of september of.like the quotation,revision a stated that wartsila nsd obligations under the warranty are as specified in the wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions.at.the last section of revision a like the quotation also stated,in all other respects,wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions will apply.at.this time,however,wartsila nsd attached terms and conditions to revision a.the terms and conditions that were attached indisputably required arbitration for all disputes arising out of the contract 
all disputes arising in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules.the arbitration proceedings shall be in the english language and will take place in paris,france.
at.the terms and conditions that were included with revision a were not titled wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions as they are referred to in the body of revision instead,they were titled wartsila diesel group general terms and conditions of contract,marine applications.at.these terms and conditions,however,were the only terms and conditions sent with revision 
on april,cummins sent inland bulk a third version of the contract called revision revision b offered to sell the engines to inland bulk for.this contract was identical in most respects to revision a,but there was one key difference.where the previous versions of the contract the quotation and revision a refer to the wartsila nsd general sales terms and conditions,revision b refers to the cummins wartsila general sales terms and conditions.at.no terms and conditions were sent with revision 
the parties came to an agreement on one of these versions of the contract on april.inland bulk assented to the contract with a purchase order form,which listed the date and the price.
the controversy between the parties arose when inland bulk had problems with the engines and subsequently filed suit against cummins,alleging claims of breach of contract,breach of warranty,fraud,and negligence.in response,cummins filed a motion to stay and to compel arbitration.the district court,without a written opinion,denied cummins motion in a marginal entry order.cummins has appealed the district court order,and inland bulk has filed a motion to supplement the record.
the principal controversy on appeal is whether the contract between inland bulk and cummins included the associated provision requiring arbitration.cummins argues that the parties agreed upon revision a and that the arbitration provision became part of that contract,and argues alternatively that revision b would also have incorporated an arbitration provision.inland bulk asserts that the parties agreed upon revision b and that the arbitration provision was not incorporated into that document,and alternatively,that revision a did not contain an arbitration provision.for the reasons explained infra,we conclude that the contract included an arbitration provision,regardless of whether the parties agreed upon revision a or revision 
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court below had diversity jurisdiction under we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a a and b,which authorize this court to review district court orders refusing to stay an action pending arbitration under and denying a motion to compel arbitration under.
b.the motion to supplement the record 
before addressing the merits of this appeal,we must resolve inland bulk motion to supplement the record,which was filed on march.inland bulk seeks to supplement the record with four documents that allegedly show that the parties agreed upon revision b as their contract.none of these documents was considered by the district court at the time of its ruling.the first is an internal invoice of cummins,dated december,which states that revision b is the proper contract between the parties.the second is a change order request from cummins,dated september,also listing revision b as the operative contract.the third piece of evidence is a copy of revision b with the original price,crossed out and a new price,written in inland bulk does not state where this copy of revision b came from,and the document has no date on it other than the date that revision b was sent to inland bulk.
the fourth and final piece of evidence is a handwritten copy of the district judge notes from a status conference.this status conference,which took place on april,addressed inland bulk motion in the district court to supplement the record on appeal in rejecting inland bulk motion to supplement the record,the district judge suggested that his decision on the issues was predicated on his belief that revision b was the operative version of the contract.
inland bulk argues that we should allow the record to be supplemented with this new evidence either under federal rule of appellate procedure e,the inherent powers of this court,or the rule that district courts retain jurisdiction to handle matters in aid of the appeal.upon reflection,we deny inland bulk motion to supplement the record.
supplementation under the federal rules of appellate procedure 
inland bulk contends that federal rule of appellate procedure e allows the admission of these pieces of evidence.normally,the record on appeal consists of the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court,the transcript of proceedings,if any and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.fed.a.however,if anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident,the rule allows the omission or misstatement to be corrected and a supplemental record to be certified and forwarded.fed.e.rule e allows correction of the record either by agreement of the parties,by order of the district court,or by order of the court of appeals.fed.e.however,as is clear from the rule wording,t he purpose of the rule is to allow the court to correct omissions from or misstatements in the record for appeal,not to introduce new evidence in the court of appeals.s e shipping chesapeake ry,cir.in general,the appellate court should have before it the record and facts considered by the district court.united states barrow,cir sovereign news united states,cir a party may not the process of the lower court and introduce new facts in brief on appeal,cert.denied,d.
rule e does not justify supplementation of the record in this case.inland bulk motion to supplement the record is not aimed towards correcting some misstatement or omission in the district court record.inland bulk has not even suggested that the record inaccurately reports the proceedings in the district court.instead,inland bulk is simply attempting to add new material that was never considered by the district court.this is not permitted under the rule.
supplementation under the equitable power of this court 
inland bulk next claims that we should permit the record to be supplemented under the equitable power of this court.several circuits have held that they have an inherent equitable authority to supplement the record on appeal under circumstances where fed.would not apply.see united states kennedy,cir,cert.denied,d ross kemp,cir turk united states,cir.commentators have noticed this inherent equitable power as well,although they point out that the practice is only justified in rare instances.see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.supp in special circumstances,however,a court of appeals may permit supplementation of the record to add material not presented to the district court.moore federal practice f,at ed.in extraordinary situations,the circuit court may consider material not presented to the district court when it believes the interests of justice are at stake.while other circuits have embraced the notion that the record can be supplemented under an appellate court equitable authority,we as of yet have not.see chrysler int l cherokee exp,wl,at cir,see also hadix johnson,cir noting that b ecause of their very potency,the inherent powers of the courts must be exercised with restraint and discretion citations omitted.
we will not allow inland bulk to supplement the record pursuant to any inherent equitable power this court may have.even assuming such a power exists,we do not find any special circumstances present that would justify its exercise here.most of the new evidence inland bulk seeks to add to the record could have been presented to the district court below,and none of it establishes beyond doubt the proper disposition of this case.see csx,city of garden city,cir a primary factor which we consider in deciding a motion to supplement the record is whether acceptance of the proffered material into the record would establish beyond any doubt the proper resolution of the pending issues.lastly,we need not consider this new information because the point inland bulk is trying to establish with this revision b rather than revision a is the operative contract between the ultimately not material to our legal analysis,as we will explain later.
supplementation under the in aid of the appeal exception 
finally,inland bulk makes the claim that there is a particular justification for supplementation of the record with the district judge handwritten notes because they were created in aid of the appeal.it is established that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction and transfers jurisdiction to the court of appeals,but that the district court retains jurisdiction to proceed with matters that are in aid of the appeal.cochran birkel,cir,cert.denied,d.several appellate courts have allowed district courts to use this exception to memorialize oral opinions soon after a decision was rendered that action has been considered one in aid of the appeal.see in re grand jury proceedings under seal,cir considering a district court written opinion that memorialized its oral ruling made one day earlier,even though the written opinion was subsequent to the appellant filing of the notice of appeal blaine whirlpool,cir considering a district court written opinion filed one week after the appellants filed their notice of appeal from the district court oral ruling see generally charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.however,appellate courts have generally prevented trial courts from developing supplemental findings after the notice of appeal has been filed.see pro sales,texaco,cir noting that the losing party had already filed its notice of appeal,and therefore the district court had no power to amend its opinion with a supplemental explanation at the time it attempted to do so see also ced epa,cir coming to the same conclusion and stating that t he parties to an appeal are entitled to have a stable set of conclusions of law on which they can rely in preparing their briefs,cert.denied,d.the distinction,although sometimes blurred,is between actions that merely aid the appellate process and actions that alter the case on appeal.allan ides,the authority of a federal district court to proceed after a notice of appeal has been filed.
we hold that the in aid of the appeal exception is inapposite in this case.first,there is no indication that the district judge comments were actually created to aid the appeal.the district judge comments were not directed to this court for our consideration.instead,they were,handwritten comments,never published or formalized.they were apparently made in a status conference that occurred roughly a year and a half after the notice of appeal was filed,at which the district court considered a motion to supplement the record with certain documents.there is no evidence that these comments were meant to aid our analysis.second,we note that inland bulk is not prejudiced by our refusal to consider the purported legal conclusions or reasoning of the district judge created a year and a half after his ruling because in any event we give no deference to such material on de novo review.for all these reasons,inland bulk motion to supplement the record must be denied.
standard of review and choice of law 
we review de novo a district court determination as to whether a dispute is arbitrable.haskins prudential ins.of,cir,cert.denied,d.this standard of review is also appropriate for review of questions of contractual interpretation.eeoc frank nursery crafts,cir.
in determining whether the parties have made a valid arbitration agreement,state law may be applied if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally,although the faa preempts state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.great earth simons,cir quoting doctor,casarotto,d.s tate law governs generally applicable contract defenses to an arbitration clause,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.id.at quoting casarotto,at.
in this case,the question of whether the contract contained an arbitration clause is resolved by basic,generally applicable precepts of ohio contract law we note the federal policy favoring arbitration,which we take into consideration even in applying ordinary state law.see great earth,at noting that although state law may dictate the standards for generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraudulent inducement,the faa governs the enforceability of arbitration clauses generally and expresses a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements that must be taken into account even when issues are presented citation omitted.
d.the incorporation of the arbitration provision 
we next consider whether the contract contained a valid arbitration provision.although we can not determine without doubt whether the parties agreed on revision a or revision
