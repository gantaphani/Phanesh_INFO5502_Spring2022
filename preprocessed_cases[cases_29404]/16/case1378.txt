the federal arbitration act faa,establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.plaintiffs in this case do not contest that they are contractually bound to arbitrate the merits of their dispute,but seek to litigate whether one arbitrator,rather than three,should preside over the arbitration.we conclude that judicial intervention on this issue would be inappropriate.the parties have agreed that arbitrator selection should follow the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association,and the number of arbitrators is a procedural question to be answered exclusively in that forum.the faa promotes the efficient resolution of disputes through arbitration,and this goal would be undermined if we were to allow arbitration proceedings to be stalled or nullified by ancillary litigation on minor issues of this type.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs complaint.
the parties in this martin schwartzberg and plaintiffs william dockser,william willoughby,and for years been involved in disputes and litigation arising out of a business relationship involving real estate.the parties concluded their litigation by entering into a definitive settlement agreement dsa in.unfortunately,this did not mark the end of their conflict,as schwartzberg has alleged that plaintiffs failed to meet an obligation under the dsa to pay him over million as his share of distributions of certain real estate partnerships.
the dsa specifies that disputes of this type are to be resolved by binding arbitration.section states in relevant part that 
such arbitration shall be conducted by,and pursuant to the rules of,the american arbitration association if within twenty days of service of the complainant notice of claim or complaint,the parties have not mutually agreed to an arbitrator,the arbitrator shall be chosen pursuant to the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association.
schwartzberg filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa on october.in the cover letter to the demand,schwartzberg requested that the dispute be arbitrated by a panel of three arbitrators,pursuant to rule a of the aaa procedures for large,complex commercial disputes.that rule provides as follows 
large,complex commercial cases shall be heard and determined by either one or three arbitrators,as may be agreed upon by the parties.if the parties are unable to agree upon the number of arbitrators and a claim or counterclaim involves at least,then three arbitrator s shall hear and determine the case.if the parties are unable to agree on the number of arbitrators and each claim and counterclaim is less than,then one arbitrator shall hear and determine the case.
the aaa has also specified how and by whom its rules are to be administered.rule of its commercial arbitration rules states that 
w hen parties agree to arbitrate under these rules,or when they provide for arbitration by the aaa and arbitration is initiated under these rules,they thereby authorize the aaa to administer the arbitration.the authority and duties of the aaa are prescribed in the agreement of the parties and in these rules,and may be carried out through such of the aaa representatives as it may direct.
rule further provides that the rules should be interpreted and applied by an arbitrator or by the aaa itself.
on november,plaintiffs filed a complaint in maryland state court,alleging that schwartzberg request for a panel violated the dsa.plaintiffs read of the dsa to expressly specify that a single arbitrator should hear the dispute.their complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the dsa requires schwartzberg claim to be heard and decided by a single arbitrator,and court appointment of this arbitrator pursuant to of the faa.
schwartzberg removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.see a,a.he then filed a rule b motion to dismiss,arguing that plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief they had requested.schwartzberg contends that does not apply because he has followed the method specified in the dsa,and that the question of the proper number of arbitrators is not for judicial resolution.
following oral argument,the district court issued a ruling from the bench granting the motion to dismiss.the aaa subsequently informed the parties via letter that three arbitrators would hear the dispute.
plaintiffs appeal the district court order.we review de novo a dismissal under rule b.see venkatraman rei,cir.
we first consider plaintiffs contention that the district court erred in failing to appoint an arbitrator under of the faa.section provides,in relevant part,that i f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators.plaintiffs contend that schwartzberg has failed to avail himself of the method of arbitrator appointment specified in of the dsa by requesting three arbitrators rather than one.
we can not agree.the operative language in states that the arbitrator shall be chosen pursuant to the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association.this is precisely the method of which schwartzberg has availed himself by sending a demand for arbitration to the aaa and requesting the appointment of three arbitrators.aaa rule a provides that since this dispute involves over million,three arbitrators should be appointed unless the parties have agree d upon the number of arbitrators.plaintiffs contend that the parties have in fact agreed upon a single arbitrator,presenting a number of reasons why the term arbitrator in of the dsa should be construed to mean a single individual rather than to refer more generically to an arbitral body of unspecified size.but these arguments implicate not the method of arbitrator the dsa specifies to be the rules and procedures of the rather the application of that method to these particular circumstances.they therefore do nothing to change the fact that schwartzberg has avail ed himself of the proper method by requesting arbitration under the aaa rules as he believes they should be applied.
plaintiffs reliance upon cargill rice,empresa nicaraguense dealimentos basicos,cir,is therefore misplaced.there,we examined an arbitration agreement and determined that for purposes of,t he arbitration clause expressly set forth the parties method for appointing arbitrators as appointment by mutual agreement of the parties.id.at.we then concluded that this method had not been followed where the arbitrators had determin ed their own jurisdiction by unilaterally appointing themselves.id.at.here,by contrast,the agreement expressly invokes a body of written rules to govern arbitrator selection,and schwartzberg has not avoided those rules.the question whether they have properly been applied falls outside the ambit of.
we therefore turn to consider whether,despite the district court inability to appoint an arbitrator itself pursuant to,it should have issued a declaratory judgment that a single arbitrator must be appointed under the rules and procedures of the aaa.this issue turns on whether application of the parties chosen method of arbitrator selection should be performed by a court or by the arbitral forum.
we conclude that the question of the number of arbitrators is one of arbitration procedure,and that the parties agreement does nothing to overcome the presumption that such questions are for arbitral,rather than judicial,resolution.
the purpose behind congress passage of the faa was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at english common law and had been adopted by american courts.gilmer lane,d.the faa therefore eliminates any bias in favor of judicial resolution of disputes,and establishes that where a contract includes an arbitration provision,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.moses cone,at.
