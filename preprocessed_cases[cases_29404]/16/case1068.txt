opinion of the court 
the babcock wilcox company b w commenced this action under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act ica,against kansas city southern railway company kcsr and norfolk southern railway company nsr collectively the railroads to recover damages to its boiler.the railroads appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of new jersey denying their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and granting b w for summary judgment.we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the matter with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
factual background and procedural history 
the following facts are undisputed.in october,b w,a manufacturer of power generation equipment,and kcsr entered into a rail transportation agreement the agreement provided for the transportation of steel power boilers,parts or attachments from west point,mississippi to newark,new jersey.contract,app.in november,pursuant to the agreement and a bill of lading,the railroads transported a boiler for b w.the parties stipulated that the railroads received the boiler in good order and condition.joint stipulation,app.in december,nsr became aware that the boiler was damaged,having been allegedly sideswiped by another train at a rail yard while in nsr care.nsr then notified b w of the damages.
in may,after nsr denied b w damage claim,b w commenced this action under the carmack amendment to the ica,against the railroads to recover in damages.the parties later stipulated that the railroads maximum liability under the agreement was.joint stipulation,app.the railroads moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.they argued that the agreement was not a common carrier transportation agreement under the ica but a private contract entered into under.defs.mot.to dismiss,docket entry.the railroads contended that the only basis for federal jurisdiction would have been diversity jurisdiction under,which was not satisfied because the damages sought did not meet the amount in controversy requirement for such jurisdiction.id.at.b w responded that the agreement was not a contract because the agreement did not state that it was made pursuant to.pl.mem.in opp to defs.mot to dismiss in supp.of cross mot.for summ,docket entry.b w also for summary judgment on its claim.
the district court denied the railroads motion to dismiss.the court concluded that it had jurisdiction because there was no evidence suggesting that the parties had any intention of invoking.babcock wilcox kansas city ry,civ,wl,at.the court stated that in order to invoke section,a contract must specifically incorporate the same but that it found no such incorporation in the agreement.id.at.the court rejected the railroads argument that the agreement content evinced the parties intent to invoke.id.the court also found no evidence of intent at the time of execution of the agreement to invoke.id.exercising jurisdiction,the district court granted b w for summary judgment and entered judgment in the amount of in favor of b id.at.the railroads now appeal,challenging only the ruling on jurisdiction.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to review a final judgment under.we review the question of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction de novo.emerald investors trust gaunt parsippany partners,cir.if we conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,we will direct it to dismiss the case even at this late stage of the litigation.id.
discussion 
the railroads maintain that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the agreement was not a common carrier transportation agreement under the ica but,rather,a private contract entered into under.they claim that the district court erred in concluding that a contract must reference the statute and in determining that the agreement terms do not evince intent to invoke.
requirement 
whether contracts must be is an open question in this court.review of the legislative history of and the history of the corresponding federal regulations,however,indicate that the law currently imposes no such requirement.
legislative and regulatory history 
in,congress enacted the ica to regulate interstate transportation and established the interstate commerce commission icc to administer the act.emerson supply estes express lines,cir.the ica initially did not set forth provisions governing carrier liability for loss of or damage to goods being transported.id.in,congress enacted the carmack amendment,which required carriers to issue a receipt or bill of lading for property received for transportation and held carriers liable for any loss,damage,or injury to the property resulting from the transportation thereof in claims arising out of the receipt or bill of lading.id.the purpose of the carmack amendment was to relieve shippers of the burden of searching out a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carriers handling an interstate shipment of goods.union pac.greentree transp.trucking,cir quoting reider thompson.the provision of the carmack amendment governing the liability of rail carriers,holds rail carriers liable for the actual loss or injury to property.a.district courts have original jurisdiction of an action brought under if the matter in controversy for each receipt or bill of lading exceeds.a.the amount in controversy here is.
in and,the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act and staggers rail act staggers,respectively,were enacted to deregulate the railroad industry to enable it to compete efficiently in the transportation industry.staggers rail act of,stat.railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of,stat.under staggers,the predecessor to enabled shippers and carriers to sidestep federal regulation of transportation agreements by entering into private contracts.staggers rail act of,at conf,reprinted in,see also repealed current version at.such private contracts are not governed by the ica,including,and the exclusive remedy for any actions arising out of such a contract shall be an action in an appropriate state court or united states district court,unless the parties otherwise agree.h i current version at c.section now clarifies that the section does not confer original jurisdiction on the district courts of the united states based on or.c.
predecessor required rail carriers to file with the icc any private contract along with a summary of contract information.b.section granted the icc authority to determine the essential terms to be made available to the public.id.the filing requirements were enacted to achieve a balance between protecting the confidentiality of private contracts,making information available to enable parties with standing to exercise their rights to challenge the contracts,and enabling the icc to exercise its remaining regulatory function of approving or disapproving contracts.see generally burlington pub.util.comm of,cir water transp.ass,cir.
to implement the filing requirements of,the icc promulgated regulations in part repealed current version at part.railroad transportation contracts.the icc defined contract as follows 
section definition of the term contract.
a a contract subject to this section is a written agreement entered into by one or more rail carriers with one or more purchasers of rail services,to provide specified services under specified rates,charges and conditions.
b a contract filed under this section shall 
specify that the contract is made pursuant to,and 
be signed by duly authorized parties.
id.at see also current version at c.the icc adopted the subsection b requirement in response to suggestions by its office of special counsel osc to specify which contracts would be subject to,as there were many different types of contracts specifically referred to in the ica which were administered by the icc.railroad transportation contracts.the osc wanted to clarify that the scope of the term contract would be limited to those contracts intended to be filed under.id.the icc retained this definition when it moved to in.see railroad transportation contracts,interim,see also amended and.
thus,in light of the history behind the enactment of predecessor and promulgation of corresponding regulations,the regulatory requirement appears to have been created to aid the icc in administering the filing of private contracts.supporting this conclusion is the fact that the requirement was deleted from the regulations when congress eliminated the requirement.
in,the icc eliminated from the regulations the requirement for agreements governing transportation of commodities.railroad transportation contracts.the icc,however,still required that carriers file contract summaries of information.id.at.the full filing requirements remained for contracts governing transportation of agricultural commodities,and the regulations still required that such contracts be.see id.at,see also amended.

thereafter,the stb revised the regulations to reflect the reduced regulatory oversight of rail transportation contracts introduced by the iccta.railroad contracts,see also removal of obsolete regulations concerning railroad contracts,june.under revised part,the stb redefined contract as an agreement,including any amendment thereto,entered into by one or more rail carriers and one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified transportation of agricultural products under specified rates and conditions.railroad contracts,at see also c.this new definition does not contain a requirement.see c.the deletion of this requirement after congress no longer required carriers to file any full private contracts,whether they governed transportation of agricultural or commodities,further indicates that the requirement was created for the purpose of efficiency.
also supporting the conclusion that is not required is a recent proposal by the stb to adopt a rule.in march,the stb instituted a rulemaking proceeding to adopt an interpretation of contract to more easily distinguish between a common carrier pricing arrangement and a rail transportation contract.interpretation of the term contract in,stb ex parte,wl,at stb march.the rulemaking proceeding was instituted in response to kansas city power light union pacific railroad kcpl,stb docket,wl stb march,which concerned an agreement that appears to have all of the characteristics of a rail transportation contract but which the carrier labeled as a common carrier rate.id.at.in kcpl,to determine if it had jurisdiction over the proceeding,the stb had to decide whether the agreement provided for a common carrier rate or a contract rate.kcpl,wl,at.the stb exercised jurisdiction despite the unclear nature of the agreement because it thought the parties could have reasonably relied on prior agency precedent to conclude that the agreement was subject to the stb jurisdiction.id.at.the stb,however,instituted a rulemaking proceeding to clarify the distinction between a common carrier agreement and private contract.id.at.in the proceeding,the stb proposed to define contract under as 
any bilateral agreement between a carrier and a shipper for rail transportation in which the railroad agrees to a specific rate for a specific period of time in exchange for consideration from the shipper,such as a commitment to tender a specific amount of freight during a specific period or to make specific investments in rail facilities.
interpretation of the term contract in,wl,at see also interpretation of the term contract in,proposed.objections of shippers and carriers led the stb to discontinue the proceeding,however.interpretation of the term contract in,stb ex parte,wl,at stb served march.
nonetheless,still concerned with the lack of any clear demarcation between common carriage rates and contract pricing arrangements and the resulting ambiguity regarding the stb jurisdiction,the stb instituted a subsequent rulemaking proceeding to consider imposing a requirement that each carrier provide a full disclosure statement when it seeks to enter into a rail transportation contract under section.id.at see also rail transportation contracts under,proposed.according to the stb,such a disclosure statement would explicitly advise the shipper that the carrier intends the document to be a rail transportation contract,and that any transportation under the document would not be subject to regulation by the stb.interpretation of the term contract in,wl,at see also rail transportation contracts under.at.in january,after reviewing public comments on the proposal,the stb proposed to add the following provision to part 
contract disclosure statement.
a the board will not find jurisdiction over a dispute involving the rate or service under a rail transportation agreement where that agreement contains a disclosure statement that conforms with paragraphs b and c of this section.conversely,where a rail transportation agreement fails to contain such a disclosure statement,the board will find jurisdiction over a dispute involving the rate or service provided under that agreement,absent clear and convincing evidence both that the parties intended to enter into a rail transportation contract governed by and that the shipper was made aware that it could request service under a common carrier tariff rate that would be subject to stb jurisdiction.
b the disclosure statement should appear at the top of the first page of the rail transportation agreement in type size at least as large as the type size used for the body of the agreement.
c the disclosure statement should read as follows disclosure agreement constitutes a rail transportation contract under.contract arrangements are generally not subject to challenge before the surface transportation board stb,but can be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction.under federal rules found at cfr,railroads are required,upon request,to quote to shippers a rate for common carriage transportation,a rate.pursuant to,the stb has jurisdiction subject to some exceptions over disputes arising out of common carriage rates.
rail transportation contracts under,stb ex parte,wl,at stb,see also rail transportation contracts under,proposed.the proposed rule,if adopted,would apply prospectively.rail transportation contracts under,wl,at see also rail transportation contracts under.at.the proposal to promulgate such a rule confirms that there is currently no requirement.
recent case law 
despite the legislative history of,the district court placed considerable reliance on schoenmann produce burlington northern santa fe railway,d,in concluding that contracts must cite the statute.the district court interpreted schoenmann as holding that in order to invoke section,a contract must specifically incorporate the same.babcock,wl,at.
schoenmann analyzes the interplay of,and,an issue that is not before us and one that we need not address.the issue there was whether an action that was initiated to recover damages to shipments that were subjected to a limited liability provision should be brought under or.see d at.the plaintiff shipper,which initiated suit in state court,argued that the action should be brought under.id.at.the defendant railroads,which removed the action to federal court,argued that the action should have been brought under.id.at.the district court held that governed.id.at.the court first determined that did not apply to shipments because shipments were exempt from subtitle iv of title of the ica,which included.id.at.the court also determined that did not govern because none of the shipping documents referenced.id.the court reasoned 
contracts entered into under section specifically cite the statute.see,glenn hunter,union pacific,cir unpublished opinion this contract is made pursuant to tamini trasformatori union pacific,wl,at,unpublished opinion holding that contract was not a section contract,even though it contained a statement that it was entered pursuant to section,because it failed to offer full carmack liability as an option am.rock salt norfolk,d,holding that carmack amendment applied even though the contract stated that it was made pursuant to because other provisions in the contract provided for its application pci,fort worth,cir citing stb decision that contracts were governed by section when e ach contract affirmatively stated that it was made pursuant to,identified the origins and destinations,and specified the terms of the contract and the rates for the commodities.
id.the court also relied on the icc decision and former regulation implementing predecessor that stated that agreements made under must specifically state that it is subject to this section.id.quoting railroad transportation contracts,at b.the court then held that an action to recover damages to the shipments was brought under,despite a limitation on liability.id.at.
the district court reliance on schoenmann for the proposition that contracts must cite the provision is problematic.first,schoenmann merely noted that contracts in other cases have referred to the statute,but the fact that other parties incorporate the statute into their agreements does not mean that such a requirement exists further,none of these referenced cases hold that contracts must cite the provision.second,schoenmann found guidance in an obsolete icc decision and regulation.as we observed,and the corresponding regulations were repealed,and the stb deleted the requirement from the regulations,years before schoenmann was decided.
we conclude based on the relevant legislative and regulatory history that the failure of the agreement at issue to cite is not fatal to the railroads claim that the agreement is a contract.thus,we turn to other indicia of intent.
ii.intent to invoke

the railroads claim that,according to its terms,the agreement encompassed all the attributes of a contract under the plain language of,specifically that it was i an agreement to provide specified services,ii to which one or more interstate rail carriers are parties and iii to which one or more purchasers of rail services are parties,iv under specified rates and v under specified conditions.appellants br.in particular,the railroads contend that the contract was between kcsr,an interstate railroad,and b w,a purchaser of rail services for the specific service of rail transportation of steel power boilers,parts or attachments from west point,ms to newark,nj via the route of and for a specific confidential rate.appellants br.the railroads further assert that the specified conditions in the agreement deviate from the statutory obligations that the ica imposes on rail carriers under.they claim that such deviation also evinces the parties intent to enter into a contract.we agree with the railroads on each of these points.
section sets forth the statutory obligations of rail carriers concerning provision of services and publication of common carrier rates and service terms.under,rail carriers must provide service and their rates and service terms to the public upon request.id.a,b.the carriers may not increase their rates or change their service terms unless they have provided days written notice to those who have requested the rates or terms or those who have made shipping arrangements that would be affected by the increased rates or changed terms.id.c.the carriers must provide transportation or service in accordance with the rates and service terms as published or made available under.id.e.section directs the stb to implement the section by establishing corresponding regulations to provide for immediate disclosure and dissemination of rates and service terms,including classifications,rules,and practices,and their effective dates.id.f see also pt.except for,which defines the scope of the rules,the regulations parallel the statutory requirements.see pt.title states that the regulations do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under or former.c.
although requires rail carriers to provide service and rates for the service to the public upon request,the agreement at issue here contains a single rate specific to b b w does not dispute the railroads contention that this rate is neither published nor available to the public.appellants br.although permits rail carriers to change their service terms upon days notice,under the agreement,the service terms here were effective from october,through september,with p rice subject to cancellation on day s notice.contract,app.further,the agreement is a confidential railroad transportation contract,which applies to only steel power boilers,parts or attachments,limits liability to per vessel,and applies to a minimum weight of pounds.id.these specific terms and conditions deviate from the common carrier obligations imposed by the ica and evince intent to enter into a contract.see siemens power transmission distribution,union pac,no,wl,at,finding contract where certain provisions in bills of lading explicitly deviate d from the requirements of the carmack amendment tokio marine fire ins.mitsui lines,no.cv er,wl,at.june,concluding that agreement was contract because it was exempt rail transportation agreement and provide d rail transportation pursuant to specified rates and conditions union pac.for declaratory order,stb finance,wl,at stb served may,noting that certain contract terms,such as fixed rates for a term of years,minimum volume requirements,service commitments,liquidated damages provisions,and force majeure clauses,were indicia of a rail transportation contract dupont de nemours csx,stb,wl,at stb served,concluding that agreement labeled confidential not contract because it was unclear whether terms were consistent with obligations under and which terms were confidential,and because extrinsic evidence showed no intent to contract for private rates aggregate volume rate on coal,acco,utah to moapa,concluding that agreement providing a specific price term a particularized quantity and term and a specified duration would have been contract but for lack of meeting of the minds.b w does not show how the contract terms here conform with or submit any evidence to negate a finding of intent to enter into a private contract
