background 
on february,columbus,ohio airport police found farris in possession of counterfeit american express traveler checks and arrested him secret service special agent joseph scargill scargill conducted a interview of harris on the same day,during which harris told scargill about his activities regarding the possession of the american express checks.scargill did not ask harris,nor did harris tell scargill,about any other counterfeiting activities id.harris then entered into a plea agreement agreement with the united states as to that possession charge.that charge is not the subject of the current appeal,but these provisions of the agreement are relevant here 
defendant harris will enter a plea of guilty to count of the information filed herein which charges him with possession of counterfeit securities,in violation of a.
defendant harris agrees to provide a complete statement pertaining to the information filed herein and to any and all other counterfeit securities activities in which he may have been involved or as to which he may have knowledge.defendant further agrees to provide a complete statement to authorities of the united states concerning such matters prior to the entry of his guilty plea pursuant to this agreement.defendant agrees to submit to supplemental debriefings on such matters whenever requested by authorities of the united states whether before or after his plea is entered.
pursuant to b of the federal sentencing guidelines,the government agrees that any information so provided will not be used against the defendant in determining the applicable guideline range for sentencing or for departure therefrom.
if such plea of guilty is entered,and not withdrawn,and defendant harris acts in accordance with all other terms of this agreement,the united states attorney for the southern district of ohio agrees not to file additional criminal charges against defendant harris based on the counterfeit securities activities charged in the information or based on other counterfeit activities in the southern district of ohio occurring prior to the date of the information and as to which defendant gives testimony or makes statements pursuant to this agreement.
as required by the agreement,on april,harris entered a plea of guilty to one count of possession of counterfeit securities 
meanwhile secret service special agent william shink shink was engaged in a separate investigation of a counterfeit securities conspiracy operating in the dayton,ohio area.in the course of that investigation,shink who had no knowledge of the charges to which harris had pleaded guilty had occasion to go to harris residence in an effort to speak to him,but harris refused.
nevertheless shink eventually gathered enough evidence to enable the government to indict harris and five others under and a on charges of conspiring to make,utter and possess counterfeit payroll and business checks from a number of businesses not including american express.that indictment,returned on december,charged that the conspiracy had lasted from at least january up to and including october.id.
at no point during either the initial possession case or the later conspiracy case did harris give any statement to any government representative concerning the counterfeiting activities underlying the conspiracy indictment.and importantly in light of the agreement provisions,there is no evidence that any government agent undertook any effort to debrief harris on the subject of his overall knowledge of counterfeit securities activities during the interval between the signing of the agreement and the entry of his guilty plea to the criminal information.
after the denial of his initial motion to dismiss the conspiracy indictment,harris followed up with the motion,arguing that the conspiracy indictment had breached the agreement and that the only available and meaningful remedy for that breach was dismissal of the indictment.in particular harris argued that the government had breached by failing to debrief him and thereby provide him with the opportunity to obtain the benefits of the government promise not to prosecute him for crimes about which he would give statements.
while the district court assume d for present purposes that the plea agreement implicitly obligated the government to debrief harris,it found that obligation had been fulfilled by shink spurned attempt to question harris.hence it denied the motion id.harris now appeals that denial.
governing principles and standard of review 
plea agreements are contractual in nature,so we use traditional contract law principles in interpreting and enforcing them.united states lukse,cir.but because plea agreements constitutional and supervisory implications raise concerns over and above those present in the traditional contract context,in interpreting such agreements we hold the government to a greater degree of responsibility than the defendant or possibly than would be either of the parties to commercial contracts for imprecisions or ambiguities in the plea agreements.united states johnson,cir,quoting united states harvey,cir.and once such an agreement is interpreted,the burden of proving its breach falls on the party asserting the breach.united states smith,cir.
as to our standard of review on appeal,while we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,all conclusions of law,questions of mixed law and fact and findings of ultimate facts which result from the application of legal principles to subsidiary factual determinations are subject to de novo review.brentwood.secondary sch.athletic ass n,cir.we apply those standards in the ensuing analysis.
obligations under the agreement 
like all contracts,the agreement imposed obligations on both parties.while harris argues that the government breached its obligation to debrief him,the government urges that it was rather harris who breached his obligation to provide statements about his counterfeiting activities,so that his request for of his be denied.as the discussion below explains,we hold that the government did indeed breach its obligation under the agreement,but that the record is insufficient to determine whether harris breached as well.
government obligation 
agreement speaks of two types of possible statements by harris an initial statement,to be provided before entry of his guilty plea,and supplemental debriefings to which he must submit whenever requested,either before or after entry of the plea.when those provisions are read together the universal principle of contract construction,they required the united states to provide harris an opportunity to give such obligation that the government failed to meet.
in that respect the key to an integrated reading of the agreement is its reference to supplemental debriefings.both in common parlance and as a matter of common sense,a debriefing denotes an eliciting of information through active inquiry.as webster third new int l dictionary unabridged,puts it,to debrief is to interrogate as a pilot returning from mission or a government official returning from abroad in order to obtain useful information or intelligence.
that being so,the same concept of an integrated reading of the agreement carries with it the proposition that for the later potential statements to be supplemental debriefings,the initial statement that harris agreed to provide in the first sentence of agreement was also to be provided in the course of a debriefing.again such a reading is eminently sensible,even apart from the resolution of any arguable ambiguities in the agreement against the g
