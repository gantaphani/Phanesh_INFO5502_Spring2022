these appeals arise from disputes as to liability for cleanup of hazardous substances at a former fertilizer manufacturing site in charleston,south carolina.after incurring response costs,ashley ii of charleston,the current owner of a portion of the site,brought a cost recovery action against pcs nitrogen,under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.pcs counterclaimed and also brought contribution actions against parties with past and current connections to the site.the district court bifurcated the case for trial.at the conclusion of the first bench trial,it found pcs a potentially responsible party jointly and severally liable for response costs at the site.at the conclusion of the second bench trial,the court found some of the other parties,including ashley,potentially responsible parties,each liable for an allocated portion of the site response costs.pcs,ashley,and many of the other parties now appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
congress enacted cercla in response to the increasing environmental and health problems associated with inactive hazardous waste sites.nurad,william hooper sons,cir.cercla was designed to promote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.burlington santa fe ry.united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
in furtherance of these goals,cercla allows private parties to recover the costs of cleaning up hazardous wastes from certain defined types of person.axel johnson,carroll carolina oil,cir.a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for cost recovery under cercla by establishing that the defendant is a potentially responsible person prp the site constitutes a facility a release or a threatened release of hazardous substances exists at the facility the plaintiff has incurred costs responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances response costs and the response costs conform to the national contingency plan,a see abb indus,prime,cir.
section a establishes strict liability.see united states monsanto,cir.this liability under cercla is subject only to a few narrow defenses and exemptions.see b defenses id.o r exemptions.liability is,by default,joint and several.see monsanto,at.
however,in some circumstances a prp may mitigate the sting of cercla imposition of joint and several liability by apportionment or allocation of harm.see axel johnson,at.apportionment also known as division of damages assigns a several share of liability to each prp based on traditional and evolving principles of federal common law.monsanto,at.under these principles,apportionment is available only when a prp proves that there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.burlington northern,at quoting restatement second of torts b.
in contrast,allocation of harm also known as contribution is available to any party sued under a,and allows the party to seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under a.f.the district court may then allocate several liability for response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.see,se.chem.solvent,cir 
central to this cercla case is the history of the site at issue here approximately acres located in charleston,south carolina.as a result of decades of phosphate fertilizer production,the westernmost acres of the site require remediation of soils contaminated with arsenic,lead,and other hazardous substances.the evidence presented at the two bench trials established the following facts.
from to the early,seven phosphate fertilizer plants operated in close proximity to the site and provided potential sources for pyrite waste that may have been disposed of on the site prior to.
planters fertilizer phosphate company,now known as ross development corporation,purchased the site in.planters manufactured phosphate fertilizer at the site by reacting sulfuric acid with phosphate rock.planters produced the sulfuric acid for the process,and stored the acid in tanks.prior to the,planters used pyrite ore as the primary fuel for its sulfuric acid production.the burning of pyrite ore generated a pyrite slag byproduct containing high concentrations of arsenic and lead.planters spread the slag byproduct to stabilize roads on the site.this accounts for the vast majority of arsenic and lead contamination found on the site today.
planters continued operating its fertilizer production plant on the site until.during that time,planters constructed and repaired several minor buildings and,after a fire destroyed a significant portion of its original acid plant,constructed a modernized acid plant.on june,planters sold the site including the plant and its equipment to columbia nitrogen corporation old cnc.
old cnc continued operations of the acid and fertilizer plants until and,respectively.although old cnc did not use pyrite ore,its superphosphate fertilizer production generated dust that contained elevated levels of arsenic and lead,and contributed to arsenic and lead soil contamination on the site.during its operations,old cnc constructed a new granulation plant and converted the former granulation plant into storage.
in april,a wind storm extensively damaged many buildings on the site,including the acid plant,and dispersed contaminated materials across the site.old cnc chose not to repair,and instead demolished,the damaged acid plant.in the process,old cnc disturbed the subsurface soil to a depth of at least two feet.by october,old cnc had ceased all fertilizer production on the site.
the site remained inactive until,when old cnc began to dismantle the remaining structures,a process completed in january.all told,old cnc construction and demolition activities between and affected nearly eighty percent of the area of contaminated soils that needs to be remediated as part of the site cleanup.in may,old cnc sold the site to james holcombe and henry fair collectively holcombe and fair.but in doing so,old cnc apparently did not transfer any of its corporate liabilities for past actions on the site thus,as the parties agree,old cnc if still in existence would be a prp with respect to the site.see infra.
old cnc did not limit its fertilizer production to the site.rather,while owning the site,old cnc also owned and operated an ammonia and nitrogen fertilizer plant in augusta,georgia.in,over a year after old cnc had sold its charleston site,old cnc parent corporations,koninklijke dsm and dsm chemicals north america collectively dsm parties,decided to shut down old cnc to benefit from a million tax advantage in the netherlands.to do so,old cnc sought a buyer for certain assets and its acquired business,including its augusta plant and operation.andlinger company,a firm specializing in the acquisition of businesses,incorporated cnc new cnc to purchase old cnc assets and acquired business.
old cnc and new cnc entered into a series of agreements,and the acquisition closed on november.under the acquisition agreement,new cnc purchased certain assets and the acquired business for million,an approximately sixty percent discount from book value.in exchange for an additional million discount,new cnc accepted the acquired business and assets as is.after closing,new cnc immediately changed its name to columbia nitrogen corporation the same name under which old cnc operated.at the same time,old cnc initiated the process of liquidation and dissolution.
after the acquisition,new cnc continued producing ammonia and fertilizers at the augusta plant.by virtue of a series of mergers and acquisitions,pcs nitrogen,is a successor to new cnc.neither new cnc nor pcs ever owned or operated any portion of the charleston site at issue in this appeal.
meanwhile,holcombe and fair,who had acquired the charleston site from old cnc in,were unaware of any contamination at the site.they first became aware of the presence of hazardous substances at the site in.
holcombe and fair intended to subdivide and lease the site,and the record contains no evidence that holcombe and fair introduced any new hazardous substances to the site.however,even after learning of the possibility and ultimate existence of hazardous substances on the site,holcombe and fair undertook activities,including the construction of a street extension,the addition of water and sewer lines,excavation and grading,and the construction of several detention ponds.as late as,holcombe and fair undertook activities in areas with discolored and contaminated soils,and destroyed wetlands along the ashley river.however,they also added a inch limestone run of crusher cover over the majority of the site,which mitigated risks of acute exposure to the site contaminated soils.
during their ownership,holcombe and fair subdivided and conveyed several parcels from the original site.first,in december,holcombe and fair sold three acres of the site to max and marlene mast.the masts sold their parcel to allwaste tank cleaning,in august.allwaste operated a shipping container cleaning and storage business and in leased two additional acres from holcombe and fair for storage.as part of its operations,allwaste utilized an underground sump system to capture wastewater generated by the process and pump it into a treatment system.allwaste allowed the sumps to deteriorate during its ownership of the parcel to the extent that the sumps presented a threat of a release of hazardous substances.although did not introduce arsenic or lead to its parcel,both contaminate the soils in its parcel.allwaste still owned the parcel at the commencement of this action.
in december,holcombe and fair contracted to sell two acres of the site to robin hood container express rhce.in december,rhce directed and paid for the excavation of a cubic foot pond,two asphalt driveways,and extended sewer and water lines on the site.contractors for rhce also stripped six inches of topsoil and graded and the land.a month later,holcombe and fair conveyed the parcel to rhce president,robin hood,who leased it to rhce to operate a dropyard.during its tenure,rhce filled in the pond,and limestone run of crusher now covers the entire parcel.although rhce did not introduce any arsenic or lead to its leasehold,both contaminate its leasehold soil.robin hood continued to own,and rhce continued to lease,this parcel at the commencement of this action.
in december,holcombe and fair conveyed the street extension they had constructed,totaling acres,to the city of charleston by quitclaim deed.the city remains the owner of the street extension today.
finally,in november,holcombe and fair sold their remaining acres of the site to ashley ii of charleston,for million.ashley purchased the site to include it as a portion of its magnolia development a sustainable,project.as with other parcels within the project,ashley purchased the site with knowledge of,and the intent to remediate,the contaminated soils.
by the time of ashley ownership,the run of crusher cover had degraded,leaving contaminated soil exposed in many areas.for several years,ashley allowed a trash pile to accumulate on its parcel.
in february well after the commencement of this action ashley contracted with allwaste to purchase allwaste parcel.ashley engaged in extensive prepurchase environmental assessments of the parcel,and conveyed the parcel to ashley in may.
in investigating and remediating the site,ashley to date has incurred response costs totaling at least 
on september,ashley filed this action,seeking a declaratory judgment that pcs was jointly and severally liable for response costs as a prp for the site,and recovery of response costs already incurred.see a b.ashley contended that pcs was a successor corporation to old cnc,and thus liable as a prp in old cnc stead.
pcs denied liability as a successor corporation to old cnc,and in the alternative filed a contribution counterclaim under f against ashley and claims against ross,the dsm parties,holcombe and fair,allwaste,rhce,and the city of charleston.those parties in turn filed counter and against one another under f,and also sought determination of their rights to future cost recovery and contribution.
the district court bifurcated the proceedings.the first trial would determine if pcs was liable to ashley under a.if so,the second trial would allocate the ultimate responsibility of each party for response costs at the site under f.
on september,after a bench trial on pcs liability,the court held that pcs was a corporate successor to old cnc,and thus jointly and severally liable to ashley for response costs as a prp for the site.a year later,the presiding judge disqualified himself from further participation in the case,and the case was reassigned to another judge.on june,the successor judge denied pcs motion to vacate the original judge order as to pcs liability.shortly thereafter,the court granted summary judgment to the dsm parties,holding them not liable because no basis existed for imputing old cnc acts to them.
then,between october and january,the district court held a bench trial on the allocation phase.the court ultimately allocated liability for past and future response costs at the site to pcs,ashley,ross,holcombe and fair,rhce,and allwaste in various amounts.
these appeals followed.on appeal,no party disputes that ashley incurred response costs for the cleanup of hazardous substances at the site that were consistent with the national contingency plan.rather,the parties solely dispute whether and to what amount each is liable for response costs at the site.
we first address the appeals of the district court determinations as to which parties constitute prps for the site.
cercla defines four exclusive classes of prps liable for costs incurred in responding to a release of hazardous substances at any facility.a see nurad,at.these prps include the current owner or operator of a facility any person who owned or operated the facility at the time of disposal of a hazardous substance any person who arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at the facility and any person who accepts hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites.a nurad,at.the classes of prps have an undeniably broad reach.see united states atl.research,d.but they nonetheless remain subject to the limitations of derivative liability inherent in corporate law.see united states bestfoods,d.
a prp strict liability for response costs is subject only to cercla limited defenses and exemptions.axel johnson,at.courts do not consider equity in determining whether a party is a prp.congress,however,did provide for equitable allocation of liability under f to mitigate any inequity arising from cercla strict liability scheme.id.at.
with these principles in mind,we review the district court determinations of prp status de novo.see pneumo abex high point,thomasville denton,cir.we first consider pcs appeal of the determination that it is a prp.then,we turn to the multiple challenges to the determinations of the other parties prp status in the second trial.
the district court held that pcs is a prp for the charleston site as the corporate successor to old cnc.although pcs never owned or operated the site,it admits that it is a successor to new cnc,and that old cnc despite dissolving decades ago would be a prp.
under cercla,successor corporations may be liable for the actions of their predecessors.united states carolina transformer,cir.however,as at common law,a corporation that acquires the assets of another corporation typically does not acquire its liabilities,unless the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the liabilities of the predecessor the transaction may be considered a de facto merger the successor may be considered a mere continuation of the predecessor or the transaction is fraudulent.id.at.in the past,we have also recognized successor liability where substantial continuity exists between a predecessor and successor corporation.id.
the district court held pcs liable as a successor to old cnc under three theories.we need only address one that new cnc either unambiguously,or based on extrinsic evidence,assumed old cnc liabilities for the site under the acquisition agreement.in doing so,we review the district court applications of contract principles de novo,and its findings of fact with respect to extrinsic evidence for clear error.hendricks cent.reserve life ins,cir.under the acquisition agreement choice of law provision,we apply new york contract law.
new york law enforces unambiguous contracts in accordance with their plain terms,giancontieri.in determining whether a contract is ambiguous,a court must 
examine the entire contract and consider the relation of the parties and the circumstances under which it was executed.particular words should be considered,not as if isolated from the context,but in the light of the obligation as a whole and the intention of the parties as manifested thereby.form should not prevail over substance,and a sensible meaning of words should be sought.
william atwater panama.thus,when considering isolated,potentially conflicting provisions,so long as a contract makes clear the parties intention,a court should then choose that construction which will carry out the plain purpose and object of the agreement.kass kass,internal quotation marks omitted.in harmonizing provisions,however,no provision of a contract should be left without force and effect.muzak hotel taft.
applying these principles,the district court initially held,as ashley maintained,that new cnc unambiguously assumed old cnc cercla liabilities for the charleston site under the acquisition agreement.we can not agree.
section of the agreement,on which the district court relied,does unambiguously transfer a ll obligations required to be performed under all court,administrative and regulatory orders.but does not address,let alone unambiguously provide,that it covers cercla obligations arising after execution of the agreement.
ashley alternatively argues that new cnc unambiguously assumed old cnc cercla liability for the site in of the agreement.this argument fares no better.all parties recognize that under new cnc did assume unknown,future cercla liability.the liability assumed,however,was only that arising out of or in connection with the acquired business or the purchased assets.
it is undisputed that the phrase arising out of or in connection with would transfer liabilities from businesses or assets no longer owned by a seller in a stock sale.but typically this phrase does not transfer such liabilities in an asset sale.see honeywell int l,phillips petroleum,cir.the acquisition agreement does not clearly establish whether the parties intended an ordinary asset sale or an atypical asset sale that was to be treated as a stock sale.rather,the agreement ambiguously provides that new cnc assume s all obligations and liabilities relating to the acquired business as if old cnc were to sell and new cnc were to purchase the stock of old cnc on the open market.this ambiguity prevents us from concluding that under the agreement new cnc unambiguously assumed old cnc cercla liabilities for the charleston site.
this ambiguity also defeats pcs contention that the acquisition agreement clearly provides that new cnc did not assume old cnc cercla liabilities for the site.for pcs can point to no language in the agreement which clarifies that,even if this were an atypical asset sale,new cnc assumed no cercla liabilities for the site.
at its outset,iii of the agreement does,as pcs contends,limit the transfer of liabilities and obligations to new cnc to those relating to the acquired business and purchased assets.but pcs heavy reliance on the narrowness of this relating to language at the beginning of iii ignores language at the end of that same section that provides that transferred liabilities include without limitation,the liabilities and obligations described below in.among the liabilities described below are those in,which provides that new cnc will assume not only the certain obligations relating to the acquired business and purchased assets but also those applicable to the seller.where a general provision like that at the outset of iii conflicts with a specific provision like that in,the specific provision controls.muzak,at.
therefore,we can not accept either party arguments that the agreement unambiguously determines whether new cnc assumed old cnc cercla liability for the site.
usually,when we conclude that a district court has erred in holding a contract unambiguous,we must remand for a factual determination of the parties intent based on consideration of extrinsic evidence.see,atalla abdul baki,cir.however,in this case,the district court has already analyzed the extrinsic evidence offered by the parties during the bench trial,and alternatively found based on that evidence that new cnc intended to and did acquire cercla liabilities for the site under the acquisition agreement.we review a district court factual finding as to intent for clear error.see hendricks,at.we can reverse only if,after reviewing the entire record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley cromartie,d internal quotation marks omitted.this rigorous standard does not permit reversal here.
the district court based its ultimate factual finding that extrinsic evidence established that new cnc intended to assume cercla liability for the charleston site on several predicate findings.when considering ambiguity,the court initially found that even if the as if clause in the agreement did not evince the parties intent to enter into something very akin to a stock sale,at the very least the clause was ambiguous.thus,the court considered the extrinsic evidence and found it demonstrated that the parties did intend to enter into an agreement tantamount to a stock sale,as if meant equivalent to.
in support of this critical finding,the district relied on the abundant extrinsic evidence that new cnc knew of old cnc determination to dissolve by december,to preserve the million tax advantage.the court found that new cnc knowledge of old cnc paramount aim to avail itself of this tax advantage supported ashley contention that the parties old cnc and new cnc agreed that new cnc would acquire all of old cnc that was not specifically retained or sold to another entity.given that no one contends that old cnc cercla liability for the charleston site was specifically retained or sold to another entity,the court found this evidence supported ashley position that old cnc transferred this liability to new cnc.
the district court also pointed to the extrinsic evidence that old cnc discounted its sale price of million by sixty percent from book value,and discounted an additional million from the sale price in exchange for new cnc assumption of the business and assets as is,including unknown environmental liabilities.the court noted that new cnc lawyer on the transaction testified that the principals at new cnc were comfortable enough with their due diligence to conclude that any unknown liabilities would not exceed million.to date,of course,the cercla cleanup costs for the site do not approach that number.the court concluded that the heavily discounted purchase price further reduced by the million discount for acceptance as is constituted additional extrinsic evidence that new cnc acquired all of old cnc that was not specifically retained or sold to another entity,new cnc acquired cercla liability for the charleston site.
finally,the court found that new cnc intended to acquire substantially all of old cnc including its environmental liabilities evidenced by two other agreements that new cnc entered into at the same time as the acquisition agreement.one of these agreements governed future advances,and the other contained guarantees signed by the chairman of new cnc.in both,new cnc stated that it was purchasing substantially all of old cnc liabilities.the court noted that these contemporaneous statements by new cnc contradict ed its litigation position as to the limited nature of the liabilities acquired.
based on these facts,the court found that the parties intended to and in the acquisition agreement did transfer all of old cnc assets and liabilities not explicitly retained or sold to another entity,including old cnc latent cercla liabilities for the site.
pcs maintains that the district court clearly erred in so finding.pcs first contends that,contrary to the district court conclusions,old cnc foremost intent to dissolve for tax benefit purposes and its agreement to discount its price if new cnc assumed the assets as is are irrelevant as to the actual scope of the liabilities transferred.that characterization seems to us to be an overstatement.while these facts are not dispositive,the district court could certainly find them relevant.pcs also points to evidence that after the sale old cnc never transferred to new cnc records relating to the site including those regarding environmental contamination that new cnc was so cautious about assuming environmental liabilities that it did not acquire the land underlying the augusta plant and that some of the parties involved in the transaction testified that new cnc only intended to acquire the augusta plant and operations.although these facts are helpful to pcs position,none require a finding in its favor.
finally,pcs contends that,although recital b describes the agreement as if it were a stock sale,at the time the agreement was executed witnesses at trial agreed that the sale transferred only assets.if the undisputed evidence at trial had established such contemporaneous agreement between old cnc and new cnc,then pcs might well have been entitled to judgment.but the trial evidence did not establish this agreement.in fact,only pcs witnesses agreed on this point,and the district court was free to weigh their testimony against the contrary,evidence offered by ashley.
this is not to say pcs did not present evidence from which the district court could have resolved the agreement ambiguity in its favor.but ashley presented contrary evidence supporting its view as to the meaning of the ambiguous contract language,and the district court,as fact finder,found in favor of ashley.we can not conclude that the court clearly erred in doing so.here,as in many other cases,both the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence of intended reach of the agreement might have supported a contrary finding.see brown balt.ohio,cir.but we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we must affirm the judgment of the district court holding that in the agreement new cnc assumed old cnc cercla liabilities for the site and that pcs is therefore a prp as a successor to old cnc cercla liability for the site 
next,we turn to the appeals of other parties challenging the district court determinations that they too constituted prps.as the plaintiff in the allocation action under f,pcs bore the burden of proving that another party was a prp under a.see minyard,at.we consider each defendant challenge to prp status in turn,reviewing the district court ultimate determinations of prp status de novo,and its factual findings underlying those determinations for clear error.
the district court held that holcombe and fair are prps as owners of the site at the time of disposal.see a.the court based its holding on its factual finding that holcombe and fair and construction activities redistributed soils,causing a disposal of hazardous substances on the site.
holcombe and fair do not challenge the legal basis for the district court conclusion.indeed,holcombe and fair accept that past owners or operators of a facility are liable for secondary disposals that is,the movement or dispersal of hazardous substances through or construction activities that occur during their ownership or operation of the facility.see tanglewood homeowners charles thomas,cir cercla definition of disposal does not limit disposal to a occurrence there may be other disposals when hazardous materials are moved,dispersed,or released during landfill excavations and fillings.see also redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir same kaiser aluminum chem.catellus dev,cir same westfarm assocs.washington suburban sanitary comm n,cir refusing to limit multiple release disposals to hazardous materials nurad,at interpreting disposal broadly to include passive acts,such as leaking or spilling.
instead,holcombe and fair challenge the district court finding that a secondary disposal actually occurred during their ownership of the site.holcombe and fair argue that the court clearly erred because pcs offered no discrete proof that holcombe and fair actually moved or dispersed contaminated soils during their activities.at best,holcombe and fair contend,the evidence demonstrates only that a disposal probably occurred during their ownership of the site.
to be sure,pcs presented no direct evidence that holcombe and fair moved or dispersed any contaminated soils.however,cercla does not require a smoking gun.niagara mohawk power chevron,cir.instead,cercla liability may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and need not be proven by direct evidence.tosco koch,cir see also franklin cnty.convention facilities auth.am.premier underwriters,cir thus,as with any other factual finding,we are bound to affirm any inference of cercla liability if plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.see davis richmond,fredericksburg potomac,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court heard evidence showing that holcombe and fair engaged in extensive grading and construction that affected at least of the site during their ownership,and that even superficial activities such as grading can redistribute contaminated soils.considering the evidence of widespread contamination across the site,the court inference that holcombe and fair construction activities at some point effected a disposal is certainly plausible.
accordingly,we affirm both the court finding that a disposal occurred during holcombe and fair ownership of the site,and its holding that holcombe and fair are therefore prps for the site under a.
the district court held that rhce is a prp for the site as a current operator.see a.on appeal,rhce concedes that it is a current operator but challenges its prp status on several grounds all unavailing.
most fundamentally,rhce argues that its leasehold is not part of the property for which ashley sued pcs to remediate.rhce br.at.this argument misunderstands cercla.whether rhce leasehold is part of the property for which ashley sued pcs to remediate is simply irrelevant.the relevant question is whether rhce leasehold is part of a facility as defined by cercla.see,a making liable the owner and operator of a facility.
cercla defines facility to include any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,stored,disposed of,or placed,or otherwise come to be located.id.the definition is not predicated,as rhce seems to believe,on the area targeted for remediation.instead,the statutory definition indicates that the bounds of a facility should be defined at least in part by the bounds of the contamination.united states twp.of brighton,cir see nurad,at holding a facility includes that portion of a larger property in and around the leaking storage tanks.the district court did not err in finding on the basis of the evidence before it that rhce leasehold is contaminated as part of a pattern of widespread contamination across the entire site.that is,rhce parcel is part of the contaminated facility for cercla purposes.
rhce seeming suggestion that its leasehold even though contaminated should be considered separately from the rest of the site also fails.courts have uniformly refused to divide widely contaminated properties into separate facilities in response to a party claim to be responsible for contamination in only certain parts of the property.axel johnson,at see also united states capital tax,cir the boundaries of a facility do not necessarily reflect property boundaries,and liability can extend beyond what defendants actually own.internal citation omitted.
in this case,fertilizer production and construction activities widely contaminated the site,including the area of rhce leasehold.that the leasehold is less contaminated than some of the rest of the site and would not require remediation for its current industrial use makes no difference for purposes of determining prp status under cercla.this is so because the hazardous substances located on rhce leasehold are not distinct from those on the rest of the site.otherwise,an operator of a leasehold,like rhce,in a facility could always avoid liability for cercla response costs for the rest of the facility merely by demonstrating less land use on its leasehold.this would turn a strict liability on its head,and would improperly broaden congress specific exemption from liability for innocent contiguous landowners.see u.q 
finally,although rhce does not claim that it meets the rigorous qualifications necessary to be exempt from prp status as an innocent contiguous landowner under q,it does assert a defense from liability as an innocent landowner under b.this defense requires a party otherwise liable as a prp to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that another party was the sole cause of the release of hazardous substances and the damages caused thereby that the other,responsible party did not cause the release in connection with a contractual,employment,or agency relationship with the defendant and that the defendant exercised due care and guarded against the foreseeable acts or omissions of the responsible party.westfarm assocs,at.the district court rejected rhce assertion of this defense,holding that it failed on all three prongs.on appeal,rhce only challenges the court holdings under the first and third prongs of the defense.because a party must establish all three prongs of the defense,and rhce does not challenge the court determination that it failed the second prong,we must affirm the court denial of rhce innocent landowner defense.
in short,because rhce is a current operator of a leasehold that is part of the facility at the site,we affirm the district court determination that rhce is a prp for the site as a current operator under a.
the district court also held ashley to be a prp for the site as a current owner.see a.in doing so,the court rejected ashley attempt to establish a bona fide prospective purchaser bfpp exemption from liability.see id,r.on appeal,ashley again invokes the bfpp exemption.
in,congress enacted the bfpp exemption as one in an array of cercla amendments intended to promote the cleanup and reuse of brownfields under the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act brownfields act,stat.bfpp status exempts from cercla liability a party otherwise liable simply because it is considered to be an owner or operator of a facility under a.see r.to qualify for the exemption,a current owner or operator of a facility must have acquired the facility after january,must not impede the performance of a response action or natural resource restoration at the facility,and must establish eight criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.see id.a h,r.
the district court held that ashley failed to establish a number of these eight criteria.among them is the requirement that a current owner exercises appropriate care with respect to hazardous substances found at the facility by taking reasonable steps to i stop any continuing release ii prevent any threatened future release and iii prevent or limit human,environmental,or natural resource exposure to any previously released hazardous substance.id.d.the court specifically found that ashley failed to clean out and fill in sumps that should have been capped,filled,or removed when related aboveground structures were demolished,and that ashley did not monitor and adequately address conditions relating to a debris pile and the limestone run of crusher cover on the site.the court concluded that these inactions established that ashley did not exercise appropriate care at the site.
ashley argues that the purposes of the brownfields act necessitate that courts apply a standard of appropriate care and reasonable steps than that applied by the district court.otherwise,ashley maintains,landowners will not undertake voluntary brownfields redevelopment for fear of becoming fully liable for cleanup costs as a result of minor mistakes that may not even contribute to harm at the facility.even recognizing congress clear intent to promote voluntary brownfields redevelopment in passing the brownfields act,however,ashley argument goes too far.
in particular,ashley fails to provide a persuasive rationale for requiring a lower level of care from a bfpp under r,than from an innocent landowner under b.both the bfpp exemption and the innocent landowner defense require a demonstration of reasonable steps.compare b i ii,with id.d.logic seems to suggest that the standard of appropriate care required of a bfpp,who by definition knew of the presence of hazardous substances at a facility,should be higher than the standard of due care required of an innocent landowner,who by definition did not know and had no reason to know of the presence of hazardous substances when it acquired a facility.compare id.d,r bfpp exemption and appropriate care standard,with id,b innocent landowner defense and due care standard.
we need not here determine whether the bfpp standard of appropriate care actually is higher than the standard of due care mandated elsewhere in cercla,because in all events appropriate care under d is at least as stringent as due care under b.accord office of enforcement compliance assurance,envtl.prot.agency,interim guidance regarding criteria landowners must meet in order to qualify for bona fide prospective purchaser,contiguous property owner,or innocent landowner limitations on cercla liability march,stating that reasonable steps required under the appropriate care standard establish an approach that is consonant with traditional common law principles and the existing cercla due care requirement.
we therefore borrow standards from cercla due care jurisprudence to inform our determination of what reasonable steps must be taken to demonstrate appropriate care.we agree with the second circuit that the due care inquiry asks whether a party took all precautions with respect to the particular waste that a similarly situated reasonable and prudent person would have taken in light of all relevant facts and circumstances.new york lashins arcade,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,ashley inactions clearly show that it failed to exercise appropriate care.for ashley delay in filling the sumps which even ashley expert admitted should have been filled a full year before ashley did so demonstrates that it did not take the reasonable steps to prevent any threatened future release,d,that a similarly situated reasonable and prudent person would have taken,lashins arcade,at internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,the district court did not err in finding that ashley failed to demonstrate that it exercised appropriate care at the site.because a party must establish all eight factors under to qualify for a bfpp exemption from liability,this failure mandates denial of ashley claim to bfpp exemption and affirmance of the district court holding that ashley is a prp for the site as a current owner under a.
pcs and rhce challenge the district court denial of apportionment of harm at the site both argue that the harm at the site is divisible and thus should be apportioned.we review a district court determination of whether a harm is capable of apportionment de novo,and review the factual findings underlying such a determination for clear error.see in re bell petroleum,cir.
while cercla does not mandate the imposition of joint and several liability,it permits it in cases of indivisible harm.monsanto,at.the supreme court has confirmed that t he universal starting point for divisibility of harm analyses in cercla cases is of the restatement second of torts.burlington northern,at internal quotation marks omitted see also monsanto,at.
under the restatement,when two or more persons acting independently caus e a distinct or single harm for which there is a reasonable basis for division according to the contribution of each,each is subject to liability only for the portion of the total harm that he has himself caused but where two or more persons cause a single and indivisible harm,each is subject to liability for the entire harm.burlington northern,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see monsanto,at.thus,prps can avoid joint and several liability by establishing either that harms are distinct,or that there exists a reasonable basis for apportioning liability for a single harm among responsible parties.monsanto,at citing restatement second of torts.
by its nature,apportionment necessarily requires a,analysis.see united states ncr,cir bell petroleum servs,at united states alcan aluminum,cir.not all harms are capable of apportionment,and cercla defendants seeking to avoid joint and several liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable basis for apportionment exists.burlington northern,at.
for this reason,cercla joint and several liability scheme may be terribly unfair in certain instances.bell petroleum servs,at.nonetheless,e quitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis,burlington northern,at,because the availability of contribution actions under f mitigates any inequity arising from the unavailability of apportionment,see axel johnson,at.
the district court found that two factors contributed to the harm at the site the amount of hazardous substances each prp caused to be contributed to the site,and the amount of soil each prp caused to be contaminated through secondary disposals.the court thus recognized that the harm at the site was at least theoretically divisible if a defendant provided sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable basis for apportionment based on those two factors.
at trial,pcs offered several bases for apportionment,including the amount of fill material each prp added to the site the volume of contaminants planters and old cnc introduced to the site the period of time that planters and old cnc produced fertilizers on the site the percentage of soils each prp first disturbed on the site and the number of contaminated soil samples attributable to each prp.according to pcs,these bases produced consistent results demonstrating pcs was responsible for,at most,six percent of the harm at the site.
the district court rejected pcs proposed bases for apportionment.in doing so,the court identified several flaws systemic to pcs proposed bases for apportionment.most notably,the court found pcs methods did not provide a reasonable estimate of the volume of soil contaminated by secondary disposals account for the likelihood of contamination prior to,and thus assumed that planters was responsible for all contamination prior to or compensate appropriately for changes in the type and intensity of uses and construction on the site over time.
on appeal,pcs first argues that the district court erred in requiring the establishment of more than a reasonable basis for apportionment,in contravention of the standard applied by the supreme court in burlington northern.rhce adopts pcs argument on this point.in burlington northern,the district court sua sponte apportioned the collective harm that two railroad companies caused at a facility by multiplying three factors the percentage of the total area of the facility the railroads owned the percentage of time the railroads leased their parcel to the facility operator and an estimate of the percentage of contamination at the facility attributable to the types of hazardous substances present on the railroads parcel.the court then adjusted its calculation by adding a margin of error,and apportioned nine percent of the harm at the facility to the railroads.at.after the ninth circuit reversed,concluding that these factors provided an unreliable measure of harm,the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit,and upheld the apportionment.the supreme court explained that the record before the district court provided a reasonable basis for the methodology it had adopted.see id.at.
contrary to pcs assertion,the district court denial of apportionment here is entirely consistent with burlington northern.to be sure,burlington northern demonstrates that a reasonable basis for apportionment need not be mathematically precise,and may be based on the simplest of considerations,e,time and land area.see at see also ncr,at.however,burlington northern neither mandates these simplest of considerations,nor establishes their presumptive propriety in every case.see ncr,at.for the factual scenario in burlington northern was relatively simple the primary pollution at the site was contained in an unlined sump and an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the facility most distant from the railroads parcel and the spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the railroad parcel contributed to no more than of the total site contamination.burlington northern,at.only w ith those background facts in mind did the court conclude that the district court methodology was reasonable.id.at.clearly,after burlington northern,apportionment necessarily remains a,determination.see ncr,at.
here the district court undertook precisely such a,determination.weighing the facts in this case,the court held that any reasonable basis for apportionment must include reliable evidence as to both the initial disposals of hazardous substances and any secondary disposals that occurred over time.indeed,the court distinguished burlington northern on this ground,emphasizing that in burlington northern most of the hazardous substances were located in unlined sumps and ponds,and that no evidence indicated that secondary disposals significantly contributed to the harm.the court further found that pcs apportionment methodologies individually and collectively failed to provide the evidence as to secondary disposals necessary to establish a reasonable basis for apportioning the harm at the site.denying apportionment because a party fails to provide reliable evidence as to one of the factors informing apportionment is in no way at odds with burlington northern.
indeed,as burlington northern confirmed,in the face of uncertain causation of harm,courts have refused to make an arbitrary apportionment for its own sake.at quoting restatement second of torts cmt.i.an arbitrary apportionment is just what the district court refused to make,as any apportionment without adequate evidence as to the harm caused by secondary disposals necessarily would have been arbitrary.therefore,the district court and analysis underlying its denial of apportionment entirely accords with burlington northern.
pcs and rhce next argue that,even if the district court apportionment analysis was consistent with burlington northern,the court erred in holding that they failed to establish a reasonable basis for apportionment.although the court found that all of the proposed methods of apportionment improperly assumed planters responsibility for all harm at the site prior to,pcs and rhce each maintain that they established a reasonable basis for apportioning at least their individual shares of the harm.because pcs and rhce are prps under different cercla provisions,we consider their arguments on this point separately.
pcs assertion of individual share apportionment presents the question of whether an owner or operator at the time of disposal under a must provide a reasonable basis to apportion all of the harm,or only its share of the harm,to avoid joint and several liability.
neither we nor the supreme court has ever before considered the question.contrary to pcs suggestion,burlington northern provides no guidance.the district court there apportioned all of the harm,because,in that case,all harm not caused by the railroads was necessarily caused by the longtime operator of the facility.see burlington northern,at.
nor do traditional and evolving standards of common law provide clear guidance on the issue.compare restatement second of torts b suggesting apportionment is appropriate only when a defendant can demonstrate that there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm emphasis added,with united states rohm haas,cir holding apportionment required a showing that there is a way to determine what portion of the harm is f
