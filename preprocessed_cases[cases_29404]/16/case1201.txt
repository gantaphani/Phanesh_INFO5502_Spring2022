factual and procedural background 
termination of the franchise agreement 
since,krystal cadillac has operated a general motors automobile dealership in gettysburg,pennsylvania pursuant to a franchise agreement with gm.under the terms of that agreement,krystal maintained a line of credit from a financial institution in order to finance krystal purchase of new gm vehicles in october,krystal lost its floor plan financing with general motors acceptance corporation,gm financial arm,and krystal was not able to secure any other financing.this constituted a default under the franchise agreement.consequently,on july,gm notified krystal that gm intended to terminate the dealer agreements.following an extension,that termination was to become effective on august.however,on august,the day before the termination became effective,krystal initiated a proceeding before the pennsylvania board of vehicle manufacturers,dealers,and salespersons vehicle board challenging the legality of the franchise termination 
the vehicle board held a hearing on krystal petition on august,and entered an order and adjudication upholding gm termination of the dealership agreements on september,krystal thereafter appealed that order to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania,but that court affirmed the ruling of the vehicle board on november.
b.the proceedings in the bankruptcy court krystal i.
on september,approximately three weeks before the vehicle board rendered its decision,krystal filed for chapter protection.thereafter,on june,krystal filed a plan of reorganization in which it provided for the sale of its gm franchise in order to raise funds to pay creditors.gm objected to the plan arguing that it had properly terminated the franchise agreement with krystal pursuant to the terms of that agreement.the appropriate state agency had upheld the termination,and the commonwealth court had affirmed the agency determination that the termination was proper.thus,according to gm,the franchise was not an asset of the estate available for sale in the bankruptcy proceedings.on october,krystal filed an amended reorganization plan and an amended disclosure statement.article v of the disclosure statement stated 
debtor also holds an automobile franchise agreement with general motors corporation.however,the status of this franchise is now in litigation.general motors terminated the franchise prior to the commencement of the case and the matter was in litigation at the time the chapter petition was filed.general motors nevertheless proceeded with termination and the matter is now on appeal in the commonwealth court.debtor takes the position,which is vigorously contested by general motors,that this franchise agreement remains an asset of the case.
gm responded by filing a separate objection to the plan and disclosure statement based upon its continuing contention that krystal franchise was not an asset of the estate and could not be sold by krystal or the trustee to satisfy krystal creditors.
the bankruptcy court affirmed gm objections and ruled that the franchise had been validly terminated by gm.accordingly,the court held that the franchise could not be sold as part of the bankrupt estate.the district court subsequently affirmed that ruling,and krystal then appealed to us.we reversed.we held that inasmuch as krystal had filed for bankruptcy before gm terminated the franchise agreement,gm termination of that agreement was a violation of the automatic stay imposed under of the code.see,in re krystal cadillac oldsmobile gmc truck,cir krystal i 
krystal ii the instant dispute 
on september,krystal filed the instant action in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against gm.krystal claims for relief arise from gm violation of the automatic stay by terminating krystal franchise agreement after krystal filed for chapter protection.more specifically,krystal seeks damages on each of the following seven grounds violation of the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code,h breach of contract violations of federal dealer day in court act,and of the pennsylvania board of vehicles act,et conspiracy conversion tortious interference with contractual relations and violation of the sherman antitrust act.
the eastern district court referred krystal suit to the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania because the claims were interwoven with the bankruptcy action then pending in the bankruptcy court for the middle district.although gm filed a motion to dismiss under.b,the court never ruled on that motion.rather,the court sua sponte dismissed krystal complaint in its entirety under the doctrine of judicial estoppel.in doing so,the court noted that krystal complaint could also be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,and expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations.as noted above,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel,and this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
krystal makes several arguments as to why judicial estoppel was improperly applied here.however,before we address any of those specific arguments,it will be helpful to first provide a brief overview of that doctrine as a framework for our analysis.
judicial estoppel in general 
we first articulated the doctrine of judicial estoppel in scarano central of,cir.there,we stated that a plaintiff,who has obtained relief from an adversary by asserting and offering proof to support one position,may not be heard later in the same court to contradict himself in an effort to establish against the same adversary a second claim inconsistent with his earlier contention.id.at.in doing so,we recognized the intrinsic ability of courts to dismiss an offending litigant complaint without considering the merits of the underlying claims when such dismissal is necessary to prevent a litigant from playing fast and loose with the courts.id internal quotation marks omitted.
since scarano,we have consistently stated that the doctrine should only be applied to avoid a miscarriage of justice.see montrose medical group participating savings plan bulger,cir.thus,in ryan operations lumber,cir,we stated t he basic principle of judicial estoppel is that absent any good explanation,a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory,and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory.id.
judicial estoppel is therefore not intended to eliminate all inconsistencies no matter how slight or inadvertent they may be.see,in re chambers development,cir.in montrose medical group,we identified certain criteria for determining when seemingly inconsistent litigation stances justify application of the doctrine.we concluded 
first,the party to be estopped must have taken two positions that are irreconcilably inconsistent.second,judicial estoppel is unwarranted unless the party changed his or her position in bad faith,with intent to play fast and loose with the court.finally,a district court may not employ judicial estoppel unless it is tailored to address the harm identified and no lesser sanction would adequately remedy the damage done by the litigant misconduct.
at emphasis added citations omitted.we also noted that equity requires that the presiding court give the party to be estopped a meaningful opportunity to provide an explanation for its changed position.id.at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to krystal alleged inconsistent representations here.
krystal inconsistent representations 
as noted above,each of the claims in krystal seven count complaint is related to,and arises from,gm termination of krystal franchise agreement.the primary claim is the violation of the automatic stay contained in count all of krystal other claims against gm rest upon that violation 
when krystal filed its amended disclosure statement,it knew about each of the claims it has now included in this action.however,as quoted above,the amended reorganization plan and amended disclosure statement merely referenced krystal position that the dealer agreements were part of the bankruptcy estate and the ongoing state proceedings wherein krystal was attempting to undo gm termination of them.
the bankruptcy court found that krystal limited the reference to the instant claim in order to conceal the claims from creditors in the hope of retaining any recovery for itself.while krystal concedes that the schedules and statements it initially filed with the bankruptcy court on october,failed to specifically list as a potential asset of debtor estate any claims against general motors or gmac,appellant br.at,and,it vigorously denies taking two irreconcilably inconsistent positions in this case.
krystal argues that although it did not list the instant claim as an asset in the october,amended disclosure statement,the language of that disclosure was nevertheless adequate to inform creditors of claims krystal had against gm and therefore they knew of the contingent asset of a potential damage award.
alternatively,krystal argues that even if the disclosure was insufficient,it could amend the disclosure statement under bankruptcy rule and thereby cure any inadequacy because the bankruptcy case is still open.krystal insists that it did effectively amend the disclosure as soon as the bankruptcy court notified krystal of the possible application of judicial estoppel therefore,argues krystal,it legitimately cured any conceivable defect in a previously filed schedule or.the bankruptcy court was not impressed by krystal eleventh hour candor and neither are we.
as the bankruptcy court properly noted,the language in the amended disclosure statement was little more than boilerplate.it did not specify any of the claims contained in the instant complaint against gm,much less attempt to place any monetary value on them.we agree that such boilerplate language is simply not adequate to provide the level of notice required.the bankruptcy rules were clearly not intended to encourage this kind of inadequate and misleading disclosure by creating an escape hatch debtors can duck into to avoid sanctions for omitting claims once their lack of candor is discovered.
allowing krystal to,and amend its bankruptcy filings,only after its omission has been detected,suggests that a debtor should consider disclosing potential assets only if caught concealing them.this remedy would only diminish the necessary incentive to provide the bankruptcy court with a truthful disclosure of the debtors assets.

as noted above,judicial estoppel is properly applied only when appropriate to redress the problem the doctrine was designed to remedy.krystal argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is too drastic a remedy to apply here because the p lan calls for a one hundred percent payment to all creditors.appellant br.at.however,as gm is quick to point out,full payment is contingent upon krystal ability to sell its gm franchises for some undetermined profit.see app,and,appellee br.at.moreover,gm represents without contradiction that krystal still has not paid its creditors in full,and that the amended plan noted the necessity of krystal owner pappas getting creditors to compromise their claims.according to gm,creditors may not have been willing to compromise their claims as much,if at all,had they known of the possible addition of damages from the instant law suit.
in oneida motor freight,united jersey bank,cir,we concluded that a rebuttable inference of bad faith arises when averments in the pleadings demonstrate both knowledge of a claim and a motive to conceal that claim in the face of an affirmative duty to disclose.that is precisely krystal situation here.accordingly,the record is sufficient to support the bankruptcy court finding of bad faith.
krystal knowledge of the assets 
under b,a party seeking chapter bankruptcy protection has an affirmative duty to provide creditors with a disclosure statement containing adequate information to enable a creditor to make an informed judgment about the plan.a.debtors must therefore identify and disclose all property of the estate including all of the debtor legal and equitable property interests.this includes such contingent assets as any cause of action krystal may have against gm,and krystal does not argue to the contrary.the nature of krystal purported misrepresentations here can fully be appreciated if we place them within the proper context.
a tenet of bankruptcy law requires one seeking benefits under its terms to satisfy a companion duty to schedule,for the benefit of creditors,all his interests and property rights.oneida,at.therefore,preparing and filing a disclosure statement is a critical step in the reorganization of a chapter debtor.id.at.it has been called by one commentator,the pivotal concept in reorganization of a chapter debtor.id.
the importance of full disclosure is underlaid by the reliance placed upon the disclosure statement by the creditors and the court.given this reliance,we can not overemphasize the debtor obligation to provide sufficient data to satisfy the code standard of adequate information.

krystal relies upon the history of this dispute in arguing that it did not have any claim to disclose until we ruled in krystal i,that gm termination of the franchise agreement violated the automatic stay.until then,argues krystal,the appropriate state agencies had ruled that gm properly terminated the franchise agreement and there was therefore no cause of action against gm to include in the disclosure statement of october.therefore,according to krystal,when the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan in october of,the law of the case was that krystal had no ownership interest in the dealership franchise and gm had not violated the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code.therefore,there was no cause of action to disclose.appellant br.at.
however,krystal was aware of every allegation currently asserted in counts ii through vii of its complaint when it filed its statement and plan.each of the events alleged in those counts had already occurred when krystal made the applicable filings under the bankruptcy code.moreover,krystal argument that it could not know that gm violated the automatic stay as it alleges in count i,is also unpersuasive.krystal clearly knew of this potential claim because it vigorously argued that gm violated the automatic stay when it appeared before us in krystal 
although it is true that the relevant state agencies had upheld gm right to terminate the lease,the agencies were never asked to consider the issue of krystal alleged violation of the automatic stay,and krystal knew this when it filed its disclosure statement in the bankruptcy court on october.the vehicle board adjudication and order did not reach this issue,and the commonwealth court november,decision had not yet been filed.therefore the law of the case did not negate krystal duty to disclose its claims against gm.
krystal attempt to seek refuge in the law of the case doctrine ignores the scope of the disclosure requirement as well as the precise issues before the vehicle board and commonwealth court.the code requires that a debtor list potential causes of action,not claims it actually intends to sue on at the time of the required disclosure.it has been held that a debtor must disclose any litigation likely to arise in a context.oneida,at.thus,krystal own actions belie its contention that it did not know it had a potential claim against gm.krystal has consistently and vigorously maintained that gm termination of the franchise agreement violated the automatic stay.that claim was not within the purview of the proceeding krystal brought before the vehicle board or commonwealth court,and the record belies
