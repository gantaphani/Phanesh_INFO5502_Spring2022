edward ellis is serving a year sentence on a conviction for the federal crime of knowingly transporting a minor across state lines to engage in illegal sexual conduct.the facts underlying his conviction and the procedural history of his case are detailed in this court two prior opinions,ellis united states,cir denying collateral review under,and united states ellis,cir affirming on direct appeal of conviction,and in a published district court opinion,ellis united states,d considering second petition under.in this case,ellis attempts to shorten his term of imprisonment,purporting to assert a claim under fed.b based on assistance ellis provided to the warden of the federal prison where he was once incarcerated.the district court rejected his claim,as do we.we affirm the dismissal of the case.
in,after his conviction and imprisonment,ellis provided assistance to the warden of the federal prison in lompoc,california,where ellis was an inmate.the nature of the assistance is not relevant it suffices to say that the assistance was of value to the warden in running the prison.in return for his assistance,ellis asserts,the warden made a promise to transfer ellis to a prison and to write a letter to the sentencing court to create an opportunity to have the sentencing judge consider reducing the defendant sentence as a reward for his service.
the warden did transfer ellis and did write a letter,in may,to the federal judge in massachusetts who had sentenced ellis.the letter fully disclosed the defendant assistance to the warden,noted that the defendant cooperation played a significant role,and that the warden was very grateful to the defendant the sentencing judge received the letter,and the attorney at some point became aware of the letter.the attorney did not file a rule b motion to reduce ellis sentence.see.b upon the government motion made more than one year after sentencing,the court may reduce a sentence for the defendant substantial assistance.the sentencing court made no effort sua sponte to modify ellis sentence as a result of the letter.
in,some thirteen years after the warden letter,ellis filed a motion in his original criminal action in federal district court in massachusetts asserting that he was entitled to have his sentence reduced.the original sentencing judge who had received the warden letter had died in the interim.ellis affidavit accompanying the motion claimed that the warden intended that his letter to the original sentencing judge would serve as a catalyst for a sentence reduction.since the only way to reduce ellis sentence was through a motion under.b,ellis claimed that the warden alleged promise was,in essence,one that bound the government to file a rule b motion on his behalf.
the district court denied ellis motion and ordered that ellis criminal case be closed.the court,in a written ruling,held that the evidence was that the warden had fulfilled his promise to the defendant,and that even if the warden had promised to file or ensure the filing of a rule b motion and there was no evidence to suggest he had,the warden lacked the authority to do so.
we bypass the question of whether there was sufficient evidence that the warden promised ellis that he would see to the filing of a rule b motion.even if the warden had made such a promise,he was without authority to do so and the promise may not be enforced.
ellis appeal depends entirely on his argument that for purposes of rule b,the warden of a single federal prison is an agent of the attorney general and has actual authority acting on his own to bind the government to file a rule b motion.this is a pure issue of law,which we review de novo.united states flemmi,cir.ellis contention is wrong.
statutory scheme for sentencing reduction 
congress created two statutory avenues,both set out in c,for reduction of an inmate sentence on grounds unrelated to his guilt or the appropriateness of the underlying sentence of imprisonment.one avenue authorizes the director of the bureau of prisons to file a motion the other avenue authorizes the government as a party in a criminal case before the courts to file a motion under rule b.
the first,c a,provides that a court,upon motion of the director of the bureau of prisons,may reduce the term of imprisonment if it finds that i extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction.the bureau of prisons informed ellis in a letter from its general counsel that ellis was not eligible for relief under this provision,as the bureau had chosen to limit its use of this avenue to situations where a prisoner has severe medical problems.the defendant has conceded that this was a matter of discretion for the bureau,and agrees that he does not qualify for consideration under c a.
the other avenue,c b,allows a court to modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.we set forth the text of rule in the footnote 
the recent history of rule demonstrates that the rule reflects a set of conscious choices by congress,choices which determine the outcome of this case.congress and the rules committee explicitly made choices both as to the grounds under which a modification of a sentence can be sought and as to who is empowered to make such a motion.
before,rule b allowed a court,on its own initiative or by motion from either party,to reduce a sentence within days of the original sentence,but no modifications to a sentence could be made thereafter.see.b amended.the previous version of the rule allowed essentially a plea for leniency addressed to the sound discretion of the district court.united states ames,cir see also united states angiulo,cir f ormer rule b conferred virtually unfettered discretion on sentencing courts.united states distasio,cir former rule b offers the sentencing court an opportunity to temper its original sentence.
beginning with congress passage of the sentencing reform act of,rule has undergone a series of changes.see.cmt.credit s.the discretion of the district court has been severely restricted.a court now can modify a sentence sua sponte only within seven days of the sentencing,and even then only to correct clear errors.see.a.the defendant is no longer allowed to make motions under rule b only the government is empowered to do so.id.b.in contrast to the general plea for leniency under the old rule,the government now can request a modification of the defendant sentence only as a result of the defendant substantial assistance.in the context of original sentencing,this is a term of art.see providing for downward sentencing departures for substantial assistance.in united states alegria,cir,we noted that with regard to the meaning of substantial assistance,rule b and ussg are birds of a feather.id.at.
in addition to the grounds for a rule b motion having been restricted,the absolute time limit has been replaced with a graduated scheme of time limits.within a year of sentencing,a court may reduce the sentence on the government motion for any sort of substantial assistance,see.b,but outside of a year of sentencing,the court may reduce the sentence on the government motion only if three criteria,which generally amount to a discovery rule,are met,see id.b a c.
we need not get into the question of whether ellis assistance here was substantial because ellis can prevail on his claim only if he can show that there was a promise by the government as meant by rule b to file a rule b motion at all.filing such a motion resides in the government discretion.courts have recognized,in both the section and the rule b contexts,that a breach of a promise to file a substantial assistance motion,like other discretionary decisions by a prosecutor,is reviewable.see wade united states,d united states marks,cir applying wade to rule b.
ellis makes no claim that a prosecutor ever made a promise to him,and so the case law described above is of no help to him.thus,ellis needs to show that the discretionary power given to the government in rule b includes an individual warden of a prison within the bureau of prisons where the defendant has been confined.we conclude the term government
