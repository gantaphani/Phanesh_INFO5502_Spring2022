opinion of the court 
introduction 
capital blue cross capital appeals from a decision of the united states tax court denying its request for a refund of overpayment of taxes for tax year.capital claims that it properly established a basis in hundreds of insurance contracts that were terminated in that year,and that it is therefore entitled to take a loss deduction under to account for the cancellation of those contracts.the tax court found that capital had not established its basis in those contracts it therefore treated capital basis as zero and denied any deduction.
we agree with capital that the tax court improperly discounted expert testimony that tended to establish capital basis in the disputed contracts,and that the zero basis found by the court was inconsistent with the facts and hence clearly erroneous.capital engaged in an extensive and professional valuation process in order to calculate its basis in the lost contracts.while the tax court correctly found that the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner established several flaws in capital valuation,overall,we are convinced that capital process was thorough and professional,and that it arrived at an essentially reasonable valuation for the cancelled contracts.given these conclusions,we are unwilling to affirm the tax court merely because we find some flaws in capital valuation process.instead,we will reverse and remand for further proceedings.
we leave it to the tax court to find the correct valuation for capital contracts.on remand,the commissioner may again press his objections to capital methods,and the tax court may consider those objections in arriving at a final valuation.but the existence of some problems in capital valuation process will not justify finding a zero basis in the lost contracts.instead,the tax court must do its best to calculate a reasonable and correct basis the commissioner can best assist the court by raising specific and quantifiable objections to capital valuation,and by proposing alternative methods that will lead to what,in his submission,would be a more reasonable valuation.thus far,the commissioner has pointed to alleged flaws in the valuation methodology without explaining or quantifying how they impacted the calculation,and without offering any alternatives.we conclude that,on the facts before us,such a procedure is insufficient to reject capital claimed deductions.
ii.facts and procedural history 
introduction 
as suggested above,this case concerns the procedures under which blue cross blue shield organizations may take loss deductions for terminated subscriber contracts.since blue cross blue shield organizations became taxable in,this issue has slowly grown in importance.it has only recently reached the attention of the courts and the internal revenue service irs or the service.the service has 
inform ed blue cross blue shield insurance organizations that the service will challenge deductions for losses that relate to the termination of individual customer,provider,or employee contracts or relationships associated with customer lists,provider networks,and workforce in place with respect to which the taxpayer claims an adjusted basis derived from section c a iii sic of the tax reform act of.
we are the second article iii court to consider the deductibility of these losses.the first case was trigon insurance united states,d,which found for the commissioner and disallowed the deductions.the court ultimately held that the,a success or to two blue cross blue shield not established the fair market value of its insurance and provider contracts and was therefore not entitled to a deduction.the decision has not been appealed,and our analysis will be guided in part by judge payne thorough opinion.since trigon,the irs has reaffirmed and clarified the position of notice in a coordinated issue paper dated may.see wl.
initial taxation of blue cross blue shield entities 
capital blue cross is a blue cross blue shield organization that sells health insurance to individuals and groups in central and northeastern pennsylvania.it was founded in,became a blue cross organization in,and became a blue cross blue shield licensee when blue cross and blue shield merged in.
historically,blue cross blue shield organizations were not subject to federal income taxes.in,the congress,concerned that this gave blue cross blue shield organizations an unfair competitive advantage over other insurers,eliminated the tax exemption effective january.see tax reform act of,stat,codified at m.when blue cross blue shield entities became taxable,they needed to have a way to determine their tax basis in their assets.congress therefore provided that blue cross blue shield organizations could take a basis in their assets,so that their tax basis in each asset would be its fair market value fmv on january.tax reform act of,c a ii.this basis is sometimes called the fresh start basis rule,see trigon,d at.
capital contracts in 
on january,when capital became a taxable entity,it had group health insurance contracts outstanding,as well as a number of individual contracts.many groups had entered into multiple contracts with capital the group contracts represented a total of separate insured groups.
under each of these group health insurance contracts,capital agreed to provide health insurance coverage to the individual members of each group typically the employees of a company,and the group agreed to pay premiums.individual group members could elect the type of insurance benefit individual,single parent with dependents,or family and coverage basic medical,basic hospital,major medical,or comprehensive that they wanted to receive.
premium structures 
each group was charged a total annual premium the group decided what portion of the premium was to be paid by the employer and what was to be paid by the individual group members.the premium for a group was determined in one of three ways.
groups with fewer than one hundred individual members were.under community rating,premiums for a particular type of coverage and benefit were based on the cumulative claims history of all of capital contracts for that.claims experience for all contracts in one year would serve as the basis for the premiums on contracts in the following year.some percent of capital group contracts were.
groups of over one hundred members had their premiums determined based on their own claims experience,rather than on the shared claims experience of multiple contracts.thus,premiums for each such group would be unique.capital had two ways of setting these premiums.
in contracts,total claims received from the members of a group in one year would form the basis for the premiums charged to that group in the following year.if an group paid premiums in one year that were excessive relative to its claims,it could receive a retrospective refund cash or a retrospective credit credited against the next year premiums.contracts made up over percent of the total value of capital contracts.
contracts were a variation on contracts premiums for the following year were calculated based on claims in the previous year plus capital administrative costs related to the group.contracts also had a retrospective adjustment feature that would adjust premiums in a given year to more closely match claims and administrative costs in that year.
the and rated contracts are,for our purposes,basically identical.for convenience,we will sometimes refer to the and contracts together as contracts,as distinguished from contracts whose premiums are determined collectively.
capital contracts were automatically renewed unless cancelled on a basis its and contracts were automatically renewed on an annual basis.the tax court found that groups could cancel their contracts at will the customer group could just stop paying the premiums,which would cause capital to cancel the contract.capital ceo testified,however,that few contracts were cancelled for that reason,and opined that capital might have a cause of action against a customer who simply stopped paying premiums while still under a contract.
because premiums were adjusted every year,capital could typically expect to make money on most of its contracts,since it was not locked into premium rates that might prove inadequate.but capital was not guaranteed a profit.a contract could build up a retrospective deficit,claims could be higher than premiums in a given year.premiums would then be increased,but if claims continued to increase faster than premiums,the deficit could constantly increase.because groups could essentially cancel their contracts at will,and because capital seems to have had no claim against the group for any accumulated deficit that was not paid,capital could in fact lose money on any contract.the tax court cited one example the pennsylvania farmer union had,retrospective contracts with capital that had a cumulative deficit of in january.by,the deficit had reached million.anxious to recoup this loss,capital proposed a rate increase for the following year.pennsylvania farmer union rejected the rate increase and terminated its contracts,leaving capital to bear the million loss.
from through,when capital was a entity,it had never valued its group insurance contracts for tax purposes.it also did not compute a cost basis for the contracts in its financial records,as the contracts were assets.when it became taxable in,capital did not make any adjustments in its tax books and records to reflect the basis allowed by the tax changes.in fact,it did not make any such adjustments until prior to that,its records did not reflect any basis in the group contracts,and it claimed no deductions for any losses on those contracts until that year.
as of january,capital was the leading health insurance provider in its geographical area.alternatives to blue cross blue as health maintenance organizations hmos,preferred provider organizations ppos,and other health insurance not nearly as widespread or important as they are today.but they were developing in importance,and by capital was facing increased competition from hmos and ppos.capital management was aware of this increasing competition,and the company weakening future prospects,in.
d.the present controversy 
as noted above,capital did not take any steps to apply the fresh start basis rule when it came into effect in its tax books did not reflect the basis of its insurance contracts this changed in september,when capital filed its tax return.this return claimed of loss deductions for subscriber groups who cancelled their insurance contracts with capital.the million loss was based on a valuation by deloitte touche.the losses came from the cancellation of of the over group contracts that capital had owned in.at roughly the same time,capital filed amended tax returns for,claiming loss deductions for contracts cancelled during those years.
the commissioner disallowed the deductions in a notice of deficiency dated august.the notice stated a number of theories under which the commissioner rejected the deductions,including that it has not been established that any abandonment occurred during the taxable year,or that any loss was sustained that the customer contracts were components of intangible assets which constitute single indivisible assets and that the basis applies only to sale or exchange losses,not to abandonment losses.
on november,capital filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the commissioner deficiency determination.the petition claimed contract loss deductions for totaling.as the tax court correctly noted,capital did not explain why it now claimed this amount,rather than the some million claimed on its tax return.in preparation for trial,capital retained a valuation expert,daniel mccarthy,who is a member of the actuarial consulting firm milliman usa and a highly credentialed actuary mccarthy calculated that capital basis in the contracts cancelled in was.mccarthy also calculated values for contracts cancelled in other years.capital now claims deductions totaling over million for tax years,including the roughly million for the tax year.while this case directly concerns capital million claimed deduction for,it will affect at least million in deductions for capital.
a trial was held in march and april of before judge stephen swift.expert testimony was taken from mccarthy and other experts for capital and for the internal revenue service hereinafter the service or irs.after trial,judge swift entered a decision for the commissioner,dated march.see capital blue cross comm r,wl.the court rejected the third theory in the commissioner notice of deficiency that the basis does not apply to losses,was equivocal on the second that the contracts were part of indivisible assets,but agreed with the commissioner that capital had not established any loss,and therefore upheld the disallowance of the entire deduction.capital timely appealed.
the tax court had jurisdiction over capital petition under,and.we have appellate jurisdiction under a.we have plenary review over the tax court legal conclusions,and may set aside findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.neonatology associates,comm r,cir.
iii.deductibility of losses on health insurance contracts 
loss deductions are governed by of the internal revenue code,which provides in relevant part 
a general shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.
b amount of purposes of subsection a,the basis for determining the amount of the deduction for any loss shall be the adjusted basis provided in section for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of the property.
hereinafter a b.
the main dispute in this case concerns the value of capital lost contracts,and who bears the burden of proving that value.but we begin with more fundamental questions.first,is the cancellation of valuable contracts a loss under a,such that capital is entitled to a deduction second,if so,what was capital basis in those contracts under b it is useful to begin with the second question.
a.the blue cross blue shield fresh start basis rule 
normally,a taxpayer basis in an asset is the taxpayer cost of acquiring that asset.see also id.a taxpayer basis in a customer,an insurer basis in an insurance contract with its normally be zero.the taxpayer may generally deduct the costs of acquiring the asset advertising,underwriting,when those costs are incurred,but does not capitalize them into a basis in the asset.on the other hand,an insurance company might have a cost basis in insurance contracts that it purchased from another insurer.its basis in such contracts would be the purchase price.
with respect to contracts written after,capital follows these principles.thus,the parties have stipulated that for tax accounting purposes beginning in,petitioner the cost of securing customer insurance contracts in the year such expenses were incurred.capital would thus have zero basis in contracts acquired after it deducts the costs of acquiring those contracts,and so has no cost basis.
however,with respect to the assets that it possessed on january,capital basis is not a cost basis but the fair market value of those assets on that date.the basis provision for blue cross blue shield organizations states that,for purposes of determining gain or loss,the adjusted basis of any asset held on the day of the taxpayer first taxable year beginning after december,shall be treated as equal to its fair market value as of such day.tax reform act of,c a,stat.capital tax year is the calendar year,meaning that its basis in its assets should be determined based on their fair market value on january.
the purpose of the basis provision was,as the tax court noted,to prevent blue cross blue shield organizations from being taxed on appreciation in the value of assets that had occurred in years when the organizations had not been subject to federal income tax.at citing conf,at,vol.a blue cross blue shield organization that bought a building for in,saw its value increase to in,and sold it for in,would have taxable income of only.a typical taxpayer in the same situation would have in taxable income on the sale,but congress did not want to tax the blue cross blue shield organizations for unrealized appreciation that occurred before they became taxable.
this basic understanding of capital basis in its assets raises several further questions.to that end,in part,we inquire whether the basis applies to losses,and in part,we discuss its application to intangible assets like the insurance contracts at issue here.
deductibility of losses by blue cross blue shield organizations 
congress intent in passing the basis seems primarily to have been to provide tax relief for gains on sales.but basis is also used to calculate deductible losses when a taxpayer sells an asset for less than its basis.the basis found under and is also used in calculating deductions when the asset is lost under.losses of assets used in business are deductible under that section,as detailed in the regulations 
a loss incurred in a business or in a transaction entered into for profit and arising from the sudden termination of the usefulness in such business or transaction of any nondepreciable property,in a case where such business or transaction is discontinued or where such property is permanently discarded from use therein,shall be allowed as a deduction under section a for the taxable year in which the loss is actually sustained.
in the tax court,and in the notice of deficiency,the commissioner reasoned that the blue cross blue shield basis applied only to sales transactions,and not to loss situations like the one presented here.see at.he cited to the legislative history of the tax reform act of,which includes the statement that the basis is provided solely for the purposes of determining gain or loss upon sale or exchange of the assets,not for purposes of determining amounts of depreciation or for other purposes.id.at quoting conf,at to,vol.
the tax court rejected this contention.judge swift found that the statutory language unambiguously provides a basis for the purposes of determining any gain or loss,and therefore declined to look to the legislative history to change the meaning of an unambiguous statute.id.at.he also noted that the policy rationale behind the applies in cases of losses.see id.at.the commissioner has not appealed this conclusion,and we accept it.we note that it is in accord with the only other reported decision on the question,trigon,d at.
are the insurance contracts mass assets 
before we turn to capital disputed valuation,we address another issue that was raised in the tax court but not pursued with clarity on appeal.that is the question whether the contracts at issue here were actually assets subject to losses at all.while the commissioner does not clearly raise this argument here,its assumptions underlie many of his objections to capital valuation.
it seems to be agreed that these contracts are in fact assets,in that each contract constitutes the right to a continuing stream of future payments.see trigon,d at newark morning ledger united states,d holding that a newspaper subscription list was a depreciable asset union bankers ins.comm r,wl,rul.while the commissioner believes that client groups may cancel their contracts at will,even an relationship may constitute a valuable asset if it is reasonably likely to continue into the future.i n valuing a contractual relationship,it is appropriate to determine the useful life of a contract by taking into account the likelihood of its renewal.trigon,d at citing union bankers,at super food servs.united states,cir newark morning ledger,at.
the more difficult question is whether the contracts are part of one or more mass assets or synonymously indivisible assets.in his notice of deficiency,the commissioner alleged that capital specific individual customer contracts are components of intangible assets which constitute single indivisible assets,including intangibles.this theory relies on the hoary mass asset rule,which limits a taxpayer ability to deduct losses of some intangible assets that are treated as mere components of a larger,indivisible asset.
the rule prohibits the depreciation of certain intangibles because they constitute assets that may change but never waste.newark morning ledger,at.while the newark morning ledger court discussed depreciation of the entire mass asset,the rule also prevents taxpayers from deducting the loss of individual components of the mass,as those deductions would for most practical purposes be equivalent to depreciation deductions.see sunset fuel united states,cir.
in newark morning ledger,the supreme court allowed the taxpayer to take depreciation deductions for its subscriber base,finding that these paid subscribers constituted a finite set of subscriptions and were not composed of constantly fluctuating components.at.this distinguished them from a mass asset.the court also cited ithaca industries,comm r,wl ithaca i,which denied a deduction for assembled work force,finding that this force was a nondiminishing asset and that new employees were trained in order to keep the assembled work force unchanged,and the cost of training was a deductible expense.newark morning ledger,at.citing ithaca i,at.
in the wake of newark morning ledger,the mass asset rule is on somewhat uncertain footing.indeed,if the subscription lists in that case were not a mass asset,it is arguably difficult to see what would be.the leading morning ledger mass asset case is ithaca industries,comm r,cir ithaca ii,which affirmed the tax court judgment in ithaca i.the fourth circuit framed the issue as follows 
as the court suggested in newark morning ledger the distinguishing feature of a true mass asset is its ability to be regenerated without substantial effort on the part of its owner,that is,its ability to.when an asset is maintained only by significant affirmative efforts to add new elements,these additions are most naturally understood as comprising something new and distinct from the original asset.
ithaca ii,at.this test has been adopted by the tax court.see hardware plus,comm r,cch,wl.
although the question is not without its difficulties,it appears that capital contracts do not constitute part of a single indivisible asset.the commissioner does not even contend that capital contract base is able to.see ithaca ii,at.instead,capital must make significant affirmative efforts to acquire new group contracts,although the costs of these efforts are generally deductible,see ithaca i,at.moreover,the insurance contracts seem to be distinct in fact each contract has a unique economic value based on its claims history,rate structure,group size,and other characteristics.we thus are satisfied that these contracts are not a mass asset 
iv.burden of proof of deduction amounts 
it appears,thus far,that capital has at least a theoretical right to take loss deductions when its group insurance clients cancel contracts that were in force on january.furthermore,capital basis in each of these thus the amount of each equal to the fair market value of each contract as of january.that said,the calculation of this fair market value is difficult and hotly disputed,as is the question who bears the burden of proof.
a.who bears the burden of proof 
the burden of proof in a tax court case is on the petitioner,but the commissioner bears the burden of proof in respect of any new matter.tax.a.the tax court placed the burden of proving the contracts value on capital.see at.
capital,however,contends that the tax court should have shifted the burden of proof to the commissioner,because the notice of deficiency did not raise the issue of capital valuation,or in the alternative because the notice was arbitrary for finding no value.
the first of these contentions is based on the fact that the notice denied that capital had established any loss.capital claims that the dispute over its specific valuation is therefore new matter within the meaning of rule.the tax court found that the notice broad language relating to whether petitioner sustained any loss includes the factual valuation issue.at.we agree with the tax court the notice of deficiency challenging capital entire deduction necessarily raised the valuation issue at the heart of that deduction.
capital more compelling contention is that the commissioner initial notice of deficiency denying any deduction was per se unreasonable.in deficiency cases brought in tax court,the petitioner may shift the burden of proof to the commissioner if it can prove that the commissioner assessment is arbitrary and excessive.helvering taylor.even the commissioner experts agree that these contracts had some value.therefore,capital argues,it has demonstrated that the commissioner position is unreasonable,and so the burden shifts to the commissioner to prove the correct amount of the deductions.
taylor,however,concerned the apportionment of income,not the calculation of deductions.indeed,the taylor court stated in dictum that the burden is upon the taxpayer to establish the amount of a deduction claimed,even where the commissioner position is unreasonable.id.at.
we have applied taylor to deduction claims in circumstances closely analogous to this case.in smith,comm r,cir,the commissioner disputed the amount that the taxpayer could deduct for amortization of certain patents.the taxpayer basis for deductions depended upon the fair market value of the patents at the time they were acquired.the taxpayer and the commissioner put forward widely varying calculations of this fair market value the tax court,rather than choosing one or the other,split the difference and entered a judgment based on its own valuation.the taxpayer appealed,arguing that once it had proven that the commissioner valuation was unduly pessimistic,the burden shifted to the commissioner,and because the tax court rejected the commissioner valuation,it was required to accept smith valuation.we agreed with the first of these contentions 
smith states that it had the burden of proving that the commissioner determination of the gross values,which initially amounted to,was arbitrary.having established that the calculation was in error,smith was not required to prove the correct figure.the commissioner had the burden of establishing the proper valuation and thus the actual tax owed.this much is an accurate statement of the law.
id.at citing taylor.fed.bank comm r,cir.
but we rejected smith second contention that the tax court was bound to award the deduction requested by smith merely because the commissioner valuation was unreasonable.we continued 
where smith argument fails is in suggesting that the refusal of the tax court to accept the commissioner evidence requires this court to reverse the trial judge with instructions to expunge the deficiencies.the teaching of helvering taylor and federal national bank commissioner of internal revenue is that the appropriate remedy in the absence of evidence of proper valuation is a remand to allow for additional evidence to be presented.in this case,however,sufficient evidence was introduced to allow the tax court to reach a reasonable conclusion.the court is not limited to simply choosing one of the two values proffered.it is appropriate for it to evaluate all of the evidence and to make an independent determination that does not necessarily accept the valuation of either party.
id.indeed,in taylor itself,the supreme court did not reject the commissioner arbitrary claimed deficiency instead,it affirmed the decision of the court of appeals remanding the case so that the board of tax appeals might hear evidence to show whether a fair apportionment might be made and,if so,the correct amount of the tax.at.in sum,the taxpayer bears the burden of proof on valuation,but where the commissioner alternative proposed valuation is unreasonable,the tax court must make a fair apportionment,and is not confined to choosing between the two proffered valuations.
proof of separate valuation the burden framework 
nonetheless,as taylor recognized,it is not always possible for the tax court to make a fair apportionment of a taxpayer obligations and basis.at.capital argues that its burden is only to prove that its aggregate deductions are correct,even if it can not apportion them precisely.see pac.trans.comm r,wl dileonardo comm r,cch.the commissioner disagrees,arguing that capital must prove the value of each contract,and may not take an approximate deduction not based in the value of the contracts actually lost.
newark morning ledger,which presents significant factual analogies to this case,set a high bar for the taxpayer seeking to prove deductions.the court held that the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that a particular asset can be valued and that it has a limited useful life,and noted that that burden will often prove too great to bear.at.
most mass asset cases before and after newark morning ledger make similar statements.these cases put the burden on the taxpayer of establish ing reasonably accurately a basis in the particular account on which the loss is claimed.sunset fuel,at see also mertens,law of federal income taxation,at rev ed.some of these cases go even further,echoing newark morning ledger s warning that the burden will often be too great for the taxpayer to bear.see,globe life accident ins.united states.
there is some tension between the rule of newark morning ledger,which places on the taxpayer a heavy burden of proving that its intangible assets may be valued separately,and the rule of taylor and smith,which allows the tax court to determine a fair value when neither the commissioner nor the taxpayer valuation is completely convincing.we think,however,that these cases can be reconciled in a straightforward manner.
newark morning ledger stands for the proposition that the taxpayer always bears the burden of proving that his lost intangible assets are susceptible of separate valuation.a taxpayer who can not carry that burden possesses a mass asset,and may not depreciate it or deduct losses of components of that asset.the commissioner may always put the taxpayer to his proofs in such a case,and the commissioner litigation position rejecting the entire claimed deduction will not necessarily be unreasonable.
but this heavy burden applies only to the taxpayer obligation to prove that his intangible assets may be valued separately and with reasonable precision.what we derive from the foregoing is that,if the taxpayer can satisfy that burden,the process of proof changes.once a court is satisfied that the intangible assets may be valued separately,its obligation is to find the correct value.the taxpayer and the commissioner may submit their own proposed valuation,and dispute over the merits of each side claims.where the commissioner refuses to submit any valuation,or where his valuation is arbitrary,the court will essentially be forced to start from the taxpayer valuation.
the court may accept this valuation if it is reasonable,or it may modify it to take into account objections raised by the commissioner or by the court sua sponte.but it will not,in our view,be reasonable for a court to reject the taxpayer valuation out of hand simply because the commissioner has identified minor flaws in the valuation.once it is established that the assets have a reasonably ascertainable value,the court is obligated to seek the correct value of the contracts not,upon catching the taxpayer in an error,to deny any deduction automatically.see smith,at.
similarly,the dispute over whether capital must prove only its aggregate deduction,or the individual value of each contract lost in that year,is a chimera.under newark morning ledger,capital must of course prove that each of the lost contracts has an individual value that exists separately from that of the other contracts.but the court need not find each individual valuation convincing in all respects in order to accept an aggregate deduction.a court might find that ten individual contracts each have a separate value,while being unable to put a precise dollar value on each one.in such a case,if the court can easily calculate the aggregate value of the ten contracts,while remaining uncertain about the individual values,the taxpayer has satisfied its burden under newark morning ledger and may prove his aggregate deduction under the logic of south pacific transportation and dileonardo.
capital valuation 
the tax court finding of fact with respect to valuation is to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.smith,at.here,the tax court concluded that capital had failed to meet its burden of proving the fair market value of its lost contracts.its basis for this conclusion was a litany of perceived flaws in capital valuation.most importantly,the tax court found that capital reinsurance model for valuing the lost contracts was flawed,at that the valuation did not completely take into account individual characteristics of the group contracts,id.at and that the valuation was based on defective assumptions regarding the expected life of the contracts,id.at.we address each of these findings in turn.on appeal,the commissioner has added numerous instances of perceived error in capital valuation we address those claims in the course of our consideration of the tax court conclusions.
a.the reinsurance model 
the tax court most significant criticism of capital valuation concerned the reinsurance model used by daniel mccarthy,capital actuarial valuation expert,see supra.
highest and best use 
mccarthy valued the contracts at issue at their highest and best use.he concluded that this use could be determined using a reinsurance model,whereby he asked how much the contracts cancelled in would have been worth if they had been sold together in a reinsurance transaction in.mccarthy argued that this is the highest and best use of the contracts,and that they would be worth more sold together in a reinsurance transaction than they would be if they were sold separately.in fact,it seems unlikely that any such contracts could be sold separately.see trigon,d at it is an undisputed fact that there are no known sales of single group health insurance contracts between insurance carriers either before january,or after.blocks of contracts can,however,be sold,and mccarthy represented that the contracts lost in would have constituted a credible block that could have been sold between insurers.see at.
the trigon court reasoned that these contracts are properly valued under a model that assumes a buyer with facilities comparable to those of capital 
group contracts must be valued on the theory that they would be sold to a hypothetical willing buyer having facilities comparable to those of the seller.attempting to value the contracts on a basis which the government appears to advocate,rather than as part of a going concern,results in an improper determination of liquidation value,rather than fair market value.
d at citation omitted.we find this analysis persuasive.
we reject the government argument that a sale model is required.the government cites cases holding that minority shares of stock must be valued according to their own value,without taking into account a control premium that might inhere in a larger block of stock.see ahmanson found.united states,cir rul.but such cases are inapposite the control premium for a majority stock holding has a separate value over and above the value of each individual share,while mccarthy use of the reinsurance model is designed not to capture additional value but to account for the transaction costs involved in selling a single contract capital need not value its contracts only at their liquidation value,rather it may use the reinsurance model to determine its basis.
separate values 
the tax court nonetheless took the reinsurance model as evidence that capital contracts could not be valued individually.it found that,at most,mccarthy had proven the value of the block sold by capital,but it had not proven the value of each individual contract 
a s it must,petitioner does not claim a single loss deduction in upon the termination of the group contracts.rather,petitioner claims separate loss deductions relating to the termination of each of the separate group contracts.what is required to support petitioner claimed loss deductions under section are valuations of the group contracts that reflect a value for each contract as a separate and discrete contract a ll petitioner has done is establish that the group contracts are capable of being valued in blocks.petitioner has not,however,established that the group contracts are capable of being valued separately and independently as individual assets.
at see also trigon,d at t he issue is not whether the highest and best use of trigon contracts is as part of an ongoing health insurance company the issue,instead,is whether specific contracts can be valued separately from the block of contracts to which they belong.
capital argues that the contracts can be valued separately,and that mccarthy did in fact value each contract separately.mccarthy testified to this effect,noting that his valuation methodology in this case was consistent with his practice in appraising insurance contracts when advising insurers that are demutualizing 
it was consistent,in that it took into account the characteristics of each contract being valued.it was consistent,in that it took into account as the standard of that to be discounted of the emerging stream of expected statutory earnings,and it was consistent,in that they were discounted to present value.
he referred to this as a seriatim or valuation.he readily admitted,however,that he calculated the contracts value based on an assumption that they would be sold in batches.
we think that the tax court,and the commissioner,misunderstood the requirements of separate valuation.as noted above,newark morning ledger,at,requires that a taxpayer wishing to deduct his losses of intangible assets must show that those assets are susceptible of separate valuation.in many cases,this will be impossible,simply because the taxpayer really possesses a single indivisible asset whose whole is incommensurable with the sum of its parts,a single mass composed of constantly fluctuating components.id.at.thus,for instance,a company may not depreciate its assembled work force,because new employees are constantly being trained to replace old ones,and because there is no meaningful way to assign distinct values to each member of this workforce.id.at.the value inheres in the assembly of the workforce,not in any one individual.
insurance contracts are different.they are valued all the time indeed,daniel mccarthy,capital expert,has spent much of his career valuing health and life insurance contracts in order to advise insurers and regulators on the fairness of demutualization transactions.while the tax court and the commissioner have numerous quibbles with capital valuation,they do not persuade us that these contracts do not each have an individual value.as capital succinctly puts it,the tax court erred because it confused the question of whether an intangible has a value and useful life separate from goodwill,with the question of what the asset value is.
the commissioner cites several morning news cases for the proposition that taxpayers may not use average values to compute the value of specific accounts.sunset fuel,at skilken comm r,cir.but the averaging procedures in those cases were far cruder than mccarthy sophisticated statistical methods here.mccarthy represented that the contracts lost in constituted a fully credible block of contracts,such that a reinsurer would expect high and contracts to cancel each other out,and would therefore purchase the contracts based on average rather than individual experience.contracts were,at all points,valued individually.
the evidence is clear that mccarthy voluminous,thorough,and professional valuation was meant to determine a value for each individual insurance contract.as part of that individual valuation,mccarthy used various averaging procedures,sometimes to check his work,but sometimes as part of his initial calculations.the undisputed evidence appears to be that such averaging procedures were consistent with industry standards for valuing group insurance contracts for the purposes of reinsurance or demutualization.mccarthy use of statistical methods does not render his appraisal invalid,or support the tax court conclusion that capital contracts could not be valued individually.we thus hold that that conclusion was clearly erroneous.
the goodwill adjustment 
the tax court also rejected mccarthy reinsurance model on the grounds that mccarthy made only some type of vague expense adjustment to account for intangibles such as goodwill that were associated with the terminated contracts.at.a larger adjustment for the intangibles,which the commissioner believes is justified,would lead to a smaller tax deduction.
mccarthy subtracted some million from his total valuation of all of capital contracts,to account for the value added by capital name,reputation,and other goodwill factors,as well as by its workforce and provider network.these factors made up a part of the value of capital contracts,but were not lost when those contracts were lost therefore,capital did could them as part of its deduction.the dispute here is over the method of calculating this goodwill adjustment.mccarthy used a rental charge,whereby he valued these intangibles based on what it would cost capital to rent them in a market transaction.the commissioner argued,and the tax court agreed,that this was improper.instead,the tax court found that mccarthy should have deducted a capital charge from the value of the contracts,based on a valuation of the intangible factors that takes into account the market rate of return on those factors.although the commissioner has not attempted to calculate what such a charge would look like,we assume that it would lead to a greater offset for these intangibles,and so to a smaller tax deduction.
capital argues,however,that mccarthy method,which used a rental charge rather than a capital charge,was proper and indeed standard.the tax court found that mccarthy explanation for not taking a capital charge for the related intangibles was not credible.id.at.capital claims that this contradicted the undisputed testimony of all the experts,which was that rental charges are normally used in insurance valuation,and that mccarthy use of them was proper.the commissioner responds that mccarthy charge for the related intangibles was based on their cost to capital rather than their market value,and that this method of deducting the other intangibles overstated the value of the lost contracts.
capital characterization of the record appears to be mistaken.the commissioner witnesses did not concede that mccarthy approach was correct,although neither did they claim that it was professionally untenable.they did argue for an alternative method,which presumably would have given a different,and greater,value to capital goodwill.
given the dispute in the record between experts,and the tax court greater familiarity with the issue,we can not conclude that the tax court finding here was clearly erroneous.indeed,this finding seems conceptually goodwill factors should be subtracted at their value,not their capital argues that mccarthy rental charge was meant to estimate value and not cost.we thus accept the tax court conclusion that mccarthy should have used a capital charge,rather than a rental charge,to extract goodwill from his valuation of the contracts.
but,as explained above,see supra part,capital does not lose its entire deduction merely because the commissioner has found some flaws in its method.on the remand that our other holdings require,the commissioner will have the opportunity to explain what mccarthy should have done differently in this regard,relying on specific calculations of cash flows rather than on generic names like capital charge versus rental charge.the commissioner will also be able to propose an alternate valuation for the million goodwill adjustment.capital,meanwhile,will have another opportunity to demonstrate to what extent mccarthy method captures the factors raised by the commissioner.
ultimately,the tax court must determine what goodwill adjustment is appropriate,using either mccarthy rental charge,a capital charge proposed by the commissioner on remand,or some other adjustment taking into account the arguments of both sides.in sum,the mere fact that mccarthy charge is flawed does not mean that the tax court may reject capital entire valuation.
specific contract characteristics 
the tax court next found that capital expert utilized incomplete information and made erroneous assumptions relating to the characteristics of the group contracts that alone would support disallowance of the million in loss deductions claimed.at.the tax court identified several instances of what it considered incomplete data or erroneous assumptions,and found that these errors made mccarthy valuation so uncertain as to be almost meaningless.
most importantly,the tax court found that mccarthy i gnored or did not consider historical premium payment and claim patterns and renewal expectations relating to each contract.at.the tax court also noted that,for many of the contracts that he valued,mccarthy used average premium or claims data,because individual contract data was lacking.id.at.
capital argues that the tax court was in error,because the contracts were appraised based on premium rates in effect on january,which reflect each of these factors on a basis.capital expert constance foster,an insurance attorney and former insurance commissioner of pennsylvania,testified that the demographics or any information about the customer is embedded in the rate.all we would do in renewing is look at their past claims experience and how many people are represented to project new rates.put differently,the experience rating process was intended to capture each group claims and payment experience in calculating each year premium rate.thus,mccarthy was able to value the contracts using only rate information,because the rate information captured the information that the tax court found missing.capital also explains that some of the contracts,which together accounted for approximately million of its million claimed deduction,were valued taking into account all of those factors,without any averaging or missing data regarding premiums or claims.
as an example of mccarthy failure to accurately appraise the value of contracts,the tax court cited the case of pennsylvania farmer union.this client group maintained three contracts that had a cumulative deficit of some in january.by,the deficit was million,and the contract was cancelled the following year,leaving capital to absorb the deficit.at.the tax court noted that,despite these deficits,mccarthy assigned the three farmer union contracts a total positive value of,or nearly percent of the total value attributed to all of petitioner group contracts that were terminated in.id.
the tax court reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the contract was not of positive value in merely because the contract ultimately caused capital a loss.as capital persuasively observes,it would not have renewed contracts that it expected to result in a loss,so it can reasonably be assumed that in its contracts had a positive expected value.indeed,one of capital experts testified that deficit accounts have a bit of more value as long as they stay with capital blue cross,because such accounts produce more margin in that capital will raise premium rates going forward for contracts with high claims rates.testimony also indicated that such deficit contracts did stay with capital blue cross,or at least that their lapse rates were not materially greater than those of other contracts.
as it turned out,capital continued to lose money on the farmer union contract,and the group ultimately cancelled the contract rather than paying a significantly increased premium,leaving capital with a large accumulated deficit.capital chief financial officer,robert markel,testified that farmer union had a deficit that was not unusually large as of,which grew larger in later years.he also testified that farmer union breached its contract by transferring employees to another carrier,and that capital cancelled the contract in upon learning of the breach.capital submits that,if this breach had not occurred,it would have been able to recoup its losses from the contract and make it profitable.capital position is that farmer union ballooning deficit and contract breach were not foreseeable in therefore,a reasonable buyer would have assigned the contract a relatively large positive value.
we believe that mccarthy valuation was reasonable.first,some of capital claimed deductions come from contracts in which averaging was not used and the data is complete.his assumptions about contracts,including those with a deficit in,were economically sensible the fact that the farmer union contract turned out to be disastrous does not prove that it had zero or negative value as of january.
the commissioner also seeks to defend the tax court decision about the characteristics of group contracts by pointing to the contracts,for which significant averaging was used.he notes,as did the tax court,that a small change in the expected claims ratio could have an enormous effect on the expected value of the contract use of a claims ratio just percent higher than the aggregate average claims ratio used by petitioner expert for group contracts would reduce petitioner projected profit relating to the contracts by more than half.at.but the commissioner has not demonstrated that there is anything wrong with using averaging,and the evidence indicates that an actual reinsurer would use an averaging method essentially identical to mccarthy.
the tax court is,of course,correct that averaging is sensitive to initial assumptions here,for instance,the valuation of the contracts depends on the average claims ratio the appropriate discount rate will also have a significant effect.but there is little in the record before us to suggest that mccarthy should have used different assumptions.in view of this fact,we must remand to the tax court to allow it to consider mccarthy procedure in more detail.
on remand,the commissioner may explain his objections to specific assumptions in mccarthy valuation,as regards both individual contracts and the collective assumptions about contracts.if the tax court finds that these assumptions were incorrect,it may find more appropriate figures and use them to calculate a more appropriate valuation of capital contracts.but if mccarthy assumptions were correct,or were those that a reasonable buyer would make,then the fact that his calculations were sensitive to his assumptions does not render his valuation incorrect.
lapse rates and lifing analysis 
a central part of mccarthy valuation was his lifing analysis,that is,the method by which he estimated the expected life of each contract as of.mccarthy used historical lapse rates to determine the probability that each group contract would lapse in any given year.these lapse rates were used to compute the expected life of each contract,which was essential to calculating its fair market value mccarthy used historical data from capital experience that indicated that each group contract had a to probability of lapsing from year to year,depending on factors such as group size and duration of the contract.at.the tax court had two objections to mccarthy lifing analysis first,that mccarthy did not take into account the uncertainty in the insurance market in,and second,that he did not take into account certain human elements that influence lapse rates 
prospective changes in the market 
first,the tax court found that the lapse rates did not account for foreseeable as of january,and significant changes in the health insurance marketplace.at.more specifically,the court found that mccarthy did not consider the impact that increased competition from hmos and other new insurance products would have on capital lapse rates.in,the argument goes,a willing buyer could have predicted that increased competition would lead to greater lapse rates,and thus would have valued capital contracts at a rate lower than mccarthy ascribed to them using historic lapse rates.
capital submits that this line of reasoning reflects a misunderstanding of the evidence.capital ceo testified that,in the,capital was aware of the competition from hmos,but expected that this competition would not significantly affect its market share or lapse rates because central pennsylvania,where capital operates,has a traditional market with relatively few hospital choices and a strong presence.mccarthy testified that he took the competitive situation into account,but determined that most of the competitive factors that led to lapses had already taken effect in the period that he used to determine lapse rates.
the commissioner experts reasoned that i n the presence of such significant market changes,the assumption that future lapse rates would be consistent with past lapse rates is,at best,problematic,and that the lapse rates were speculative in the extreme,given what was going on in the group health insurance market at the time.we are unconvinced.first of all,mccarthy,unlike the commissioner experts,seems to have spoken to capital management and considered circumstances unique to capital central pennsylvania market,while the commissioner experts considered only the national health insurance market.capital presented evidence that its market was for reasons suggested above uniquely resistant to the competitive pressures introduced by hmos and ppos therefore,mccarthy calculations based on capital own past data may well have been more accurate than the commissioner projections based on national trends.
furthermore,there does not seem to be any evidence that mccarthy lapse rates were incorrect.instead,capital evidence tends to show that subsequent experience proved capital projections correct it has not lost significant market share to hmos,and its historic lapse rates from were very close to those predicted by mccarthy.mccarthy table of historically derived lapse rate from a lapse rate for groups of members whose contracts had been in effect for over ten years to a rate for groups of members whose contracts had been in force for under one relatively well with capital actual experience.mccarthy testified that the experienced lapse rate by number of contracts was,while the lapse weighted rate by total premiums lost was just under.as mccarthy explained,the former number corresponds reasonably well to his predicted lapse rates for small groups,which were the most numerous,while the latter corresponds quite well to his predicted rates for large groups,which made up the bulk of capital premiums.of course,it is theoretically possible that mccarthy predicted lapse rates were speculative,but nonetheless turned out to be correct.but the general accuracy of his predictions is certainly strong evidence that they had a foundation in reasonable analysis rather than speculation.
the commissioner denies that mccarthy lapse rate predictions were accurate,although he has not pointed to any statistical evidence to refute the numbers we have cited above.instead,the commissioner cites a capital marketing plan from,which states that s ignificant losses from existing accounts are being incurred from hmo,and that the berkshire health plan ppo had targeted blue cross and blue shield customers and had been successful in enrolling a significant number of accounts through selective underwriting.
this document certainly supports the commissioner thesis that capital faced competition from hmos.but mccarthy testimony was that this competition had already developed by the period that he used to estimate lapse rates,and that his use of historical rates therefore accurately captured capital expectation of future rates.he testified that,based on discussions with capital executives,he concluded that the phenomena of increased competition,including from hmos and ppos had really already developed in the period of time i used for purposes of the lapse study and so i felt,after listening to them,that based on the situation in,it was not necessary to modify those experience rates that i sic had derived for purposes of projecting in the future.
without any contradictory evidence,we have no choice but to accept mccarthy representations that his predicted lapse rates turned out to be accurate.moreover,his on recent historical rates that he concluded incorporated the developing changes in the insurance industry,and discussing his predictions with capital management to get a sense of their predictions as of not strike us as speculative in the extreme.the tax court appears to have ignored capital evidence that mccarthy lapse rates were accurate,and to have unduly credited the commission
