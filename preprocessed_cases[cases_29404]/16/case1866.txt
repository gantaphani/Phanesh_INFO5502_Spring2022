cooper industries,cooper sued tarmac roofing systems,tarmac and international fidelity insurance ific for damages arising from the installation of a roof on cooper vicksburg,mississippi manufacturing plant.a jury found tarmac liable to cooper for negligence,breach of contract and warranty,and ific liable to cooper for negligence and breach of contract.tarmac and ific each contest their liability and the amount of damages awarded.we reverse the district court decision on tarmac rule motion,but affirm the district court decisions as to ific.
cooper hired moisture protection associates,mpa,a roofing consulting firm,to advise it regarding the roof installation,and to monitor the installation process.mpa,inter alia,assisted cooper in soliciting bids for the roofing contract and devising the following conditions for prospective contractors prove that they were trained by one of the membrane manufacturers to install the membrane agree to install the membrane in accordance with the manufacturer specifications,and obtain the manufacturer approval promise to procure a labor and materials warranty from the membrane manufacturer and obtain performance and payment bonds.castro,the contractor chosen by cooper,identified tarmac as the manufacturer of the membrane castro planned to use.castro provided proof that tarmac certified castro as trained to install the tarmac product,and tarmac agreed that the project was satisfactory to proceed.castro also obtained performance and payment bonds from ific 
shortly after the project began,castro owners died.while castro continued to perform under the contract,ific hired a consultant to monitor the payment of castro bills.what occurred next is subject to dispute.ific asserts that it was informed that castro had not made timely payment to some suppliers,and subsequently learned that castro could not meet its payroll obligations.thereafter,ific entered into an assignment agreement with castro in which it received cooper payments to castro in return for providing financial assistance to castro.as a consequence of the financial assistance provided by ific,castro was able to complete the project through its subcontractor,weatherguard.cooper,however,contends that after demands for payment were made,castro defaulted and ific took over the contract,entering into a subcontract with weatherguard to complete the project.
under either theory,problems arose regarding the quality of weatherguard work.at one point,cooper requested that ific remove weatherguard from the project,but ific refused.ific consultant,however,responded to cooper complaints by informing cooper that ific remained committed to completing the project,that it would monitor weatherguard daily progress,and would procure another contractor to assist weatherguard.ific then hired canton sheet metal roofing to complete the drainage system on the roof,and to perform any warranty work under the contractor roofing guarantee,which was executed in ific name as castro surety.
upon completion of the project,ific obtained the tarmac workmanship and material warranty for cooper.the warranty covered defects in the roof as long as the roof was installed in accordance with tarmac specifications.the weatherguard representative signed the warranty application f or castro roofing international fidelity insurance company and listed castro roofing dba castro rfg international fidelity insurance company as the contractor.on the warranty,castro rfg int l fidelity ins.was identified as the contractor.tarmac asserts that it issued the warranty based on weatherguard representations,as it did not inspect the roof.
less than a year after the roof was completed,it began to blister.for the first two years that the roof required repair,ific fulfilled its obligations under the contractor warranty by paying to have the roof repaired.after the contractor warranty expired,cooper continued to make repairs.thereafter,cooper informed tarmac that the tarmac warranty covered the roofing repairs.after the roof,tarmac denied liability,concluding that the contractor failure to follow tarmac installation procedures necessitated the repair work.next,cooper informed ific that it would seek liability damages against ific,as surety for castro.
cooper repaired and replaced parts of the roof,and sued ific and tarmac for the repair and replacement costs.the district court denied tarmac and ific motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law.the jury found ific liable for breach of contract and negligence,and tarmac liable for breach of contract,negligence,and breach of warranty.the jury denied ific and tarmac cross claims for indemnification,and awarded damages of for the repair and replacement costs less betterments.the district court entered judgment against ific and tarmac for.the court arrived at this amount by deducting the value of cooper use of the defective roof from the amount awarded by the jury.

cooper charges tarmac with negligence and breach of contract under a theory that castro and weatherguard were tarmac agents,making tarmac liable for their acts and omissions.tarmac contends that cooper failed to produce any evidence that castro and weatherguard were tarmac agents,or should be treated as such.in mississippi,t he burden of proving an agency relationship is on the party asserting it.booker pettey,so d.cooper argues that the controlling law in mississippi on the issue of whether tarmac should be held responsible for castro and weatherguard conduct is found in fedders boatright,so d.in fedders,the mississippi supreme court held a manufacturer of a heat pump liable for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.the consumer in that case purchased the pump from the manufacturer authorized dealer,and the dealer installed the pump.according to the court,fedders manufactured and placed on the market a machine which required personnel of special skill and knowledge to install.fedders,contracted with,and represented that oh cc w as its authorized dealer,to sell and install its machines in residences,and oh cc carried the fedders sign.id.at.the court noted that the heat pump was not sold directly by fedders to a consumer,with the consumer having the responsibility for its proper installation,but through an authorized dealer which made the installation.id.at.
at first blush,fedders appears to control this case,as the facts underlying that opinion are somewhat similar to the facts in this case.a close read of fedders,however,indicates that the two cases are factually distinguishable.first,the consumer in fedders purchased a specific product,a heat pump.to acquire this product,the consumer went to a dealer authorized by fedders to carry its product,and bear its insignia.in the present case,the purchaser,cooper,sought a new roof for its plant,and,therefore,shopped for a roofing contractor to perform roofing did not shop for a product.second,unlike the authorized dealer in fedders,there was no evidence presented that castro was a dealer in tarmac products,as castro business was selling a service not a product,and castro was certified by a number of different manufacturers.third,in fedders,the court noted that the heat pump was sold by the manufacturer dealer to a consumer to be used in a residence.here,the tarmac membrane was sold through a dealer to the plaintiff contractor to be used in a commercial setting,and the plaintiff hired a roofing consulting firm to monitor the installation.thus,the concerns that animated the court holding in a manufacturer not avoid liability when its authorized dealer sells a piece of machinery,which requires special skill to install,to a not arise in the case sub judice.
as fedders does not control the outcome of this case,the district court ruling denying tarmac rule motion is only proper if cooper proved that under mississippi general agency law there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis regarding the existence of an agency relationship between tarmac and.we have previously noted that under mississippi law,a n agency relationship may be express or de facto.a de facto agency may be proven by the presence of three elements at the time of contracting m anifestation by the alleged principal,either by words or conduct,that the alleged agent is employed as such by the principal,t he agent acceptance of the arrangement,and t he parties understood that the principal will control the undertaking.stripling jordan prod,cir quoting forest oil tenneco.
cooper presented the following evidence regarding alleged agency status tarmac certified installers tarmac sent a letter to cooper stating that a number of its certified installers were bidding on the project and that a warranty would issue on the condition that the membrane was installed according to tarmac specifications tarmac sent a letter to mpa confirming tarmac review of the site,stating that the project was satisfactory to proceed,and that tarmac was sure mpa was headed for a successful project tarmac visited the site a few times and tarmac circulated a brochure within the roofing industry indicating that professionals installed the tarmac product.
this evidence failed to establish a legally sufficient evidentiary basis as to whether tarmac manifested that were its agents,or that agreed to serve as tarmac agents.the evidence showed that installers could be certified by numerous manufacturers,that castro was certified by a variety of manufacturers,and that tarmac certified its installers because it issued a warranty for its product.the tarmac brochure also does not suggest that were tarmac agents,as the brochure did not mention or state that tarmac certified installers were its agents.further,there was no evidence presented that the individuals at cooper who decided to hire castro knew or relied on the brochure.
the evidence also failed to establish the exercise of control by tarmac over.although tarmac sent letters to cooper and mpa regarding its installers,the information contained in these letters was either related to the tarmac warranty,or required by cooper in its bid documents moreover,there was no evidence that tarmac received any revenue on the cooper project apart from the revenue it received from the sale of the membrane,or that tarmac could select the projects for its certified installers to perform.finally,while a tarmac employee visited the site a few times,the visits were for customer relations reasons.cooper did not present evidence that during these visits tarmac exercised any control over the installers.therefore,there did not exist a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to submit the agency issue to the jury,and tarmac rule motion should have been granted.
cooper also charged tarmac with breach of express warranty.tarmac moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a,b.tarmac contended that it did not breach its warranty because cooper witnesses testified that the membrane was installed improperly,and section of tarmac warranty provides t he original installation of the roofing membrane must be installed in accordance with tarmac published specifications in order for this warranty to be effective.the district court denied tarmac motions,reasoning that section of the warranty was void as an unenforceable attempt to limit liability based on ann,and fedders.
as previously noted,fedders does not control our decision in this case.likewise,we find that does not dictate the result here.section provides a ny oral or written language used by a manufacturer of consumer goods,which attempts to limit or modify a consumer remedies for breach of the manufacturer express warranties,is unenforceable.emphasis added.by its own terms,does not preclude our giving effect to section of the warranty because cooper is a merchant,not a consumer.cooper is considered a merchant because it hired a roofing consulting firm to monitor the roof installation.under ann,the expertise of the roofing firm is imputed to cooper.see ann.merchant means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.emphasis added.further,the goods in question are not consumer goods,goods used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes.ann.see ann.applying ann.to chapter of the uniform commercial code.consequently,does not prevent the limitation in the warranty from applying.
cooper makes two arguments as to why the limitation in the warranty should not be read as an obstacle to its claim against tarmac.first,cooper claims that the contractor did not violate tarmac installation specifications.cooper avers that the contractor was not required to follow tarmac specific procedures for installing the membrane,but rather,was only required to follow tarmac general outline for membrane installation cooper argues that to hold otherwise would render the warranty provision covering claims arising from faulty workmanship useless.
cooper argument fails,as the testimony presented by cooper experts unequivocally established that tarmac installation procedures were violated.therefore,pursuant to the terms of the warranty,the warranty was ineffective due to faulty workmanship.the workmanship provision of the warranty is not rendered meaningless because it covers only a narrow class of problems,workmanship defects that occur despite the fact that the contractor installed the material in accordance with the installation procedures set forth by tarmac.
second,cooper asserts that a tarmac representative stated that the warranty would issue if the installation was accomplished according to tarmac specifications.accordingly,cooper contends that regardless of whether the provisions of the warranty were met,when tarmac issued the warranty,it became effective.we disagree.the fact that tarmac issued a warranty does not undercut the provisions of the warranty detailing whether the warranty is operative.the warranty provides that its validity is contingent upon proper installation,and the warrantor is not bound by any statements not contained in the warranty.thus,there did not exist a legally sufficient evidentiary basis regarding cooper warranty claim,and tarmac rule motion should have been granted 
in the proceedings before the district court,ific requested summary judgment on the ground that cooper claims elapsed because its claims were not filed within the time specified by the performance bond or ann.the district court denied ific motion.we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,acknowledging that summary judgment is warranted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c daniels city of arlington,cir.as all relevant conduct occurred in mississippi,the law of mississippi governs issues of substantive law.see mckee,at.
ific argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment when it held that,ific may properly be sued under the performance bond and the roofing contract for those duties which were originally incumbent upon castro as contractor.the district court arrived at this conclusion by determining that ific took over the contract upon castro default ific,however,asserts that it did not assume the contract,but rather,merely fulfilled its contractual bond obligation to remedy castro default by meeting castro financial obligations.by doing so,ific allowed castro to complete the contract through its subcontractor,weatherguard.accordingly,ific contends that coo
