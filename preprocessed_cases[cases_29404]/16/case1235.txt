in this case we must determine whether an insurance company properly denied coverage to its insured.in,entities and individuals related to appellant miller development company miller were sued in a contract dispute.subsequently,in,miller entered into a liability insurance contract with appellee continental casualty company continental.miller itself was sued in in a fraudulent conveyance action seeking recovery on the judgment entered in the lawsuit.miller tendered the suit to continental,seeking coverage of defense costs.continental,however,determined that the lawsuit alleged interrelated wrongful conduct with the allegations made in the lawsuit brought against entities related to miller.because allegations of such interrelated wrongful conduct constituted a claim first made in,before the policy period,continental denied coverage.miller went on to successfully defend the lawsuit at its own cost.
in,miller sued continental for breach of the insurance contract and sought as damages the costs it incurred defending itself in the lawsuit.the crux of the parties dispute is whether the allegations in the and lawsuits are,indeed,interrelated wrongful acts as defined by the insurance policy.the district court determined that continental properly denied coverage.we now affirm.
in the early,one of the principals of miller,edward miller,founded a land development company,haymount limited partnership haymount.miller owned upwards of of haymount at all relevant times.edward miller,is the chairman of miller as well as the president of haymount.haymount goal was to develop acres of land along the rappahannock river in virginia caroline county.
in order to develop the property,haymount required considerable financing.on september,haymount entered into an agreement with international benefits group,ibg.ibg agreed to introduce haymount to lenders in exchange for a finder fee of million if haymount secured a loan as a result of ibg introductions.on november,haymount entered into a similar arrangement with american property consultants,apc.this agreement provided that apc,too,would receive a finder fee if a loan to haymount resulted from any of apc introductions to lenders.
haymount eventually secured a million loan from general motors acceptance corporation residential gmac.haymount then paid a finder fee to apc and terminated their agreement.upon learning of the gmac loan,ibg also sought payment of its fee and sent haymount a list of lenders to whom ibg had introduced haymount.the list of introduced lenders included gmac.haymount refused to pay the million fee and terminated its agreement with ibg on june.ibg filed for chapter bankruptcy less than a month later,allegedly as a direct result of haymount failure to pay its fee.
in,ibg sued in the district of new jersey seeking payment of the million fee it claimed it was owed under the agreement with haymount ibg named several defendants haymount westminster associates ii,westminster,another development company that invested in haymount john clark clark,the owner of westminster edward miller,and apc.ibg asserted causes of action for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,tortious interference,common law civil conspiracy,and state law statutory conspiracy.through their motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,the defendants successfully narrowed the claims to one ibg claim for breach of contract.on january,the district court entered judgement against haymount,among others,on ibg breach of contract claim for the sum of million plus interest,for a total judgment of.
eight months after the judgment in the lawsuit,on october,ibg again sued haymount and related parties.the lawsuit alleged that the defendants took actions to render themselves judgment proof so that ibg could not collect on the judgment entered in its favor after the lawsuit.in this second suit,ibg named as defendants,among others,haymount,miller,edward miller,and clark.the causes of action asserted in the lawsuit included fraudulent transfer,fraudulent conveyance,common law and statutory conspiracy,creditor fraud,and aiding and abetting.the complaint in the action detailed the haymount development project,the ownership structure of haymount,the events leading to the contract between ibg and haymount,and the course of the lawsuit giving rise to the judgment in ibg favor.
miller entered into a liability insurance contract with continental in.miller tendered this second lawsuit to continental seeking coverage of defense costs.continental denied coverage as being outside the scope of the policy.miller therefore proceeded with the defense at its own expense.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.the court concluded that the challenged transfers were legitimate transfers to a secured creditor senior to ibg and were not,therefore,fraudulent conveyances designed to defeat ibg judgment.the third circuit affirmed.kohn mcguire woods,app x cir.
miller filed the lawsuit that is the subject of this appeal on february.miller alleges that continental wrongfully denied coverage under the policy and should be required to pay the costs miller incurred defending the lawsuit.
the policy,contains several relevant provisions.the policy includes coverage for employment practices liability,directors and officers liability,and entity liability.general terms and conditions at the beginning of the policy apply throughout.under the policy,continental will provide coverage to miller for claims against miller made during the coverage period for a wrongful act by an insured person.the policy coverage period is november,through november,a claim is a demand for damages or relief,including a civil action,against an insured.the insurance policy covers claims made against subsidiaries of miller such as haymount.
the policy provides,however more than one claim involving the same wrongful act or interrelated wrongful acts shall be considered as one claim which shall be deemed made on the date on which the earliest such claim was first made emphases in original.in other words,if more than one claim involving interrelated wrongful acts is made against miller or its subsidiaries,the multiple claims are considered a single claim made on the date on which the earliest of the claims was made.further,the policy expansively defines interrelated wrongful acts as any wrongful acts which are logically or causally connected by reason of any common fact,circumstance,situation,transaction or event.emphasis in original.from this language,continental reasoned that the acts alleged in the lawsuit and the fraudulent conveyance and other acts alleged in the lawsuit were interrelated wrongful acts constituting a single claim.under the terms of the policy,such a claim should be deemed to have been made in,before the policy coverage period began on november.continental therefore concluded the claim was not insured by the policy.
after some limited discovery,continental moved for judgment on the pleadings and miller moved for summary judgment.on november,the district court granted continental motion and denied miller motion.the district court found that the allegations in the lawsuit were interrelated wrongful acts with the allegations in the lawsuit and,therefore,pursuant to the policy,that the claim was deemed to have been made in.
the district court agreed with continental that under the policy broad definition of interrelated wrongful acts,the and lawsuits were related and shared a common nexus because they involved allegations of a common scheme involving the same claimant,the same fee commission,the same contract,and the same real estate transaction.in addition to finding the existence of an alleged common scheme,the district court found that the alleged common scheme logically and causally connected the and actions but for the alleged actions of haymount,miller,and others trying to avoid payment to ibg,the lawsuit would never have been filed.accordingly,the district court concluded that the lawsuit constitutes part of the claim brought in and that continental properly denied coverage because the claim was made before the commencement of the policy period on november.
