backgrounda.facts 
the plaintiffs are the owners and operators of berkshire auto truck,berkshire auto,an business,which they started in.in or early,the plaintiffs approached miller about the possibility of purchasing his property located at berkshire avenue the premises for berkshire auto new location.miller was amenable to the sale,but wanted to avoid paying capital gains tax on the property.the parties therefore settled on a lease with a purchase option.the lease was executed on february,and began on march.the purchase option,contained in article xvii,subsection,is as follows 
the tenants shall have an option to purchase the premises for the sum of one hundred seventy five thousand dollars to be exercised during the term of this lease by instrument in writing directed to the landlord at its designated address provided that the tenants shall not then be in default in the payment of rent or any of the other terms and conditions hereof.
article iv,subsection allowed the plaintiffs to make alterations or improvements with miller written consent.under article vi,subsection,prior written consent also was required for any sublease or assignment.however,any sublease or assignment would not alter the overall rental obligation of the plaintiffs under the lease article vii,subsection required the plaintiffs to comply with all of the requirements of all county,municipal,state,federal and other applicable governmental authorities and faithfully observe in the use of the premises all municipal and county ordinances and state and federal statutes.article xiv,subsection provided that waiver of any breach,covenant or condition,or acceptance of rent subsequent to a breach,was not a waiver of the lease term and that any waiver had to be in writing.subsection required any amendment to the agreement to be in writing.
miller duties under the agreement included a provision in article iv,subsection that he warrant the good condition and repair of the roof of the premises for a period of ten years and agree to be responsible for any necessary repairs thereto.the plaintiffs specifically requested this provision because an inspection had revealed that the roof had several issues and needed work.bachorz testified that he may not have entered into the lease had miller not agreed to warrant the good condition of the roof.bachorz believed that,in ten years,berkshire auto would be financially able to take over responsibilities for the roof.
the plaintiffs leased the premises in their own name and immediately began subleasing it to berkshire auto,although the record does not indicate whether this arrangement included a formal written sublease.the lease did not provide explicitly that the plaintiffs would sublease the premises to berkshire auto,and the plaintiffs did not obtain written permission for that arrangement.miller himself also continued to maintain an office on the premises until however,the lease contained no provision contemplating that miller would continue to occupy part of the premises 
bachorz testified that,after signing the lease,miller encouraged the plaintiffs to find subtenants to assist in paying rent and thus utilize the entire building.at some point between and early,the plaintiffs allowed an individual to operate a discount dog food business on the premises in exchange for a portion of his sales revenue.in february,the plaintiffs allowed another business,berkshire rv rentals,to operate on the premises without paying rent.bachorz testified that,although he did not obtain express oral or written consent to sublet to the dog food business,miller knew about the arrangement because he walked past displays of dog food every day when he came to his office on the premises.bachorz testified that,when he approached miller about subletting to berkshire rv rentals in early,miller said it was a good idea and agreed to vacate his office to make room for the new subtenant berkshire rv rentals occupied space on the premises for three or four months.from february until at least the date of the district court ruling in september,the plaintiffs sublet two offices on the premises to tri lift,a forklift company,for per month.as with the other subtenants,there was no written lease,just a oral agreement.the parties agree that the plaintiffs did not notify or obtain permission from miller or miller forslund prior to subleasing to tri lift.
the roof of the premises leaked at least once every year from the commencement of the lease until.bachorz testified that the leaky roof caused property damage including a radio and alarm system,and the plaintiffs had to hang plastic from the ceiling to channel the incoming water.in may,the plaintiffs attorney notified miller in writing that the roof was leaking yet again,had caused property damage and was sagging.a professional estimated that it would cost over to repair the roof properly.the letter noted that miller prior attempts to repair the roof had failed and demanded that he comply with the lease term requiring him to repair it properly.miller responded by letter saying that replacing the roof was not an option.he stated that the plaintiffs owed him in late fees and,in a,noted that the plaintiffs were in default for subletting a portion of the premises without prior written consent.bachorz testified that,when he spoke with miller after the letter exchange,miller said that he would not pay for a new roof and told the plaintiffs,you guys should pay for the roof because you going to own the building.in response to interrogatories,the plaintiffs stated that miller agreed to waive any default as to subtenants.he said words to the effect that the place will be yours soon.i do want to pay anything else for maintenance.if you pay for the roof,i will not raise any issue about present or future subtenants.in their depositions,both plaintiffs also testified that miller told them that,if they paid for the roof,he would not worry about the lack of prior written consent for the subtenants.bachorz specifically testified that this oral agreement included past and future subtenants.the plaintiffs replaced the roof at their own expense in bachorz testified that the delay was probably because they could not afford the repair in in addition to replacing the roof,the plaintiffs made other changes to the property over the course of the lease bachorz testified that miller verbally approved their efforts and told them that they were doing a good job.
miller died on january,and his daughter,shaunice miller forslund,became executrix of his estate.on april,miller forslund attorney sent a letter informing the plaintiffs that they were in default for failing to pay late fees,subleasing the premises without prior written consent and failing to resubmit rental payments when two checks designated as mortgage were refused.the letter stated that these defaults precluded the plaintiffs from exercising the purchase option.on may,the plaintiffs sent miller forslund a written notice of their intent to exercise the option.when miller forslund refused to sell,the plaintiffs sued,demanding specific performance or damages of plus costs and fees.
