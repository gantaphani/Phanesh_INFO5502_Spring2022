joint venture ptjv or appellant appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of ace american insurance ace or appellee.ptjv filed suit,claiming coverage under primary and excess insurance policies with regard to a construction project in oxon hill,maryland.the district court determined ace was entitled to summary judgment because ptjv did not obtain ace consent before settling the underlying dispute regarding property damage at the construction site and,pursuant to the insurance contract,ptjv was required to do so at the risk of relinquishing coverage.we hold that under maryland and tennessee law,ptjv violated the terms of both the primary and excess policies by not obtaining ace consent before settlement,and as such,can not now claim reimbursement under those policies.we thus affirm the district court.
in,gaylord national llc gaylord hired ptjv,a joint venture between the perini building company and turner construction company,to serve as manager in connection with the construction of a million hotel and convention center in oxon hill,maryland the project.as part of the construction contract between ptjv and gaylord the contract,gaylord agreed to purchase and maintain an owner controlled insurance program ocip,which was a program crafted and sold by ace to insure only the project and its participants.
gaylord then purchased from ace an ocip commercial general liability insurance policy the primary policy,providing a limit of million per occurrence,and an ocip excess liability policy the excess policy,providing a limit of million per occurrence collectively,the policies.the policies provided coverage for the period from may,to august.by endorsement,ptjv was added as a named insured on the policies.the project was also insured by a builders risk policy through factory mutual insurance company fm global.
during construction of the signature feature of the building an story,ton glass atrium serious property damage occurred.the damage is described in the complaint as follows 
a significant portion of the project involved the construction of a glass roof atrium.the atrium was composed of numerous subsections,called trusses,that were preassembled on the ground and lifted via crane into place.each truss contained several components,including supportive tension rods that were connected by junctures.
the atrium was under construction on or about august,while truss was lifted into position and,on or about august,certain components were added to the atrium that placed additional pressure and tension on truss,causing,unbeknownst to either gaylord or ptjv,one of the junctures on truss to slowly erode.
on september,the juncture on truss,which began eroding no later than august,failed.that failure caused a loss of tension that substantially impaired the structural integrity of the atrium the collapse.
the collapse caused damage to various components of the project and required a temporary suspension of the project and such damages were neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of ptjv.
a representative from ace was on site at the project at the time of the collapse and thereafter.the project was scheduled to be completed in december,but due to various delays including the collapse,the completion date was pushed to march.
the underlying litigation 
after the project was completed,litigation ensued.on september,ptjv filed a complaint against gaylord for establishment and enforcement of a mechanic lien,breach of contract,quantum meruit,and violation of the maryland prompt payment act.see joint venture,et gaylord,llc,no,the ptjv action.ptjv alleged gaylord still owed under the contract and asked for damages plus interest,costs,and fees.the claims were based on the costs allegedly incurred due to gaylord late delivery of the project designs and its alleged changes to the original scope of the work.
subsequently,on october,gaylord countersued,filing a complaint against ptjv for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.see gaylord,llc joint venture,no,the gaylord action.gaylord claimed ptjv failed to properly manage scheduling,costs,and budgets,and failed to build a project at the price.specifically,gaylord alleged it paid ptjv,when it should have only paid.thus,gaylord sought reimbursement of approximately million in damages resulting from the alleged overpayment.notably,ptjv did not notify ace of the gaylord action.
gaylord and ptjv settled the gaylord action on november,gaylord paid an additional for a total of almost million and ptjv credited back to gaylord.crucial to this appeal,ptjv never sought to obtain ace consent prior to entering into this settlement.
the coverage litigation 
on may,almost six months after the settlement and nearly two years after the collapse,ptjv sent a letter to ace advising that,to the extent fm global did not pay the claim related to the collapse,ptjv intended to seek reimbursement from ace.this letter was the first formal,written notice of a claim to ace,although ace concedes its representative was present on the site when the collapse occurred.however,this letter did not mention the settlement or the gaylord action at all.over ten months later,on february,ace issued a reservation of rights letter,citing b usiness r isk exclusions,late notice,and voluntary payments made without ace consent as potential grounds for denial of coverage.on april,fm global denied ptjv claims.
after several additional months of between ptjv and ace,on december,ptjv filed suit against ace in the united states district court for the district of maryland,alleging 
count one breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing ace refused neglected to pay any portion of the c laims regarding the collapse pursuant to the primary policy or the excess policy and is in breach of its contractual obligations to ptjv.
count two a declaratory judgment to determine the rights and duties of ptjv and ace pursuant to the primary policy and the excess policy and 
count three bad faith under tennessee law based on,inter alia,ace intentionally recklessly t aking direction from another named insured to deny ptjv claim,and engag ing in unwarranted delay tactics.
ace filed a motion to dismiss on february,and the district court denied the motion in part on september,but ordered that limited discovery be conducted on issues regarding late notice to ace,including any corresponding prejudice.after discovery,ace filed a summary judgment motion on august.the district court held oral argument on october,and orally granted summary judgment in favor of ace.the district court explained,
it really is not disputed that the settlement occurred without consent.
what clear is that the defendant was not given an opportunity to enter into settlement negotiations in any way to determine whether the concessions that were being made by the plaintiff in this case were in any way reasonable,whether there was any collusion because there were other claims going back and forth,and this carrier clearly did not involve itself.
t he court is prepared to find that there is a reasonable dispute as to notice of the occurrence and even arguably as to notice of claim.the problem here is with the notice of settlement.now,the court feels as a matter of law,the defendant w as entitled to notice of the settlement negotiations to intervene,to investigate,to challenge.
a formal order issued the next day,october,granting summary judgment for the reasons stated on the record at the hearing.this timely appeal followed.
before we proceed to the merits of this appeal,we first decide the proper law to apply.a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits.see seabulk offshore,am.home assurance,cir.in this diversity action,the district court was correct in applying maryland choice of law rules.see caci int l,paul fire and marine ins,cir because we have diversity jurisdiction in this case,we apply the choice of law rules of the forum state.
in insurance contract disputes,maryland follows the principle of lex loci contractus,which applies the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made.allstate ins.hart.for choice of law purposes,a contract is made where the last act is performed which makes the agreement a binding contract.typically,this is where the policy is delivered and the premiums are paid.sting,first mercury syndicate,internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.in this case,that state is tennessee 
under certain circumstances,however,maryland choice of law rules follow the renvoi doctrine,an exception to the lex loci contractus rule.under this exception,a maryland court may disregard the rule of lex loci contractus and apply maryland law,if 
maryland has the most significant relationship,or,at least,a substantial relationship with respect to the contract issue presented and 
the state where the contract was entered into would not apply its own substantive law,but instead would apply maryland substantive law to the issue before the court.
see am.motorists ins.artra group.
we recognize,however,c hoice of law analysis becomes necessary only if the relevant laws of the different states lead to different outcomes and where the laws do not so conflict,the choice is immaterial,and the law of the.lowry reports,legg mason,d,see also int l adm rs,life ins.of,cir conflicts rules are appealed to only when a difference in law will make a difference to the outcome.as explained below,under either tennessee or maryland law,the outcome is the same.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see francis allstate ins,cir.we also review de novo a district court decision on an issue of contract interpretation.see seabulk offshore am.home assurance,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
the policies 
in essence,this is a simple contract interpretation case.see rouse fed.ins,it is axiomatic that an insurance contract is interpreted like any other contract.if the policy language is clear and unambiguous,the court will assume the parties meant what they said citations omitted.as with any contractual dispute,we start with the relevant policy provisions.see prince george cnty.local gov t ins.trust,in interpreting an insurance policy,as with any contract,the primary task of the circuit court is to apply the terms of the policy itself.
the primary policy contains the following provisions 
right and duty to defend clause we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking property damages we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result.our right and duty to defend end when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgment or settlements.
voluntary payment clause no insured will,except at that insured own cost,voluntarily make a payment,assume any obligation,or incur any expense,other than for first aid,without our consent.
clause no person or organization has a right under this coverage part t o sue us on this coverage part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.a person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement an agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us,the insured and the claimant or the claimant legal representative.
the excess policy likewise contains similar duty to defend,voluntary payment,and clauses.see.
maryland law 
section of the maryland code provides,
an insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured or a person claiming the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.
ann.emphasis added.ptjv relies heavily on this statute and argues that ace denial of coverage centers on ptjv alleged lack of notice of the claim regarding the collapse and lack of cooperation in ptjv failure to notify ace of the gaylord claim and settlement.as such,it contends,ace must show actual prejudice before denying coverage,which is an issue of fact that should survive summary judgment.
ace,in contrast,maintains that regardless of whether ptjv provided them with timely notice of the claim or whether they had constructive knowledge through their representative,there is no dispute that ptjv did not obtain ace consent before settlement,in violation of the voluntary payment and clauses.ace argues prejudice is irrelevant in this instance,but even if ace were required to show prejudice,we should infer prejudice as a matter of law because ace was left in the dark during the pendency of the underlying litigation and the negotiations leading to the finalization of the settlement,and otherwise,ace will be placed in the impossible position of having to prove a negative appellee br.
we agree with ace that t he central issue in this appeal is whether the insured can unilaterally settle a construction defect case,present the settlement to its liability insurer as a fait accompli,and obtain indemnification despite its blatant breach of clear and unambiguous policy provisions.appellee br.
we find phillips way,american equity insurance to be particularly instructive in dissecting this case.see.there,phillips way,a construction company,contracted to design and construct a clubhouse for the university of maryland.see id.at.during the course of the construction,several architectural and design defects arose,and phillips way decided to settle complaints about these problems to the tune of,without notifying its insurance carrier,american equity.once the project had been accepted by the university,phillips way made a claim against american equity for.see id.at.the contract between american equity and phillips way contained a clause which stated,in relevant part,
no action shall be maintained against the company by the insured to recover for any loss under this insurance policy unless,as a condition precedent thereto,the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms and conditions of this insurance policy,nor until the amount of such loss has been fixed or rendered certain by agreement between the parties with the written consent of the company.
just like ptjv in this case,phillips way argued that.ann.applied,and as such,american equity was required to show they were prejudiced by its failure to obtain consent before settlement.but the court of special appeals held that section should not be read to be applicable to any defense raised by the insurer.at.specifically,it explained section was inapplicable when an insurer defends on the basis that its insured failed to meet the condition precedent set forth in a clause id.at.it continued,
from the perspective of the insurer,one of the main purposes of a no action clause is to protect it from collusive or overly generous or unnecessary settlements by the insured at the expense of the insurer.that purpose would be difficult to accomplish if an insured could disregard the clause,sue its insurer,and put the nearly impossible burden on the latter of showing collusion or demonstrating,after the fact,the true worth of the settled claim.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
phillips way is directly applicable to the case at hand.the clause in this case states that the insured can not sue under the policies unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.emphasis added.it also states that ptjv can sue to recover on a settlement only if the settlement and release of liability is signed by ace.id.the voluntary payment clause requires ace consent before voluntarily mak ing a payment,assum ing any obligation,or incur ring any expense,at the risk of relinquishing coverage.these are conditions precedent to ptjv ability to obtain coverage,that is,fact s,other than mere lapse of time,which,unless executed,must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance of a promise arises.chirichella erwin,internal quotation marks omitted.w here a contractual duty is subject to a condition precedent,whether express or implied,there
