during the construction of a shipbuilding facility in bath,maine,a series of events,primarily attributable to the caprices of nature,delayed the schedule,forcing significant alterations to the work plan and ultimately making the project more expensive than had been anticipated.these events led to a dispute between the project dredging subcontractor,inner space services,issi,and the drilling and blasting subcontractor it had hired,northeast drilling,ndi,over who should bear the additional costs arising from these various matters.following a bench trial,the district court determined that ndi should receive some of the payments it claimed were due under its contract with issi,but that it was not entitled to the full amount because it had failed to render complete performance under its agreement with issi.the court also awarded attorney fees and interest to ndi.
on appeal,issi challenges a number of the district court factual findings,and argues that the court erred by declining to make certain additional findings.issi also assigns error to several legal determinations made by the district court,including the district court failure to join the general contractor as a party,its refusal to grant issi motion for judgment as a matter of law,and its approach to calculating damages.we affirm in all respects.
background 
the facts of this case are chronicled extensively in the district court opinion,northeast drilling,inner space,wl,and so we restrict our discussion to the facts bearing on this appeal.on september,issi,a firm,entered into an agreement with atkinson construction atkinson,the general contractor on the bath iron works land level facility construction project biw project or project.the biw project,which took place along the banks of the kennebec river in bath,maine,involved the creation of a facility enabling bath iron works to build simultaneously three navy destroyer ships and to launch those ships into a floating dry dock.to this end,issi was hired by atkinson to lower the underwater rock table to a suitable elevation through drilling,blasting,and dredging.
before submitting its bid to atkinson,issi had contacted ndi,a drilling and blasting specialist headquartered in maine,about ndi availability to perform work on the biw project.after securing the subcontract with atkinson,issi concluded an agreement with ndi on november.according to the terms of the contract,ndi was to be paid for its drilling and blasting work on the area of submerged rock specified in the contract for this sum,ndi agreed to perform blasting on a x grid,with the intent of supplying diggable rock for dredging.nowhere in the contract was the term diggable defined.the agreement further provided that if,at some point during the project,issi asked ndi to perform drilling and blasting work outside of the designated area in order to achieve the desired elevation therein,ndi would receive a proportional amount of any claims made to atkinson by issi for such additional work.pursuant to the parties arrangement,ndi was to be paid if and only if issi receives compensation from atkinson for work in this expanded area finally,the timeline for ndi performance under the contract was structured to account for the stringent environmental regulations protecting the kennebec river sturgeon population.ndi was to commence work on or about november,being the point at which the sturgeon typically vacate the affected area,and was to finish its operations by the end of march of the following year,when the fish were expected to return.
unfortunately for the parties,the kennebec river sturgeon were uncharacteristically slow to swim away from the project area that year and,as a result,ndi did not receive authorization to begin blasting until january.by that time,ice floes had emerged on the surface of the river.this floating ice posed a significant challenge to ndi operations by threatening to detach the detonation cords that ndi planned to stretch from the drilling barge to the holes in the submerged rock that contained the blast charges.in response to this problem,ndi abandoned its original blasting plan,which called for detonating several rows of explosives simultaneously,and decided to blast one row at a time.this attempt at only created a new set of difficulties,however,as the blasting of the first row of charges broke up the rock in the surrounding area,making it nearly impossible to fulfill the contractual obligation to drill another row of holes six feet from the previous row.accordingly,ndi proposed an alternative to issi it would extend the size of the drilling and blasting grids from x to x or x while continuing to blast one row at a time.issi was reluctant to endorse this approach,as it knew that its likely byproduct would be larger pieces of rock that would be more difficult to dredge,and it expressed these concerns,in writing and in person,to ndi president,forrest bradbury.nonetheless,ndi went forward with the modified plan,believing that it had secured issi acquiescence.
the ad hoc nature of this drilling and blasting technique also forced the parties to incur unexpected costs along the way.in order to account for the extra labor necessitated by the,blasting technique,atkinson leased an additional drilling barge,known to the parties as the hughes barge,and backcharged its cost to issi.issi,in turn,deducted this cost from the amount to be paid to ndi.additionally,ndi was called upon by issi to do drilling and blasting in the expanded area in an attempt to improve the quality of the blasted rock inside the contract area.issi,however,failed to submit a request to atkinson,as required under its agreement with the general contractor,until september six months after ndi had demobilized from the biw project site.
although ndi ultimately did complete its drilling and blasting work before the march environmental window closed,the proportion of large rock it left behind made it impossible for issi to do dredging work using the equipment already on site this forced issi to lease extra equipment and to spend more time dredging the area,and as a result,it was required to cancel a subsequent dredging contract in boston,depriving it of additional revenue.furthermore,a survey of the site commissioned by atkinson after ndi demobilization revealed that some of the submerged land,particularly that located in the expanded area,was not at the proper elevation.
because of these problems,issi sent a default notice to ndi in march,asserting that ndi had failed to perform its contractual obligations to provide diggable rock and to lower the submerged rock to the proper elevation.although it made several payments after ndi demobilization,issi refused to pay the remaining due ndi under the initial million contract price.issi also refused to absorb any of the cost of the hughes barge,electing to treat the full cost of approximately as a component of the drilling and blasting operations for which ndi bore responsibility.finally,a dispute between atkinson and issi over the cost of the blasting and drilling performed by ndi in the expanded area resulted in ndi not receiving any payments for that work,as the contract provision dealing with work outside the target area stated that ndi would only receive a proportional share of the payments that issi obtained from atkinson and issi did not initially seek such sums.
on april,ndi sued issi in the superior court of sagadahoc county,maine,claiming breach of contract,unjust enrichment,quantum meruit,and equitable accounting,as well as a cause of action under maine law for delayed contractor payments.issi removed the case to federal district court based on the diversity of the parties and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,and on june,it filed an answer and counterclaim,asserting that ndi failure to produce adequately sized rock and to lower the submerged rock to elevation amounted to negligence and a breach of the parties contract.both ndi and issi subsequently amended their complaints to add as defendants the parties respective insurance carriers in an attempt to collect on the payment bonds that had been issued during the biw project.
following a protracted discovery period,issi moved for partial summary judgment on ndi unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims.the district court denied this motion on january.six days later,issi moved to continue the trial indefinitely pending resolution of its ongoing dispute with atkinson over the adequacy of issi performance under the agreement.the district court also denied this motion.finally,two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial and weeks after the joinder deadline laid out in the pretrial schedule had passed,issi moved under.a to have atkinson joined as a necessary party.the joinder motion was considered,and denied,by magistrate judge cohen.at the start of the trial,issi filed a motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge decision on the joinder issue the district court heard oral arguments and denied the motion 
the district court conducted a bench trial,primarily consisting of the testimony of officials of the two firms and expert witnesses familiar with the industry practices governing drilling,blasting,and dredging work.at the close of all the evidence,issi moved for judgment as a matter of law,asserting that ndi could not prevail on its claims because it had breached its obligations under the agreement to blast according to a x grid and to provide diggable rock.the district court denied this motion.
on march,the court issued its written findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court first found that ndi decision to deviate from the x blast grid did not constitute a breach of contract because issi,despite its expressions of concern,had acquiesced in the enlarged blast pattern.moreover,the court concluded that ndi had,in fact,adequately blasted the rock down to the proper elevation it discounted as inconclusive the survey indicating the insufficient elevation of some spots in the target area,noting the possibility that a neighboring sand dump in the kennebec river may have caused the problem.with respect to ndi obligation to provide diggable rock,however,the district court found that ndi had not fully performed.on this point,the court,relying on expert testimony adduced at trial,construed the term diggable rock as it appeared in the contract to mean a quantity of rock in which no more than ten percent of the sample exceeded one cubic yard in volume.in this case,the court found that percent of the rock that ndi had left behind at the biw project site exceeded one cubic yard.as to the consequence of ndi incomplete performance,the court determined that the failure to provide diggable rock lowered the value of ndi services by the court determined that this figure for ndi failure to fully perform was precisely the same amount that issi could prove on its counterclaims for negligence and breach of contract,and that it therefore did not matter whether the credit to issi came in the form of a damage award on its counterclaims or as a reduction in ndi payment claim.subtracting that figure from the remaining amount that issi was withholding from ndi,the court determined that ndi was entitled to receive an additional from issi for the work it had performed under the contract.
the district court also addressed ndi claim of right to payment for its drilling and blasting in the expanded area,for which ndi only was to receive proportional compensation from the amount atkinson paid to issi,as well as its claim for a partial credit for the hughes barge,a cost that it had been required to fully absorb.the court relied on trial testimony establishing that atkinson and issi were on the verge of concluding a settlement in which atkinson would pay issi for drilling and blasting done outside the contract area and concluded that the figure was an accurate assessment of the amount that issi was entitled to receive from atkinson.alternatively,the district court found that ndi was deserving of payment for its work in the expanded area because issi had the obligation to make a reasonably timely request upon atkinson for payment and failed to do so.northeast drilling,wl,at.going further,the court determined that b ecause issi is the only party that knows what ndi proportional share is and because issi has provided no evidence on this topic,there is no basis on which to reduce the,and i find that ndi is entitled to the full.id.as to the hughes barge,the court found that under the anticipated settlement,atkinson was to reimburse issi for the barge cost.since ndi had paid the full cost of the barge through issi backcharging,and had never been reimbursed by either issi or atkinson,the court awarded ndi the full that issi was to receive from atkinson for this expense.
finally,the district court determined that ndi was entitled to interest under maine law,for the delayed payments by issi.the court found that issi was obliged to pay interest on because,although remained to be paid on the original contract price,of that sum was being deducted by the court for ndi incomplete performance and issi had yet to receive from atkinson.the court further determined that ndi was entitled to recoup reasonable attorney fees under maine law,see,in an amount to be apportioned according to the degree of its success.issi seasonably filed its notice of appeal.
on appeal,issi challenges both the district court factual and legal determinations.on the facts,issi points to three findings made by the district court,mainly involving the parties performance under the contract,that it alleges were erroneous.it also claims that the district court should have made findings on twelve additional points.on the law,issi attacks the district court refusal to grant its motions to continue the trial and to join atkinson as a party,its denial of issi motion for judgment as a matter of law,and the permissibility of the court method of assessing issi damages for ndi imperfect performance.
ii.factual findings 
issi claims that the district court made three erroneous factual findings in its written opinion.moreover,it claims that the court erred by not making twelve additional findings of fact that it claims the overwhelming weight of the evidence at trial would compel.according to issi,these alleged factual mistakes,which relate to the parties performance under the contract,demand correction because they played a pivotal role in the district court legal analysis and award of damages.
under.a,we will not disturb the district court factual determinations unless they are clearly erroneous.see vinick united states,cir under the clearly erroneous standard,we accept the district court findings of fact unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.internal quotation marks omitted quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.
issi points to three specific factual findings by the district court that it claims were clearly erroneous.specifically,issi challenges the findings of fact regarding its acquiescence in the enlargement of the pattern,its failure to exercise its right to demand a meeting with ndi to discuss ndi failure to drill and blast properly,and ndi success in blasting the target area down to the required elevation.we address each alleged error in turn.
first,issi vehemently disputes the district court finding that it acquiesced in ndi expansion of the x blasting grid specified in the contract it notes that laurie mason,the president of issi,and robert mason,issi manager on the biw project,each testified at trial that they repeatedly expressed,through letters and conversations,their dissatisfaction with the grid change to ndi president,forrest bradbury.both testified,moreover,that bradbury told them not to worry about the modified plan and assured them that everything will be okay.issi argues that this evidence demonstrates that issi never gave the to ndi to deviate from the initial blast pattern,or,alternatively,that issi approval of the expanded blast grid was conditioned on ndi reaching a satisfactory result.
based on evidence in the record tending to cast doubt on issi version of the facts,we find that the district court determination on this point was not clearly erroneous.for instance,issi laurie mason sent a letter to ndi insurance carrier on january,ndi had informed issi of its plan to expand the blasting which she described ndi blasting work to date as satisfactory.moreover,in a letter to atkinson dated february,laurie mason spoke approvingly of the expanded blasting pattern that had already been used in drilling and blasting operations by ndi.perhaps most importantly,the masons testimony was contradicted by bradbury,who stated that robert mason,who was present at the biw project site virtually every day,had agreed,in spite of his trepidation,to go forward with the enlarged grid if that what we had to do.given the conflicting evidence adduced at trial on this point,we can not say that the district court committed clear error by finding that issi acquiesced in ndi expansion of the x blasting grid.
second,and closely related to the first issue,issi claims that the district court was mistaken when it asserted that there had been no meeting to discuss ndi drilling and blasting performance,even though issi had the contractual right to summon ndi to such a meeting if ndi was not fulfilling its obligations.such a finding,according to issi,is clearly erroneous and misleading to the extent it suggests that issi did not promptly exercise its right to request such a meeting.
based on our earlier finding that issi acquiesced in ndi blasting plan,the issue of whether issi called a formal meeting to object to ndi performance loses much of its relevance,at least in the context of this appeal nonetheless,we find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that there was no meeting between ndi and issi that had been requested by issi.during the period of the biw project,at least one meeting,involving atkinson,issi,and ndi,did occur,but the evidence shows that that meeting was convened by atkinson.furthermore,issi introduced evidence showing that,on march and,it sent letters to ndi demanding a meeting to discuss the ways in which ndi drilling and blasting were not conforming to the requirements of the contract including the enlargement of the blasting grid.these letters were sent,however,more than two months after the drilling and blasting began,and well after ndi had completed the lion share of its work.moreover,and more to the point,the fact that issi requested such a meeting does not negate the challenged finding that there was no such meeting held pursuant to issi contractual right to request one.there was,in sum,no clear error by the district court on this point.
finally,issi takes issue with the district court finding that ndi drilling and blasting were generally successful in satisfying the contract elevation requirements.it alleges weaknesses in the testimony by atkinson project engineer,timothy daniels,that ndi had sufficiently drilled and blasted,noting that daniels had written a letter to his supervisor on the eve of ndi demobilization questioning the adequacy of the drilling and blasting work.moreover,issi notes the december hydrographic survey which found that certain portions of the area that ndi drilled and blasted were at a higher elevation than that called for in the agreement.in this regard,it argues that the district court statement that i t is impossible to tell whether the elevation was inadequate at the time of the survey because of unblasted rock or whether it is a result of sand filling in the area that has migrated from a sand dump in the river,northeast drilling,wl,at,represents an improper shifting of the burden to issi to prove ndi nonperformance.
we do not agree with issi argument that the district court clearly erred by relying on daniels testimony in concluding that ndi met its obligation to lower the target area to the required elevation.the fact that daniels may have expressed uncertainty to his superiors as to the sufficiency of ndi drilling and blasting does not necessarily negate his testimony at trial that,in the final analysis,ndi performance in lowering the elevation was adequate.moreover,the hydrographic survey cited by issi,which notes the heightened elevation of some spots in the target area,was conducted nine months after ndi demobilized.given this time lapse,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to discount this survey,and to find that ndi had met its burden of proving,primarily through daniels testimony,its fulfillment of the contractual obligation to drill and blast down to the proper elevations.
in sum,on these three factual issues raised by issi,the district court,acting as,made its determinations based on its reasonable assessment of the conflicting evidence before it.thus its findings of fact can not be deemed clearly erroneous,anderson,at,and must be affirmed.
issi further claims that,beyond the three allegedly erroneous findings of fact that the district court did make,the court also erred in declining to make findings of fact on twelve additional matters relating to the parties performance under the contract in the absence of specific findings by the district court on these matters,issi asks us to remand the case for additional factfinding,or to fill the gaps ourselves by making those additional determinations that it claims the great weight of evidence adduced at trial would compel.
standing in the way of this request,however,is issi own failure to file a postjudgment motion,under.b,asking the district court to amend its findings of fact to include these twelve points.rule b,in pertinent part,provides that o n a party motion filed no later than days after entry of judgment in a case tried without a jury,the court may amend its make additional may amend the judgment accordingly.rule b represents the principal,and preferred,mechanism for challenging the district court failure to find facts,as it allows a court that has recently tried the case,rather than an appellate tribunal perusing a cold record,to determine the propriety of considering those additional facts.see consol.aluminum foseco int l,rule b,provides for motions for findings not made.counsel should not simply ignore that rule and head off to the appellate court to seek a remand for the making of those same findings.united states,cir.it is a general principle of appellate jurisprudence that a party desiring more particularized findings at the trial court level must request them from the trial court.quoting united states tosca,cir,cert.denied,d.when a party complains of incomplete findings of fact after neglecting to file a rule b motion,remand is appropriate only in cases where the district court failed to make findings as to a certain fact and that fact is essential to the resolution of a material issue.glaverbel societe anonyme northlake mktg.supply.
after reviewing the record,we conclude that,even if true,the twelve facts that issi seeks to have included as formal findings would be largely redundant or irrelevant,and that appellate factfinding or a remand for additional factfinding by the district court therefore would be inappropriate.we find the proposed findings concerning the timing of ndi performance to be immaterial because the district court did not determine that the delay created by the sturgeon excused the imperfections in ndi performance,as issi contends in its reply brief.on the contrary,the court reduction of ndi damages by reflected its view that ndi had rendered deficient performance under the contract.as to those suggested findings that issi had paid only a proportionate share of the money it received from atkinson for extras,we find that they would not negate the court determination that ndi was entitled to all of the for work completed in the expanded area.the fact that issi had paid a proportionate share on other occasions did not eliminate its obligation to prove to the district court what that term meant.finally,we find that as to the facts relating to the consequences of the deviation from the x blasting pattern,the additional findings proposed by issi are irrelevant because the district court found,in a manner that was not clearly erroneous,see part,supra,that issi acquiesced in this modification of the blasting pattern.
accordingly,we decline issi invitation to make findings of fact on the twelve points or to remand the case to the district court for the purpose of requiring it to make such findings.
iii.continuance and joinder 
issi contends that the district court committed legal error by denying its pretrial motions to continue the trial and to join atkinson as a necessary party.both motions constituted an attempt by issi to prevent the present case from being decided without reference to issi separate dispute with atkinson arising out of the biw project.we consider each issue separately.
a district court decision to grant or deny a continuance is analyzed under the standard.amarin plastics.cup,cir.only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay will abuse that discretion.id.quoting united states torres,cir.our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to grant the continuance.while it might have been helpful to issi to have its disagreement with atkinson resolved before going to trial with ndi,in that it would have fixed the amount it was to receive from atkinson,virtually all of the issues posed by the present litigation could be determined wholly without implicating the dispute.we further note that even though issi dispute with atkinson had not yet crystallized into formal legal proceedings at the time of the continuance request,issi nonetheless requested that the trial date in this case be postponed indefinitely.united states gantt,noting that district court may consider length of delay in deciding whether to grant or deny continuance motion.given the potentially lengthy delay that this continuance could have caused,and the rather marginal benefit that would have redounded in return,we believe that the district court was well within its discretion in denying the motion.
issi also attacks the district court denial of its motion to join atkinson as a necessary party under.a.consistent with its arguments regarding the continuance motion,issi asserts that the commonality of facts between the litigation and the dispute counseled in favor of joining atkinson as a party in the present lawsuit.issi further argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in assessing its rule a motion.
we have recently declined on two separate occasions to decide whether a rule a denial should be reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion because we found in both cases that the distinction would not be.united states san juan bay marina,cir tell trustees of dartmouth,cir noting in dicta that the panel would be inclined to apply standard if it mattered to the outcome.as in those cases,we need not resolve the issue here because doing so would not affect the result.
in this case,issi moved to join atkinson as a necessary party well after the passage of the deadline to join additional parties specified in the pretrial scheduling order.it did not ask the court for leave to modify the scheduling order in its rule a motion,nor did it articulate subsequently any good cause to excuse the belated filing,although it was required to do both in order to move to join a necessary party beyond the specified deadline see.b universidad metropolitana,cir.issi appellate briefs also fail to explicate its failure to properly raise the issue.in denying issi motion for reconsideration of its decision not to join atkinson,the district court noted that the failure to meet this deadline constituted an independent ground for denying the motion.we certainly believe that the district court had the discretion to remain faithful to the pretrial scheduling order that it had previously entered.nickerson searle,cir holding that district court decision not to deviate from final pretrial order constituted neither manifest injustice nor abuse of discretion requiring court of appeals to intervene.accordingly,we affirm its denial of issi motion to join atkinson as a party 
iv.judgment as a matter of law 
issi next contention is that the district court committed legal error by denying both its motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of ndi evidence and its renewed motion at the close of all the evidence.it claims that ndi breached the parties contract by deviating from the x blasting pattern and by failing to produce diggable rock.given these breaches,issi insists,ndi was precluded from prevailing on its contract claims as a matter of law.
in their briefs,both parties have erroneously characterized issi motions for judgment as a matter of law as arising under.because the trial was heard without a jury,issi motion at the close of ndi case should have been characterized as a motion for judgment on partial findings under fed.civ.p c.rego arc water treatment,cir rule a applies in jury trials and rule c applies in trials.moreover,because issi put on evidence following the district court denial of the motion for judgment on partial findings,it waived its right to appeal from the denial of that motion.state gas sec y of labor,cir citing bituminous,rucker,cir.consequently,we treat the arguments issi makes on appeal under the heading of motion for judgment as a matter of law simply as challenges to the factual and legal sufficiency of the district court determinations based on all the evidence.see id.noting that following denial of rule c motion the sufficiency of the evidence is analyzed on appeal by viewing the entire record.following a completed bench trial,of course,we review the court factual determinations for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.commercial union ins.seven provinces ins,cir,cert.denied,d.
on the portion of issi argument that relates to ndi deviation from the initial blasting scheme,we have little trouble affirming the district court conclusion.given the district court factual finding that issi acquiesced in the enlargement of the x grid and our determination that that finding was not clearly erroneous,it can not be said that the deviation prevented ndi from prevailing,as a matter of law,on its contract claims by acquiescing in the modified blasting pattern,issi effectively relinquished its right under the contract to have blasting performed according to the x grid.
the second part of the argument concerns the district court allegedly erroneous interpretation of the term diggable in the contract.the district court,relying on trial testimony as to the meaning of diggable in the absence of an explicit contractual definition,construed the term to mean a quantity of rock in which no more than ten percent may exceed one cubic yard.the court further found that percent of the rock at the biw project site had a volume of more than one cubic yard,and that the value of ndi performance to issi had been diminished by due to this failure to perform fully.issi argues that the contract did not provide for this ten percent error rate,and that the district court committed clear error of law in rewrit ing the contract to allow for the ten percent deviation.it further argues in its opening brief although it does not make the point with great clarity that ndi production of a quantity of rock with an oversize rate of either twenty or thirty percent depending on whose interpretation of the contract is accepted amounted to a breach of the contract as a matter of law.
we first find that the district court did not err in finding that the term diggable in the contract allowed for a ten percent oversize rate.relying on extrinsic evidence in the form of expert testimony,the court determined that this ten percent tolerance threshold represented the industry standard for such drilling and blasting operations,and that the contract had incorporated this standard.this was an appropriate method of construing the contract given the ambiguity of the term diggable.hilltop cmty.sports ctr.hoffman,me commercial union ins,at finding that district court properly considered expert testimony on trade usage and industry practice in order to ascertain meaning of ambiguous contract term.
beyond the issue of interpreting the term diggable,issi makes the argument that ndi failure to produce a quantity of rock meeting that definition amounted to a breach of the contract as a matter of law.the district court,finding the amount by which ndi defective production of diggable rock lowered its performance value to be identical to the amount that issi could prove on its counterclaims,deemed the distinction between substantial performance and partial performance academic in this case.accordingly,it declined to characterize ndi performance as either substantial or partial.northeast drilling,wl,at.issi insists,however,that under maine law issi was entitled to an explicit determination that ndi had breached the parties contract,thereby shifting the burden to ndi to establish the value of its deficient performance under the theory of quantum meruit.see loyal erectors,hamilton son,me explicating the elements of quantum meruit under maine law.
we find issi argument on this point to be unavailing.the district court expressly found that no matter who bore the burden of proving the cost of ndi performance,the result would have been the same a reduction in the amount that ndi would have otherwise received.regardless of how useful a finding that ndi had breached its contractual duties would have been to issi in its dispute with atkinson and we doubt it would have been exceedingly so,given the fact that issi at all times bore ultimate responsibility to atkinson for the quality of the end product,we do not agree that issi was entitled to have the district court expressly characterize its damages determination as being based on substantial or partial performance given that the criteria for both theories of damages were found to be fulfilled and given the district court finding that application of either of the two theories would have produced an identical measure of damages for ndi,we think that the district court could fairly characterize the quantum of damages as being derived alternately from either one.northern heel compo,cir noting that there is often more than one sufficient method of measuring damages in any given case.we therefore uphold its damages methodology.
ndi work in the expanded area 
issi next challenges the district court findings regarding ndi work in the expanded area.the court found that,pursuant to an anticipated agreement between issi and atkinson,issi was about to receive for the drilling and blasting work done by ndi outside of the contract sum that,according to the district court,reasonably represented the value of the work performed by ndi in the expanded area.alternatively,the court found that issi could not complain about the fact that it would have to compensate ndi before receiving payment from atkinson because issi had been six months late in requesting such payments from atkinson.the court also determined that issi had failed to meet its burden to establish the proportional share of the atkinson payments that ndi was entitled to receive under the parties agreement,and accordingly awarded the entire sum to ndi.on appeal,issi argues that the district court should not have based its award on the uncertain occurrence of the settlement agreement,nor should it have found that the entire amount of the atkinson payments belonged to ndi.in the same vein,it contends that the district court should not have credited ndi for the hughes barge,another expense for which issi was expected to receive compensation from atkinson in the same settlement agreement.
at the heart of the first component of issi the district court erred by finding that atkinson was about to pay issi for work in the expanded the contractual provision stating that ndi would be paid for such work if and only if issi receives compensation.issi asserts that under this clause in the contract,atkinson remission of fees was a condition precedent to it making any payments to ndi,and that it was therefore improper for the district court to award anything for work in the expanded area given the absence of a finding that the condition had been met.although atkinson and issi did reach a settlement covering work in the expanded area on or about february,the terms of that settlement have not been divulged.under these circumstances,it would be improper for us to assume that the expected amount of the settlement agreement was the amount that issi actually received.ponte,cir noting that appellate court may only make inferences that can be drawn from the evidence without resort to speculation citing frieze boatmen bank of belton,cir.
the district court award rested,however,on an alternate ground that issi effectively surrendered its authority to enforce the condition precedent atkinson payment by waiting six months after ndi demobilization to submit the requests to atkinson for ndi work in the expanded area.under the prevention doctrine,a contractual condition precedent is deemed excused when a promisor hinders or precludes fulfillment of a condition and that hindrance or preclusion contributes materially to the nonoccurrence of the condition.restatement second of contracts.in this case,the court found that in spite of having the information needed to submit requests to atkinson,issi failed to submit such requests until september,or nearly six months after the completion of ndi work because this delay materially contributed to atkinson failure to pay issi before the trial,issi is estopped from arguing that it was entitled to be paid by atkinson before it reimbursed ndi for drilling and blasting in the expanded area.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.w here one improperly prevents the performance or the happening of a condition of his or her own promissory duty,the offending party thereby eliminates it as a condition moore.brown root,cir applying prevention doctrine to render inoperative pay when paid condition precedent in construction subcontract.based on this principle,the district court reasonably concluded that the value of the work performed in the expanded area was.
apart from the issue of whether ndi deserves any payments given the uncertainty surrounding the payments by atkinson,issi further contends that the district court committed error by awarding all of the sum to ndi.under the contract,ndi was to receive a proportional share of the amount issi received from atkinson this critical term in the contract,however,was unaccompanied by further elaboration.issi claims that the court erred by determining that b ecause issi is the only party that knows what ndi proportional share is and because issi has provided no evidence on this topic,there is no basis upon which to reduce the northeast drilling,wl,at.issi points to the trial testimony of laurie mason,who was asked to discuss the manner in which issi would tally ndi proportional share.in that testimony,laurie mason noted that issi would make those payments to ndi according to the same ratio by which it had paid ndi for ndi drilling and blasting work in the contract area.she neglected,however,to disclose what that ratio was.on appeal,issi attempts to make up for this omission by proposing a formula by which this court could ascertain the proper amount.that suggested formula,however,was not presented to the district court and absent extraordinary circumstances not present in this case,we may not entertain newly proffered evidence for the first time on appeal.in re colonial mortgage bankers,cir,cert.denied,d.as the district court noted,because the proportion of the atkinson payments that would pass to ndi was a fact about which issi had exclusive knowledge as ndi apparently had no control over the size of its proportional share for work in the expanded area,issi failure to divulge that fact meant that ndi was entitled to all of the payments.united states,new haven hartford,d the ordinary rule,based on considerations of fairness,does not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary.selma,rome dalton united states.holding that burden of proof regarding right to payment rests with party possessing relevant account books.
issi also attacks the district court award of to ndi for the cost of the hughes barge.the court award was based on issi backcharging of ndi for the cost of this additional equipment,which ndi needed to procure to make up for the time it ha
