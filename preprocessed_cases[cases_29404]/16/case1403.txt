defendant cincinnati insurance company appeals two of the orders making up the judgment of the district court a july,order granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff wallace edwards sons,on its claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment in the amount of and an august,order granting the plaintiff motion to amend and awarding prejudgment interest in the amount of.the defendant contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to set forth any objective evidence that the product was damaged under the terms of the insurance policy and that the plaintiff can not maintain the breach of contract claim because it failed to adhere to a period of limitation set forth in the insurance policy.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
wallace edwards sons,edwards is a wholesale seller of virginia ham,bacon,and sausage.in september of,edwards had over pounds of ham product stored in cold storage at richmond cold storage in smithfield,virginia.on september,an employee at the storage facility cracked a refrigerant line with a,causing the release of anhydrous ammonia vapor within the storage facility.following this incident,edwards made a claim under its commercial property policy which defendant cincinnati insurance company cincinnati insurance had issued to edwards sons for april,through april.the claim alleged damage to its property due to the ham products exposure to the ammonia.in addition to filing the claim,edwards collected samples of the exposed product and contacted microbac laboratories,microbac,to test the product and determine the extent of the ammonia damage.
cincinnati insurance sent an adjuster to visit the cold storage facility and inspect the ham that had been exposed.the adjuster stated that he detected the smell of ammonia in the product,and at the direction of his supervisor requested additional evidence of the damage.the additional evidence requested and sent to the insurance company consisted of a large loss notice to cincinnati insurance a statement from the forklift driver or other witness a copy of the sales contract to the wholesale dealer establishing the sale price certification from the fda that the meat is contaminated and can not be sold proof of loss for claim check subject to edwards sons deductible and proceed with subrogation against wrongdoer.
while edwards was waiting for the results of the tests from microbac,the storage facility agreed to repackage the ham products.edwards agreed,and the repackaging took place on february.samples of the repackaged product were also sent to microbac for testing.following the repackaging,on march,cincinnati insurance sent a letter to edwards sons informing them that there was nothing wrong with the ham as repackaged,and that the case was being removed from active status.
meanwhile,microbac informed edwards sons by letter on march,that it was unable to find any regulatory guidelines for the limit of ammonia in pork,other than adulteration.thus,microbac stated that it had arrived at its conclusion by using a reference in an fda international association of refrigerated warehouses manual that set forth the guidelines for ammonia contamination of food products.these guidelines indicated that the ammoniacal nitrogen level in meat products normally does not exceed percent and none of the plaintiff samples had tested above percent.in addition,microbac noted that there was an ammonia odor while at the refrigerant site,but the analyst did not notice any odor while at the laboratory.there was also mention in the march,letter of some brown areas observed on the meat,which was assessed as probable effects from being frozen.in a later letter sent march,however,microbac retracted its earlier statement and concluded that it was unable to determine the cause of the brown areas.
due to edwards uncertainty about the safety of the product and microbac indeterminate analysis,edwards finally decided to discard the product in april of as a total loss.
over one year after receiving the microbac results,and more than two years after notification of the loss,on october,cincinnati insurance sent the plaintiff a letter advising edwards that after a review of the microbac analyses,the evaluation,and the fact that the usda ha d not determined that the product wa s unsafe for human consumption,there was insufficient evidence to determine that the product was damaged from exposure to ammonia.accordingly,cincinnati insurance denied the claim on the basis that edwards sons had not shown any damage.
edwards filed this action on january,in the circuit court of surry county,virginia.the complaint asserted three claims.first,edwards sought a declaratory judgment that the defendant has an obligation under the policy to pay the claim because the ammonia exposure had caused damage to edwards sons product.second,edwards sons alleged a breach of contract claim against cincinnati insurance.lastly,edwards asserted that cincinnati insurance was acting in bad faith in denying the coverage.cincinnati insurance removed the case to federal district court on february.on that same day,cincinnati insurance filed in state court its answer and grounds of defense to edwards sons original complaint.
once the case was removed,edwards filed a motion for partial summary judgment,asserting that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the claim for declaratory judgment and breach of contract claim counts i and ii.it reserved the bad faith claim count iii for trial.in response,cincinnati insurance filed a motion for summary judgment as to all claims,contending in its accompanying memorandum that there was no damage to the ham products and thus it was not obligated to pay under the policy that edwards sons could not maintain the breach of contract claim because,inter alia,it was filed beyond the limitations period required under the policy and that it did not act in bad faith in denying the claim.
on july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of edwards sons on its claims for a declaratory judgment and for breach of contract,but granted summary judgment for cincinnati insurance as to the claim of bad faith.on august,edwards sons filed a motion to amend its judgment to include an award of prejudgment interest which was granted by the district court in the amount of.
cincinnati insurance appeals the money judgments against it.there is no issue on appeal of bad faith in the denial of coverage by cincinnati.there is also no issue on appeal as to the amount of if any should be awarded.cincinnati insurance takes the position that no damages at all are authorized.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see bass dupont de nemours,cir.summary judgment is warranted when there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see celotex catrett,d.the party has the burden of showing that a genuine dispute exists.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
the principal contention of cincinnati insurance on appeal is that the district court should have applied a provision of the insurance policy contained as a commercial property condition,numbered d,which is that 
no one may bring a legal action against us under this coverage part unless 
the action is brought within years after the date on which the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
it is agreed that the direct physical loss or damage occurred on september,and that this case was filed in the circuit court of surry county,virginia,on january.so more than two years had elapsed between the date of the damage and the filing of the suit.
the district court held that the time limitation in the contract becomes the functional equivalency of a code section,and therefore is entitled to the protection that it gets under the virginia statute.the district court applied the statute of limitations that applies under virginia law and is five years.see virginia code section and.virginia code provides in part that t he objection that an action is not commenced within the limitation period prescribed by law can only b
