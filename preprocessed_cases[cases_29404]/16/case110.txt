there is,by now,a significant body of commentary on the housing market most recent boom and bust.little could we add about the development,proliferation,and ultimate collapse of the securities market that has not already been said.writing against that background,we recite here only the most relevant aspects of the market recent instability.at its height,the boom was facilitated by a novel system of bundling residential mortgages and trading these pooled mortgages in the form of security instruments.crucial to the success of this market was mortgage electronic recording system mers,a corporate entity that facilitated the pooling and assignment of mortgages among its member institutions 
with the market bust,as more and more homeowners faced foreclosures initiated not by their original lenders but by financial institutions with which they had never directly dealt,mers practices came under increasing legal scrutiny.this case is a paradigmatic example of that common fact pattern.in,susan woods woods,having fallen behind on her payments,faced foreclosure on her home mortgage.the notice of foreclosure did not come from woods lending institution,however,but from an unknown bank that had purchased her mortgage through a series of assignments.
woods challenged the foreclosure on multiple grounds,all largely predicated on her theory that mers could not validly assign her mortgage,and therefore the receiving institution had no legal interest upon which to foreclose.woods also brought related state law claims for fraud and unfair business practices.the district court found these claims unavailing and dismissed woods complaint.agreeing that the complaint states no plausible claim for relief,we affirm.
background 
on january,woods executed a promissory note for to fremont investment loan fremont,secured by a mortgage on her hadley,massachusetts home.the mortgage listed fremont as the lender and mers as fremont nominee as well as the mortgagee of record.as mortgagee,mers held legal title over the mortgaged property and,solely as nominee for fremont and its successors and assigns,it possessed the power of sale.the mortgage was recorded in the hampshire county registry of deeds.
the first of several assignments of woods mortgage occurred on october,when,acting in its own name,mers transferred the mortgage and note to wells fargo bank,national association as trustee for fremont investment loan sabr.on january,acting this time as nominee for fremont,mers again assigned the mortgage and note to wells fargo bank,national association as trustee for fremont investment loan sabr.both assignments were timely recorded in the hampshire county registry of deeds.
on april,counsel for wells fargo bank,national association as trustee for fremont investment and loan sabr filed notice of its intended foreclosure in massachusetts land court,seeking a declaration that the sale was not barred by the servicemembers civil relief act,app.shortly thereafter,on july,the mortgage was again assigned.this time,wells fargo bank,national association as trustee for fremont investment and loan sabr transferred all right,title,and interest as current holder of the mortgage to wells fargo bank,national association as trustee for securitized asset backed receivables llc mortgage pass through certificates,series wells fargo 
the massachusetts land court granted wells fargo permission to sell on june.subsequently,on july,wells fargo notified woods of its intent to foreclose.at first proceeding pro se,woods filed a complaint in hampshire county superior court on july,seeking and ultimately receiving a preliminary injunction to arrest the foreclosure.after retaining counsel,an amended complaint followed on august.
this amended complaint alleged that wells fargo lacked valid possession of her mortgage and had provided no evidence that it held the accompanying note,making any attempted foreclosure illegal.further,woods claimed that the foreclosure violated a consent agreement between the state of massachusetts and fremont,which required fremont to notify the state of any pending foreclosures and abide by a waiting period during which the attorney general could arrest foreclosures deemed presumptively unfair.the complaint also included claims for common law fraud and violations of massachusetts consumer protection statute.
after removing the case to federal court,wells fargo filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.b.the motion argued that woods pled no facts plausibly showing that wells fargo lacked legal standing to foreclose,failed to comply with the fremont consent agreement,or made false representations actionable as fraud.it also argued that woods lacked standing to challenge the assignments of her mortgage,to which she was not a party,and that her claim for deceptive business practices was void for failure to abide by a notice requirement the district court granted that motion on july,concluding that wells fargo validly possessed both the note and mortgage,that woods did not have standing to challenge the mortgage assignment,and that all requirements of the fremont consent decree were properly met.
woods filed a timely appeal from that decision.although her arguments are not always clear,we read her brief as contending that the following claims were plausibly pled woods had standing to challenge the assignments of her mortgage the purported assignments were void,making wells fargo attempted foreclosure illegal under.laws ch,wells fargo did not possess both the note and mortgage at the time of attempted foreclosure the attempted foreclosure violated the terms of fremont consent agreement and wells fargo committed fraud and deceptive business practices under.laws ch.

woods standing to challenge assignments 
before turning to the merits of woods challenge to the assignment of her mortgage,we must take up the predicate question of whether she has standing to bring that claim.the district court found that she did not,reasoning that woods was not a party to the trust agreement,nor in privity with fremont.woods wells fargo bank,d.in a case decided subsequent to the district court order,however,this court rejected that approach,holding that standing may be appropriate even where a mortgagor is not party to,nor beneficiary of,the challenged assignments.culhane aurora loan servs.of,cir assessing mortgagor standing based solely on privity paint s with too broad a brush.because massachusetts law allows for foreclosures by mortgagees with the power of sale,culhane reasoned that barring standing in all cases would unduly insulate assignments mortgagors could not challenge the validity of assignments either as the defendant in a suit for judicial authorization or as the petitioner in a suit like the present one.id.holding that mortgagors must have standing to bring certain challenges to assignments in order to protect their legally cognizable right to be secure from unlawful foreclosures.on this basis,culhane found standing appropriate in instances where a mortgagor challenge s a mortgage assignment as invalid,ineffective,or void,although not where the challenge would render the assignment merely voidable but otherwise effective to pass legal title.id.at.
thus,claims that merely assert procedural infirmities in the assignment of a mortgage,such as a failure to abide by the terms of a governing trust agreement,are barred for lack of standing.id.in contrast,standing exists for challenges that contend that the assigning party never possessed legal title and,as a result,no valid transferable interest ever exchanged hands.see bank ass ibanez,t here must be proof that the assignment was made by a party that itself held the mortgage.in this latter case,the challenge is to the foreclosing entity status qua mortgagee.culhane,at see also ibanez,at any effort to foreclose by a party lacking jurisdiction and authority to carry out a foreclosure is void.internal quotation marks omitted.
while far from a paradigm of clarity,woods complaint appears to set forth just such a challenge.the complaint alleges that mers,as a mere nominee for fremont,never possessed a legally transferable interest in woods mortgage,rendering any attempted assignments void.see culhane,at the challenge is premised on the notion that mers never properly held the mortgage and,thus,had no interest to assign.if this were so,the assignment would be void therefore,under the framework of culhane,woods has standing to challenge whether the assignments of her mortgage were legally valid.
having determined that woods may bring a challenge as to the assignments validity,we now turn to the merits of that claim.
the assignments validity 
woods contends that the very premise upon which mers is predicated that it may remain a mortgagee of record throughout multiple transfers of an underlying promissory note runs counter to the title theory nature of massachusetts law.in support of this proposition,her complaint recites massachusetts law holding that when a mortgage is split from its promissory note a constructive trust is implied to the benefit of the noteholder.as such,she asserts that fremont,as the original lender and noteholder,was the sole entity possessing a beneficial,transferable interest in her mortgage.mers,in contrast,held only a bare legal interest as a placeholder nominee,rendering it unable to properly initiate an assignment.
this argument stumbles while barely out of the gate.as an initial matter,woods contention that the mers business model runs counter to the nature of massachusetts mortgage law has been resoundingly rejected by this court.culhane,at finding that the mers model fit s comfortably within the structure of massachusetts mortgage law see also rosa mortg,d,in re marron.further,it ignores the express language of woods mortgage,which grants mers,as nominee,the power of sale.under massachusetts law,a nominee in such a situation holds title for the owner of the beneficial interest.culhane,at citing morrison lennett.as such,when fremont the holder of the beneficial interest undertook to transfer the promissory note to wells fargo,mers was authorized by the terms of the contract to transfer the underlying mortgage as well.id.
woods recitation of traditional mortgage law precepts regarding the effect of splitting a note from its underlying mortgage are no more helpful to her cause.it is undoubtedly true,as woods asserts,that in massachusetts an entity that holds a mortgage but not the associated promissory note holds that mortgage in an equitable trust for the benefit of the noteholder.ibanez,at citing barnes boardman.yet culhane made clear that mers status as an equitable trustee does not circumscribe the transferability of its legal interest.culhane,at explaining that where the note and mortgage are split,the mortgagee retains and may transfer its bare legal interest in the underlying mortgage.as such,it is clear,and woods presents no plausible claim to the contrary,that mers,as the mortgagee of record,possessed the ability to assign woods mortgage.id.a mortgagee may assign its mortgage to another party.mckenna wells fargo bank,cir.
woods attempts to set forth an alternative argument that wells fargo interest is legally invalid because the recorded assignments through which it purportedly gained possession failed to account for additional parties with an interest in the mortgage.the entirety of this argument rests on a single allegation in woods complaint barclays bank,plc is the investor of woods loan,not wells fargo.even drawing all reasonable inferences from this factual allegation,however,it falls short of establishing any plausible claim upon which relief might be granted.
woods fails to recognize that the mers registry electronically tracks transfers of a mortgagors promissory note,a process which is legally distinct from the assignment and recordation of mortgage interests in a county registry of deeds.see rosa,d at mers is named as the mortgagee of record so that beneficial ownership and servicing rights of the note may be transferred among mers members without the need to publicly record such assignments instead assignments of the note are tracked by mers electronic system.that barclays possessed some interest in the promissory note at some time the registry search is undated does not plausibly establish a legal deficiency in the transfer of that note underlying mortgage.there is a chain of recorded assignments which show the mortgage traveling from fremont to wells fargo,and woods has offered no grounds on which to call the validity or completeness of those assignments into question.ibanez,at a foreclosing entity may provide a complete chain of assignments linking it to the record holder to prove it validly holds the mortgage.
wells fargo ability to foreclose 
having found the transfer of woods mortgage valid,we need pause only briefly to make clear that there exists no real dispute that wells fargo is the current possessor of woods promissory note.woods does not allege that wells fargo does not own the note.she instead alleges only that a t no time has wells fargo ever adduced any direct evidence that it received a valid assignment of her note.in support of its motion to dismiss,wells fargo presented what appears to be the note,endorsed in blank,at oral argument before the district court and as an appendix to its motion to dismiss.
in response,woods provides no serious challenge to either the note authenticity or wells fargo ownership of it.at oral argument woods offered only a hypothetical allegation,absent any factual support,that the note might be forgery.even that weak argument was largely foregone in her appellate brief.like the district court before us,we see no need to travel down this rabbit hole of baseless suspicion it is clear no plausible claim rests at its bottom 
where the note and mortgage are unified at the time of foreclosure,our inquiry may come to an end.eaton fed.mortg.ass n,requiring possession of both the note and mortgage to properly foreclose having found no plausible grounds for relief based on mers involvement in the assignment of woods mortgage,we affirm the district court dismissal of her.laws ch,claim and turn now to the other claims asserted in her amended complaint.
fremont consent agreement 
woods next asserts that the foreclosure violated the terms of a consent agreement between fremont and the commonwealth of massachusetts,requiring fremont to notify the attorney general prior to initiating any foreclosures in the state.this agreement was the result of litigation filed by the massachusetts attorney general against fremont based on unfair and deceptive business practices.laws ch,stemming from its mortgage foreclosures in the commonwealth.final judgment by consent,commonwealth fremont inv.loan.supp.june,incorporating,verbatim,the terms of an earlier preliminary injunction arresting fremont foreclosures absent attorney general review as relevant to this appeal,the consent agreement contains language mandating that fremont receive approval by the attorney general prior to proceeding with any foreclosure in the commonwealth 
before initiating or advancing a foreclosure on any mortgage loan originated by fremont fremont shall first give the attorney general days advance written notice so that the attorney general can verify that the proposed foreclosure falls outside the scope of this agreement.if the attorney general has not given written notice of an objection to fremont by the day fremont may proceed with the foreclosure.
id.slip op.at emphasis added.
wells fargo presented to the district court a letter,dated march,informing the attorney general of its intention to foreclose.woods contends,however,that absent proof of return correspondence from the attorney general expressly showing that it consented to the foreclosure,her claim that wells fargo violated the agreement must be allowed to proceed.this argument strays far wide of its mark.
