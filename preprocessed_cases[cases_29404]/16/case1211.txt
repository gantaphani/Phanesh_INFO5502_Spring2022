opinion of the court 
at issue is whether state law applies to a agency.the international union of operating engineers,local,petitioned for a court order compelling the delaware river joint toll bridge commission to comply with new jersey collective bargaining laws.in granting summary judgment to the commission,the district court held that neither new jersey nor pennsylvania collective bargaining laws apply because the state legislatures have not expressed a clear intent to impose their labor laws upon the commission.we will affirm.
background 
under the compact clause,article i,section,clause of the united states constitution,states may enter into agreements regarding matters of common concern provided they obtain the consent of congress in,the legislatures of new jersey and pennsylvania created the delaware river joint toll bridge commission the commission to operate certain bridges spanning the delaware river.stat.ann.west.stat.ann.tit.west.the commission was consented to by act of congress the following year.stat.the compact has since been amended by the states,which amendments have been approved by congress.the most current version is dated march.
the commission powers and duties are framed entirely by the compact.the compact has been carefully crafted to provide for joint governance by commissioners from both states,requiring a majority of the commissioners from pennsylvania and a majority of the commissioners from new jersey to agree to any action.stat.ann,art.i.stat.ann.tit,art.i.the commissioners are charged with administering,operating,and maintaining numerous bridges and port facilities,acquiring and constructing additional facilities,fixing tolls and issuing bonds to raise funds,and procuring the consent of congress whenever necessary.id.most pertinent to our purposes,under article ii of the compact,the commission powers include the authority 
f to appoint such other officers,agents and employees as it may require for the performance of its duties.
g to determine the qualifications and duties of its appointees,and to fix their compensation.
h to enter into contracts.id.
the compact is entirely silent regarding the rights of commission employees to collectively bargain and the duty of the commission to collectively bargain with unions.the compact also contains no provision regarding procedures for its amendment,or,especially relevant here,enabling the states to modify it by passing legislation that is concurred in by the other state.
in june,the international union of operating engineers,local,local advised the commission that a majority of the and regular toll collectors,maintenance employees,bridge officers,and tellers employed by the commission had selected local as their exclusive representative for collective bargaining purposes.the commission refused to recognize local as the employees representative,explaining that the compact does not confer upon commission employees the right to organize.local then petitioned a new jersey state court to order a union election pursuant to the new jersey relations act,stat.ann.et west,and the pennsylvania public employee relations act.stat.ann.tit.et west both acts provide for an election among public employees to determine whether they wish to be represented by a labor union and require public employers to bargain collectively with the selected union id.neither act specifically states that it applies to the commission or is intended to amend the compact.
the commission removed the case to the district court for the district of new jersey.both parties moved for summary judgment.local argued that new jersey and pennsylvania complementary and parallel employee relations acts effectively amended the compact and therefore require the commission to engage in collective bargaining.the commission countered that a compact can not be modified unless both state legislatures expressly state an intention to alter the compact.in an oral opinion,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the commission.local appeals.

iii.discussion 
in creating the delaware river joint toll bridge commission,new jersey and pennsylvania agreed to the power sharing,coordination,and unified action that typify compact clause creations.hess port auth,d.entities like the commission are intended to address interests and problems that do not coincide nicely with state lines.id.at.quoting thursby,interstate cooperation a study of the interstate compact.they are to be regarded not as extensions of each compacting state authority,but rather as independently functioning parts of a regional polity and of a national union.id.quoting grad,compact a new experiment in cooperative federalism,colum.by compacting together to form the commission,new jersey and pennsylvania have each surrendered a portion of their sovereignty over certain delaware river bridge operations in order to better serve the regional interest.such a surrender of state sovereignty should be treated with great care,and the supreme court has stated that courts should not find a surrender unless it has been expressed in terms too plain to be mistaken.jefferson branch bank skelly,black.
our role in interpreting the compact is,therefore,to effectuate the clear intent of both sovereign states,not to rewrite their agreement or order relief inconsistent with its express terms.texas new mexico,d declining to alter the voting structure of the pecos river commission to break an impasse see also new jersey new york,d declining to redraw the boundary between new jersey and new york for reasons of practicality and convenience.although we understand the desire to bring the commission under the auspices of new jersey and pennsylvania employee relations acts,we conclude that to do so would be an act of legislation,rather than interpretation or enforcement.we can find no legislative intent to subject the compact to the collective bargaining schemes of new jersey or pennsylvania.we will therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
a.the legal landscape 
local urges that states may amend a compact by passing legislation that is substantially similar,without an express statement,either in the legislation or otherwise,that they intend to apply that law to the entity.this issue has been treated differently by different courts.in nearly every one of these cases,courts have been presented with a compact that addresses the issue of modification by including language enabling one state to modify the compact through legislation concurred in by the other.see.stat.ann.tit,art.iv e west delaware river port authority unconsol.law,art.vii west port authority of new york and new jersey.here,the compact contains no concurred in language.nonetheless,an overview of the relevant case law in this area assists in understanding the issue before us.
the most notable difference of opinion regarding the interpretation of concurred in language is between the courts of new york and those of new jersey.new york courts have interpreted the concurred in language in a compact to permit application of states laws to the compact if the states legislation contains an express statement that they intend to amend the compact.new jersey courts have held that this language will be effective to apply the states laws that are complementary or parallel even where there is no stated intent to amend the compact.federal courts,including those in our circuit,have at various times adopted both approaches.
new york view 
the new york standard was most clearly articulated by the court of appeals of new york in malverty waterfront commission of new york harbor.in malverty,the petitioner sought to apply new york corrections law to the waterfront commission of new york harbor,a agency established by new york and new jersey and approved by congress.id.at.the compact creating the waterfront commission included authorization to amend and supplement the interstate compact,to implement the purposes thereof,by legislative action of either state concurred in by legislative action of the other state.id.at.the malverty court found the absence from the text and legislative history of the corrections law of any reference to the waterfront commission,coupled with the absence of an express statement that the legislature was amending or supplementing the provisions of the compact and that the corrections law would take effect upon the enactment by new jersey of legislation of identical effect,to indicate that the new york legislature had never intended the corrections law to apply to the waterfront commission.id.the court noted,that the two states have evinced the same,or similar,public policy regarding employment opportunities for former inmates by enacting similar antidiscrimination laws is not sufficient under the express terms of the compact to render it properly amended or supplemented such that the commission would be subject to the provisions of new york corrections law.id.citations omitted.it thus viewed the concurred in language to require an express statement to that effect.
ii.new jersey view 
new jersey courts have taken a different tack,finding the passage of similar legislation by compacting states to satisfy the concurred in test and be sufficient to imply an intent on the part of both states to apply the legislation to a entity.bunk port auth.of new york new jersey.in bunk,the court applied new jersey workers compensation laws to the port authority of new york and new jersey,a entity whose compact contains concurred in language,without examining whether either state had expressly intended its workers compensation laws to apply.the court reasoned that the corollary of the proposition that neither state may unilaterally impose its legislative will on the agency is that the agency may be subject to complementary or parallel legislation.id.citing eastern paralyzed veterans ass camden.the court then examined new york and new jersey workers compensation laws and found them somewhat similar.id.according to the new jersey view,then,a state may meet the requirements of concurring in the other legislation merely by passing a somewhat similar statute of its own.
iii.federal courts 
federal courts have followed both lines of reasoning when interpreting compacts containing concurred in language.courts in the second circuit have uniformly adopted the express intent standard,finding the new york view more in line with the language of the compacts before them.baron port auth.of new york new jersey,declining to unilaterally impose new york human rights laws on the new york and new jersey port authority where there was no evidence that either state intended its laws to apply.see also dezaio port auth.of new york new jersey,cir same rose port auth.of new york new jersey,d,stating that the same or similar public policy of two states is not sufficient to impose law of either state on the agency unless legislation expressly mentions the entity settecase port auth.of new york new jersey,d,i f new york and new jersey intend their own laws to apply to the port authority,they have the means to do so clearly and expressly,as they have done for other laws.
within our circuit,however,the district courts have espoused both views.the district court for the district of new jersey has applied the new jersey complementary or parallel standard.moore.river port,d,citing int l union of operating eng rs,local.river bay.in moore,the court refused to apply new jersey common law regarding wrongful discharge and breach of contract to the delaware river port authority,a entity whose compact includes concurred in language.id.at.in arriving at that result,however,the court analyzed whether the common law of new jersey was substantially similar to the common law of pennsylvania,bypassing any discussion as to what was required in order for a law of one state to be concurred in by the other.
in contrast,in delaware river port authority fraternal order of police,lodge,d,rev on other grounds,delaware river port authority fraternal order of police,lodge,cir,judge robreno in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania noted that as a general rule of statutory interpretation,surrenders of sovereignty are to be strictly construed in terms of their scope,id.at,concluding that the ambiguous term concurred in of the delaware river port authority compact should be interpreted to require the express consent of both legislatures before additional duties are imposed upon the entity.id.at.the court further noted that the weight of authority supported the express intent standard,and that the new jersey complementary or parallel standard was based on a misreading of the law of compacts.id.at.the court went on to hold that because neither new jersey nor pennsylvania had expressly stated that they intended to impose their collective bargaining laws on the delaware river port authority,they had not concurred in the application of those laws.id.at.
on appeal,we did not reach the merits of judge robreno ruling,or of either the new york express intent or the new jersey complementary or parallel views,but reversed on different grounds,concluding that the parties litigation involved an attack on a new jersey judgment entitled to preclusive effect.lodge,at discussing fraternal order of police,lodge.river port.the parties to the lodge litigation were in privity with the parties in a case resolved in the new jersey courts we were therefore required to give preclusive effect to the new jersey court ruling regarding the complementary or parallel test id.at.in dicta,however,we noted,were we sitting on the new jersey courts,we might have interpreted the respective statutes and the drpa obligations to its patrol officers differently.but we may not reconsider the new jersey judgment.id.
iv.bridge commission compact before us 
the cases discussed above all address the interpretation of compacts that expressly authorize the compacting states to amend the compact through legislation concurred in by the other.as we have noted,the compact before us contains no such language,nor did the relevant laws of each state evince an intent to apply to the compact as such.the only case to address a compact in a similar setting is international union of operating engineers,local delaware river bay authority.in local,the new jersey supreme court held that new jersey and delaware collective bargaining laws were complementary and parallel with regard to collective negotiations for public employees and therefore applied to the delaware river and bay authority.id.at.the court so held in spite of the fact that the compact did not clearly authorize modification through legislation concurred in by both states,and neither new jersey nor delaware had expressed any intent to amend the compact or apply state labor laws to the authority the court found that because both states had a public policy endorsing collective bargaining,the legislatures had in effect modified the compact.id.
here,local urged before the district court that local was controlling and persuasive,but the court rejected its reasoning.the district court reviewed the new york and new jersey views and the federal case law,and found that the new jersey view has not been accepted as a matter of federal law.the district court also considered local argument that the lack of concurred in language in the compact provides a basis to distinguish it from,and therefore a basis to reject,the new york and second circuit app
