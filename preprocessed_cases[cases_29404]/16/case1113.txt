at issue in this petition for review is whether agreements,entered into by a company licensed under the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,and its produce suppliers,which set the payment for the produce at an amount lower than the invoice price,bar the united states department of agriculture usda from enforcing the prompt payment provisions of the paca.baiardi chain food baiardi appeals the final order of the secretary of the usda,entered on september,which found baiardi in violation of section of the paca,for failure to fully and promptly pay its suppliers of perishable agricultural commodities.the secretary sanctioned baiardi by ordering publication of the facts and circumstances of baiardi violations.we will affirm the decision of the secretary and deny the petition for review.
the material facts of this case are not in dispute.the agricultural marketing service of the usda initiated an investigation of baiardi after receiving several complaints between october and january from suppliers seeking reparation for unpaid produce shipments.in january,carolyn shelby,a paca marketing specialist with the usda,conducted an investigation of baiardi business practices and met with david axelrod,the owner of the corporation.axelrod provided shelby with hundreds of unpaid invoices.the invoices revealed that baiardi failed to make full payment promptly for lots of perishable agricultural commodities from sellers,amounting to a debt owed of.
in january,baiardi notified its sellers in most instances the producers of the agricultural products that it was going out of business.baiardi negotiated agreements with several of the producers to whom baiardi owed payment.pursuant to those agreements,the produce sellers accepted payment of approximately fifty cents on the dollar for the money baiardi owed.the producers were willing to resolve baiardi indebtedness quickly because,due to baiardi impending demise,several companies feared they would receive none of the money they were owed if they chose not to settle.at least two other accounts were settled through court dispositions.
on august,the associate deputy administrator,fruit and vegetable programs,agricultural marketing service of the usda issued a complaint charging baiardi with violating section of the paca.on october,baiardi filed an answer denying the allegations in the complaint.chief administrative law judge alj marc hillson conducted a hearing in new york on february,and may,during which the agency called four witnesses and entered exhibits into evidence.baiardi called no witnesses but entered exhibits into evidence through of the agency witnesses.
on april,the alj issued his decision and order,finding that baiardi,from march through january,failed to make full payment promptly for lots of perishable agricultural commodities from producers in violation of section of the paca.on july,baiardi appealed the alj decision to the secretary of the department of agriculture.on september,the judicial officer jo,acting for the secretary,affirmed the alj decision and ordered that the facts and circumstances of baiardi violations be published,pursuant to the secretary authority under a.that section provides that if the buyer has violated any of the provisions of section of the paca,including the secretary may publish the facts and circumstances of such violation,by order,suspend the license of such offender for a period not to exceed ninety days,except that,if the violation is flagrant or repeated,the secretary may,by order,revoke,the license of the offender.id.because baiardi had failed to pay its license renewal fee,its paca license terminated in june as such,the only sanction open to the secretary was the publication of the facts and circumstances of the case.baiardi filed a motion for reconsideration which the jo denied.baiardi filed a timely petition for review with this court.

congress enacted the paca in to promote fair trading practices in the produce industry.see tanimura antle,packed fresh produce,cir citing idahoan fresh advantage produce,cir.under the paca,every dealer of perishable agricultural commodities is required to be licensed by the secretary of agriculture.see also allred produce united states dep t of agriculture,cir citing a.congress intended to protect small farmers and growers who were especially vulnerable to the practices of financially irresponsible buyers.tanimura,at see also idahoan fresh,at.
under the paca,it is unlawful for buyers of produce to fail to make prompt payment for a shipment of produce.section of the paca states 
it shall be unlawful in or in connection with any transaction in interstate or foreign commerce 
for any commission merchant,dealer,or broker to make,for a fraudulent purpose,any false or misleading statement in connection with any transaction involving any perishable agricultural commodity which is received in interstate or foreign commerce by such commission merchant,or bought or sold,or contracted to be bought,sold,or consigned,in such commerce by such dealer,or the purchase or sale of which in such commerce is negotiated by such broker or to fail or refuse truly and correctly to account and make full payment promptly in respect of any transaction in any such commodity to the person with whom such transaction is had 
emphasis added.
a buyer failure to tender prompt payment triggers civil liability and the possible revocation of the buyer paca license which is required by.the paca is admittedly and intentionally a tough law,as reprinted in,which 
is designed to protect the producers of perishable agricultural products who in many instances must send their products to a buyer or commission merchant who is thousands of miles away.it was enacted to provide a measure of control over a branch of industry which is almost exclusively interstate commerce,is highly competitive,and presents many opportunities for sharp practice and irresponsible business conduct.

congress amended the paca in to add a section providing for a statutory trust to benefit unpaid suppliers of fresh produce.c.the statutory trust provision was created in response to congressional concern over the increase in the number of buyers who failed to pay,or were dilatory in paying,their suppliers,and the impact of such payment practices on small suppliers who could not withstand a significant loss or delay in receipt of monies owed.tanimura,at holding that because sellers who qualified as paca trust beneficiaries demonstrated the likelihood of dissipation of trust fund assets and the likelihood of irreparable harm,the district court should have granted the injunction sought.
the trust consists of the perishable agricultural commodities received,all inventories of food or other products derived from the perishable commodities received,and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities or products.the trust holds all proceeds and receivables from the sale of produce by a dealer until the dealer pays the seller the full purchase price.c.the trust thus provides an additional remedy for sellers against a buyer failin
