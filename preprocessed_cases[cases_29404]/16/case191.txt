in this appeal from an order in a diversity suit,rochem international,usa rochem challenges the district court denial of its motion for sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule against cq international,cq see cq int l rochem int l,usa,ng,dist.lexis,wl.june.specifically,rochem avers that,although the district court granted summary judgment in its favor,the court failure to impose sanctions on cq constituted an abuse of discretion in light of cq allegedly frivolous lawsuit against rochem and cq purportedly frivolous arguments in opposing rochem motion for summary judgment.for the reasons stated below,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the imposition of sanctions on cq and thus affirm the appealed order.
factual background 
although the facts and procedural history in this highly contentious case are extensive,we provide a brief sketch of only the events most relevant to this appeal.
cq and rochem are direct competitors in the business of importing and distributing pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured in china.
in,cq entered into an exclusive distribution agreement the cq huizhou contract with guangdong huizhou dongjiang pharmaceutical factory huizhou predecessor,whereby cq acquired exclusive sales rights in the market for huizhou predecessor drug and became huizhou predecessor exclusive agent in regulatory matters with the united states food and drug administration fda concerning this drug.under this contract,cq agreed to buy clozapine exclusively from huizhou predecessor,and not from any other chinese or foreign manufacturer.by its terms,the cq huizhou contract became effective immediately after it was signed by the parties in,had a duration of ten years,could not be cancelled without both parties written consent,and was binding upon each party successors and assigns.
in april,the chinese government auctioned off a majority of huizhou predecessor assets.although cq participated in the auction,it was unsuccessful in acquiring the assets of huizhou predecessor,which were instead acquired by a chinese individual named qiu huazhou who continued huizhou predecessor business under the new name huizhou dongjiang pharmaceutical,huizhou successor.in the action underlying this appeal,cq alleged that the cq huizhou contract survived this auction and bound huizhou successor.rochem,however,argued to the contrary,noting that certain alleged requirements for the assignment of the cq huizhou contract were not met.specifically,rochem noted that the auction proposal required that the auction winner qui huazhou pay huizhou predecessor a deposit of million yuan rmb,which amount was to be refunded by cq to the auction winner upon execution of a product distribution succession contract.it is undisputed that qui never paid the deposit to huizhou predecessor and that huizhou successor and cq never executed a product distribution succession contract.the district court nevertheless found based on the language of the auction proposal and cq huizhou contract,along with public policy considerations that the cq huizhou contract survived the auction and became binding on huizhou successor.
after the auction,cq continued to purchase clozapine from huizhou successor and sold it to ivax pharmaceuticals ivax,a corporation and cq sole clozapine customer.cq alleges that,at some point in,ivax requested that cq obtain clozapine on its behalf.cq,however,was unable to obtain micronized clozapine from huizhou successor,because the latter did not have the capacity to provide micronized clozapine and was unwilling to invest in the necessary micronizing equipment and facilities.
subsequently,in february,cq entered into another exclusive distribution agreement the cq contract with two other chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers,wuhan shiji jingmao sj and wuhan yanhuang chemical,yh,whereby cq became the exclusive distributor and spokesman in the american market for the clozapine manufactured by sj and yh and agreed to act as the exclusive agent for sj and yh in matters relating to the fda concerning the drug clozapine.this contract provides,inter alia,as follows cq shall have clozapine produced exclusively at the factories of sj and yh it can not purchase clozapine from any other chinese or foreign manufacturers.the cq contract became effective in february and had a duration of twenty years.cq maintains that it entered into this contract because it believed that,unlike huizhou successor,sj and yh would be able to provide it with micronized clozapine.however,cq has never purchased any clozapine micronized or from sj and yh under this contract.
cq ordered clozapine from huizhou successor for the last time in may.thereafter,from the fall of through the spring of,huizhou successor contacted cq representatives via telephone approximately five times to inquire whether cq was planning to purchase clozapine.yet,no purchases of clozapine materialized.
around april,rochem contacted huizhou successor to explore the possibility of purchasing clozapine from it,offering huizhou successor a higher price for its clozapine than cq had previously paid.in addition,rochem obtained from huizhou successor a copy of the cq huizhou contract and investigated whether such contract precluded huizhou successor from selling clozapine to rochem.rochem alleges that during this investigation it learned that cq had not purchased clozapine in nearly a year,that cq owed huizhou successor money,and that cq was not answering huizhou successor or telephone calls.furthermore,rochem president,robyn frisch,maintains that qui huazhou,huizhou successor owner,personally informed her that huizhou successor was free to do business with rochem.cq,on the other hand,contests the thoroughness of this investigation and its conclusion that huizhou successor was not precluded from selling clozapine to rochem.
although rochem and huizhou successor were unable to agree on an exclusive distribution agreement,rochem purchased clozapine from huizhou successor on three occasions in,with the last of these purchases occurring in august.rochem,in turn,sold this clozapine to ivax.rochem made its last sale to ivax in december.
cq alleges that,prior to filing its complaint in the action underlying this appeal,it was informed by an employee of huizhou successor,fang zhigang,that huizhou successor had met with rochem and provided the latter with a copy of the cq huizhou contract.according to cq,zhigang also informed it that rochem had purchased clozapine from huizhou successor for sale to ivax.cq maintains that it later confirmed through conversations with the president of ivax,don marchione that rochem had purchased clozapine from huizhou successor for sale to ivax.
ii.procedural history 
in january,cq filed a complaint in the district court against rochem seeking damages for the latter purported intentional tortious interference with the cq huizhou contract.the complaint also included various other derivative claims that were dependent on the tortious interference claim and could not survive if such claim failed.
in june,rochem moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.after opposition by cq,the district court denied dismissal,ruling that cq had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for intentional interference with performance of contract.
thereafter,in september,after the close of a prolonged and highly litigious discovery period,the district court attempted to foster settlement discussions by ordering cq to make a written settlement offer by october.although cq complied,it demanded,the full amount of the damages claimed in its amended initial disclosures.rochem responded by rejecting this offer and making a demanding that cq pay rochem in order to settle the case and avoid rochem filing of a motion for sanctions and a suit for malicious prosecution.the district court noted,after being apprised of this matter by cq,that the peculiar amount in rochem offer was due to the fact that the number four is considered an unlucky number in chinese culture because it is homophonous with the chinese word for death.the district court opined that,while rochem was not a death threat,its attorneys had acted improperly.the court,however,declined to impose sanctions on rochem attorneys.
in october,rochem moved for summary judgment on all claims,pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.after the parties filed various responsive motions,the district court scheduled a hearing for january,regarding rochem summary judgment motion and requested supplementary briefing on various aspects of the cq contract and its effect on cq claim that rochem tortiously interfered with the cq huizhou contract.both parties filed supplemental memoranda.cq memorandum,which cq filed on the eve of the hearing,january,was accompanied by additional declarations from its president,joan chen,and its chinese advisor,chen hongyi.these supplemental declarations attempted,inter alia,to substantiate a claim first made by cq in its earlier opposition to summary judgment specifically,that the cq huizhou contract only involved clozapine,whereas the cq contract solely contemplated micronized clozapine.rochem moved to strike these additional declarations as untimely.
thereafter,on january,rochem moved for sanctions against cq under rule and and cq responded by requesting that the district court instead sanction rochem.
finally,on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rochem,concluding that,although the cq huizhou contract survived the auction and bound huizhou successor,cq breached said contract by entering into the cq contract,which the court considered incompatible with cq obligations under the cq huizhou contract.the court determined that cq breach of the cq huizhou contract caused huizhou successor to be discharged from its obligation to sell clozapine exclusively to cq.in addition,the court concluded that cq was not harmed by rochem purchases from huizhou successor because cq could not have purchased clozapine from huizhou successor without breaching the cq contract.in reaching its decision,the district court ruled that cq additional declarations from joan chen and chen hongyi were stricken from the record as untimely,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and local rule b.see.e lr,b affidavits and other documents setting forth or evidencing facts on which the opposition is based shall be filed with the opposition.the court,however,made clear that its conclusions would not have changed even if the additional declarations had been admitted as evidence.additionally,the court declined to impose sanctions on either party,concluding that cq claims,although belatedly and insufficiently developed,were not frivolous.cq int l,wl,at.

iv.discussion 
rochem challenges the district court denial of sanctions against cq on two grounds.first,rochem asserts that the district court clearly erred in determining that cq claims were not frivolous.to this effect,rochem argues that cq presented frivolous arguments and declarations in its opposition to summary judgment regarding the contract and rochem compliance with fda regulations.in addition,rochem argues that cq failed to reasonably investigate its claims and knew prior to filing suit that its claims were not well grounded in fact.second,rochem alleges that the district court abused its discretion by failing to adequately lay out its rationale for rejecting rochem motion for sanctions under rule.
for the reasons stated below and taking into consideration the extraordinary deference accorded to the district court in denying sanctions,we find that cq claims were not so patently frivolous that sanctions necessarily should have been imposed.see id.at.in addition,we find that the district court sufficiently provided its rationale for denying sanctions.we further discuss these findings in order.
cq claims were not patently frivolous 
rule permits a court to impose sanctions on a party or lawyer for advocating a frivolous position,pursuing an unfounded claim,or filing a lawsuit for some improper purpose.see.b.we have noted,however,that this rule is not a strict liability provision,and a showing of at least culpable carelessness is required before a violation of the rule can be found.citibank global,santana,cir alteration omitted citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,it is clear that t he mere fact that a claim ultimately proves unavailing,without more,can not support the imposition of rule sanctions.protective life ins.dignity viatical settlement partners,cir.
in the present case,rochem avers that cq violated rule by presenting frivolous arguments in its opposition to summary judgment concerning the contract and rochem compliance with fda regulations,and failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the law and facts underlying its tortious interference claim prior to filing the complaint.we address these arguments seriatim.
cq opposition to summary judgment 
rochem maintains that the district court clearly erred in determining that cq claim that rochem tortiously interfered with the cq huizhou contract was not frivolous,particularly in light of the district court conclusions on summary judgment regarding the merits of this claim.as previously mentioned,the district court concluded that cq breached the cq huizhou contract by entering into an inconsistent distribution agreement with sj and yh,the cq contract before rochem made the challenged purchases,and that cq was not harmed by rochem purchases because cq could not have purchased clozapine from huizhou successor without breaching the cq contract.significantly,these conclusions were premised on the district court finding that contrary to cq contention both the cq huizhou contract and the cq contract embraced all forms of clozapine micronized and and were therefore inconsistent.
thus,whether or not cq tortious interference claim was frivolous depends in large part on the reasonableness of its contention first presented in its opposition to summary judgment that the cq huizhou contract involved only clozapine,whereas the cq contract contemplated solely micronized clozapine.cq pointed to various pieces of extrinsic evidence in support of this distinction,despite the fact that the contracts apparently unambiguous language made no such limitation.for example,rochem presented evidence suggesting that both huizhou predecessor and huizhou successor lacked the capacity to manufacture micronized clozapine and never acquired the necessary micronizing equipment,the only clozapine that cq purchased from either huizhou predecessor or huizhou successor was the variety,and cq only contracted with sj and yh after ivax requested micronized clozapine,which cq knew huizhou successor could not produce.in addition,cq argued that the fact that both the cq huizhou contract and the cq contract included only one price term demonstrated that the contracts did not cover both micronized and clozapine because micronized clozapine was more desirable and demanded a higher price.
the district court noted that cq argument presented interesting questions regarding
