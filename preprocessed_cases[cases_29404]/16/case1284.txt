santander consumer usa santander appeals from the district court order denying its motion to compel arbitration and stay court proceedings of antonia rota mclarty rota mclarty claims against it while finding that an enforceable arbitration agreement encompassing rotamclarty claims existed,the district court nevertheless concluded that santander had waived its right to enforce arbitration by its delay.after assuring ourselves of jurisdiction,we conclude the record does not support the district court finding of waiver.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to refer the claims to arbitration.
the relevant facts are few and undisputed.on july,rota mclarty,a maryland resident,purchased a used car from easterns automotive group easterns in rockville,maryland.in completing that transaction,rota mclarty executed two contracts with easterns.the first was a buyer order,which provides the terms of the sale and contains an agreement to arbitrate disputes.
the second was a retail installment sale contract risc,which does not contain an arbitration provision.the risc provides the financing terms for rota mclarty loan and information about repossession rights and procedures.additionally,the risc contains an integration clause,which states this contract contains the entire agreement between you and us relating to this contract.any change to this contract must be in writing and we must sign it.no oral changes are binding.santander the financing terms,and easterns assigned the risc to santander immediately after the sale.
rota mclarty returned the car,which she claimed was defective,to easterns lot in maryland,having never made a payment on her loan.santander sought collection of the outstanding debt after repossessing and selling the car at a loss.
rota mclarty filed a putative class action in state court against santander on march,alleging violations of various maryland consumer protection laws for undisclosed finance charges and other unfair business practices.on april,santander removed the complaint to federal court on the basis of diversity.santander filed an answer the next day,and within a month the parties had agreed on a bifurcated discovery schedule,whereby the first stage would focus on the issue of hidden finance charges,with class and other discovery to follow.during the brief discovery period that ensued,santander took rota mclarty deposition on both stage one and stage two issues,and rota mclarty took easterns deposition and sought production of various documents.one such document was a letter easterns had received from santander in,detailing the terms of the risc assignment,which rota mclarty asserts supports her hidden finance charge allegations 
on september,santander moved to compel arbitration of rota mclarty claims and to stay the proceedings in federal court.santander claimed the delay in seeking arbitration was caused by uncertainty in the law regarding whether it would be forced into class arbitration,which was clarified by the supreme court decision in stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.santander waited longer,until a district court had applied stolt nielsen in the consumer context,to file its motion 
in denying santander motion,the district court deemed the underlying transaction purely intrastate in nature,and applied the maryland uniform arbitration act the muaa,cts.jud.proc.et,rather than the federal arbitration act the faa.concluding that the buyer order and risc must be read together despite an integration provision in the latter,the court found there was an enforceable arbitration agreement between rota mclarty and santander,which encompassed her claims.nonetheless,the court denied santander motion on grounds that santander had waived its right to compel arbitration through unjustified delay and by having participated significantly in discovery.santander now appeals.
santander argues that the district court erred in failing to apply the faa and in finding waiver.rota mclarty disagrees,and also contests the district court conclusion that a binding arbitration agreement existed between the parties.before turning to the merits,however,we must first assure ourselves of our jurisdiction over this appeal.
courts of appeal ordinarily may review only final decisions of district courts.wheeling,health plan of the upper ohio valley,cir arthur andersen llp carlisle,see also.although the district court order denying santander motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is not a final decision,we may nevertheless exercise appellate jurisdiction if the order falls within an exception to the final judgment rule established by the faa.
the faa provides for appeals from,inter alia,orders refusing a stay of any action under section of this title,or denying a petition under section of this to order arbitration to proceed.a a b.congress purpose in creating appellate jurisdiction for these orders was to effectuate a strong policy favoring arbitration through appeal rules,whereby an order that favors litigation over arbitration is immediately appealable,even if interlocutory in nature.stedor,armtex,cir.
here,our determination of whether the district court order falls within an exception comprises two steps.we must first decide whether the transaction is one that involves interstate commerce to which the faa applies if so,we then examine whether santander motion did,in fact,adequately invoke or,thus giving us appellate jurisdiction under of the faa.
turning first to the question of whether the parties agreement falls within the scope of the faa,we note that the reach of the statute is broad.it operates to enforce an arbitration provision included in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.see also wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,where commerce means commerce among the several states.the supreme court has interpreted this provision as exercising the full scope of congress power.allied bruce terminix dobson.moreover,the term evidencing a transaction requires only that the transaction in fact involved interstate commerce,not that the parties contemplated it as such at the time of the agreement.id.at.
the district court analysis of whether the underlying transaction is solely intrastate in nature consists of one sentence there is no indication that rota mclarty transaction involved interstate commerce,and the parties agree that maryland law governs their relationship.we are constrained to disagree.
the underlying transaction here is simply a consumer credit arrangement between a citizen of one state and a financing company in another.although diversity of citizenship or lack thereof is not by itself enough to determine the nature of a transaction,see maxum,salus,cir t he mere circumstance of diversity of citizenship between the parties is not sufficient to command the application of the faa,we need not rely solely on it here.the financing,which originated from a foreign state,was integral to rota mclarty purchase of the used car from easterns.we agree with sister circuits,which have concluded that reliance upon funds from a foreign source in a transaction is sufficient to implicate the faa.see,jenkins first am.cash advance of georgia,cir payday loan completed by a georgia consumer in the georgia office of loan company involved interstate commerce where the funds were approved and disbursed by a national bank based in south dakota.therefore,the faa applies.
our conclusion is bolstered by two additional factors.first,we have held that the faa does not impose a burden upon the party invoking the faa to put forth specific evidence proving the interstate nature of the transaction.maxum,at where the party seeking arbitration alleges that the transaction is within the scope of the faa,and the party opposing application of the faa does not come forward with evidence to rebut jurisdiction under the federal statute,we do not read into the faa a requirement of further proof by the party invoking the federal law.santander has made the requisite initial showing,which rota mclarty has failed to rebut.indeed,she admits the interstate nature of the transaction embodied in the risc should be hardly controversial,appellee br.at,and we agree 
second,in deciding to apply the faa,we need not identify any specific effect upon interstate commerce,so long as in the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent a general practice subject to federal control.citizens bank alafabco,citation omitted.we agree with santander that the broad impact of consumer automobile lending on the national economy is evident.appellant br.at citizen bank,at w ere there any residual doubt about the magnitude of the impact on interstate commerce caused by the particular economic transactions in which the parties were engaged,that doubt would dissipate upon consideration of the general practice those transactions represent.no elaborate explanation is needed to make evident the broad impact of commercial lending on the national economy or congress power to regulate that activity pursuant to the commerce clause.internal citation omitted.
for these reasons,we find that the underlying transaction relates to interstate commerce,and that the district court erred in declining to apply the faa.we are thus assured that federal law supplies not only our procedural framework,but also the substantive law regarding arbitration.preston ferrer.
we next address the narrower issue of whether santander motion adequately invoked or of the faa so as to create appellate jurisdiction under the statute exception to the final judgment rule.guided by our precedent in wheeling,we find that it did.
consonant with the approach taken by our sister circuits,wheeling held that the proper inquiry focuses on substance rather than nomenclature.at.in other words,we look to whether a motion evidences a clear intention to seek enforcement of an arbitration clause rather than on whether it adhered to a specific form or explicitly referenced or.id.of course,t he first,simplest,and surest way to guarantee appellate jurisdiction under a is to caption the motion in the district court as one brought under faa or.id.quoting conrad phone directories,cir.but requiring such a caption would violate the spirit of notice pleading embodied in our federal rules of civil procedure.conrad,at.instead,we 
look beyond the caption to the essential attributes of the motion itself.the goal of this inquiry is to determine whether it is plainly apparent from the four corners of the motion that the movant seeks only the relief provided for in the faa,rather than any other remedy.
specifically,in examining the four corners of the motion,our focus is on the relief requested.if the essence of the requested relief is that the issues presented be decided exclusively by an arbitrator and not by any court,the denial of that motion is appealable under.wheeling,at citation omitted.if,however,the requested relief would be a judicial remedy that is inconsistent with the position that the issues involved may be decided only by the arbitrator,then the motion should no longer be viewed as proceeding exclusively under the faa,and interlocutory review under is not proper.id.citation omitted.
guided by wheeling,we conclude the denial of santander motion is immediately appealable.although the caption motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings does not specifically reference or,it clearly invokes the relief provided in those sections.further,santander memorandum in support of that motion asks the court to grant santander motion,compel arbitration of rota mclarty claims,and stay all other aspects of this action pending further order of the court.it does not,by contrast,request any judicial remedy that is inconsistent with the position that the issues involved may be decided only by the arbitrator.wheeling,at citation omitted.rota mclarty has not pointed to any authority other than the faa upon which santander could have intended to rely in seeking to compel arbitration and stay litigation,much less shown how the relief santander sought is inconsistent with the position that rota mclarty claims must be decided by an arbitrator.
for these reasons,we find that the four corners of santander motion make it abundantly clear santander sought enforcement of the arbitration agreement.denial of that motion is therefore immediately appealable.
turning now to the substantive issues on appeal,we examine whether a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties,and,if so,whether santander was in default of its right to enforce that agreement.
the question of whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between rota mclarty and santander is a matter of contract interpretation governed by state law,which we review de novo.find where holdings.env t optimization,llc,cir.
we must first determine whether santander,as an assignee only to the risc,which contains an integration clause providing that it is the complete agreement between the parties,and not the buyer order,which includes the arbitration language,could invoke arbitration.relying on maryland cases instructing courts to look to the intent of the parties to determine the preclusive effect of an integration clause,the district court found that the circumstances surrounding the transaction here indicated that the parties did not intend the risc to be a final and complete integration of their agreement.rather,they intended that the two agreements should be interpreted together.further,the court concluded that rota mclarty claims fell within the scope of the arbitration provision.rota mclarty challenges both conclusions.we consider each in turn.
with respect to the integration clause,rota mclarty essentially repeats her arguments before the district court she relies heavily on hartford accident indem.scarlett harbor,which she asserts can not be distinguished on any principled basis from the instant matter.appellee br.at.in that case,the court examined two contracts.the first,between a condominium developer and a construction contractor,contained an arbitration provision,while the second,the contractor performance bond with a bonding company,did not.the court declined to allow the bonding company to enforce the arbitration provision contained in the construction contract,even though the bond incorporated that contract by reference.hartford,at.
we disagree with rota mclarty that the circumstances in that case mirror those in the case at hand.far from indistinguishable,hartford is inapposite because santander does not rely on language in the risc,but instead points to language in the buyer order itself,which states that it applies to the assignee of the risc,including several times in the arbitration provision thus,we do not have the same concerns as the court in hartford that the parties did not intend the arbitration provision,specifically,to govern their agreement.
the facts in this case support the district court finding that the buyer order and risc were made as part of a single transaction,and should be interpreted together under maryland law.see shoreham developers,randolph hills,explaining that the coverage of an integration clause is a matter of interpretation,and does not exclude reading the instruments together where the parties did not intend the sales contract standing by itself to be a final and complete integration of the agreed upon terms jaguar land rover north america,llc manhattan imported cars,d,whether an agreement is integrated and the effect of an integration clause are preliminary questions of interpretation determined by the court.citing shoreham,aff,fed.app x cir.the buyer order,which is expressly conditioned upon approval of the retail installment sale contract,and defines the agreement collectively with other documents made in connection with the buyer order,is insufficient on its own to explain the full extent of the parties obligations,jaguar land rover,d at.for these reasons,we find rota mclarty has failed to establish that the risc integration clause prevents reading both contracts together as a single agreement.
rota mclarty second argument,that santander should not be able to enforce the arbitration agreement because it contains a for assignees of the risc,is similarly unconvincing the flaw in her interpretation of the arbitration clause becomes evident when the is viewed in the context of the arbitration clause 
a dispute is any question as to whether something must be arbitrated,as well as any purely monetary claim greater than in the aggregate,whether contract,tort,or other,arising from the negotiation of and terms of the buyer order,any service contract or insurance product,or any retail installment sale contract or lease but this arbitration provision does not apply to and shall not be binding on any assignee thereof.
enumeration added.basic principles of contract interpretation instruct us to look first to the plain meaning of the contract terms,and also to give meaning to each word used and avoid constructions that render language meaningless,superfluous,or contradictory.see directv,mattingly.
here,the parenthetical phrase that constitutes the follows,and modifies,a list of three types of monetary claims that are subject to arbitration.the parenthetical exempts the forced arbitration of any purely monetary claim greater than by an assignee of that claim.it does not pertain to assignees of the risc in particular rather,it indicates that a person to whom an monetary claim has been assigned can not enforce arbitration.santander is not the assignee of any monetary claim,but instead is the assignee of the entire agreement embodied in the risc.the interpretation advanced by rota mclarty not only ignores the structure of the sentence containing the,but it also operates at odds with the remainder of the arbitration provision,which contemplates the binding nature of the agreement on santander by equating the dealer and the assignee of any risc in several places.see,a ll disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator located in the dealer area in the state of maryland selected by the dealer or the assignee of any risc with the consent of the purchaser.we thus find nothing in the language of the arbitration provision to indicate it was not intended to be enforceable by santander as assignee of the risc.
finally,we examine the district court finding that santander waived its right to enforce the arbitration agreement.we review the district court decision to deny santander arbitration request de novo,with deference to its underlying factual findings,forrester penn lyon homes,cir,and conclude that the court made several errors.
applying maryland arbitration law,the district court found that whether a party has waived its right to arbitrate depends on the extent of its participation in judicial proceedings,including whether an answer has been filed whether there was a legitimate reason for the participation and whether the delay in seeking arbitration prejudiced the other party.additionally,the court proclaimed that the belated insistence on arbitration that has all the markings of a simple strategic decision is improper.id.quoting abramson wildman.the district court then concluded that santander had waived its right to arbitrate for four reasons santander delay in moving to compel arbitration santander participation in discovery about rota mclarty allegations of hidden finance charges,which included exchanging hundreds of pages of documents,serving and responding to interrogatories,and taking rota mclarty deposition on all allegations,santander strategic decision based on its fear that class discovery would have been compelled prior to stolt nielsen is not a legitimate reason for engaging in litigation rather than immediately seeking arbitration,and santander failure to rebut rota mclarty contention that santander had delayed in order to use litigation to fully evaluate rota mclarty case,id.we must reject the district court reliance on each of these findings,for the reasons that follow.
as a threshold matter,we note the district court erred by applying the wrong law.under the faa,a party may lose its right to compel arbitration if it is in default in proceeding with such arbitration.this principle of default is akin to waiver,but not identical.unlike some waiver doctrines,the circumstances giving rise to a statutory default are limited and,in light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,are not to be lightly inferred,maxum,at,and the party opposing arbitration bears a heavy burden to prove default,am.recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir 
generally,a litigant defaults on its right to invoke the faa where it so substantially utiliz es the litigation machinery that to subsequently permit arbitration would prejudice the party opposing the stay.forrester,at citation omitted.where a party fails to demand arbitration during pretrial proceedings,and,in the meantime,engages in pretrial activity inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate,the party later opposing a motion to compel arbitration may more easily show that its position has been compromised,prejudiced.fraser merrill lynch pierce,fenner smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the dispositive determination is whether the opposing party has suffered actual prejudice.microstrategy,lauricia,at citing fraser,at see also patten grading paving,skanska usa,cir.two factors specifically inform our inquiry into actual prejudice the amount of the delay and the extent of the moving party activity.microstrategy,at.notably,the moving party reason for delay is not relevant to the default inquiry under our precedent we consider each of the two factors in turn.
first,in comparison to our decisions considering the issue,the length of delay in this case was relatively short.at most,santander waited six and a half months from the date rotamclarty filed her complaint in state court to file its motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in federal court we have previously held that a delay of several months,without more,is insufficient to demonstrate the opposing party suffered actual prejudice.see,patten,at no prejudice inherent in delay maxum,at same,with delay forrester,at default proper where litigation had proceeded for over two years before the moving party sought arbitration fraser,at same,with delay.
here,nothing in the record supports a finding that rotamclarty was prejudiced by the length of the delay itself.her general assertion that she committed substantial resources to the case on the premise that the court would have an opportunity to rule on a motion for class certification,appellee br.at,is both unsubstantiated and unconvincing.although incurring significant expense as a result of extended litigation can be part of actual prejudice,such cases usually involve resources expended specifically in response to motions filed by the party who later seeks arbitration.see,fraser,at prejudice found in part because opposing party had to respond to a number of potentially damaging motions,including a motion for partial summary judgment and three motions to dismiss.and where,as here,rota mclarty has provided no evidentiary support for her claimed significant expense,this argument fails entirely.patten,at declining to base prejudice on costs incurred where the opposing party failed to adequately prove the expense.consequently,we conclude the district court erred to the extent it based its determination of default on the length of delay 
the second factor in our prejudice inquiry looks to the nature and extent of santander litigation activities.here,santander utilized the litigation machinery in a few mostly minimal ways it removed the complaint to federal court,filed an answer,proposed a bifurcated discovery plan,took rota mclarty deposition on both phase one and phase two issues,and waited for clarity in the law in order to avoid class arbitration.no dispositive motions were filed for her part,rota mclarty engaged in some discovery as well,which resulted in easterns production of a document that rota mclarty styles as a smoking gun proving her claim of an undisclosed finance charge.rota mclarty asserts these activities support a finding of prejudice because santander proposed a plan that limited her discovery rights,while ignoring those limitations itself by taking her deposition on
