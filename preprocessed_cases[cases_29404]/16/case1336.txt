these appeals relate to lawsuits being pursued by several classes of peanut farmers the farmers who insured their peanut crops under a multiple peril crop insurance policy the mpci policy that,under federal law,was issued by private insurers and reinsured by the government after suffering heavy losses to their peanut crops,due primarily to a severe drought during the growing season,the farmers filed claims under the mpci policy.they were indemnified for their losses at a rate of cents per than at the claimed quota rate of cents.the farmers expectations of indemnity at the cent quota rate were premised largely on the government allocations of peanut poundage quotas in previous years.however,federal farm legislation enacted in may eliminated the peanut quota program that had been in effect in some form since.see farm security and rural investment act of,stat,the farm bill.
after the farmers were indemnified at the cent rate for their crop losses,they initiated a series of civil actions against the government in several federal jurisdictions,alleging,inter alia,that the mpci policy had been breached and that their due process rights had been violated the district court eventually had before it a class action on behalf of the farmers situated in the eastern district of north carolina,as well as several other class actions first initiated in other jurisdictions and then transferred to the eastern district of north carolina by the litigation panel the mdl panel.in disposing of the farmers contentions,the court,on july,certified a class action on behalf of the farmers in the eastern district of north carolina the north carolina case.the court then awarded summary judgment to those farmers on their breach of contract claims.see barnhill davidson,july,the sj opinion on march,the court entered an order establishing a formula to be used in computing damage awards.see in re peanut crop insurance litigation,the damages order on march,and again on december,the court extended its sj opinion including the class certification ruling,as well as its damages order,to the lawsuits brought by the farmers in other jurisdictions the mdl cases.see in re peanut crop insurance litigation,mdl order i in re peanut crop insurance litigation,mdl order ii 
on december,the district court entered final judgment on the farmers breach of contract claims,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure the government has appealed,contending,inter alia,that the court erred by concluding that the mpci policy obligated the insurers to indemnify the farmers at the cent quota rate in the absence of peanut poundage quota allocations having been made to individual farms and determining that the government failure to allocate such quotas breached the mpci policy,based on the court conclusion that the enactment of the farm bill hindered the performance of the government statutory duty to allocate such quotas.the government also contends that the court erroneously premised its sj opinion,in part,on the farmers alternative theory of detrimental reliance.the farmers have,asserting that the district court erred in failing to certify a nationwide class of,and also in denying the requests of certain plaintiffs for transfers of venue.as explained below,we disagree with the district court breach of contract ruling,and thus vacate its sj opinion and remand.
in order to properly assess these appeals,we first review the background of the federal crop insurance and peanut quota programs we then examine the relevant provisions of the mpci policy and the farm bill.finally,we relate the procedural history of this litigation,as well as the appellate contentions of the parties.
although crop insurance under the mpci policy is provided by private insurers,it is reinsured by a governmental entity called the federal crop insurance corporation the fcic,pursuant to the federal crop insurance act,et the fcic is a wholly owned government corporation that operates under the umbrella of the department of agriculture the usda,and it is statutorily responsible for regulating the crop insurance industry.see.peanut farmers united states.the fcic is itself regulated by the usda risk management agency the rma.id.as specified by congress,the fcic purpose is to promote the national welfare by improving the economic stability of agriculture through a sound system of crop insurance.a.the crop insurance program implements the public policy of protecting farmers from the risks associated with drought,flood,and other natural disasters.b.the basic coverage provisions of crop insurance protect insured farmers against catastrophic risk,and serve to indemnify those farmers on losses in excess of of the crop normal yield,indemnified at of the crop expected market price.b.pursuant to the governing provisions of the crop insurance program,insured farmers are also entitled to purchase additional insurance coverage at a greater percentage of their expected yields.c.
prior to,the extent to which the mpci policy indemnified lost or damaged peanut crops varied,depending on whether the insured crops were designated as quota or peanuts,as defined by the peanut quota program.this peanut quota program was recently addressed and described by the federal circuit in members of the peanut quota holders ass united states,concluding that farm bill changes in quota program did not result in compensable taking under fifth amendment.that court description of the background of the program is helpful,and was spelled out,in part,as follows 
in the the united states economic depression particularly affected the agricultural community.congress,in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the depression on agricultural products,enacted the agricultural adjustment act of aaa,ch.tit.iii,et,stat,which regulated the production and sale of tobacco and wheat within the united states.the statute instituted acreage allotments to prevent oversupply of the targeted agricultural commodities.in,the aaa was amended to include farm acreage allotments for peanuts.the agricultural adjustment act of,as amended,ch,tit.iii,stat,the act.the act sought to regulate the production of peanuts to avoid severe fluctuations in price caused by rapid changes in market demand and the lag in response to that demand caused by crop growing cycles.act,stat.at.since,congress has regulated peanut production primarily through quotas set by the secretary of agriculture but the nature and reach of the quota system has not remained constant.
peanut quota holders ass n,at.the peanut quota program was,prior to,a price support system for each year peanut crop.quota peanuts were peanuts used for domestic edible consumption,whereas peanuts additional peanuts or excess peanuts were either crushed or exported.peanuts had a lower value than quota peanuts,and,in the crop years preceding,the vast majority of peanuts grown by the farmers were quota peanuts.
the value of quota peanuts and the related national poundage quota for such peanuts in a specific crop year were determined by the usda farm poundage quota allocations to individual farms were made by the farm service agency the fsa,which administers the price support programs of the usda.during the crop years immediately preceding,quota peanuts lost due to covered occurrences were indemnified at the rate of cents per pound,and peanuts lost due to such occurrences were indemnified at a cent rate.the peanut quota program thus supplied the mpci policy with the value per pound of both quota and peanuts,and those values were used for determining the applicable coverage and indemnification rates.based on to what poundage quotas were allocated to individual peanut farms,these rates were used to calculate the allowable indemnification for peanut crop losses under the policy.
the coverage provisions of the mpci policy were published in the federal register and are codified in title of the code of federal regulations.see et.the usda,acting through the rma and the fcic,is responsible for satisfying certain deadlines and for general oversight of the mpci policy.see et.the mpci policy also imposes certain obligations on insured farmers.the following mpci policy terms relate to dates and that are pertinent to these appeals 
all changes to the mpci policy coverage provisions,price elections,coverage limits,premium rates,and program dates must generally be made prior to a contract change date.the policy defines the contract change date as the calendar date by which we make any policy changes available for inspection in the agent office.mpci basic policy.for the crop year,the contract change date was november.
price elections can be offered after the contract change date,so long as they are offered no later than fifteen days prior to the sales closing date,and are not less than those available on the contract change date.mpci basic policy e b.the mpci policy defines the sales closing date as a date contained in the special provisions by which an application must be filed.the latest date by which you may change your crop insurance coverage for a crop year.id.the sales closing date,which varied from state to state,was february,for the farmers in the north carolina case.
the cancellation date,or the date on which coverage would automatically renew unless cancelled in writing,was also february,in north carolina after the cancellation date,the farmers were bound by the mpci policy and could neither rescind nor alter it.
the earliest planting date for north carolina farmers was april.the mpci policy defines the earliest planting date as the earliest date established for planting the insured crop.mpci basic policy.
the north carolina farmers had until the final planting date of may,to plant their peanut crops.the final planting date is the date contained in the special provisions for the insured crop by which the crop must initially be planted in order to be insured for the full production guarantee or amount of insurance per acre.mpci basic policy 
the mpci policy includes several other provisions and definitions that are pertinent to an understanding of these proceedings,including 
the mpci policy defines price election as the amounts contained in the special provisions or an addendum thereto,to be used for computing the value per pound for the purposes of determining premium and indemnity under the policy.mpci basic policy.the price election is generally based on the fcic projection of market prices for a given commodity.c.
the mpci policy required each insured farmer to file an annual acreage report detailing the peanut crop acreage to be planted by the farm and the effective poundage marketing quota,if any,that is applicable to an individual farm for the current crop year.mpci policy peanut provision.
the term effective poundage marketing quota is important with respect to this litigation and federal crop insurance,and is defined by the mpci policy as the number of pounds reported on the acreage report as eligible for the average support price per pound not to exceed the marketing quota established by the fsa for the farm serial number.mpci policy peanut provision.
the mpci policy defines quota peanuts as p eanuts that are eligible to be valued at the average support price per pound.mpci policy peanut provision.peanuts,in turn,are simply defined as p eanuts other than quota peanuts.id.
the production guarantee is defined in the mpci policy as the number of pounds determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.mpci basic policy.
the mpci policy provides that t he maximum pounds that may be insured at the quota price election are the lesser of the effective poundage marketing quota,or the insured acreage multiplied by the production guarantee but,to the extent that the resulting figure exceeds the effective poundage marketing quota,the difference will be insured at the peanut price election.mpci policy peanut provision b.although the mpci policy explains how quota peanuts are insured,it also authorizes and provides for coverage where lost or damaged crops do not involve quota peanuts.for example,the mpci policy makes reference to the effective poundage marketing quota,if any.id.in calculating the maximum poundage that may be insured as quota peanuts,the mpci policy looks to the lesser of the effective poundage marketing quota,on the one hand,or the insured acreage multiplied by the production guarantee,on the other.if,with respect to an insured farm,the insured acreage multiplied by the production guarantee exceeds the effective poundage marketing quota,the difference is insured and indemnified at the rate only.if an insured farm has not been allocated an effective poundage marketing quota,its entire insured acreage,multiplied by the production guarantee,would exceed a quota allocation of zero and the entire production would be insured at the rate.thus,when an annual farm poundage quota allocation for an insured farm is zero,none of that farm peanut production is insured at the quota rate.
the mpci policy similarly provides for the calculation of indemnity in the event that part or all of a farmer lost crops are peanuts.specifically,the indemnity formula provides that the value of lost or damaged peanuts is computed by first multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee per acre.mpci policy peanut provision c.the second step of this indemnity formula requires the effective poundage marketing quota of the farm to be subtracted from the resulting sum,to determine the amount of insured quota and peanuts the amount in excess of the effective poundage marketing quota is the amount of peanuts.id.after determining the amount of insured quota and peanuts,those amounts are multiplied by their respective price elections.thus,in the event a farm poundage quota allocation is not made to a farm with an insured crop,the mpci policy provides that the loss to be indemnified must be determined on the basis of the price election for peanuts.id.
on november,the contract change date,an addendum to the mpci policy was issued and made effective.the addendum provided that losses suffered by crop year peanuts would be indemnified at cents per pound for quota peanuts and cents per pound for peanuts as they had been indemnified for the previous several years.two weeks later,on december,the usda announced a national poundage quota for peanuts for the crop year,at the same level as the national poundage quota.the usda announcement stated that the national poundage quota will be allocated to each state based on the state share of the national poundage quota.this announcement,however,also alerted the farmers to the possibility that the peanut quota program for the crop year could be altered or eliminated by statute.specifically,it advised that 
the farm bill currently being considered by congress would dramatically change the peanut program.poundage quotas would be eliminated and price support would be replaced with a target price and deficiency payment plan.if pending legislation is enacted as law,the poundage quota and price support announced by this release may be altered or rescinded.
emphasis added.as noted,this usda announcement was made two weeks after the contract change date of november.on january,the usda announced that the national poundage quota for peanuts would remain the same in and will be allocated to eligible quota and farms.this announcement again warned,however,that 
the farm bill currently being considered by congress would change the peanut program.poundage quotas would be eliminated and price support would be replaced with a target price and deficiency payment plan.if pending legislation is enacted as law for,the poundage quota announced according to this notice will be altered or rescinded.
emphasis added.as these usda announcements forecast and warned,the fsa did not allocate farm poundage quotas to individual farms in.instead,on may,the fsa directed its county offices not to allocate any such quotas to individual peanut farms for.ten days later,on may,the president signed into law the farm bill,which,inter alia,repealed the fsa statutory authority to allocate farm poundage quotas to peanut farms and substantially and materially altered the federal crop assistance program for peanut farmers.
in the place and stead of the peanut quota system,the farm bill provided for several programs continued price supports through loans at rates substantially below the quota rates a program of direct payments to farmers a new price support program of payments triggered by the rise and fall of market prices a marketing quota program and a mandated cents to cents per the price election for peanuts,to be used to compute premiums and indemnity payments under the mpci policy.farm bill c 
on may,in response to the major statutory revisions made by the farm bill to the peanut quota program,the usda sent a bulletin to the crop insurance companies,advising them that all peanuts were to be treated as peanuts for purposes of the mpci policy in the crop year.accordingly,all indemnities made pursuant to the mpci policy for peanut crops were made at the rate of cents 
unfortunately,the farmers peanut crops suffered heavy losses and damages,primarily due to a severe drought during the growing season.when they filed their claims for indemnification under the mpci policy,the farmers were informed that their losses would only be indemnified at the rate of cents per pound,although they had been expecting indemnification at the cent quota rate.indeed,quota peanuts had usually constituted a majority of the farmers annual crops.when their claims for indemnification at the cent rate were denied,the farmers initiated this series of lawsuits,alleging that the mpci policy had been breached and that the government had violated their due process rights.
the north carolina case was filed on november,on behalf of all peanut farmers in north carolina and virginia who are eligible for the multiple peril crop insurance policy for crop year and are similarly situated to the named plaintiffs.put succinctly,the complaint sought declaratory,injunctive,and compensatory relief,and requested that the proceeding be certified as a class action.it alleged that the government had breached the mpci policy by the unilateral and untimely modification of its coverage terms,and asserted that the government had violated the farmers due process rights by,inter alia,arbitrarily and capriciously altering the policy by unilateral and retroactive action.
in ruling on the class certification issue in its sj opinion,the district court certified a class of insured farmers whose farms were situated within the eastern district of north carolina and who had been assigned farm poundage quotas for the crop year.see sj opinion.the court concluded,however,pursuant to j of title,that it lacked jurisdiction over insured farmers whose farms were situated outside the eastern district of north carolina,and thus excluded them from the certified class.id.at,
the district court then proceeded to address the parties for summary judgment,and ruled in favor of the farmers on the merits of their breach of contract claims.see sj opinion.in so ruling,the court concluded that the government had breached its contractual obligation under the mpci policy to indemnify the farmers lost peanut crops at the cent quota rate.the court reasoned that the government,by the farm bill repeal of the fsa authority to allocate farm poundage quotas,had hindered the occurrence of a condition that would have given rise to coverage and indemnity at the cent rate,and that the government was thus barred from denying liability under the mpci policy.id.at.the court also determined that neither the sovereign acts doctrine nor the unmistakability doctrine afforded the government a valid defense to liability.id.at.
with respect to the sovereign acts doctrine,the court recognized that the government would possess a valid defense to the farmers breach of contract claims if a public and general law prevented the occurrence of a condition giving rise to liability.sj opinion.it concluded,however,that the farm bill,in repealing the poundage marketing quota program,included a provision that obviously and specifically targeted the contractual obligations under the peanut farmers crop insurance policies for the crop year.id.at.the court concluded that the reduction of insurance coverage was direct,not merely incidental to the accomplishment of a broader governmental objective.id.internal quotation marks omitted.it thus determined that the sovereign acts doctrine did not authorize the government to escape liability for the farmers breach of contract claims.id.at.
the court next concluded that,because the farm bill was not public and general,the unmistakability doctrine does not apply.sj opinion.with respect to the due process claims,the court determined that the plaintiffs due process arguments are primarily based on their contract claims.id.at.concluding that it had already discussed the plaintiffs contract claim at length and found for the plaintiffs as to this claim,the court found it unnecessary to resolve the plaintiffs due process claims.id 
when the district court made its rulings in the sj opinion,several similar lawsuits were being pursued in other federal courts.one such proceeding,filed in the court of federal claims on behalf of farmers in texas,georgia,alabama,florida,and south carolina,was dismissed on december,for lack of jurisdiction.on appeal,the federal circuit concurred in the jurisdictional ruling,but vacated the dismissal and remanded to the court of federal claims for transfers of the lawsuits to the appropriate district courts.peanut farmers ass united states.the farmers in those cases then requested the mdl panel to transfer their claims to the eastern district of north carolina,pursuant to.the mdl panel agreed,and transferred these and other cases to the district court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.citing 
on march,and december,the district court certified several additional classes in the mdl cases the class certification orders entered with respect to the mdl cases tracked the court class certification ruling in the sj opinion in the north carolina classes of farmers whose insured peanut crops were located within the district in which their cases had originally been pending.see mdl order i at mdl order ii at.the court also ruled that its sj opinion,rendering the government liable on the farmers breach of contract claims,extended to each of the certified classes of farmers in the mdl cases.see mdl order i at mdl order ii at.
on march,after receiving recommendations from the farmers and the government,the district court entered its damages order,explaining the formula it would apply to the calculation of the farmers damages.the formula first provided for the calculation of the farmers hypothetical farm poundage quota and amounts.this initial calculation was a necessary starting point because there had been no farm poundage quota allocations made to individual peanut farms.the damages order called for these hypothetical farm poundage quota and amounts to be determined by multiplying each individual farmer production guarantee by the percentage of quota liability for to arrive at a quota amount.see damages order.the amount of lost quota production for each farmer was then multiplied by the difference between the rate for peanuts cents and the cent quota rate that had been announced prior to the farm bill.id.at after calculating the damage awards under this formula,the court,on december,entered final judgment for the farmers in the aggregate sum of approximately million.
the district court final judgment made its rulings appealable under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,ordering as follows 
p ursuant to rule b,more than one claim for relief has been presented and multiple parties are involved,the court hereby enters final judgment in favor of all plaintiffs and class members who presently have cases pending before this court as to the breach of contract claim.the court further finds that there is no just reason for delay.
the court thus determined that its judgment was final with respect to the breach of contract claims,and also found that there was no just reason for delay.the government filed its notice of appeal on february,and the farmers have.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.see sears,roebuck mackey.

the government contention that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to the farmers on their breach of contract claims is premised on two basic propositions that the court erred by concluding that the mpci policy obligated the insurers to indemnify the farmers at the cent quota rate in the absence of farm poundage quota allocations having been made to individual farms and that the court incorrectly determined that the government failure to allocate such farm poundage quotas breached the mpci policy,based on its conclusion that the enactment of the farm bill hindered the performance of the government statutory duty to allocate such quotas.the government also maintains that the court erroneously premised its sj opinion,in part,on the farmers alternative theory of detrimental reliance.as explained below,we agree with the government that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to the farmers on their breach of contract claims.
before turning to the government contentions of error,we must first ascertain the body of law that applies to our analysis of these contract issues.as an initial proposition,w hen the united states enters into contract relations,its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.united states winstar,d internal quotation marks omitted.and,as the federal circuit recently observed,i t is customary,where congress has not adopted a different standard,to apply to the construction of government contracts the principles of general contract law,which become federal common law.long island sav.bank,fsb united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the federal circuit further concluded that t he restatement of contracts reflects many of the contract principles of federal common law.see also mobil oil exploration producing,united states,d relying on restatement of contracts for principles of repudiation and restitution franconia assocs.united states,d applying principles of general contract law by relying in part on restatement second of contracts.both the district court and the parties in this litigation,through their reliance on the restatement of contracts and other general principles of contract law,have impliedly agreed that the contract principles of federal common law should govern this dispute.because neither the government nor the farmers contend that congress promulgated or mandated a different standard,we will apply such principles in our assessment of the breach of contract issues.battle seibels bruce ins,cir concluding that the law is well settled that federal common law alone governs the interpretation of insurance policies issued pursuant to the national flood insurance program.we now turn to the government contentions of error on the district court breach of contract rulings.
first,we agree with the government that the mpci policy did not create any contractual obligation for the insurers to indemnify the farmers for lost peanuts in at the cent quota rate.instead,the indemnity obligation at the quota rate was contingent on farm poundage quota allocations being made to individual peanut farms.absent such allocations,there was no obligation under the mpci policy for the farmers to be indemnified at the cent quota rate.put simply,to be indemnified at the cent rate,an insured farm had to be assigned a farm poundage quota by the fsa.because the fsa did not assign farm poundage quotas for the crop,the farmers were never insured at the cent quota rate,and their claims were properly indemnified at the cent rate.see studio frames,std.fire ins,cir applying federal common law to interpretation of federal insurance policy and determining that if the policy language in issue is clear and unambiguous,we apply it directly.
this interpretation is supported by the express terms of the mpci policy,which required each farmer to file an acreage report,detailing the farm peanut acreage and the effective poundage marketing quota,if any,that is applicable to the farm for the current crop year.mpci policy peanut provision emphasis added.the mpci policy provides that the effective poundage marketing quota,if any,for each unit is not to exceed the farm poundage quota provision that specifically contemplates the contingency of no quota allocations being made to an insured farm.id,emphasis added.as the government asserts,the mpci policy was applicable to all insured peanut farms,including those that had not previously been allocated any farm poundage quotas.thus,the mpci policy makes no promise to provide coverage and indemnification at the cent quota rate in the absence of the fsa allocation of poundage quotas to individual farms.
this point is further supported by the fact that,absent the farm poundage quota allocations,it would be impossible to insure the farmers at the cent quota rate.this is so because the mpci policy provides that t he maximum pounds that may be insured at the quota price election may not exceed the effective poundage marketing quota defined in turn as a quantity of peanuts not to exceed the marketing quota established by fsa for the farm serial number.mpci policy peanut provision.as a result,if the fsa farm poundage quota for an insured farm is zero,none of that farm peanut crop is insured at the cent quota rate.
the mpci policy indemnity formula also supports the interpretation that,absent farm poundage quota allocations,the insurers have no obligation to indemnify the farmers at the cent quota rate.as noted above,the policy indemnity formula provides that the value of insured peanuts must first be computed by determining an insured farm amounts of quota and peanuts by subtracting the effective poundage marketing quota from the production guarantee,and then multiplying these amounts by their respective price elections.thus,the mpci policy does not,absent the allocation of farm poundage quotas,authorize indemnification at the cent quota rate.see mpci policy peanut provision.this point is illustrated by the fact that the district court was unable to calculate the farmers damages at the cent quota rate without resorting to an extrinsic source,poundage quota amounts,in the formula provided by its damages order.see damages order.
the farmers,on the other hand,maintain that the government announcements,as well as the mpci policy,contain both express and implied promises that the farmers would be indemnified at the cent quota rate for what should have been their lost farm poundage quota peanuts,and that enactment of the farm bill and the government handling of their indemnity claims breached those promises.in particular,the farmers point to the mpci policy provision that coverage will not be reduced 
in addition to the price election or amount of insurance available on the contract change date,we may provide an additional price election or amount of insurance no later than days prior to the sales closing date these additional price elections will not be less than those available on the contract change date.
mpci basic policy e see also id.providing that any changes in policy provisions,including price elections,will be provided no later than the contract change date,except that price elections may be offered after that time in accordance with paragraph.as noted above,the farm bill specifically altered the price election although expressly for peanuts only,by providing that 
the price election shall be cents per pound and shall be used for all aspects of the policy relating to the calculations of premium,liability and indemnities.
farm bill c.put succinctly,under the farm bill,all peanuts were peanuts.the farmers,however,contend that the alteration to the price election for peanuts made by the farm bill was in fact a change to the price election for quota overall coverage and directly contravening the mpci policy peanut provisions.see mpci policy peanut provision providing that additional price elections will not be less than those available on the contract change date.because the price election of cents,as specified in the farm bill,actually raises the price election for peanuts,we disagree with the farmers on this point.this aspect of the farm bill thus does not constitute a breach of the mpci policy.
the farmers nevertheless contend that section c of the farm bill not only altered the price election,it did so after the date specified for such alterations in the mpci policy.even if the terms of the mpci policy were somehow violated when the farm bill raised the price election for peanuts after the policy deadlines,we would decline to award relief on that basis.put simply,the farmers can not demonstrate that the increase made by the farm bill to their indemnity for peanuts to cents,even if made after the change date specified in the policy,resulted in an injury to them.see,santana,levi strauss,cir concluding that,in order to maintain action for breach of contract,plaintiff must show that alleged breach caused injury,and finding no injury occurred when alleged breach benefited plaintiff.
the farmers primary contention,of course,is not that the farm bill raised the indemnity rate for peanuts,but that the government was able to avoid indemnifying them at the cent quota by enactment of the farm bill.although the mpci policy provides that additional price elections may be offered after the contract change date,the farmers contention that the farm bill replaced the price elections available under the mpci policy rather than offering additional ones is unpersuasive.in the absence of farm poundage quotas being allotted to individual farms,the farmers were unable to avail themselves of the cent quota rate,regardless of whether the farm bill replaced that rate or simply provided price elections in addition to it.
we are similarly unpersuaded by the farmers contention that the two usda announcements of december,and january,made express or implied warranties to them with respect to the farm poundage quotas for peanuts.although the usda announcements indicated that the national poundage quotas would remain the same as in the previous year,and that such quotas would be allocated to eligible farms in the future,the announcements explicitly warned the farmers that congress was considering a farm bill that would change the peanut price support program by eliminating poundage quotas.importantly,these announcements specified that,if the farm bill was enacted,the national poundage quotas for peanuts would be either altered or rescinded.
in these circumstances,we agree with the government contentions,and reject those of the farmers.although we have great sympathy for the peanut farmers of this country,our obligation is to rule on the basis of the factual underpinnings and the applicable legal principles.the mpci policy and the usda announcements neither expressly nor impliedly promised to indemnify the farmers at the cent quota rate,absent farm poundage quota allocations being made by the fsa for the crop year.the mpci policy thus did not,absent farm poundage quota allocations being made to individual farms,create a contractual obligation on the part of either the government or the insurers to indemnify the farmers for their peanut crop losses at the cent quota rate.see studio frames,std.fire ins,cir applying federal common law to interpretation of federal insurance policy and determining that if the policy language in issue is clear and unambiguous,we apply it directly.
our analysis of the farmers breach of contract claims does not end here,however.the district court,in part,premised its finding of a breach on the legal principle that,in the proper circumstances,a contract condition here,the allocation of farm poundage quotas may be excused if the promisor prevents or hinders the occurrence of the condition and it would have otherwise occurred.accordingly,although the court appears to have concluded that,under the terms of the mpci policy,the government was not obligated to indemnify the farmers at the cent quota rate,the court nevertheless found a breach by the government,concluding that it had prevented the fsa from allocating farm poundage quotas to individual farms for the crop year.in its ruling,the court relied for this conclusion on section of the restatement first of contracts,which provides 
if a promisor prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition,and the condition would have occurred except for such prevention or hindrance,the condition is excused,and the actual or threatened nonperformance of the return promise does not discharge the promisor duty,unless a the prevention or hindrance by the promisor is caused or justified by the conduct or pecuniary circumstances of the other party.
sj opinion citing restatement first of contracts as quoted in powers sims levin,cir winter,concurring and dissenting.based on this restatement provision,the court concluded that such a hindrance had occurred when the farm bill,enacted on may,eliminated the statutory directive to the fsa to allocate farm poundage quotas to individual farms for each crop year.id.at citing b a.the court further concluded that,as the fsa would have assigned the farm poundage quotas had the farm bill not prevented or hindered it from doing so,the requirements of are met.id.at.
although judge parker recognized years ago,in fuller brown,that i t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause of the failure of performance of a condition upon which his own liability depends,he can not take advantage of the failure,see,cir quoting williston on contracts,that legal principle is inapplicable to this appeal.the indemnification of the farmers under the mpci policy did not depend on fsa allocation of farm poundage quotas.the district court thus erred in excusing what it viewed as the condition of farm poundage allocations.a condition,as defined by the restatement second of contracts,is an event,not certain to occur,which must occur,unless its is excused,before performance under a contract becomes due.restatement second of contracts emphasis added see also williston on contracts ed.a condition precedent is either an act of a party that must be performed or a certain event that must happen before a contractual right accrues or contractual duty arises.moore.brown root,cir the prevention doctrine is a generally recognized principle of contract law according to which if a promisor prevents or hinders fulfillment of a condition to his performance,the condition may be waived or excused.emphasis added 
the only condition to the indemnification of the farmers under the mpci policy was the occurrence of a natural cause of covered loss.see mpci policy peanut provision providing coverage for loss caused by,inter alia,adverse weather conditions,fire,insects,plant disease,wildlife.when a covered loss occurs,the obligation of the insurer to indemnify under the mpci policy is triggered.there is,however,no policy provision that conditions such indemnification on whether farm poundage quotas are allocated to an individual farm for a particular crop year.instead,the farm poundage quota allocations simply play a role in the computation of the indemnification to be paid to the farmers for their covered losses.thus,the government is also correct on this under the mpci policy is not conditioned on the allocation of farm poundage quotas by the fsa.
importantly,our conclusion on this contention is supported by the fact that the farmers have already been indemnified for their crop losses under the mpci they were indemnified at the rate of cents,rather than at the cent quota rate they seek in this litigation.thus,the government did not hinder the occurrence of any condition t
