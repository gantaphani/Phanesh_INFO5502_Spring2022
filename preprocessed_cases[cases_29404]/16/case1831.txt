appellant,lexington insurance company lexington,challenges the district court summary judgment in favor of appellee,samedan oil corporation samedan.the district court concluded that samedan recovery against lexington under endorsements to liability policies issued to samedan contractor,pride offshore,pride,was not barred by the louisiana oilfield indemnity act loia,et.we agree with the district court that the loia does not invalidate samedan coverage because the record is uncontradicted that samedan paid the entire premium for that coverage.
charles rogers began this litigation when he filed a personal injury suit in state court in louisiana against samedan.samedan removed the suit to the federal district court based on diversity.several other parties were added thereafter.
when rogers was injured he was employed by pride and assigned to work aboard samedan platform located in east cameron block off the coast of louisiana.rogers employer,pride,was operating the drilling rig pursuant to a contract with samedan on the samedan platform.the parties settled rogers action before trial for of which samedan contributed and its commercial general liability carrier,commercial underwriters insurance company commercial underwriters,contributed.
upon settlement of the main demand,the only issues remaining before the district court were those relating to the third party demand asserted by samedan against lexington.in its demand,samedan sought recovery against lexington for settlement costs of together with attorneys fees and statutory penalties under.stats.and.
lexington is the liability insurer of rogers employer,pride.prior to roger accident,lexington issued a commercial general liability policy and an umbrella policy to pride,with liability limits of million dollars the lexington policies.special endorsements entitled louisiana statute coverage the lexington endorsements were later added to the lexington policies,naming samedan as an additional insured in the lexington policies the lexington endorsements were added before rogers accident.
lexington charged samedan two thousand dollars per year for the coverage provided by the lexington endorsements.these separate premiums were paid directly by samedan with no contribution from pride.
in august,following demand upon lexington for defense and indemnification,lexington assumed samedan defense of the roger suit.however,in november,after the louisiana first circuit court of appeal denied rehearing amoco prod.comp.lexington ins,lexington informed pride that it was withdrawing its defense and indemnity of samedan.see amoco prod.comp.lexington ins.cir.so d,writ denied,so d.
on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court determined that the loia did not preclude samedan from enforcing its rights under the lexington policies.after a trial on the remaining issues,the district court determined that lexington was liable to samedan for its attorney fees and settlement costs of.however,the court found that lexington withdrawal of samedan defense was not in bad faith,thus samedan was not entitled to penalties or damages under.stats.and.both parties have appealed.
lexington first argues that the lexington endorsements,naming samedan as an additional insured are not enforceable under the loia,et.as this issue was resolved on cross motions for summary judgement,we review it de novo.apani southwest,cir melton teachers ins.annuity ass of,cir.
loia was enacted to prevent an inequity foisted on certain contractors and their employees by the defense and indemnity provision contained in some agreements pertaining to wells for oil,gas or water,to the extent those provisions apply to death or bodily injury to persons.through loia,the louisiana legislature declared null and void and against public policy of the state of louisiana any provision in such agreements which require the defense or indemnification for death or bodily injury to persons caused by the negligence or fault of the indemnitee.
loia also applies to certain insurance coverage supplied by the contractor.subsection g provides that any provision in any agreement arising out of operations,services or activities covered by loia which requires additional named insured endorsements,or any other form of insurance protection which would frustrate or circumvent the provisions of loia shall be null and void and of no force and affect.
consistent with the express language of subsection g,courts generally hold that contractual provisions requiring the contractor to extend its insurance coverage to cover the principal acts of negligence or fault are void under the loia because these insurance arrangements frustrate the purpose of the act.see roberts energy dev,cir hodgen forest oil,cir davis mobil oil exploration producing southeast,cir babineaux mcbroom rig.service,cir amoco prod.company lexington ins,supra.however,in marcel placid oil,cir,this court recognized an exception to this rule.we held that,when the principal pays the entire cost of its own insurance coverage by securing an endorsement naming it as an insured in the contract or policy,the purposes of the loia are not frustrated,and the insurance coverage is valid and enforceable.
in marcel,placid oil company placid,the operator of an offshore platform,contracted with see,see to perform workover services on the platform.as part of the agreement,see agreed to procure insurance at placid expense indemnifying placid and naming placid as an additional insured.plaintiff,marcel,worked as a roustabout and was injured in a slip and fall on the platform.after being named as defendant,placid filed a third party complaint against see for failing to name placid as an additional insured under its insurance policy.the district court granted a summary judgment in favor of see,determining that the agreement violated loia,and placid appealed.
relying on patterson conoco,placid argued on appeal that see agreement to provide insurance indemnifying placid and identifying placid as a named insured did not violate loia.in patterson,the court found that loia did not render invalid a provision requiring the contractor to extend insurance coverage to the operator where the operator actually paid for the cost of the insurance.id.at.in marcel,we adopted the exception created by patterson and stated 
we now adopt the exception created in patterson as law of this circuit and find that it has potential application here.the loia is aimed at preventing the shifting of the economic burden of insurance coverage or liability onto an independent contractor.if the principal pays for its own liability coverage,however,no shifting occurs.we see no need to prevent such an arrangement in order to give effect to the loia.indeed,agreements such as the one in patterson may be economically desirable in situations where it is less expensive for the independent contractor to add the principal as an additional insured than for the principal to obtain its own insurance on a particular operation.marcel placid.
lexington asserts that the exception recognized in marcel the marcel exception has no application to this case.instead,lexington relies on a recent case decided by the louisiana first circuit court of appeal,also involving a lexington policy procured by pride.amoco prod.lexington ins,supra.in amoco,the court permitted lexington to invoke the provisions of loia to invalidate claims by amoco production company and related companies for coverage under two lexington policies.the louisiana first circuit court of appeal determined that the marcel exception had no application to the policies at issue in the lawsuit.
in its contract with amoco,pride agreed to defend and indemnify amoco for any and all liability exposure for losses arising out of pride operations under the contract,even those occasioned as a result of amoco own fault or negligence.the agreement also required pride to insure its contractual assumption of liability however,the agreement did not require pride to name amoco as an additional assured in pride liability policies.in october,three months after the accident giving rise to the underlying lawsuit,pride and amoco met to discuss having
