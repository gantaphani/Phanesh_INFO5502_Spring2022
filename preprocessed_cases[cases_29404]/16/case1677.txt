this case brings questions of our jurisdiction to review an order remanding the case to state court after its removal as a case that relates to an earlier arbitration proceeding.certain underwriters at lloyd,london and other insurers subscribing to reinsurance agreements and no.seek dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the appeal filed by warrantech corporation and joel san antonio collectively,appellants.appellants appeal the district court order remanding all unresolved issues back to state court the district court order granting underwriters partial summary judgment on appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses and the district court order dismissing with prejudice warrantech counterclaims 
this case arises out of the administration of consumer warranties and extended service plans on computers,printers,and related items sold by compusa,a national electronics retailer.compusa contracted with warrantech to administer the warranties on compusa consumer goods.the contract required warrantech to obtain insurance to cover the cost of paying warranty claims,which warrantech did with houston general insurance company,a nonparty to this litigation.houston general,in turn,reinsured a portion of the risk with underwriters.
after approximately one year,underwriters contended that warrantech was paying unauthorized claims and refused to reinsure houston general for any unauthorized amounts.houston general instituted arbitration proceedings to determine underwriters obligations,which took place under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards hereinafter,the new york convention after five weeks of hearings,the arbitration panel ordered underwriters to pay houston general million,and the order was confirmed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
on september,one month after the arbitral panel decision,underwriters filed the instant lawsuit against warrantech in texas state court,seeking to recoup as damages the reinsurance payments that underwriters was ordered to pay houston general warrantech filed counterclaims,asserting causes of action for fraud,unfair and deceptive insurance practices in violation of article of the texas insurance code and violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing after underwriters added san antonio to the litigation,the case was removed under with appellants asserting res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses based on the arbitration award to houston general.
underwriters moved to remand the matter to state court.in consideration of its jurisdiction,the district court,relying upon beiser weyler stated that its only task was to determine whether appellants affirmative defenses were facially frivolous.concluding that they were not,the district court denied underwriters motion to remand.in its order,the court supplied a caveat if the court later makes a summary ruling that the arbitration award does not provide a defense to any of underwriters claims,the court will then consider whether the action should be remanded to the state court.
subsequently,underwriters moved for partial summary judgment on appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses and on warrantech counterclaims.on august,the district court granted summary judgment for underwriters,concluding that the affirmative defenses were without merit and dismissing warrantech counterclaims with prejudice.after determining that there was no just reason for delay,the district court entered final judgment dismissing warrantech counterclaims that decision forms the basis of part of this appeal.
after its august order,the district court requested additional briefing on whether underwriters remaining claims should be remanded to state court given that the issues related to the arbitration award were no longer part of the lawsuit.after briefing,the district court granted underwriters motion to remand,concluding that appellants were not asserting any defense based on the arbitration award finding no policy reasons in support of exercising jurisdiction over this case and concluding that there were no other grounds for federal jurisdiction,the district court remanded all unresolved claims and causes of action to state court 
we must first decide what we can decide.prior to remanding all unresolved matters to the texas state court,the district court granted underwriters motion for partial summary judgment on appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses and warrantech counterclaims.appellants seek merits review of each of the district court orders.underwriters seeks dismissal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
our analysis of the district court remand order begins with d an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.the supreme court instructs that d must be read in pari materia with c which provides two bases for remanding cases to state court a defect in the removal procedure which must be made within days of the date of removal and the lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
it is plain that with any remand based on the enumerated grounds of c,the clear language of d is an absolute bar to appellate review since there is no contention,here,of a defect in the removal procedure,we only lack appellate jurisdiction to review the district court remand order if it is based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
our analysis is complicated by the supreme court recognition,in a narrow category of cases that a district court can remand a case to state court on the basis of a non c ground in university cohill,the supreme court held that where all federal claims have been eliminated a federal district court has discretion to remand to state court a removed case involving pendent claims upon a proper determination that retaining jurisdiction over the case would be inappropriate.to the court,under limited circumstances a remand may best promote the values of economy,convenience,fairness,and comity.thus,it is also plain that with any remand based on the policy considerations offered in,d is no longer a bar to appellate review should we find jurisdiction to review the district court remand order,our review is for an abuse of discretion 
so framed,we must determine whether the district court order remanding all unresolved matters to state court was based on jurisdictional grounds,c,which bars appellate review,or nonstatutory grounds,which allows for discretionary review.our inquiry is guided by a clear statement requirement for a remand order to be reviewable on appeal,the district court must clearly and affirmatively state a non c ground for remand our requirement allows a quick inquiry into jurisdiction,preventing delay through protracted litigation of jurisdictional issues and it avoids having this court decipher the of a district court remand order to determine whether it was jurisdictional or not.when the matter is remanded to state court often following removal from state court initially,the district court has determined that the plaintiff choice of forum should stand.our requirement best serves this policy.
moreover,our requirement focuses our inquiry away from the merits of the district court decision.section d precludes examination of the merits of the district court actions we only must determine what the district court perceived it was doing,as no matter how erroneous,a remand order based on a c ground precludes review on appeal.a contrary requiring a thorough and exhaustive examination of the district court reasons for tainting the limited,mandated by d with a,a process that,as noted,would only lead to a lengthier appeals process.although we are not in search of magic words,our requirement carefully delimitates our expanding it beyond statutorily imposed limits,nor eschewing it when matters are appropriately before us.
nothing in the supreme court recent decision in kircher putnam funds trust requires us to back away from our clear statement requirement.there,the court held that d ban on appellate review of remand orders applied to cases removed under the securities litigation uniform standards act of the court had no reason to consider a clear statement requirement,as the district court plainly indicated that it remanded the case for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
we recognize that there is some disagreement among the circuits regarding the methodology for reviewing remand orders.we apply a requirement others do not,opting instead to analyze a remand order for what the district court did rather than what the district court said it did.the supreme court recognized but did not resolve this dispute in kircher.justice scalia would stop with the district court words,forgoing any examination of the merits the majority passed on the issue,noting that the result was the same under either approach.as the solicitor general recently recognized,this type of methodological dispute may have more impact on how district court judges draft remand orders than on the rights of the parties.the validity of our methods for reviewing remand orders is not before us,so we need say no more.
with these principles in mind,our analysis requires examination of the text of the district court remand order after concluding that appellants were not asserting any defense to underwriters claims based on the arbitration award,the court made passing reference to policy considerations 
no policy evidenced by the federal arbitration statutes would be advanced in the slightest by the exercise by this court of subject matter jurisdiction over the issues that remain to be resolved in this case there is no reason from a policy standpoint for this court to further entertain jurisdiction over this case,bearing in mind that there is no claim of arbitrability,and that the only issues which implicate the arbitration award itself have been summarily removed from the case 
appellants contend that the order reference to policy indicates that the remand was based,not on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,but on the efficiency and economy considerations guiding courts under.underwriters point to subsequent language in the remand order,which,they contend,indicates the remand was based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.specifically,
n ow that the arbitration award issues have been removed from this case by a summary ruling,and there being no other grounds for federal jurisdiction in this case,the case should be remanded to the state court.
therefore,t he court orders that all unresolved claims and causes of action in the action be,and are hereby,remanded to the state court from which this action was removed 
with only this language before us,we conclude that the district court did not clearly and affirmatively state a non c ground for remand.to be sure,appellants contentions are not without merit,as this presents a close case both parties can point to language in the remand order supporting their position.appellants argument falls short however,following a closer examination of the district court language and upon application of the requirement embraced by this court.
the district court first reference to policy is to that evidenced by the federal arbitration acts,and not the concerns animating discretionary remands the second reference to policy considerations is essentially a single sentence,with no citation to,thermtron products,or any of the efficiency and economy factors guiding courts in making discretionary remands.any conclusion that this was a discretionary remand,on the basis of references to policy,is militated by the subsequent discussion by the district court suggesting that it perceived itself to lack subject matter jurisdiction.as the district court concluded its remand order,it stated that there are no other grounds for jurisdiction,language we read to mean the court perceived it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.moreover,the court also states that the case should a derivative of the imperative shall although must might have been a more emphatic indication of a jurisdictional remand,so too would may be more probative of a discretionary remand.as such,we can not say that the district court clearly and affirmatively stated a non c ground for remand 
unclear remand orders are not a new thing in this court,even given our strict adherence to a requirement.we have confronted situations before in which a district court remand order offered language supporting both a statutory and a nonstatutory remand.in bogle phillips petroleum,various plaintiffs injured in a explosion brought claims against phillips for their injuries as well as a claim for wrongfully denied medical benefits,which phillips used to remove the case alleging that the employee retirement income security act preempted the litigation the district court ruled on the asserted defense,finding no preemption,and granted plaintiffs motion to remand,stating that t his case does not contain a federal claim and applying the discretionary factors from on appeal,we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that t he district court discussion of the factors,although improper surplusage,did not taint its ultimate conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court reliance on beiser weyler does not alter our conclusion.reading relates to very broadly beiser suggests that in cases removed under,the district court,as here,should initially deny remand as long as the defendant asserted,defenses are not facially frivolous.that is precisely what the district court did here,initially denying underwriters motion to remand,and no contention is raised on appeal that this decision was error we do not depart from beiser insistence on easy removal of causes whenever a defendant can assert a nonfrivolous connection to an arbitration award under the new york convention.
moreover,nothing in beiser alters our analysis of the district court order.the mere citation of dicta in beiser suggesting a discretionary remand can not serve to satisfy our requirement and nothing in beiser suggests that we should not apply our requirement within the context of removals.application of our requirement is consistent with the plain text of,which provides that,although allowing removal on the basis of a federal defense presented in the petition for removal,t he procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply.this procedure for removal incorporates d absolute bar to appellate review as well as our insistence that a district court clearly and affirmatively state a non c ground for remand.as we find no clear statement in this case,our appellate jurisdiction is precluded by d 
although we lack jurisdiction to review the district court remand order,we still must consider whether we can review the district court grant of partial summary judgment to underwriters on appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel defenses.district court determinations accompanying remand orders are reviewable despite d if they meet the requirements of city of waco,texas united states fidelity guaranty under city of waco,we can review a decision of the district court if the decision is separable from the remand order and independently reviewable under the collateral order doctrine a decision is separable if the decision preceded the remand order in logic and in fact such that it was made by the district court while it had control of the case and the decision is conclusive that is,functionally unreviewable in state courts.
our decision in linton airbus industrie is illustrative there,prior to remanding the matter to state court,the district court determined that the defendants did not qualify for foreign sovereign immunity,the basis for removal we held that i n light of the district court ultimate conclusion that the entire case had to be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court foreign sovereign immunity determination could be deemed a jurisdictional finding under the facts of this case and,as such,could be reviewed by the state court upon remand.thus,determinations made in the process of remanding a case for lack of jurisdiction are jurisdictional findings that can be revisited by the state court upon remand 
here,the district court res judicata and collateral estoppel did not provide appellants a defense to underwriters made in the process of remanding the case for lack of jurisdiction.we see no difference between the rejection,in linton,of the defendants foreign sovereign immunity basis for the rejection,here,of appellants affirmative,the basis for removal.we conclude that the district court order rejecting appellants affirmative defenses is not conclusive under city of waco thus,we are unable to review the merits of the district court decision.
finally,we turn to the most troubling aspect of this,what to do with the district court order dismissing with prejudice warrantech counterclaims.unlike resolution of appellants affirmative defenses,we can not say that the decision to dismiss the counterclaims was a jurisdictional finding,not conclusive under city of waco,and therefore not binding on the state court upon remand.we also decline to hold that the decision is conclusive under city of waco,as warrantech asserts and as underwriters appears to concede rather,the prudent resolution of warrantech counterclaims requires a,a reexamination of what the district court should have done upon concluding that appellants affirmative defenses were meritless.we conclude that the district court,upon resolving the merits of the affirmative defenses,abused its discretion in continuing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over warrantech counterclaims 
warrantech counterclaims rode into federal court on the coattails of appellants assertion that appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses relate d to the claims asserted by underwriters as we have noted,this is proper,and it would be within the district court prerogative to adjudicate them on the merits,but only if the district court properly exercised its discretion under,the statute granting the federal courts supplemental jurisdiction over related claims after concluding that appellants affirmative defenses lacked merit,the following claims remained in the case underwriters claims against warrantech and san antonio and warrantech counterclaims against underwriters.it is at this moment in time that we must examine the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.
our inquiry starts with the mandatory nature of a,which provides that a district court shall have supplemental jurisdiction over claims so related to claims within the court original jurisdiction yet a command is moderated by the factors provided in c,which allow a district court to decline supplemental jurisdiction under certain circumstances in consideration of these factors,we have stated that it is our general rule that courts should decline supplemental jurisdiction when all federal claims are dismissed or otherwise eliminated from a case 
this is such a case.here,all claims with even a tenable connection to federal jurisdiction were dismissed very early in the litigation.as the supreme court noted in united mine workers gibbs,i f the federal claims are dismissed before trial,even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense,the state claims should be dismissed as well.we echoed a similar thought in the context of removal under in beiser 
under the federal issue in cases will often be resolved early enough to permit remand to the state court for a decision on the merits if the district court decides that the arbitration clause does not provide a defense,and no other grounds for federal jurisdiction exist,the court must ordinarily remand the case back to state court 
thus,the absence of any claims with any connection to federal law at such an early point in the litigation suggests that the district court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over warrantech counterclaims 
moreover,warrantech counterclaims have little,if any,relation to the arbitration award.our task is to compare the federal basis for jurisdiction here,the asserted affirmative defenses stemming from the arbitration award against the dismissed claims here,warrantech counterclaims arising from underwriters alleged discovery conduct and failure to voluntarily make payment of warranty claims there is little factual overlap between these two claims.appellants asserted their affirmative defenses in response to underwriters underlying claims.res judicata and collateral estoppel are judicial economy devices,seeking to prevent relitigation of issues previously adjudicated warrantech counterclaims arise out of separate and independent actions of misconduct and failure to pay insurance claims.in short,we do not see a sufficient connection between the two claims to warrant the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over warrantech counterclaims.
in sum,our inquiry into what we can decide leaves us without jurisdiction to consider the merits of any of the district court orders.first,we lack jurisdiction to review the district court remand order as the district court did not clearly and affirmatively state a non c ground for remand.second,the district court order dismissing appellants res judicata and collateral estoppel affirmative defenses was a jurisdictional finding,not binding on the state court following remand.finally,the district court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over warrantech counterclaims.accordingly,the district court order dismissing with prejudice warrantech counterclaims must be vacated,and the remainder of appellants appeal must be dismissed.
appellee motion to dismiss appeal for lack of jurisdiction is granted.
i dissent from the majority initial holding that the district court remand order is not reviewable under d.because this case involves the discretionary remand of supplemental claims,the prohibition on appellate review does not apply.
the law in this area is clear.after a district court remands a case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,d bars a federal appellate court from reviewing the remand ruling no matter how erroneous.dahiya talmidge int l,cir quoting arnold state farm fire cas,cir.if the remand order is not based on a lack of jurisdiction but is,rather,discretionary,the remand order is reviewable.bogle phillips petroleum,cir see cohill,d a district court has discretion to remand to state court a removed case involving pendent claims upon a proper determination that retaining jurisdiction over the case would be inappropriate.in determining whether a remand is discretionary or jurisdictional,the scope of our inquiry is limited to determining the basis for the district court remand order,in other words,what the district court perceived it was doing.see bogle,at in determining whether an order is appealable,the threshold inquiry is whether the district court based its remand on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.mcdermott int l,lloyds underwriters of london,cir t he availability and means of appellate review for a district court remand order depend entirely on the court reason for issuing the order.
asserting a newly tailored requirement,the majority concludes that the district court did not clearly and affirmatively state a non c ground for remand and holds that the court is without jurisdiction on appeal under d although it acknowledges that the remand order bears the hallmarks of a discretionary remand and although it claims to not require magic words to satisfy its requirement,the majority nevertheless finds the remand order to be unclear.like the majority,i decline to opine as to the validity of its requirement because,even under this standard,the district court remand order unmistakably states a discretionary,non c ground for remand.
in its analysis,the majority pauses only momentarily to discuss and cast aside our treatment of a removal in beiser weyler,cir.yet,beiser is the only case relied upon by the district court to determine its jurisdiction upon and the only case it used to state and explain the basis for its subsequent remand in so doing,the district court could not have been clearer it remanded based upon our guidance in beiser.
because the only basis for remand provided by the district court is taken from beiser,our analysis of whether the remand stated a non c ground for remand must begin and end with understanding what that case teaches.a cornerstone to our reasoning in beiser was the determination that removal is proper under on the basis of a federal defense presented in the petition for removal.a s long as the defendant claims in its petition that an arbitration clause provides a defense,the district court will have jurisdiction to decide the merits of that claim.beiser,at.where the special circumstances presented by a removal are at issue,beiser contemplates a later merit inquiry into arbitrability and,if the district court decides that the arbitration clause does not provide a defense,a discretionary remand of supplemental claims.see id.at citing authority for the proposition that a district court has discretion to remand.beiser does not intend a remand based upon a post facto determination that it lacked jurisdiction ab initio but,rather,a discretionary determination that its continued exercise of jurisdiction is no longer prudent after federal issues have been removed from the case.id.at.
the district court understood and scrupulously adhered to our guidance in beiser when it exercised jurisdiction and subsequently remanded this case.quoting pertinent parts of that opinion,it initially determined that jurisdiction was proper based upon purported ties between warrantech res judicata and collateral estoppel defenses and the arbitration proceeding.finding no ties to the arbitration award after its ruling on summary judgment,however,the district court remanded,c onsistent with the expectations of the fifth circuit,because did not require retention where the only issues which implicate d the arbitration award itself ha d been summarily removed from the case.remand order at.in so doing,the district court spoke plainly it was exercising its discretion to remand supplemental claims after determining that the defenses were without merit.such a remand order is reviewable.
the majority acknowledges that the district court applied beiser and that beiser calls for a discretionary remand in these circumstances.nonetheless,it asserts that the mere citation of dicta in beiser can not satisfy our requirement the majority reasoning here is puzzling.dicta is,of course,not binding.but in stating the basis for its remand,there is no principle in law or reason that prevents a district court from interpreting and using our case law to explain itself.in this case,the district court used beiser dicta to clearly and affirmatively state the basis for its remand.no clearer statement was required.
if there remained any doubt,the district court remand order contains additional convincing indicia of a discretionary,non c ground for remand.first,the district court examined prudential reasons that militate against the exercise of jurisdiction in its remand order,stating no policy evidenced by the federal arbitration statutes would be advanced in the slightest by the exercise by this court of subject matter jurisdiction over issues that remain to be resolved in this case there is no reason from a policy standpoint for this court to further entertain jurisdiction over this case remand order at such a proffer of prudential reasons would be wholly unnecessary if the district court felt that it lacked jurisdiction under c second,and most tellingly,the district court adjudicated the counterclaims brought by warrantech in its summary judgment order.the court could only properly do so if it perceived that it had supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to and exercised such jurisdiction pursuant to c,which gives a federal court the ability to determine all issues in a removed case,including claims.the district court could not have determined those claims unless it believed that it had original jurisdiction in the first instance based on federal law.significantly,our case law establishes that where there is an initial determination of jurisdiction,as is evident here,a subsequent remand is not based on a lack of jurisdiction.in bogle phillips petroleum,we stated 
the critical distinction for determining appealability is the presence of federal subject matter jurisdiction prior to the order of remand.in a section c remand for lack of jurisdiction,federal jurisdiction never existed,and in a c remand,federal jurisdiction did exist at some point in the litigation,but the federal claims were either settled or dismissed.
bogle,at.here,the district court initially rejected a motion to remand because,under beiser,the district court will have jurisdiction under over just about any suit in which a defendant contends that an arbitration clause provides a defense.order denying remand at quoting beiser,at.only after the district court had ruled on a motion for summary judgment and found the defenses without merit did it remand the case to state court.under the reasoning in bogle,this is a c remand,because federal jurisdiction did exist at some point in the litigation,but the federal claims were either settled or dismissed.bogle,at 
there is no need to decipher the of the district court remand order because the district court clearly and affirmatively remanded for discretionary reasons based upon the guidance we provided in beiser.accordingly,the restriction on appellate review in d does not apply.i would review the district court remand order,as well as its decision granting partial summary judgment in favor of underwriters.
both warrantech and san antonio assert affirmative defenses based on the arbitration award.only warrantech asserts various counterclaims against underwriters.as such,when discussing the affirmative defenses,we refer to appellants and when discussing the counterclaims,we refer only to warrantech.
