a separate section delineates what is not covered by the limited warranty or michelin pax system assurance plan.among other things,the warranty does not apply to tires and support rings which become unrepairable unserviceable due to u neven or rapid wear which results from mechanical irregularity in the vehicle such as wheel misalignment a measured tread difference of nds of an inch or more across the tread of the same tire.

robinson used the car for personal and family purposes and had the tires rotated by the honda dealer at the recommended maintenance intervals.after months and less than miles of use,robinson noticed what he characterized as excessive wear on the tires,particularly on the outside edge of the tread and sidewall.upon going to a local tire shop to purchase new tires,robinson was informed that only michelin pax system tires would fit on his minivan and that these tires could only be installed by his honda dealer.when robinson went to his honda dealer,he was advised that he needed four new tires at a cost of over.the dealer stated that the tires were not warranted by honda and offered to put robinson in contact with michelin.robinson spoke with a michelin representative who offered to pay of the replacement cost of the tires.this was calculated based on the amount of tread remaining on the tires.
robinson refused this offer and shortly thereafter filed suit against honda and michelin in the circuit court for montgomery county,maryland in november.the complaint alleged four counts,all of which were asserted against both defendants i breach of express warranty,ii breach of implied warranty,iii declaratory judgment,and iv consumer fraud.count iii,seeking a declaratory judgment,asked the court to construe the terms of the parties warranties.robinson purported to act for a class of similarly situated honda odyssey owners whose vehicles were also equipped with the pax system tires

the standard of review for dismissal pursuant to rule b is de novo.schatz rosenberg,cir citation omitted.this court will construe factual allegations in the party favor and will treat them as true,but the court is not bound by the complaint legal conclusions.id.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,the facts alleged must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level and must provide enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.
although the express warranties of honda and michelin were not attached to robinson complaint this court may consider them when reviewing the motion to dismiss because the warranties were integral to and explicitly relied on in the complaint and because robinson agrees that the warranties provided are authentic.see phillips lci int l,cir.these warranties were also relied upon by the district court in rendering its decision.
