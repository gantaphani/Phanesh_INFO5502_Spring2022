relying on the federal arbitration act faa,bmo harris sought to enforce an arbitration agreement for the loan at issue,which was entered into by dillon and the lender,great plains lending,llc great plains.the district court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under this court opinion in hayes delbert services,cir,and denied bmo harris motion to compel arbitration.bmo harris appeals from the district court order.upon our review,we hold that the arbitration agreement between dillon and great plains is unenforceable,and we affirm the district court order denying bmo harris motion.
james dillon is a resident of north carolina.in december,dillon applied for and received a payday loan through the website of great plains,a lender wholly owned by the tribe of indians.although north carolina usury law generally prohibits interest rates in excess of,stat,great plains has no physical presence in north carolina and charged an interest rate of for dillon loan.dillon authorized great plains to deposit and withdraw funds in dillon bank account through the automated clearing house network ach network,a transaction processing system that facilitates electronic transfer of funds between financial institutions,usually on behalf of account holders.
in order to complete the loan transaction,dillon electronically signed a contract the great plains agreement that contained terms governing the loan the underlying loan agreement and an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration the arbitration agreement.the great plains agreement included choice of law provisions both in the underlying loan agreement and in the arbitration agreement.these choice of law provisions required the application of tribal law and disclaimed the application of state or federal law.for example,the great plains agreement by its terms was subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the tribe of indians,a federally recognized indian tribe,and provided that no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this agreement,its enforcement or interpretation.
similarly,the arbitration agreement within the great plains agreement provided that any dispute will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the law of the tribe of indians,and instructed the arbitrator to apply the laws of the tribe of indians.for borrowers who opt out of arbitration within days of receiving the loan,any disputes shall nonetheless be governed under the laws of the tribe of indians and must be brought within the court system thereof.
immediately below the arbitration agreement,another choice of law provision in the great plains agreement provided that t his agreement and the agreement to arbitrate are governed by the laws of the tribe,and n either this agreement nor the lender is subject to the laws of any state of the united states.the great plains agreement signature page also required that dillon agree to the following term i further understand,acknowledge and agree that this loan is governed by the laws of the tribe of indians and is not subject to the provisions or protections of the laws of my home state or any other state.
dillon later filed a putative class action complaint in the district court,claiming that great plains and other tribal payday lenders had issued numerous unlawful loans.instead of directly suing the tribal payday lenders,including great plains,for violating state usury laws,dillon sued the financial institutions that facilitated these payday lending transactions over the ach network.dillon alleged that the ach network was an enterprise,and that several of its members,including bmo harris,conducted and participated in the collection of unlawful debts in violation of the federal rico act 
in the district court,bmo harris sought to compel arbitration pursuant to the great plains agreement see dillon bmo harris bank,cir.while the merits of bmo harris motion to compel arbitration were pending in the district court,this court decided hayes delbert services,cir.in hayes,we reviewed a loan agreement between a consumer and western sky financial,llc western sky,a payday lender organized under the laws of the cheyenne river sioux tribe.id.at.the loan agreement at issue in that case the western sky agreement contained an arbitration clause that we held was unenforceable as being in violation of public policy.id.at.
after we issued our opinion in hayes,the district court evaluated the language of the great plains agreement in light of the hayes decision.the district court concluded that the great plains agreement is like the contract in hayes and denies the applicability of all federal and state law.accordingly,the district court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable,and denied bmo harris renewed motion to compel arbitration.bmo harris appeals from the district court order denying the requested relief.
the faa grants this court jurisdiction to review a district court order denying a motion to compel arbitration.see also dillon,at.we review de novo the enforceability of an arbitration provision,and apply a strong federal policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.hayes,at quoting dean witter reynolds,byrd.
under the faa,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.courts therefore must enforce arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts.mobility llc concepcion,internal citations omitted.the faa preserves state law contract defenses unless such defenses rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate and are applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.
consistent with these contract principles,the supreme court has recognized that arbitration agreements that operate as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies are not enforceable because they are in violation of public policy.see mitsubishi motors soler,see also am.express italian colors,penn plaza llc pyett,gilmer lane.under this prospective waiver doctrine,courts will not enforce an arbitration agreement if doing so would prevent a litigant from vindicating federal substantive statutory rights.see am.express,at penn plaza,at gilmer,at.
a foreign choice of law provision,of itself,will not trigger application of the prospective waiver doctrine.see mitsubishi,at.instead,a court first must examine whether,as a matter of law,the and clauses operate in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.id.when there is uncertainty whether the foreign choice of law would preclude otherwise applicable federal substantive statutory remedies,the arbitrator should determine in the first instance whether the choice of law provision would deprive a party of those remedies.see vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,aggarao mol ship mgmt,cir.in such a case,the prospective waiver issue would not become ripe for final determination until the federal court is asked to enforce the arbitrator decision.vimar,at aggarao,at.
in hayes,we applied the prospective waiver doctrine to the western sky agreement governing another internet payday loan.there,we examined a choice of law provision that disclaimed the application of any law other than the law of the cheyenne river sioux tribe of indians to this agreement.id.at.we observed that this language almost surreptitiously waives a potential claimant federal rights through the guise of a choice of law clause and flatly and categorically renounce s the authority of the federal statutes.id.we held that such language took the plainly forbidden step of prospectively waiving federal substantive rights.id.we therefore conclud
