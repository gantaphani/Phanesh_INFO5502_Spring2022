sphere drake insurance plc hereinafter sphere and commercial underwriters insurance company hereinafter commercial collectively hereinafter appellants appeal the dallas federal district court ruling that they had a duty to defend harken exploration company hereinafter harken in harken underlying federal and state lawsuits,the award of harken defense costs for the underlying lawsuits,and the use of a interest rate to calculate prejudgment interest.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background.
harken is an oil and gas exploration and production company.on december,harken purchased an oil and gas lease hereinafter lease that covered big creek ranch hereinafter ranch from momentum operating company.thereafter,harken commenced oil and gas operations on the ranch.the rice family living trust hereinafter trust owns the ranch.rice and karen rice hereinafter rices are the trust trustees.
on october,the rices,on behalf of the trust,sued harken in amarillo federal district court hereinafter amarillo court alleging that harken polluted the ranch hereinafter federal lawsuit.the rices asserted causes of action for violation of the oil pollution act breach of the lease,breach of the pipeline easement,negligence,including negligent discharge of saltwater,negligence per se,nuisance,trespass,and equitable relief.
harken notified the appellants of the claims filed against it and asked the appellants to defend it in the federal lawsuit.harken carried two separate,successive commercial general liability policies one issued by each of appellants.the policy sphere issued insured harken from october,through october,hereinafter sphere policy.the policy commercial issued insured harken from october,through october,hereinafter commercial policy collectively hereinafter policies.the appellants denied harken request and refused to defend it in the federal lawsuit.
harken filed a declaratory judgment action in state court to determine whether the appellants had a duty to defend it in the federal lawsuit.the appellants removed this action to the dallas federal district court hereinafter dallas court based on diversity.the three parties,harken,sphere,and commercial,each filed motions for partial summary judgment.before the dallas court ruled on the motions for summary judgment,the amarillo court dismissed the rices oil pollution act claims and the remaining supplemental state law claims for want of jurisdiction in response to the dismissal,the rices sued harken in state court asserting the same causes of action,minus the oil pollution act claim hereinafter state lawsuit.harken notified the appellants of the state lawsuit and asked them to defend it in that lawsuit.the appellants refused.on february,the dallas court granted partial summary judgment in favor of harken.
at this point,harken had not expressly amended its pleading or its motion for summary judgment to include the state lawsuit.in its motion for entry of judgment,harken presented the dallas court with the state lawsuit original petition and asked the court to enter a judgment that the appellants had a duty to defend it in both the federal lawsuit and the state lawsuit collectively hereinafter lawsuits.the appellants responded and presented evidence in opposition.on april,the dallas court entered its final judgment.the dallas court decided that the appellants had a duty to defend harken in the lawsuits and that by failing to do so breached the policies.the dallas court awarded harken its defense costs in the lawsuits attorneys fees and court costs,prejudgment interest at,and later,attorneys fees and expenses in this case.
discussion.
the appellants appeal the dallas court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of harken.they contend that they do not owe harken a duty to defend because there was not an occurrence as defined by the policies the saline clause only obligates the appellants to indemnify harken,not defend it and the property damage alleged did not occur during the policies periods.the appellants,further,contend that the dallas court erred when it awarded harken the lawsuits defense costs and used a interest rate to calculate prejudgment interest.
the appellants have a duty to defend harken.

the appellants contend that the dallas court erred when it held that the appellants have a duty to defend harken.under texas law,an insurer duty to defend is usually determined solely from the allegations in the most recent petition and the language of the insurance policy union fire ins.of pittsburgh,merch.fast motor lines.the insured bears the initial burden of showing that the claim against her is potentially within the insurance policy scope of coverage.employers casualty block.if the insurer relies on the policy exclusions to deny coverage,the burden shifts to the insurer to prove the exclusion applies.federated mut.ins,at,citing guaranty ins.vic,cir,citing telepak united services auto.ass,antonio,writ denied.if the insurer is successful,the burden shifts back to the insured to show that an exception to the exclusion brings the claim against her potentially within the scope of coverage under the insurance policy.federated mut.ins,at,citing guaranty ins,at,citing telepak,at.
the general rule is that the insurer is obligated to defend its insured if there is,potentially,a case under the complaint within the coverage of the policy.merch.fast motor lines,at.if there is a doubt as to whether or not the factual allegations of a complaint against the insured state a cause of action within the coverage of a liability policy sufficient to compel the insurer to defend the action,such doubt will be resolved in the insured favor.id.
the rices alleged an occurrence.
the parties agree that initially under the policies the appellants have a duty to defend harken against a suit alleging damages caused by an occurrence.the first step in determining whether the appellants have a duty to defend harken against the lawsuit is to determine whether the rices alleged an occurrence.
the policies define occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.the policies,however,do not define accident.thus,we must give accident its plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning.see western reserve life ins.meadows,i t is law in this state that contracts of insurance in their construction are governed by the same rules as other contracts,and that terms used in them are to be given their plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning unless the instrument itself shows the them to have been used in a technical or different sense.giving war its plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning gonzalez,at giving bodily injury,sickness,disease,death,and including their plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning.
the texas supreme court has not articulated a hard and fast rule for when an accident occurs.see ins.of texas lindsey,a n injury caused by voluntary and intentional conduct is not an accident just because the result or injury may have been unexpected,unforeseen,and unintended although,the mere fact that an actor intended to engage in the conduct that gave rise to the injury does not mean that the injury was not accidental.it is reasonably clear that an accident has two elements an action and that action is,the resulting damage.see id.there are also two factors that influence both elements a an intent or design factor and b an expectability or foreseeability factor see id.
the texas supreme court has told us that there is not an accident when the action is intentionally taken and performed in such a manner that it is an intentional tort,regardless of whether the effect was unintended or unexpected.see argonaut southwest ins.maupin,finding that there was not an accident when the action was a trespass,the removal of soil from the wrong piece of real property,and the effect was the unintended and unexpected resulting hole in the wrong piece of real property federated mut.ins,grapevine excavation,cir discussing maupin.we also know,however,that there is an accident when the action is intentionally taken,but is performed negligently,and the effect is not what would have been intended or expected had the action been performed.see trinity universal ins.cowan,accident includes the negligent acts of the insured causing damage which is undesigned and unexpected.massachusetts bonding ins.orkin exterminating,finding there was an accident when the action,the deliberate fumigation of a rice mill was performed negligently,and the effect was neither the intended nor the expected result had the fumigation been performed federated mut.ins,at finding there was an accident when the action,the deliberate instillation of parking lot fill material was performed negligently,and the effect was neither the intended nor the expected result had the instillation been performed.in other words,if the act is deliberately taken,performed negligently,and the effect is not the intended or expected result had the deliberate act been performed,there is an accident.
the rices allege that harken operated an oil facility on the ranch that various lines,tanks,and wells have ruptured,leaked,and overflowed releasing pollutants,including saline substances,and continue to do so that the pollutants contaminated the ranch water,killed their cattle,destroyed vegetation,and generally damaged the ranch and continue to do so that harken negligently,carelessly,and wrongfully polluted the ranch when it knew or should have known that such actions would cause damage and that harken acted and is acting maliciously with subjective and actual awareness that its actions would cause property damage applying the rices factual allegations to what the texas supreme court has told us about accidents,we hold that the rices alleged an accident.the operation of the oil facilities is the action deliberately taken,but alleged to have been performed negligently.the contaminated water,dead cattle,caused by the pollutants,including saline substances,are the unintended and unexpected effects of the operation of an oil facility.
the appellants contend that the effect,the contaminated water,dead cattle,is not unexpected because the contaminated water,dead cattle,are the natural and probable consequences of operating an oil facility.we disagree.the appellants offer no authority for the proposition that contaminated water,dead cattle,destroyed vegetation,and generally damaged land are the natural and probable consequences of operating an oil facility,nor have we found any.the appellants argue that the rices should have expected the contaminated water,dead cattle,because the rices alleged that the act of contaminating the water,killing the cattle,was is,the negligent performance of the deliberate action was continuing.we disagree.the policies expressly state that property example,contaminated water,dead cattle,can be caused by the continuous or repeated exposure to a condition.moreover,according to the texas supreme court we are supposed to focus on whether the effect is intended or expected not whether the negligent performance is intended or expected.see cowan,at orkin exterminating,at.thus,whether the rices should have expected the negligent operation of the oil facility because it is continuing is irrelevant,if the deliberate operation of the oil facility,the act,is performed negligently and the effect,the resulting property damage,is not the intended or expected result of operating an oil facility.
the appellant,further,assert that the rices failed to allege an occurrence because harken conduct can not,at the same time,be both negligent and malicious or negligent and knowing.the appellants argue that the factual allegations that charged malicious or knowing actions in effect transformed the factual allegations that charge negligent actions into malicious or knowing actions because the rices did not plead malice or knowledge in the alternative.the fact that the rices plead negligent,malicious,and knowing actions does not in and of itself transform the negligent actions into malicious or knowing actions,and there is nothing in the factual allegations to suggest that harken performance was not negligent.if an insurer has a duty to defend any portion of a suit,the insurer must defend the entire suit.green tree,at.thus,the appellants must defend harken against the entire suit including causes of action that would not alone trigger the duty to defend,regardless whether the complaint is pled in the alternative or not because the rices factual allegations of negligence are sufficient to trigger the duty to defend.see paul ins.texas of,pet.denied a lthough the plaintiffs also allege gross negligence and intentional torts,this is not controlling because we must focus on the facts alleged,not the legal theories pleaded that coverage may not be available for some causes of action pleaded does not relieve paul of its duty to defend.
the rices alleged that the release of the pollutants was sudden and accidental.
the parties agree that exclusion f in the policies narrows the appellants initial duty to defend harken against a suit alleging damages caused solely by the discharge,dispersal,release,or escape of pollutants,which would include saline substances,to suits that allege that such discharge,dispersal,release,or escape is sudden and accidental.courts should construe exclusions more stringent ly than the other parts of an insurance policy or the factual allegations in the complaint.see barnett aetna life ins,because this case involves an exception or limitation on aetna liability under the policy,an even more stringent construction is required.additionally,courts must adopt the construction of an exclusionary clause urged by the insured as long as that construction is not itself unreasonable,even if the construction urged by the insurer appears to be more reasonable or a more accurate reflection of the parties intent.id.
the rices alleged that the various lines,tanks,and wells ruptured releasing pollutants,including saline substances.the word rupture intimates that the release was sudden.therefore,since the release was sudden,and we have already determined that the pollution was the result of an accident,the rices alleged that the release of the pollutants was sudden and accidental.
the saline clause obligates the appellants to defend harken against suits that allege property damage caused by saline substances.
the parties agree that supplemental exclusion clause,pollution and contamination eliminates the limited duty the appellants have to defend or indemnify harken against a suit alleging damages caused solely by pollutants,which would include saline substances,regardless of whether the damage is sudden and accidental.the parties,however,disagree as to the effects of the seepage and pollution endorsement hereinafter endorsement and the saline substances contamination hazard clause hereinafter saline clause.
harken maintains that the endorsement reinstitutes the appellants duty to indemnify it for damage caused by pollutants,which would include saline substances and that the saline clause reinstitutes the appellants duty to defend harken in actions that allege damage caused by saline substances.thus,according to harken,the appellants have a duty to defend it against an action that alleges that the damages were caused by saline substances and have a duty to indemnify it for the damages caused by pollutants,including saline substances.
on the other hand,the appellants contend that the endorseme
