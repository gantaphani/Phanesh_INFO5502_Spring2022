plaintiff appellant doral financial doral filed this appeal after the district court denied its petition to vacate an arbitral award.according to doral,the district court incorrectly rejected its contention that the arbitration tribunal engaged in misconduct by denying the issuance of and hearing subpoenas.doral also argues that the district court erred in its determination that the tribunal had authority to order the payment of interest.after carefully considering the record,we affirm.
background 
when doral terminated defendant appellee calixto garcía vélez as the president of its consumer banking division,garcía vélez began the arbitration proceedings underlying this appeal seeking the severance compensation that he felt was contractually due doral opposed the filing and argued that garcía vélez employment contract required no severance payment because the termination was for cause.shortly thereafter,garcía vélez accepted a top executive position at the miami branch of a bank with whom doral competed in puerto rico.he notified doral by letter about his new employment,and doral responded with an amendment to its submission to the arbitration tribunal,adding the claim that it owed no severance to garcía vélez because he had breached the clause of his employment contract.doral also moved the tribunal for injunctive relief against garcía vélez and commenced parallel litigation in state court against his employer 
the arbitration tribunal held a preliminary arbitration conference on march.it subsequently issued a scheduling order reflecting the agreements of the parties at the conference.as relevant here,the order established may,as the deadline for final requests for information,and august,for the submission of a final witness list.the order also stated that,if a party wishes to issue a subpoena to a third party the parties shall first confer and determine if there is any disagreement to the date and propriety of the subpoena any dispute,as to a subpoena,shall be resolved by the tribunal 
on september,five days before the first arbitration hearing was scheduled to begin,doral filed an urgent motion to stay the arbitration proceedings,stating that the miami branch of the bank for which garcía vélez allegedly worked had merged with its puerto rico holding company.according to doral,the merger proved the falsity of garcía vélez contention that he exclusively worked for the miami branch.the tribunal,however,denied the stay,and the arbitration hearings commenced as scheduled on september.
garcía vélez testified during the first days of the arbitration hearings.however,on september,due to a medical situation afflicting doral counsel,his testimony was interrupted and the hearings were postponed until december.doral took advantage of the recess to serve garcía vélez with a first set of interrogatories and a request for production of documents.doral also notified garcía vélez counsel that it intended to request subpoenas from his employer.garcía vélez did not respond,and doral filed a formal application with the tribunal to issue the subpoenas 
garcía vélez immediately opposed the formal request.he argued that the subpoenas were untimely and that they sought to change the schedule agreed upon by the parties.garcía vélez also argued that the granting of the subpoenas would likely require the arbitration to be further delayed.the tribunal agreed with garcía vélez and denied doral requests as untimely.
doral remained undeterred.on december,it filed an application for hearing subpoenas directed at garcía vélez employer,seeking information and documents of the same nature as those sought through the subpoenas.doral also moved the tribunal to reconsider its decision on the subpoenas,explaining that it had learned about garcía vélez possible involvement with the merged puerto rico holding company well after the discovery deadline had lapsed 
the tribunal denied the issuance of hearing subpoenas as well as doral reconsideration motion.as to the motion for reconsideration,it found the subpoenas significantly broader in scope than it would have permitted had the request been timely submitted and the deadline for requesting such subpoenas has long past.the tribunal held the same regarding the hearing subpoenas and added that doral could have determined the witnesses it needed during the exchange of information process and,it has had notice of the potential rebuttal witnesses it now wants to call since the september,hearing.
on december,the tribunal issued a written decision further explaining the reasoning behind its prior order.there,the tribunal addressed the alleged misrepresentations by garcía vélez,stating that t he fact that doral has maintained the same claim against garcía vélez for his employment with the merged entity indicates that it should have requested the information it believed relevant to its claim during the exchange of information process.the tribunal further established that doral has been aware since the beginning of these proceedings of the witnesses that it is now attempting to subpoena related to its claim,because,f or an extended period of time,doral has been engaged in collateral litigation with garcía vélez employer concerning the provision in the employment agreement.
the arbitration hearings resumed on december,and doral had the opportunity to garcía vélez as well as to present evidence of its own.the tribunal then provided the parties with the opportunity to file briefs and proposed awards.
the award was issued soon thereafter.in pertinent part,the tribunal found garcía vélez entitled to be compensated pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement dealing with his termination without cause.the tribunal also found that doral had failed to establish that garcía vélez breached the provision of the employment agreement and held that he was entitled to interest pursuant to rule d of the commercial arbitration rules.the arbitral award totaled,including in interest 
in due course,doral filed suit in the district court seeking vacatur of the award.it argued that the tribunal improperly denied the issuance of the subpoenas and thus engaged in misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the issue of garcía vélez s violation of the clause of the employment agreement.doral also posited that,b y awarding interest,the a rbitrator s exceeded their powers under the employment agreement and engaged in a manifest disregard of the law.in all,doral charged the tribunal with refus ing to hear material and pertinent evidence,manifest disregard of the law,manifest and gross misconduct egregious failure to receive,evaluate and properly weigh the available evidence,and implausibl y reading the employment agreement.
the district court denied the relief doral sought in a thorough written decision.doral reconsideration motion was also denied,and this appeal timely ensued.

doral clings like a limpet in the heaviest sea to the fair hearing requirement subsumed in a,urging us to find that the tribunal abridged it in refusing to issue the subpoenas.doral claims that this refusal in turn prevented the introduction of relevant evidence regarding garcía vélez potential breach of the clause.doral position is untenable for at least two reasons.
first,the record is devoid of evidence showing that doral was not afforded a fair hearing.the fair hearing requirement is rooted in due process concerns and thus calls for notice,and an opportunity to present relevant evidence and arguments.see raytheon automated bus,cir doral does not argue nor could it that the tribunal failed to provide adequate notice as to the schedule governing the arbitration proceedings.in fact,it is undisputed that the scheduling order the tribunal issued was agreed upon by the parties.moreover,the record before us unequivocally shows that the tribunal granted doral adequate notice in connection with the process governing the issuance of subpoenas.the scheduling order speaks for itself in this regard if a party wishes to issue a subpoena to a third party the parties shall first confer and determine if there is any disagreement to the date and propriety of the subpoena any dispute,as to a subpoena,shall be resolved by the tribunal 
the tribunal also provided doral ample opportunity to present its position regarding the subpoenas.in fact,the tribunal allowed doral three opportunities at bat the application for subpoenas the application for hearing subpoenas and the motion to reconsider the subpoenas order.on all three occasions,doral had the opportunity to argue why the subpoenas were warranted even though the deadline to request information had lapsed,the hearings were already underway,and garcía vélez had already testified at length.
the tribunal afforded doral many other procedural safeguards,including the continuance its counsel obtained as well as the opportunity to weigh in on the scheduling order governing the arbitration proceedings garcía vélez introduce evidence of its own and file a memorandum and a proposed award.furthermore,the tribunal provided doral with ample support,in written and unequivocal form,for its decision to deny the subpoenas and for its arbitration award,despite having no obligation to do so.see zayas bacardí,cir although arbitrators frequently elect to explain their decisions in written opinions,they are under no cumpulsion to do so.we are therefore not persuaded by doral arguments that the tribunal failed to satisfy the fair hearing exigencies behind a.
second,doral position is premised on unsupported and unwarranted factual assumptions.on this front,we note that even though doral proposed subpoenas requested a wide range of information from garcía vélez employer,it is uncertain whether such information was available for production.but more importantly,even assuming that the information sought was accessible to doral,there is nothing concrete in the record that would indicate that garcía vélez in fact violated the clause.in other words,all that doral has to offer in support of its position on appeal is the hunch that the subpoenas would have potentially yielded relevant information for its case.we can not vacate an arbitral award based on sheer speculation alone.see,cytyc deka prods,cir finding vacatur under a unwarranted because,among other things,movant failed to produce concrete evidence supporting its claim hoteles condado beach,la concha and convention,at vacating award under a upon a concrete showing that the evidence excluded was both central and decisive for the movant case.
as it did in the district court,doral places undue weight on the misrepresentations garcía vélez allegedly made during the arbitration in connection with the merger of his employers.doral presented the same argument to the arbitration tribunal.but the tribunal discarded it,reasoning,inter alia,that t he fact that doral has maintained the same claim against garcía vélez for his employment with the merged entity indicates that it should have requested the information it believed relevant to its claim during the exchange of information process.we have no authority to second guess the tribunal decision on this issue.see asociación de empleados del unión internacional de trabajadores de la industria de automóviles,et,cir we do not sit as a court of appeal to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator or to consider the merits of the award.see also prudential bache,tanner,cir declining to revisit arguments presented to,and rejected by,an arbitration tribunal dean sullivan,cir stating that courts have no authority to consider afresh arguments decided by an arbitration tribunal 
in sum,doral contentions ring hollow.the record before us contains no evidence to support a finding that the tribunal engaged in a misconduct.on the contrary,the record presented to us shows that doral lost the arbitration fairly and squarely,after the tribunal afforded it more than adequate process to present its side of the dispute.accordingly,we are in no position to grant the relief doral requests under a.
the same holds true for the relief doral seeks in connection with the grant of interest.as stated above,doral argues that the tribunal exceeded its authority in awarding interest to garcía vélez and asks us to vacate that portion of the award.we can not do so.the record is uncontested that the parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.in granting interest to garcía vélez,the tribunal explicitly referenced rule d of the commercial arbitration rules,which,in pertinent part,establishes that t he award of the arbitrator s may include interest at such rate and from such date as the arbitrators s may deem appropriate.the record contains no evidence that the parties limited the applicability of rule d in any way.therefore,doral can not now be heard to challenge the grant of interest on the ground that the tribunal lacked the very same authority that the parties explicitly granted to it by agreeing to arbitrate under the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.to say more on this front would be to carry coals to newcastle.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court decision is affirmed.
the employment contract had an arbitration clause whereby garcía vélez and doral agree d that any controversy or claim arising out of,or relating to this agreement,or the breach thereof shall be settled by confidential arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.there is no dispute that this clause mandated the arbitration of garcía vélez claims.
early into the arbitration,doral voluntarily dismissed the claim for injunctive relief.
the subpoenas sought discovery items,most of them as broad and open ended as the following three examples a copy of any and all documents exchanged with garcía vélez from the year to the present a copy of any and all documents analyzing the merger and a copy of a
