this case concerns a claim made by gregory house against his former employer,first marblehead corporation the company,relating to its refusal to honor his attempt to exercise certain incentive stock options isos he received during his employment.according to the written,plan governing the isos terms and conditions the plan,house isos expired three months after his resignation from the company.however,house alleges that he was repeatedly assured that his isos had a term of exercise and that he never received a copy of the plan.he also alleges that the company was advised by its outside general counsel that employees such as house were misinformed about the duration of their isos after termination of employment,but that the company failed to inform him of this fact.
the district court granted summary judgment for first marblehead on house claims for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and negligent misrepresentation.after careful review of the record,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims,but vacate the judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim and remand for further proceedings.
the following facts are drawn from the pleadings and depositions and are largely undisputed.where conflicts exist,we view the record in the light most favorable to house,who is the nonmoving party.clifford barnhart,cir.house was recruited by dan meyers,his friend and first marblehead ceo,to work at first marblehead in early.meyers promised house that he would receive valuable stock options to compensate him for the salary cut he would take by leaving his previous position.
shortly after house began working at first marblehead,the company approved the first marblehead stock option plan.the plan documents included a vesting schedule and specified the constraints on exercise when an employee resigned or was terminated.according to the plan,a resigning employee o ptions will remain exercisable by the grantee for a period not extending beyond three months.house has testified and first marblehead has conceded that house never received a copy of this plan.
in the spring of,meyers asked house to value the incentive stock options the company was preparing to issue.management described the key features of these options to that would play an important role in house that the options would have a strike price a duration,and a certain rate of interest and volatility.this was the first time house learned that the isos would be exercisable for ten years.
at his compensation review in june,house received a worksheet indicating that he had been granted isos,valued at per share.this worksheet did not reference the plan nor did it disclose that the isos would expire within three months should house resign from first marblehead.
a few weeks later,on july,house received a memo from first marblehead general counsel,rodney hoffman,spelling out the principal terms of the isos.this memo,and a presentation by hoffman,reiterated the strike price and the duration house had ascertained during his role in pricing the options.the memo failed to address the expiration upon resignation.it did,however,introduce conditions relating to the vesting schedule.the vesting schedule caught house by of his options would vest immediately and of the remainder would vest each year over a period of four years.house objected to the vesting schedule and immediately negotiated with meyers to make his options exercisable at once.meyers agreed.
shortly after preparing the memo and presentation laying out the vesting schedule,hoffman realized that the expiration date on options for employees leaving first marblehead was another significant term and condition requiring disclosure.according to hoffman testimony in a deposition,he prepared a supplemental memorandum on july,specifying that vested options would terminate if not exercised within three months of an employee departure.the cover letter accompanying this memo and addressed to employees of first marblehead stated 
in preparing the final form of the iso grant document,i found that i had misstated one of the terms of the option in the summary memo mea culpa.a copy of that revised memo is attached you will note that the change is to section ii which describes what happens to the options upon termination of employment.
hoffman testified that he delivered this memo to the company,but it is unclear whether the company distributed it.house the company he never received this memo.
in early,house resigned from first marblehead.in february a public offering of first marblehead stock led to a dramatic increase in the stock attempted to exercise his options,but his efforts were rejected.house claims that his options are worth million dollars when issued,they had a grant price of.
during the ensuing negotiations between house and first marblehead,the company sought a declaratory judgment in the massachusetts superior court that house isos had expired three months after his resignation.invoking diversity jurisdiction house removed the action to federal court and asserted two counterclaims breach of contract,based on first marblehead refusal to honor the terms of his options,and promissory estoppel,based on first marblehead failure to make good on its repeated promises to house that he had ten years in which to exercise his options.
house became aware of the mea culpa memo as a result of deposing hoffman.soon thereafter,house moved to compel the company to produce this memo.first marblehead filed a motion for summary judgment on house counterclaims soon thereafter.during the pendency of that motion and after the parties had submitted briefs and argued before the district court,the district court compelled production of the memo.house promptly amended his complaint to add a negligent misrepresentation claim arising from first marblehead failure to inform house about the expiration of his options upon his resignation even though hoffman memo had alerted the company to the urgency of doing so.
the district court granted first marblehead motion for summary judgment on house breach of contract and promissory estoppel counterclaims.in addition,the court granted summary judgment sua sponte on house negligent misrepresentation counterclaim,even though first marblehead had not moved for summary judgment on that claim and the parties had not briefed the issue.
the district court granted the company motion for summary judgment on house breach of contract claim because it found that the worksheet from house compensation review and the july memo contained no affirmative representations that conflicted with the plan and that,even if they did,delaware law requires that a written,plan take precedence over all other representations regarding corporate stock.the district court also granted the company motion for summary judgment on house promissory estoppel claim on several grounds delaware law bars equitable claims based on representations contrary to written,language regarding stock options no affirmative representations were made to house about a period for exercising his options after terminating his employment and house could not have reasonably relied on any affirmative representations made in any event because he had expert knowledge of how options worked.finding that house negligent misrepresentation claim required two of the same elements as his rejected promissory estoppel affirmative misrepresentation and reasonable district court granted summary judgment to first marblehead on that claim as well.
on appeal,house argues that the district court erred by applying an overly broad construction of delaware law to his contract and promissory estoppel claims,and that delaware law does not foreclose either of these claims.he also argues that the company affirmatively misrepresented the terms of his options that he reasonably relied on those assertions or,at the least,that the reasonableness of his element of both the promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation a factual question that should have survived summary judgment and that the company failure to disclose to him the mea culpa memo correcting the earlier,erroneous memo constituted negligent misrepresentation.as we shall explain,we agree in part with his contentions.

breach of contract and promissory estoppel 
affirmative misrepresentation 
at the heart of both house breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims is the proposition that the company represented to him that he would have ten years to exercise his isos even if the company had affirmatively represented to house that he had ten years in which to exercise his isos even after terminating his employment,any such representations would have been contrary to the plan approved by the company board of directors,which only permitted a period for the exercise of house isos after departure.as we describe below,delaware law requires that the terms and conditions of stock options be governed by a written,plan.
delaware corporate law 
pursuant to delaware law,every corporation may create and issue rights or options such rights or options to be evidenced by or in such instrument or instruments as shall be approved by the board of directors.ann.tit,a emphasis added.delaware courts have observed that this rule was designed to serve the important policy goal of preserv ing the board broad authority over the corporation and protect ing the certainty of investors expectations regarding stock.grimes alteon,see also staar surgical waggoner,the issuance of corporate stock is an act of fundamental legal significance having a direct bearing upon questions of corporate governance,control and the capital structure of the enterprise.the law properly requires certainty in such matters.here the plan explicit time limit for the exercise of isos held by employees who resign would thus supersede any other communications about the expiration of the isos.
we note that delaware courts have adhered to statutory requirements respecting stocks when denying claims for equitable relief even in situations when that might generate an inequitable result.liebermann frangiosa,see also staar surgical,at directing that neither logic nor equity compel the validation of a legally void because in contravention of section act,hampton,averring that the court can not give any effect to void shares even in the context of an equitable defense emphasis in original citing staar surgical,at.
house urges us to read these cases narrowly,as standing only for the proposition that the initial issuance of stock need be controlled by a writing,duly approved by a corporation board of directors.since the case at hand concerns the right to exercise options to purchase validly issued stock,house argues that this delaware jurisprudence does not apply.we find this argument unpersuasive.the policy concern motivating section a corporation know precisely what its capital stock is and what the potential calls on that capital will be,grimes,at quoting grimes alteon,at.ch,bench ruling is compromised if validly issued stock options are exercised in a way that conflicts with the plan terms it seems incontestable that resurrecting house right to redeem shares of company stock would substantially affect the corporation control of its capital stock.
appellant also offers several cases suggesting that section may not completely bar his promissory estoppel claim.see,ostler codman research group,cir wert clear channel commc ns,d.in ostler,a case we decided,the plaintiff ostler held stock options that were soon to expire.to exercise them,ostler was required by a writing to certify that he had fully investigated the company current financial condition.ostler requested relevant information from the company,but received only a draft financial report just days before the options were to expire.because it was likely that the final report would differ significantly from the draft,company management extended the option exercise deadline to hours after a final report was issued.in a subsequent breach of contract case,ostler argued that the deadline extension was not valid because it was not written and approved by the board.we ultimately validated the extension and denied relief to ostler noting that at least one delaware in an unpublished recognized an exception to the requirement that board approval be obtained for all actions related to options.see collins am.int l group.ch.lexis.ch.
we observed that the ruling in collins may suggest that a minor extension of an option exercise deadline by management is permitted under delaware law,but it is hardly conclusive.ostler,at.we further noted that i t is not clear in collins whether the contested option deadline was part of the option plan or who had authority to alter the deadline nor did the court expressly discuss section.id.at.in underscoring our narrow interpretation of collins,we cautioned that corporate law remains fairly fussy about the actual authority of officers when their actions affect stock options.id.at.thus we emphasized in ostler the limited nature of the exception we were reluctantly endorsing,the district court minor extensions of an option exercise deadline to deal with last minute emergencies.
appellant asks us to expand this narrow holding to accommodate the far different circumstances here.rather than a extension,appellant seeks to extend his options years beyond the expiration period set by the board.while a extension arguably would not frustrate management ability to make capital decisions with certainty,a delay of years could have a significant impact.we agree with the district court that delaware law does not allow the relief house seeks under these circumstances.
reasonable reliance 
in granting summary judgment to first marblehead as to house promissory estoppel claim,the district court also found that,even if the company had affirmatively misrepresented the terms of his options,house could not have reasonably relied on any such misrepresentation because house was no woods.because we agree with the district court that delaware law bars house recovery on his breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims,we do not analyze house reliance here.instead,we will address the reliance issue in analyzing his negligent misrepresentation claim.
negligent misrepresentation 
although the district court noted that neither party has briefed this claim,it granted first marblehead summary judgment on house negligent misrepresentation claim,concluding that the claim failed for the same reasons as his promissory estoppel claim.we disagree with that conclusion.
governing law 
where the parties have reached a plausible agreement about what law governs,a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction is free to forgo independent inquiry and accept that agreement.cochran,at.pursuant to a clause in first marblehead plan,its provisions shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with delaware law.provisions of the plan were,in fact,central to the contract and promissory estoppel claims.hence the parties plausibly agreed that delaware law applied to the contract and promissory estoppel claims.since no similar agreement governs the negligent misrepresentation claim,we consult massachusetts choice of law principles to determine whether massachusetts or delaware law applies 
massachusetts approach to choice of law is explicitly guided by the restatemen
