opinion of the court 
appellant illinois national insurance company illinois national and appellees wyndham worldwide operations,wyndham worldwide corporation,wyndham vacation ownership,and wyndham resort development corporation collectively wyndham are in a contract dispute over insurance coverage.in resolving this dispute,we must decide whether the doctrine of mutual mistake allows reformation of a contract against a party that did not participate in the negotiations.
illinois national filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that a plane crash did not trigger coverage under an aircraft fleet insurance policy that it issued to jet aviation business jets,jet aviation.wyndham filed a counterclaim seeking coverage and filed motions for summary judgment and to dismiss illinois national complaint.the united states district court for the district of new jersey granted wyndham motion to dismiss illinois national complaint as well as wyndham motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim.on appeal,illinois national argues that the district court erred both when it determined that mutual mistake can only serve as a basis for reformation in an action against a bargaining party and when it held that illinois national had insufficiently pled mutual mistake.we agree and hold that new jersey law allows reformation on the basis of mutual mistake against a party that did not participate in the negotiation of a contract and that illinois national sufficiently pled mutual mistake.
for the following reasons,we conclude that the district court grant to wyndham of summary judgment was improper,as was its dismissal of illinois national complaint.accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
illinois national issues insurance products and services.jet aviation offers aircraft maintenance,completions and refurbishment,engineering,and fixed base operations,along with aircraft management,charter services,aircraft sales and personnel services.wyndham is a recognized service leader in the hospitality industry.
illinois national provided insurance coverage to jet aviation and to some of jet aviation clients,so long as jet aviation managed the client aircraft and aircraft usage.jet aviation managed an aircraft owned by wyndham and provided insurance for that aircraft pursuant to the terms of a series of aircraft management services agreements.
in,wyndham predecessor,cendant operations,and jet aviation entered into the first of these aircraft management services agreements.among other things,the agreements obligated jet aviation to provide domestic flight planning and scheduling,flight crew staffing,and management of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for wyndham aircraft.if wyndham aircraft was not available when needed,jet aviation could arrange for an aircraft for wyndham use from another source.pursuant to the aircraft management services agreements,jet aviation agreed to procure insurance for wyndham aircraft while it was managed by jet aviation.the agreement also stated that it would provide wyndham with insurance coverage when wyndham used aircraft at the direction of jet aviation.
for successive periods beginning in,and through the policy year,a series of aircraft fleet management insurance policies were purchased by jet aviation and issued by illinois national.each was negotiated by illinois national and jet aviation,directly and through their agents.the policies contained endorsements that provided coverage for jet aviation clients.these clients were identified on the endorsements as insured owners and also as named insured.the policies contain the following managed aircraft endorsement

jet aviation and illinois national claim that the drafting change was designed to make it more clear that entities affiliated with jet aviation were covered.both contracting parties have stated that they believed that it did not expand coverage to entities that were unaffiliated with jet aviation,such as wyndham.however,the modification,as written,appears to provide third parties with coverage when using aircraft without jet aviation involvement.
despite being drafted to seemingly provide expanded coverage,wyndham premium declined from for the policy to for the policy.wyndham did not know about the change made to the endorsement for and continued to obtain aircraft liability coverage through a policy issued by starnet insurance company starnet 
it is undisputed that neither wyndham nor its brokers was involved in the negotiations or drafting of the revised provisions of the endorsement.it was negotiated between illinois national and jet aviation.
in august,jason ketcheson,a wyndham employee,rented a cessna from aviation adventures to travel to a meeting in oregon.jet aviation had no involvement in this transaction.ketcheson crashed into a house in gearhart,oregon,killing five people.as a result,various claimants have sued wyndham for damages.the crash may have triggered coverage under the language of the policy.
illinois national filed suit against wyndham seeking a declaratory judgment that the policy did not cover claims
