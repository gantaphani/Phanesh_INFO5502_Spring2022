background 
factual background 
as the law requires,we construe the facts of this case in the light most favorable to rfs,the nonmoving party.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.as the district court observed,the parties agree regarding many basic facts,although rfs would have us draw inferences from some of those facts that even the lenient summary judgment standard can not support.
rfs first entered into a sales and service agreement with ford in.after the dealer principal,james peirce,died in,his widow meredith peirce became its sole owner.in,she executed a new sales and service agreement with ford,which the parties agree was identical to the first in all relevant respects.the agreement itself is an extensive document,addressing in detail the procedures for running and selling a dealership.for the present purposes,several provisions are relevant.
first,with regard to a prospective sale of the dealership,paragraph a gives ford the right to approve or decline to approve a prospective purchaser.it provides,in relevant part 
ford has the right to approve or decline to approve any prospective purchaser as to his character,automotive experience,management,capital and other qualifications for appointment as an authorized dealer in company products for the dealership operations involved.approval of the prospective purchaser shall not,however,be unreasonably withheld.
second,to facilitate the orderly transfer of ownership,a number of provisions address the right of the dealer to demand the repurchase of ford products by ford at the time of the dealership sale and to assign such rights to the successor dealer.paragraph describes the right of the dealer to demand that the company repurchase certain parts in connection with the dealer notice of termination or nonrenewal,as follows 
upon termination or nonrenewal of this agreement by the dealer,the dealer may demand in his notice of termination or nonrenewal,to have the company purchase or accept upon return from the dealer,in return for his general release specified in paragraph certain vehicles,parts,dealer signs,special tools and equipment as outlined in paragraphs a d.
the dealer could not only demand ford repurchase of parts,but could also assign its repurchase rights to a successor dealer.
assignment of benefits.as an assist to the dealer in effecting an orderly transfer of his assets to a replacement dealer and to minimize possible interruptions in customer convenience and service,in the event of termination or nonrenewal by either party,any rights or benefits with respect to subparagraphs a,b,c,and d,herein may be assigned by the dealer to anyone whom the dealer has agreed to sell the respective property and whom ford has approved as a replacement for the dealer.such assignments will be subject to dealer fulfillment of his obligations under paragraph and this paragraph and subject to the dealer tender of a general release as specified in paragraph.
both of these dealer right to have ford repurchase parts and the dealer right to assign its repurchase rights to the successor the execution of a general release between the dealer and ford.paragraph provides,in relevant part,as follows 
u pon the dealer demand of any of the benefits provided for in paragraph upon any termination or nonrenewal by the dealer,ford shall be released from any and all other liability to the dealer with respect to all relationships and actions between the dealer and ford,however claimed to arise simultaneously with the receipt of any benefits so elected or demanded,the dealer shall execute and deliver to ford a general release with exceptions,as above described,satisfactory to ford.
negotiations to sell rfs,which was not doing well financially,began in.the dealership proved to be difficult to sell because the real estate on which it was situated was a former municipal dump and contaminated by solid waste.over the next three years,during which rfs lost almost,four or five different prospective sales fell through for various reasons,including,in,ford refusal to approve one of the sales.in december,rfs sought ford approval of a proposed sale of its ford dealership to rochester lincoln mercury,rlm.ford refused its consent on the grounds that rlm track record in sales was too weak rfs owners were disappointed,but continued to search for a buyer.
on january,rfs finally executed an agreement to sell the ford dealership to dennis roberts and kevin donovan,owners of granite ford.rfs tendered the asset purchase agreement to ford on january.then,in order to facilitate the transfer,rfs took the following three steps on march,
rfs voluntarily terminated its sales service agreement with ford by signing and tendering a letter of resignation drafted by ford.the letter stated that rfs resignation would be effective when accepted by ford motor company,expressly conditioned upon the successful closing of the pending purchase and sale agreement between peirce ford sales and dennis roberts,kevin donovan,granite ford.
in the letter,rfs explicitly elected the parts repurchase option available under paragraph of the sales and service agreement.rfs requested that ford repurchase its inventory of new,unused,and undamaged eligible ford parts and accessories upon terms and conditions set forth in subparagraph b in an amount by which the actual audited inventory exceeds recommended inventory guide levels as determined by ford motor company in its sole discretion.having elected the repurchase option,rfs then assigned it to granite ford under paragraph g,pursuant to the ford asset sale agreement.
rfs executed and delivered a written general release in favor of ford,in exchange for the parts buyback option and right of assignment,as specified in the ford sales service agreement.
at some point between january and march,ford approved the sale of rfs to granite ford the precise date is unclear from the record.on february,ford sent rfs a packet of sample forms to be used in effectuating its resignation to assist you in the agreement with dennis roberts.moreover,william albee the son of peirce,the owner of rfs stated in his affidavit in support of the plaintiff opposition to summary judgment that on february,prior to closing,friestedt on behalf of ford motor company had already approved the purchase of the dealership by roberts and donovan through granite ford,llc.however,friestedt memorandum recommending approval of the sale is dated march.
the sale to granite ford closed on april.after closing the sale,and notwithstanding the release it had signed,rfs brought this suit against ford,alleging that ford unreasonably withheld its consent to the proposed rlm sale in,resulting in a substantial financial loss to rfs,in violation of.ann.ford responded that rfs suit was barred by the terms of the general release executed on march,pursuant to paragraphs and of the sales and service agreement.
decision below 
the district court found the core question on summary judgment to be a straightforward one is rfs bound by the terms of its general release rfs had argued that the release was not binding for two reasons it was not supported by adequate consideration and it was coerced or the product of duress.the district court found both claims to be insufficiently supported by evidence to survive summary judgment.
as to the consideration question,the district court explained that the dealership agreement very clearly provided rfs with an option relative to parts repurchase upon its voluntary termination of the dealership agreement it could either elect to put the eligible parts back to ford or assign that right to its purchaser,in exchange for a general release of all claims against ford or it could elect to keep the parts sell them to others,giving no release to ford,and retaining the right to sue ford on any claims rfs might have.wl,at.the consideration given by ford was the agreement to buy back the eligible parts,or assign them,at rfs option.the court found that this was sufficient consideration.see hyman ford motor,d grand motors,ford motor,
as to the coercion claim,the district court noted that,once rfs voluntarily terminated its dealership agreement and elected the repurchase option,ford was effectively and automatically released under paragraph of the service and sales agreement.the subsequent written release served merely to memorialize what the terms of the agreement made automatic.wl,at.
thus,the district court concluded,any claim that the release form was coerced was of no moment ford had already been released under the agreement when rfs made its written demand for repurchase in its voluntary notice of termination.moreover,the court found no other evidence of coercion in the record rfs may have later regretted taking the repurchase option in exchange for releasing ford from further liability,but its choice to do so was nonetheless voluntary and uncoerced.wl,at.finding no genuine issues of material fact to warrant a trial,the court granted summary judgment to ford.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party favor.houlton citizens coalition,at.this standard of review does not limit us to the district court rationale we may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any ground revealed by the record.id.
summary judgment may be granted only when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.t he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d emphasis in original.to be considered material,a disputed fact must have the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.id.at.
the party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine issues of material fact for trial.celotex catrett,d.this burden may be discharged by showing that is,pointing out to the district there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.id.at.after such a showing,the burden shifts to the nonmoving party,with respect to each issue on which he has the burden of proof,to demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably could find in his favor.denovellis shalala,cir citing celotex,at.
in the end,after examining the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,we are required to determine if there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.anderson,at.
consideration 
rfs argued before the district court that the buyback option per se did not constitute valid consideration for the release.on appeal,rfs makes a different argument that ford failed to give the consideration it was supposed to give rfs because it varied the description of the parts eligible for return between the original description in the sales and service agreement and that in the letter containing rfs election of the repurchase option a letter that ford drafted,but rfs signed.
according to rfs,paragraph b of the sales service agreement entitles a dealer to request ford to repurchase all current unused ford parts in the dealer inventory.however,the march,letter of resignation drafted by ford requested that ford accept the return of such current unused parts as exceed recommended inventory guide levels.thus,rfs argues,in so drafting the letter,ford unilaterally reduced the number of current unused parts that were covered by the buyback.
rfs maintains that the fact that it did not actually receive the consideration distinguishes the present case from all the other cases upholding ford release provisions.see,devalk lincoln mercury,ford motor,cir fabert motors,ford motor,cir hyman,d at ray dobbins,ford motor,aff,cir grand motors.at ford,ford motor.accordingly,rfs argues,the release must be held invalid for lack of consideration,and the case should have been allowed to proceed to trial.
ford responds that rfs received adequate consideration for the release when it exercised the buyback option and assigned the parts repurchase right to granite ford.the repurchase right is expressly listed as one of the dealership assets to be sold under the asset purchase agreement between rfs and granite ford.ford argues that the consideration that rfs received in terms of the purchase price it negotiated with granite ford satisfies the requirement of consideration.see hyman,d at under similar circumstances,finding consideration where seller assigned repurchase right to replacement dealer the fact that the seller was not the one to personally receive the parts return is irrelevant.as to the variation in terms,ford acknowledges that the letter of march,contains a more stringent limitation of the parts repurchase than the one in the dealership agreement,but argues that it is the agreement and rochester ford written release that actually govern the terms of the parts repurchase,and thus that it is bound to accept return of all current parts in any case.
we find that the district court reasoning on the consideration issue was very much on point rfs obtained the benefit of the repurchase option in paragraph,which it expressly included as an asset of the dealership to be sold to granite ford,in exchange for releasing ford from liability.ford agreement to repurchase the parts in question either from rfs or from rfs assignee was sufficient to support the general release obligation whether it was rfs or the assignee who would actually receive the money in exchange for the parts is irrelevant to the consideration issue.see hyman,d at.
finally,rfs makes an additional no consideration for the release ever materialized because ford never actually repurchased any parts from granite ford.this argument,too,is without merit.for the purposes of analyzing whether rfs received consideration in exchange for the release,the transaction that concerns us is rfs exercise of the repurchase option and the sale of that option,among rfs assets,to granite ford,not any subsequent transactions between ford and granite ford,to which rfs is not a par
