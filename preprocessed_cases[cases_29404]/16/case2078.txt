this case involves a dispute between plaintiff kolkowski and defendant goodrich corporation concerning severance benefits.kolkowski contends he is owed money under the company employee protection plan epp,because he was not offered comparable employee benefits by the acquiring company.the district court ruled that kolkowski was entitled to vacation benefits but not severance benefits.the district court denial was based on finding that the plan was covered by erisa and the application of federal law.
kolkowski appeals from this part of the decision.he argues that the district court ruling that federal and not ohio law applies was based on the district court application of the wrong test.further kolkowski argues even under federal law he should have been awarded benefits.
for the reasons that follow the decision of the district court granting partial summary judgment in favor of goodrich is reversed and remanded.
in late,kolkowski received an offer of employment from goodrich.within months,kolkowski joined the company as patent counsel.in addition to a salary and signing bonus,kolkowski became eligible to join three select bonus programs,as well as the company stock option plan and the employee protection plan epp.the epp provided severance benefits to those who incurred involuntary termination within two years of a change in control in the company itself or a division of the company.the language of the epp that is at the heart of the dispute,section a,states 
termination of the covered employee employment with the company without consent of the covered employee,for any reason other than cause i f the purchaser of any business unit,division,or subsidiary of the company which is sold after the date on which a change in control occurs offers employment to any covered employee,the termination of such covered employee employment by the company prior to or simultaneous with any such sale shall not be considered involuntary termination,unless either the base salary offered to the covered employee by the purchaser is lower than the covered employee highest base salary between the date immediately prior to the change in control and the date of sale,or the employee benefits offered to the covered employee are not at least comparable to the benefits received immediately prior to the change in control.if either or both of the events described in the foregoing sentence occur,a covered employee will be deemed to have incurred an involuntary termination if such covered employee chooses not to accept the offer of employment made by such purchaser,or accepts the offer of employment,but voluntary terminates within sixty days following such event.
in april of a change of control took place,goodrich shareholders approved a merger of their performance materials segment pms division,the division that employed kolkowski,with coltec industries.the approved merger transferred ownership of the two divisions to a group of investors named pmd group pmd.
in anticipation of the date of sale,in early,goodrich distributed a newsletter entitled pm newsline to all the employees of their pms division,notifying them that they would cease being goodrich employees on the closing date of sale,february.the newsletter also supplied the pms employees with general information about their future employment opportunities with pmd.according to the newsletter,every employee would be offered the same base salary,the same bonus opportunities,the same time off policies for,essentially the same health and welfare benefits,and the same severance program through april.the newsletter also stated that it would adopt a new severance program after the april date.this particular program was later finalized and became known as the performance materials transition arrangements plan.the pm newsletter did not discuss the specifics of the bonus or benefits plans,nor did it discuss the availability of stock option plans to employees.
kolkowski,who was entitled to discretionary stock option benefits while employed at goodrich,became concerned with the lack of specificity in pmd employment offer.he attempted to discuss this with goodrich administrator of the epp but was unable to even determine who the plan administrator was.instead,kolkowski met with terrence linnert,the head of the legal department and human resources at goodrich.linnert was also unsure of pmd employment offer but reminded kolkowski that the epp provision allowed him to reject an employment offer if the position did not include at least the same salary and comparable benefits.at no time during the conversation did linnert inform kolkowski that the offer was substantially comparable.
on february,kolkowski received a more specific offer of employment from pmd human resources head,cheryl fells.the offer included the same position,same base salary,the eligibility to participate in a pension plan and k plan,the unspecific opportunity to receive substantially comparable performance based cash incentives,and 
employee welfare and other benefits medical,dental,vision,life insurance,disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance that are substantially equivalent to the benefits provided to you by the goodrich company immediately before close.
the letter did not mention a stock option plan or a change in control severance protection agreement.
the next day,kolkowski,unsatisfied with the specifics of the benefits outlined in pmd offer,contacted vice president chris clegg of the legal department for pmd.clegg informed kolkowski that he could not answer any questions but directed him to fells with any specific questions,which he promptly did.
on february,one day before the close of sale,pmd representative fells finally responded to kolkowski email.she stated the details of the substantially comparable bonus plan would be available within the next sixty days,far later than the close of sale.on the same day,kolkowski received a letter from goodrich general counsel,linnert,indicating that he would be terminated from goodrich on the following day.
the next day,goodrich completed the sale of its pms division to pmd.believing that he was not offered substantially comparable benefits,kolkowski declined pmd employment offer.he was subsequently discharged by goodrich.
after waiting over fifteen days after the close of sale for his severance package from goodrich,kolkowski sent a letter to linnert demanding his severance package.neither linnert nor goodrich responded.over the span of three weeks,three subsequent letters mailed by kolkowski were also met with silence.on april,kolkowski sent a final letter to linnert,this time threatening legal action.
four days later,senior counsel for goodrich,kevin murphy,responded to kolkowski letters and demand for severance.the letter indicated that linnert was on medical leave and that he was asked by murphy to respond to kolkowski inquiries.murphy stated that kolkowski was offered employment that met the requirements of section a of the epp.he continued,a s was explained to you prior to the date that pm was sold,you are not eligible for severance under epp.
procedural history 
kolkowski filed a complaint against goodrich in the court of common pleas in cuyahoga county,ohio alleging breach of contract arising from the company failure to disperse severance benefits and vacation pay.the case was removed to the northern district of ohio.cross motions for summary judgment were filed.
the district court issued an order granting partial summary judgment to both sides.the district court found that kolkowski was entitled to his contractual vacation pay claims,which is not at issue here.the district court granted goodrich motion for summary judgment affirming its denial of severance to kolkowski.
in arriving at its decision to affirm the denial of severance benefits,the district court determined that the severance benefits plan was an erisa benefits plan,governed by federal law.applying erisa law,the district court then conducted de novo review of the denial of benefits looking first to the plan plain language.after determining that the plan language was ambiguous,the district court next turned to the materials that the plan administrator used to make his decision.the district court,noting that the case was difficult,determined that kolkowski had been offered at least comparable benefits to those he received at goodrich.thus,the district court upheld the plan administrator denial of severance benefits.
kolkowski appeals this ruling.
standard of review 
kolkowski asks this court to review the district court order granting defendant motion for summary judgment.we review de novo the grant of summary judgment,using the same rule c standard used by the district court,williams mehra,cir en banc citations omitted,and considering the record as it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling.niecko emro marketing,cir.similarly,we review the decision to deny benefits under erisa de novo,unless the plan expressly commits discretion to determine eligibility and to construe the terms of the plan to the plan administrator.wilkins baptist healthcare,cir.both sides agree that the epp grants no such discretion,therefore this court review of the plan administrator decision is de novo.
is the epp an erisa benefit plan 
appellant argues that the district court erred in its conclusion that the epp should be categorized as an erisa benefit plan.if the benefits plan does not fall under erisa governance,ohio law would govern.
determining the existence of an erisa plan is a question of fact to be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances and facts from the point of view of a reasonable person,which is reviewed for clear error.thompson am.home assurance,cir.thus,the district court decision that the severance benefit plan is an erisa benefit plan is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.
erisa defines an employee benefit welfare plan as any plan established or maintained by an employer,for the purposes of providing for its participants a benefits in the event of unemployment or b any benefit described in section c of this title.since severance plans are included in the definition of b they may be considered an erisa benefits plan.cassidy akzo nobel salt,cir.even though plans to pay employees severance benefits,which are payable only upon termination of employment,are employee welfare benefit plans,massachusetts morash,d,this circuit has held that not all severance pay plans are erisa plans.cassidy,at see sherrod general motors,cir severance plan in which benefits were predetermined and involved simple mechanical determination was found not to be an erisa plan.
in order to distinguish an erisa from a plan,we must look to the nature of the plan itself.cassidy,at citing swinney general motors,cir.the hallmark of an erisa benefit plan is that it requires an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer obligation.swinney,at quoting fort halifax packing coyne,at,d.although the thompson three part test is normally used to determine if there is an erisa benefits plan this circuit has used two particular factors to determine if a severance agreement plan meets the fort halifax criteria to determine if erisa governs whether the employer has discretion over the distribution of benefits,and whether there are demands on an employer assets.
the degree of discretion retained by the employer over distribution of benefits is one important factor in deciding whether a severance plan is an erisa plan another important factor is whether the delivery of benefits creates an demand on employer assets.
cassidy,at.
this court has said that this determining characteristic of administrator discretion was whether the plan administrator made individualized determinations of eligibility,as opposed to those that require automatic or simple decisions.
p lans in which benefits are predetermined or which involve simple or mechanical determinations have been found not to be erisa plans on the other hand,if to determine benefits the employer must analyze each employee particular circumstances in light of the appropriate criteria,the severance plan is probably an erisa plan.
cassidy,at citing sherrod,at.
in this case,the plan administrator exercised discretion in determining benefits in two distinct ways,one more complex than the other.the administrator decided whether the benefits offered by an acquiring company were at least comparable to the prior benefits.the administrator also computed the seniority status of each employee in order to calculate the amount of severance pay and benefits due.the administrator authority to evaluate and determine facts,including whether an employee prior and prospective position have at least comparable benefits,is more than the simple,mechanical function that the court encountered in sherrod.under similar facts,the ninth circuit in bogue ampex and,found the severance package at issue to be an erisa severance benefit plan since it required the company to determine whether an employee received substantially equivalent employment to trigger the severance benefits.
the ongoing benefits prong is,
a plan may be an erisa plan if the employer assumes responsibility to pay benefits on a regular basis,and thus faces periodic demands on its assets that create a need for financial coordination and control.
cassidy,at quoting fort halifax,at.
despite the fact that the epp issued a one time lump payment of salary and bonuses to those who were eligible,goodrich plan also met the requirement of ongoing benefits prong since the medical,dental and life insurance benefits continued for a period after the payout.at least one district court has found this factor was enough for the plan to be considered an erisa plan.see champagne revco,severance benefits plan for employees displaced after merger,which provided for lump sum severance payment,was nevertheless an employee welfare benefit plan subject to erisa because continuing medical benefits and outplacement assistance provided by plan created ongoing obligations for employer.secondly,the epp covered every involuntary termination over a period.
plaintiff argues that the district court and defendant reliance on this line of cases is misplaced.claiming it is better suited to determine whether a plan constitutes an erisa plan,plaintiff asks us to substitute the test set forth in donovan dillingham,cir.under dillingham,a plan,fund or program under erisa is established if,from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person can ascertain the intended benefits,a class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits,the second part of the thompson three part test.plaintiff argues that under this test the epp would fail to be considered an erisa plan since goodrich did not comply with erisa reporting requirements,there was admittedly no plan administrator at times,and no claims procedure was in place.
even though the dillingham test has been adopted by this court as well as every other circuit,williams wci steel,fn.cir citations omitted,this court has not always employed this test when determining whether an erisa plan exists in severance package cases.see cassidy,at shahid,at swinney.at.the only case that has mentioned the dillingham test in a severance package case to come after the sherrod and shahid decisions is reedstrom nova chemicals.cir unpublished.in that case,only after the court employed the sherrod factors to determine that the severance package qualified as an erisa plan,did the court then conclude that appellant dillingham argument was insufficient because severance payments could be calculated,the class of beneficiaries had been defined,and the procedures were spelled out.
similar toreedstrom,the epp in this case also meets the requirements of the dillingham test since the intended benefits twelve months salary,unused vacation,bonuses,and welfare benefits,the intended beneficiaries employees who are involuntarily terminated,the procedures for obtaining the benefits automatic receipt within days after termination,and the source of the financing goodrich are not difficult for a reasonable person to ascertain.these tests are not exclusive of each other but instead are different tools that can both be used to determine whether an erisa plan exists.
thus,under either te
