appellant westpoint stevens westpoint appeals from two judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,scheindlin,ordering westpoint to pay attorney fees,costs and interest in the amount of to robert krumme krumme and to gordon allen,john currier,james dunne,leo fornero,gerard mandry,norman matheson,bruce moore,nicholas pallotta and cochran supplee collectively the allen plaintiffs.
to resolve this appeal,we must determine when a dispute arises to trigger a party rights under a provision,and whether a general release of a party obligations under a contract relieves that party of the obligation to pay attorney fees pursuant to a provision in the same contract.the district court held that a dispute under the relevant provision can arise only when a party rights vest under the contract and that a broad release does not relieve the releasee of the obligation to pay attorney fees pursuant to the released contract.see allen.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
background 
this appeal presents another chapter in a litigation that has spanned three decades.it involves dozens of plaintiffs in three separate actions before four district court judges,three panels of this court and a new york state court.the full background is presented thoroughly in numerous district court opinions,as well as two prior opinions of this court.see krumme westpoint stevens,cir krumme west,d allen.at.we assume familiarity with those opinions and recount only the facts necessary to understand and resolve the present appeal.
the epi program and the epi amendment 
the plaintiffs are ten former,senior executives of cluett,peabody company,cluett.each participated in cluett executive permanent insurance epi program.in,westpoint acquired cluett and began administering the epi program.the epi program includes a deferred compensation agreement,under which participants who reach the age of are entitled to receive lifetime monthly payments,on an annual basis,equal to percent of their final base salary.upon acquiring cluett,westpoint became the obligor with respect to plaintiffs benefits under this agreement.
confronted with the prospect of a hostile takeover,westpoint drafted an amendment to the deferred compensation agreement the epi amendment.the proposed epi amendment would allow participants to opt for a lump sum payment in the event of a change of control,rather than await monthly payments at age the board designed the epi amendment to protect the benefits of epi program participants from the potential actions of a hostile acquiror.
to further deter an acquiror from depriving the participants of their payments,the epi amendment contained a broad provision.the provision required westpoint to reimburse participants for their investigative costs and attorney fees i f at any time upon or after a change of control there should arise any dispute as to the validity,interpretation or application of any term or condition of this agreement.emphasis added.in the event that such a dispute arose,westpoint agreed to reimburse the participants on a current basis whether or not they ultimately prevailed.
the start of litigation and the change of control 
on october,farley,farley commenced a hostile tender offer for all outstanding shares of westpoint common stock.on or about november,westpoint offered the epi amendment to the program participants.krumme and each allen plaintiff accepted.
shortly thereafter,westpoint discovered that the epi amendment mistakenly provided that a percent discount rate be used in the calculation of the participants lump sum payment.westpoint had intended to use a floating rate calculated at percent of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc immediate interest rate.at all relevant times,this floating rate was percent.the relationship between the discount rate and the lump sum payment is inverse the higher the discount rate,the less the epi participant receives.as a result of the drafting error,the plaintiffs lump sum payments would have been nearly twice the present value of their epi benefits and significantly higher than payments to participants in westpoint other benefit plans.
on february,the plan committee changed the percent discount rate to the percent discount rate.we subsequently determined that westpoint acted properly in making this adjustment.see krumme,at.
by letters dated february,westpoint notified krumme and the allen plaintiffs that it had adopted a new discount rate and requested that they execute an election form.the election form provided that krumme and the allen plaintiffs could either execute a broad release of westpoint and remain eligible for the lump sum payment at the percent discount rate,or rescind the epi amendment and return to the original deferred compensation agreement,providing for monthly payments at age.the releases stated,in pertinent part 
i elect to have my deferred compensation benefit paid as a lump sum in the event of a change in control.i understand that the lump sum payment of the actuarial equivalent of my deferred compensation benefit will be in full satisfaction of all obligations of westpoint,as successor to cluett,peabody,under the terms of my deferred compensation agreement,and that in accepting a lump sum payment i shall thereby release westpoint from all obligations under the agreement.
the allen plaintiffs executed the releases and remained eligible for a lump sum payment calculated with the percent discount rate.krumme did not return the election form.
in two letters dated february,and march,krumme asserted that he and the other participants were entitled to lump sum payments calculated with the percent discount rate.krumme charged that westpoint change to the rate constituted gross and manipulation.by letter dated march,krumme claimed that a change of control from westpoint to farley had already taken place.he reasserted his claim to a lump sum payment calculated with the percent discount rate,threatened legal action and demanded attorney fees pursuant to the epi amendment.westpoint disputed each of krumme claims and denied each of his demands.
on march,krumme commenced a lawsuit charging westpoint with breach of contract,fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.he sought a money judgment against westpoint for the lump sum payment,plus interest,a declaratory judgment that the percent discount rate applied,punitive damages and costs and fees pursuant to the epi amendment.
on april,farley purchased percent of westpoint common stock,consummating the october,tender offer.that day,westpoint mailed lump sum payments to various employees who were entitled to benefits upon a change of control.the checks were accompanied by a form letter,which stated that by cashing the check,the recipients acknowledge that the company obligation to make informal payments has been fully satisfied.each of the allen plaintiffs received payments calculated with the percent discount rate and each cashed their checks without protest.
at the behest of krumme,however,the allen plaintiffs filed suit against westpoint on june,alleging breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.like krumme,who represented and continues to represent them,the allen plaintiffs claims arose out of westpoint change of the discount rate and its failure to pay upon an alleged,earlier change of control to farley.in addition,the allen plaintiffs sought equitable rescission of the releases on the bases of fraud and mutual mistake regarding the appropriate discount rate.
on august,westpoint moved to dismiss the complaint in the allen action,arguing that the allen plaintiffs had released westpoint from liability on all of their claims.on january,the district court,conboy,dismissed the complaint in its entirety.on september,we held that the complaint sufficiently alleged the elements of rescission under new york law and we remanded for further proceedings.see allen,cir,rev g wl.on remand,westpoint filed its answer and raised a number of affirmative defenses,again contending that the allen plaintiffs claims were barred by the releases.
relevant district court determinations and appeal 
in,after five years of discovery disputes,for partial summary judgment and bench trials on a number of discrete issues,the district court,scheindlin,reached the following conclusions 
the change of control had occurred on april,when farley purchased percent of westpoint common stock.therefore,westpoint had made timely lump sum payments to the allen plaintiffs under the epi amendment 
the allen plaintiffs were not entitled to rescind the releases on the basis of mutual mistake or fraud.because the releases amended and superseded the epi amendment,the allen plaintiffs lump sum payments were properly calculated using the percent discount rate 
krumme was entitled to a payment calculated using the percent discount rate because westpoint had violated erisa when it adjusted the discount rate and 
krumme and the allen plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to section of the epi amendment because their respective disputes with westpoint had arisen upon or after the april,change of control.
the parties challenged numerous aspects of the district court decision on,which we consolidated by order dated april.on appeal,we concluded that westpoint had not violated erisa by adopting the percent discount rate.see krumme,at.accordingly,we affirmed the district court decision in the allen case and vacated its decision in the krumme case.with respect to both actions,however,we conclude d that we have no jurisdiction to review the district court award of attorney fees and costs to krumme and the allen plaintiffs until the amount of those fees and costs have been set.id.we remanded for that determination.
subsequent district court proceedings 
on remand,westpoint reiterated one of the arguments that we declined to reach on appeal,that the district court attorney fees award was inconsistent with its decision to enforce the allen releases,which amended and superseded the epi amendment.westpoint sought permission to move for summary judgment on the grounds that the releases barred the allen plaintiffs claim for attorney fees.the district court concluded that it is too late to now raise a dispositive argument which could have and should have been raised earlier.
the district court then referred the case to a magistrate judge for calculation of the amount of fees,costs and interests owed by westpoint to the plaintiffs.plaintiffs entitlement to these awards and the amounts awarded are the subject of the present appeal.
discussion 
westpoint raises numerous arguments on appeal,two of which were raised,but not addressed,in its previous appeal.first,westpoint argues that krumme and the allen plaintiffs are not entitled to recover attorney fees because their disputes with westpoint arose before the april,change of control.second,westpoint argues that the allen plaintiffs are barred by the releases from collecting fees or costs pursuant to the epi amendment.
in the event that it does not prevail on those arguments,westpoint raises numerous challenges to the nature and amount of the fees,costs and interest awarded by the district court.we do not reach these additional arguments.rather,we hold that krumme is not entitled to recover attorney fees under the epi amendment because his dispute with westpoint did not arise upon or after april.with respect to the allen plaintiffs,we hold that the releases extinguished westpoint obligations under the provision.
principles of contract interpretation 
before turning to the parties arguments,we outline the general principles of contract interpretation that guide our determinations.
the parties briefs assume that new york law controls,and such implied consent is sufficient to establish choice of law.civil environmental engineers,cir.it is well settled that t he threshold question in a dispute over the meaning of a contract is whether the contract terms are ambiguous.revson cinque cinque,cir applying new york law.the language of a contract is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement.seiden assocs.anc holdings,cir quotation marks omitted.conversely,a contract is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning,unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself,and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.hunt lifschultz fast freight,cir quoting breed insurance of north america.we review the district court conclusion regarding whether a contract is clear or ambiguous de novo.tourangeau uniroyal,cir citing seiden,at.

it is within this general framework that we examine the district court interpretations of the provision and the allen releases.
provision upon or after a change of control 
the provision states,inter alia,that i f at any time upon or after a change of control there should arise any dispute as to the validity,interpretation or application of any term of the deferred compensation agreement,westpoint must pay certain costs and fees to the participants on a current basis.after examination,the district court held that the language of the provision is unambiguous.allen.at.we agree.the provision,although broad,is definite and precise and there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion as to its meaning.hunt,at quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiffs attempt to recast the provision as ambiguous and characterize the district court determination of when a dispute arose as factual is unpersuasive.essentially,we are presented with two legal applications of an unambiguous contract.given the factual findings of the district court with regard to the parties interactions,we must determine whether a dispute had arisen before or upon or after the change of control,within the meaning of the provision.this is a pure legal question which we now proceed to answer unencumbered by the deference generally accorded to the district court on a factual determination.
the district court held that a dispute had not arisen between the parties prior to the change of control because the plaintiffs right to a lump sum payment had not yet vested.see allen.at.in other words,the district court held that no dispute could have arisen between plan participants and westpoint until the april change of control because that was when the participants rights to a lump sum payment vested.
however,the district court vested rights interpretation of the provision is doubly flawed.first,it renders the words upon or after a change of control disputes arise only when rights vest,and if rights vest only upon or after a change of control,there is no reason to specify that attorney fees are available only for those disputes that arise upon or after a change of control because that is when all disputes arise.second,on its dictionary definition,discussed below,a dispute is a conflict or just a conflict or controversy over vested rights.accordingly,the district court interpretation impermissibly narrows the scope of the provision by construing the provision reference to a dispute as a reference to a dispute over vested rights.see generally american express,at,at noting that courts must not rewrite an unambiguous agreement.
the district court interpretation distorts the plain meaning of the provision,thereby rewrit ing an unambiguous agreement.american express,at,at.here,the words and phrases used by the parties must,as in all cases involving contract interpretation,be given their plain meaning,and the plain meaning of the words used by the parties to this contract do not manifest an intention to elevate the ordinary meaning of the term dispute to a stringent vested rights analysis.brooke group jch syndicate,internal citation omitted.
a dispute is defined as a conflict or controversy,an assertion of a right,claim,or demand on one side,met by contrary claims or allegations on the other,or the subject of litigation.black law dictionary ed.unabridged.a circumstance such as a dispute arises when it spring s up,originate s,or come s into being.id.at.similarly,webster defines a dispute as a verbal controversy,strife by opposing argument or expression of opposing views or claims,or a quarrel.webster third new international dictionary ed.a dispute arises when it comes about or takes place.see id.at.therefore,if a conflict,controversy or competing assertion of rights took place between westpoint and the plaintiffs prior to the april,change of control,the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover attorneys fees under the provision.
the district court findings and the undisputed evidence in the record indicate that a dispute had arisen between krumme and westpoint prior to the change of control date.the district court found that krumme had been fighting with westpoint management over his epi benefits prior to april.krumme wrote two letters of protest to westpoint asserting that percent was the proper discount rate and that a change of control had already occurred.in a third letter krumme threatened to take legal action against westpoint,which action he commenced on march.all of this occurred well in advance of the change in control date,as determined by the district court.the district court factual findings fit comfortably within the common definitions of a dispute set forth above.
in conclusion,we hold that the district court krumme and westpoint began fighting,that krumme had repeatedly asserted rights under the epi amendment,that westpoint contested krumme claims,and that krumme threatened and eventually commenced a lawsuit against a dispute under the epi amendment.because that dispute arose prior to the change of control,krumme is not entitled to recover attorney fees under the epi amendment.
we need not determine whether the allen plaintiffs dispute ar o se upon or after a change of control because,for the reasons discussed below,we hold that the allen plaintiffs released westpoint from its obligations under the provision.however,we note that the allen case presents a factually distinct scenario from krumme.the allen plaintiffs did not file suit until over a year after the change of control and,unlike in krumme,the district court did not expressly find that the allen plaintiffs had begun fighting with westpoint over their entitlement to benefits.our holding that when a dispute arises is not necessarily coterminous with when rights vest under a contract is based on the facts in the krumme case and should not be extended to the same issue in the allen case,which we do not reach.
the allen releases 
in late february,the allen plaintiffs each signed releases stating,inter alia,that the lump sum payment of the actuarial equivalent of my deferred compensation benefit will be in full satisfaction of all obligations of westpoint and that in accepting a lump sum payment i shall thereby release westpoint from all obligations under the agreement.approximately two months later,each of the allen plaintiffs accepted lump sum payments.
in their lawsuit,the allen plaintiffs sought rescission of these seemingly broad releases on the grounds of mutual mistake and fraud arising out of westpoint change to the discount rate.the district court held that the alleged mistake did not justify the drastic and extraordinary remedy of rescission.allen.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court further held that the allen plaintiffs released westpoint from any further obligation to them and that the releases amended and superseded their epi amendments.id.nevertheless,without explanation,the district court held that the allen plaintiffs were entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to the very same epi amendment.
after we declined to hear any attorney fees issues on appeal,westpoint argued on remand that the district court decision was internally inconsistent and that it had erred by failing to hold that the broad and unambiguous releases encompassed the provision.the district court held that because westpoint had failed to raise the defense prior to its appeal to this court in,it would be totally inappropriate for the court to now permit westpoint to take a second bite of the apple.in effect,the district court found that westpoint had forfeited its defense by failing to raise it in a timely manner.
forfeiture of the release defense 
the parties approach this issue from a number of different angles.westpoint argues in its opening brief that it did not waive the release defense as to attorney fees and that,in any case,this court should exercise its discretion to hear this issue because it is a pure question of law and injustice would result by leaving untouched an internally inconsistent district court opinion.in response,the allen plaintiffs argue that westpoint should not be permitted to raise an issue for the first time on appeal because it will prejudice the allen plaintiffs and reward westpoint bad faith tactics,and the district court correctly found that westpoint forfeited the defense.
as an initial matter,this issue is properly framed as one relating to forfeiture,not waiver.unlike a waiver,which is an intentional relinquishment of a known right,a forfeiture occurs w here a litigant action or inaction is deemed to incur the consequence of loss of a right,or,as here,a defense.hamilton atlas turner,cir.however,because we choose to exercise our discretion to reach this issue whether or not it was raised below,we do not address whether the district court abused it discretion in finding a forfeiture.see diesel town of lewisboro,wl,at cir,recognizing that we have discretion to address the merits of an otherwise waived argument.
it is the general rule,of course,that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.singleton wulff,d see also vintero corporacion venezolana de fomento,cir a party who has not raised an issue below is precluded from raising it for the first time on appeal.internal quotation marks omitted.in singleton,the supreme court explained the rule rationale 
the rule is essential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues and in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence.

in keeping with this rationale,we have repeatedly recognized that the rule is not an absolute bar where the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional or where consideration of the issue is necessary to avoid manifest injustice.readco,marine midland bank,cir see also greene united states,cir.diesel,at refusing to exercise discretion where the argument requires new evidence or factual findings internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,where an allegedly forfeited claim raises a pure question of law,we may choose to reach the merits.baker dorfman,wl,cir.
westpoint has easily met this standard.the facts underlying the scope of the releases have been fully set out during a decade of litigation.whether the releases,the scope and effect of which are unambiguous,relieve westpoint obligation to pay attorney fees under the epi amendment is purely a question of law.see revson,at under new york law,the meaning of a contract that is unambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide.the allen plaintiffs argue that they will be prejudiced if we exercise our discretion to hear this issue.in particular,they contend that the district court equitable decision not to rescind the releases would have come out differently if the district court had known that the allen plaintiffs would not recover attorney fees.
