javier and eva carrizales plaintiffs urge that texas standardized homeowners insurance policy with state farm lloyds state farm covers mold contamination resulting from a plumbing leak.the district court determined that it did not and entered summary judgment in favor of state farm.plaintiffs also challenge the district court trial instruction to the jury that the failure to mitigate damages is a condition precedent to recovery.we affirm on the former conclusion but must reverse and remand for a new trial on the jury instruction.plaintiffs duty to mitigate may reduce their damage recovery from the insurance company,but it is no affirmative defense to the company liability.
plaintiffs hold a standardized insurance policy issued by state farm the texas standardized homeowners b form b.they filed a claim with state farm for damages resulting from a plumbing leak in their garage.because the cost of repair was less than their deductible,state farm did not pay any benefits.plaintiffs then submitted additional claims,and state farm,after inspection and investigation,paid.
for the next year and a half,plaintiffs lived in an apartment,for which state farm paid an additional in living expenses.no significant repairs to the house were begun during that vacancy,and the air conditioner and other utilities were turned off.after filing suit,plaintiffs submitted three mold remediation claims,totaling more than,which were denied.
plaintiffs sued state farm for alleged violations of the insurance code,breach of the insurance contract,and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing state farm removed to federal court.the case was handled at one time or another by four district judges,including judge hinojosa,who granted in part and denied in part state farm motion for summary judgment,concluding that form b excludes coverage for mold damage to the dwelling.summary judgment was also granted on plaintiffs common law and statutory good faith claims.
the case proceeded to trial,shepherded by judge hudspeth.based on judge hinojosa summary judgment ruling,judge hudspeth excluded evidence of mold damage.at the close of evidence,the court formulated the jury charge so as to require mitigation of damages on the part of plaintiffs as a condition precedent to state farm liability.the jury found for state farm.
plaintiffs challenge judge hinojosa grant of summary judgment and judge hudspeth determination that the law of the case precluded reconsideration of the mold issue.we do not reach the second question,because we determine that mold is not covered under form plaintiffs further challenge the verdict and the jury instruction requiring mitigation of damages as a condition precedent to recovery.
we review a summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as did the district court.united states lawrence,cir.summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
because the texas supreme court has not addressed whether form b covers mold damage that results from plumbing leaks,we make an erie guess as to how the state supreme court would decide the issue.erie tompkins.mayo hartford life ins,cir.insurance contracts are subject to normal rules of contract construction.union fire ins.cbi.it follows that all parts of the contract must be read together so as to give effect to the parties intent.state farm life ins.beaston,citing forbau aetna life ins.we must,however,be particularly wary of isolating from its surroundings or considering apart from other provisions a single phrase,sentence,or section of a contract.id.
ambiguities in insurance contracts giving rise to two reasonable interpretations,one providing and the other denying coverage,are read contra proferentem and in favor of the insured.puckett fire ins.the principle of contra proferentem applies only if the contract is ambiguous.id.ambiguity is a question of law for the court.sharp state farm fire cas.ins,cir citing union,at.the fact that the parties disagree as to the contract coverage does not create an ambiguity.id.
the primary issue involves the interaction of two provisions in form mold exclusion and the exclusion repeal provision.because the interaction of the two provisions creates no ambiguity,mold is not covered.
form b divides coverage into two discrete subdivisions,a and coverage a covers all risks to the dwelling unless specifically excluded by section section i.coverage b insures personal property against certain,enumerated perils,including,in subsection nine,damage from plumbing leaks section.subheading of section i lists exclusions,of which only the first eight are referenced in the exclusion repeal provision mold is one of those exclusions the dispositive issue,then,is whether coverage b exclusion repeal provision also repeals section i with respect to coverage 
in balandran safeco ins,which plaintiffs argue compels a result in their favor,the court held that section repealed section i exclusion of foundation damage caused by a plumbing leak under coverage a.the court advanced two reasons in reaching that decision.first,it opined that the exclusion repeal provision could be located under coverage b simply because that is the only place in the policy that the accidental discharge risk is specifically described.id.at.
the court second conclusion followed closely from the first.reading the entire contract so as to give meaning to every clause,the court viewed the exclusion repeal provision language to require an application to the dwelling because exclusion h on its face applies only to damage to the dwelling.id.in other words,the exclusion repeal provision would never repeal unless it repealed it in respect to coverage a.this result led to an ambiguity,because the insurers argument against coverage was also reasonable.applying contra proferentem,the court held that form b covered foundation damage caused by plumbing leaks.
that line of reasoning is not persuasive in our case.the two conclusions are not really independent the first makes sense only in light of the second.if the contract could have been read such that one part of it would not have been a nullity,the location of the exclusion repeal provision would not have been evidence in favor of coverage.as the dissent and the insurer urged,t he word loss in the exclusion repeal provision can reasonably refer only to the type of loss at issue in coverage b,which is personal property loss.id.at owen,dissenting.in other words,the location of the exclusion repeal provision in the contract would have controlled.
because the second conclusion is ultimately controlling,we begin there.the balandran court did not say that section of coverage b repealed all covered exclusions for both itself and coverage rather,the court reasoned that with respect to,the words e xclusions.through.under section i exclusions do not apply to loss by this peril would be wholly inoperative,because exclusion by its terms applies only to coverage a.such is not the case with exclusion.section operation on exclusion.f gives effect precisely to what its location in the text of form b implies mold damage to personal property caused by accidental discharge is covered.
to decide that form b covers mold damage resulting from discharge,leakage,or overflow from plumbing would eviscerate the mold exclusion entirely.the most recent mold decision by the texas supreme court confirms this.
we earlier certified to that court the question whether the ensuing loss provision contained in section,part f when read in conjunction with the remainder of the policy,provide s coverage for mold contamination caused by water damage that is otherwise covered by the policy.fiess state farm lloyds,cir.the court answered that question with a broadly phrased and unambiguous no.fiess state farm lloyds.the court said that w hile other parts of the policy sometimes made it difficult to decipher,we can not hold that mold damage is covered when the policy says it is not.id.at.
first,the court noted that the words we do not cover loss caused by mold in section i are plain and unambiguous.id.second,the ensuing loss provision did not rewrite the first line to say we do too cover loss caused by mold.id.with respect to what exactly the ensuing loss provision accomplished,the court reaffirmed that the only reasonable construction of this clause was that it applied when an excluded risk was followed by an intervening occurrence that in turn caused an ensuing loss.id.at.notwithstanding balandran,fiess shows an obvious direction in the texas supreme court mold jurisprudence that is easier to reconcile with the result we reach in this case than with the result plaintiffs ask us to announce.
water must be present for mold to grow.if every plumbing leak were a way around the mold exclusion,that exclusion would be meaningless.although plaintiffs ask us to adopt just such a position,the texas supreme court has said that we must be wary of turning an insurance contract into a maintenance agreement.see id.at.if section is expanded,as appellants in fiess sought the ensuing loss provision to be expanded,the mold exclusion would be nugatory.
the answer to the balandran court first conclusion,then,is that although the exclusion repeal provision is in the section dealing with plumbing leaks,it does not follow that every exclusion is repealed with respect to plumbing leaks.rather,we are to look at each provision and determine whether the court can still give effect to it in light of the exclusion repeal provision.as it stands,we can not envision the role the mold exclusion would play if coverage a implicitly as well as coverage b explicitly covered mold damage resulting from plumbing leaks.
the question in this case is not whether insurers should provide mold coverage in texas,a public policy question beyond our jurisdiction as a court.the question instead is whether the language in an insurance policy provides such more and no less.id.at.here it does not 
plaintiffs next contend that the jury instruction incorrectly required them to mitigate damages as a condition precedent to recovery.we review jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.see,fiber.int l,roehrs,cir.courts are given wide latitude in formulating jury charges.united states monroe,cir.to establish error,the challenging party must first show the instruction as a whole creates substantial doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided.green adm rs of tulane educ.fund,cir.
the plaintiffs only remaining claims before the jury were its breach of contract claims.plaintiffs asserted state farm breached the policy by failing to adequately investigate losses claimed by plaintiffs failing to pay the cost of repair or replacement of the dwelling failing to pay the costs of repair or replacement of personal property and failing to pay additional living expenses.the jury charge contained a number of specific instructions,among which were 
conditions precedent to suit 
you are instructed that plaintiffs contract with defendant state farm lloyds requires plaintiff to give prompt written notice to defendant of the facts relating to the claim.the contract also requires plaintiffs to protect property from further damage and to make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect the property from further damage.
this instruction was based on state farm claimed affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages the charge also contained a number of interrogatories related to the plaintiffs duties under the policy,particularly the duty to mitigate damages,which it framed as an affirmative defense,that is,a condition precedent to recovery the plaintiffs argue that mitigation of damages was an issue that the jury should decide in determining the amount of damage to award,not a condition hence affirmative liability.we agree.

suit against us.no suit or action can be brought unless the policy provisions have been complied with 
the policy language firmly requires homeowners to take steps to ensure prompt,correct adjustments of loss claims,but it does not expressly render these conditions as prerequisites to recovery.consequently,texas courts have concluded that while some of the duties after loss are conditions precedent,others are not.see progressive county mut.ins.trevino,notice provision is condition precedent to recovery beacon national ins.glaze,repair records provision is not condition precedent to recovery lambrecht assocs.state farm lloyds,police report is not condition precedent to recovery.even the decisions finding a condition precedent agree that prejudice is required for the term to preclude coverage.see harwell state farm mut.auto.ins.texas courts have not yet ruled on whether the duty to mitigate damages is a condition precedent or an offset to reimbursement under the generic homeowners policy.we make an erie guess on this question and conclude that mitigation of damages is an offset to damages rather than a condition precedent to recovery under texas law.
in general,the duty to mitigate damages is an equitable doctrine,and means a reduction in the amount of damages,not an affirmative defense.see generally damages see also hygeia dairy gonzalez.in the insurance law context,two important authorities have described the duty as a condition precedent to recovery but they also state that the breach of the duty relieves the insurer only of any increase in loss caused by the breach.see appleman,insurance law and practice couch on insurance see also higginbotham new hampshire indem,so d.thus,the insurer still has the evidentiary burden of demonstrating the extent to which breach of the duty to mitigate lessens the insurer liability.
to the extent that a homeowner duty of mitigation can be informed by other sources of texas law,we note that texas rule of civil procedure does not list mitigation of damages among the affirmative defenses that must be pled.see also moulton alamo ambulance serv,failure to mitigate damages by care and treatment of personal injuries is not an affirmative defense which must be specifically pleaded to let in evidence of such failure and to entitle the wrongdoer to proper court instructions.furthermore,texas applies the principle that the failure to mitigate damages is an offset against damages in the deceptive trade practices dtpa,employment and contexts.see.jur d employer and employee employment regency advantage.bingo,pinson red arrow freight lines,dtpa.
contrary to state farm position,a holding that an insured duty to mitigate is an affirmative defense to recovery under a homeowners insurance policy would be inconsistent with the decisions that only bar recovery for noncompliance with certain policy conditions,the duty to give timely notice if the insurer is prejudiced.conversely,reducing the homeowner recovery for failure to mitigate is more analogous to the prejudice bar,as both standards relieve the insurer of its contractual responsibility only in proportion to the seriousness of the homeowner default.barring all recovery for failure to mitigate is an onerous consequence not in keeping with the rule that ambiguous policy provisions are construed in favor of the insured.see,highlands ins,see also empire fire marine ins.brantley trucking,cir.
for all these reasons,we conclude that the failure to mitigate damages is an offset to recovery under the generic homeowners policy,and the district court erred and abused its discretion when it instructed the jury that mitigation was a condition precedent to recovery.accordingly,we reverse and remand for a new trial related to plaintiffs breach of contract claims 
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
i concur in the judgment and agree with the holding that mold damage to the carrizales dwelling caused by plumbing leaks is not covered under form b of the texas standardized homeowners policy issued by state farm.i write in the hope that it will be useful to review the texas law on mold damage under the current policy language.
as noted by the majority,the policy divides coverage into coverage a dwelling,insuring against risk of physical loss to the dwelling,and coverage b personal property,insuring against loss to personal property caused by specific,enumerated perils.the policy specifically excludes from coverage all loss caused by mold there are two policy provisions that could possibly negate this general mold exclusion.the first is the ensuing loss provision of the mold exclusion itself,which states in relevant part we do cover ensuing loss caused by water damage although mold is certainly caused by water,texas law controls our decision and the texas supreme court has refused to read the ensuing loss provision as providing coverage for damage in mold cases.see fiess state farm lloyds.
the second provision that could negate the mold exclusion is the exclusion repeal provision,which is located textually in coverage b.this provision was not at issue in fiess.see fiess,at.subsection of coverage b affords coverage for loss to personal property from plumbing leaks.it then provides that e xclusions.a through including the mold exclusion of.f under section i exclusions do not apply to loss caused by this peril.it is clear from the plain language of this provision that the exclusion for loss to personal property from mold caused by plumbing leaks is repealed.in other words,the exclusion repeal provision reinstates coverage for mold damage to personal property that arises from a plumbing leak.the question is whether this provision applies to any loss or only to losses to personal property under coverage b.the carrizaleses would have this provision also repeal the exclusion to coverage a for loss to the dwelling caused by mold arising from plumbing leaks.
the carrizaleses rely on balandran safeco ins.of america,where the texas supreme court held that the exclusion repeal provision repealed exclusion.for foundation damage in a dwelling and reinstated coverage even though the repeal provision was textually located within coverage b.the balandran court read the exclusion to apply to the limited dwelling damage of because of its concern with affording meaning to all policy language.see id.at we must read all parts of the contract together,striving to give meaning to every sentence,clause,and word to avoid rendering any portion inoperative the insurer construction of the policy renders a part of the policy language meaningless.internal citation omitted.because exclusion applies only to the limited dwelling and not to personal property losses,its inclusion in the list of provisions that are repealed would be meaningless if the repeal was not meant to reinstate coverage for that loss to the dwelling in coverage id.at.in other words,because exclusion does not apply to personal property,it would not be necessary to include in the repeal the repeal provision reinstated coverage for that peril with respect to coverage 
in the instant case,the same concern for affording meaning to all policy language is not present.unlike exclusion,the mold exclusion in.f applies to both dwelling and personal property loss.because mold can affect both real and personal property,the policy language is not left without meaning by concluding that the exclusion repeal provision reinstates coverage for mold only for losses to personal property in coverage rather,coverage b appears specifically intended to provide greater coverage for such a loss to personal property.see salinas allstate texas lloyd,d.
the plaintiffs argument for the exclusion repeal provision to reinstate coverage for exclusion.f with respect to the dwelling in coverage a ignores the structure of the policy.coverage b insures against risks to personal property from specific perils,one of which is plumbing leaks.the exclusion repeal provision expressly negates exclusion.f with respect to loss caused by this peril.the peril referred to is plumbing leaks which affect the personal property of the insured.other than balandran,which is distinguishable,there is no reason apparent in the policy to apply the exclusion repeal provision to the dwelling in coverage 
the majority,and some district court opinions,have reached a similar result and found support in the texas supreme court decision in fiess.although fiess found no mold coverage,it concerned a wholly separate part of the ensuing loss is inapposite.
this case involves a standard form policy mandated by the texas insurance commissioner.see fiess,at balandran,at.ann.if state regulators want to require the exclusion repeal provision to reinstate mold coverage for damage to a dwelling under coverage a they could do so by simply amending the form to read,exclusions.a through under section i exclusions do not apply to loss to the dwelling or personal property caused by this peril.as currently drafted,the exclusion repeal provision with respect to mold applies only to personal property.
finally,i agree that if plaintiffs proved damages not attributed to mold damage to the dwelling or to state farm refusal to cover that,and not to the plaintiffs failure to mitigate same,the judgment must be reversed.i do not understand what part of the judgment we are affirming.
i would affirm the judgment.i concur in the majority opinion in regard to the coverage issue,but i respectfully dissent from part,regarding the duty to protect property,because the majority finds ambiguity in the contract where there is none it misinterprets texas caselaw and policy and it misapplies the abuse of discretion standard.
we review jury instruction for abuse of discretion.see,fiber.int l roehrs,cir.a instruction should not be reversed unless,as a whole,it does not correctly reflect the law.united states stephens,cir.because here the instruction as a whole correctly reflects the law,we should affirm.
fairness requires we begin with the text of the instruction.interrogatory reads,do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiffs failed to protect their property from further damage and to make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect their property from further damage the jury answered yes,so judgment was entered in favor of the insurer state farm.
it is important to quote the instruction as a whole,because it follows the duties imposed by the insurance contract on the plaintiffs,javier and eva carrizales.the instruction tracks the language found in the duties after loss section of the contract,which provides in part as follows 
duties after loss.
your duties after loss.in case of a loss to covered property caused by a peril insured against,you must 
give prompt notice to us of the facts relating to the claim.
notify the police in case of loss by theft.
a protect the property from further damage.
b make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect the property.
furnish a complete inventory of damaged personal property showing the quantity,description and amount of loss.attach all bills,receipts and related documents which you have that justify the figures in the inventory.
as often as this company reasonably requires 
a provide this company access to the damaged property.
b provide this company with pertinent records and documents requested and permit copies to be made.
c submit to examination under oath and sign and swear to it.
suits against us.no suit or action can be brought unless the policy provisions have been complied with 
the issue is whether duty is a condition precedent.because the texas supreme court has not ruled on that issue,we must make an as to what that court would do.mayo hartford life ins,cir.
