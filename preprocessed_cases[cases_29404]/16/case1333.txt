this appeal presents yet another set of facts upon which we must determine whether the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,preempts certain state law claims.more specifically,the sole issue we decide in this appeal is whether erisa preempts a state law breach of contract claim and an alternatively pled state law unjust enrichment claim brought by a company hired to perform only administrative services,under the portion of an employee health care benefit plan covered by erisa,against the sponsor of such plan for reimbursement of in nondiscretionary payments the company fronted to satisfy benefit claims,when the plan administrator,with full discretion to determine whether a claim for benefits should be paid or denied and who also served as the sponsor chief financial officer expressly acknowledged the debt and recommended to the sponsor chief executive officer that it should be paid and resolution of either claim requires no interpretation of the plan terms nor is it in any way dependant upon the plan being governed by erisa.after careful consideration,we hold that erisa preempts neither state law claim at issue in this appeal.accordingly,we affirm the district court entry of judgment in favor of the company following the grant of the company motion for summary judgment.
effective september,the defendant in this case,information systems and networks isn,established a health care benefit plan for the purpose of providing certain health care benefits to its covered employees and their dependents the plan.the parties agree that the plan is governed by erisa.
isn is the plan sponsor,as that term is defined by erisa.b the term plan sponsor means i the employer in the case of an employee benefit plan established or maintained by a single employer.isn operated the plan pursuant to the written terms of a summary plan description.the plan designated isn chief financial officer,charles bonuccelli cfo bonuccelli as the plan administrator as that term is defined by erisa.a the term administrator means i the person specifically so designated by the terms of the instrument under which the plan is operated.
isn purchased insurance from the plaintiff in this case,life and annuity insurance company,to cover some benefits under the plan,for example,accidental death benefits.isn also contracted separately with to provide coverage for the amount any claims by an employee or dependent exceeded per month in the aggregate.
relevant to the preemption issue we decide in the present appeal,in a separate and distinct contractual agreement between isn and the services agreement,isn also hired to perform certain administrative services under the plan.state law claims against isn in this case both arise from performance of only one of these nondiscretionary administrative services,namely,duty to front the payment of claims made by isn employees and their dependents for benefits under the plan.isn,in turn,agreed to reimburse for any such payments.
notably,the plan stated the following with respect to the roles of the plan administrator the plan administrator and with respect to the portion of the plan 
medical,prescription drug,dental and vision benefits 
the plan administrator has complete authority to control and manage the plan.the plan administrator has full discretion to determine eligibility,to interpret the plan and to determine whether a claim should be paid or denied,according to the provisions of the plan as set forth in this booklet.
the employer is fully responsible for the benefits.processes claims and provides other services to the employer related to the benefits.does not insure or guarantee the benefits.
article of the services agreement confirms that,at all times,isn retained the authority to control and manage the plan 
isn acknowledges that it has authority to control and manage the operation of the plan.it is expressly agreed that under no circumstances will be designated as plan administrator or a fiduciary of the plan.nothing herein will be deemed to constitute a party to the plan or to confer upon any authority or control respecting management of the plan,authority or responsibility in connection with administration of the plan or responsibility for the terms or validity of the plan.
by letter dated december,isn notified of its intention to terminate their contractual relationship effective february.thereafter,pursuant to the services agreement,demanded that isn reimburse it,representing the balance amount of benefit claims paid out on behalf of isn under the portion of the plan.in the spring of,collection representative spoke with cfo bonuccelli about the outstanding balance.over the course of an period,issued a series of letters,some with supporting documentation and some without,to isn seeking payment of the outstanding balance.
after reviewing the documentation provided by as to the benefit payments at issue,cfo bonuccelli acknowledged the validity of demand for reimbursement of the and recommended to isn president and chief executive officer roma malkani ceo malkani,on at least two occasions,that isn satisfy demand.but each time,without explanation,ceo malkani refused to reimburse,and continues steadfastly to do so.notably,isn does not dispute that,pursuant to obligations under the services agreement,fronted on behalf of isn to satisfy claims for benefits under the plan.
with no hope of isn voluntarily reimbursing it the,on april,filed the present civil action against isn in federal court in maryland,based upon diversity jurisdiction.the complaint alleged two alternative common law causes of action under maryland of contract and unjust enrichment.as should be obvious by now,the crux of both causes of action is that isn owes for breach of the services agreement.to be clear,claims against isn arose exclusively under the services agreement.
isn moved to dismiss complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,on the grounds that state law breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims were preempted by erisa,a,and that lacked standing to assert any claims under erisa civil enforcement provision,id.at.the district court denied the motion,but noted that isn would have the opportunity to reassert its erisa preemption argument in a future motion for summary judgment.isn then filed its answer to complaint,asserting,inter alia,erisa as an affirmative defense to both claims.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment,with isn motion asserting erisa preemption as its sole basis.in fact,in its opposition to plaintiff life annuity insurance company motion for summary judgment and for summary judgment,filed with the district court,isn expressly recognize d that the payments made by plaintiff pursuant to the health plan,if not for erisa,would be reimbursable if erisa had not been implicated.
the district court rejected isn erisa preemption argument,denied its motion for summary judgment,and granted summary judgment for in favor of with respect to breach of contract claim.this timely appeal by isn followed.
as its sole challenge to the judgment below,isn argues that the district court erred in concluding that erisa does not preempt either of state law claims.as isn seeks to use erisa as an affirmative defense to state law claims,isn bears the burden of proving the defense applicability.see bank of louisiana aetna healthcare,cir when defendant uses erisa preemption as an affirmative defense to plaintiff state law claims,defendant bears burden of proof that defense applies,cert.denied,d.metro.life ins.taylor,d federal is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff suit.isn presents no specific argument in challenge to the district court ruling on the merit of breach of contract claim.accordingly,the sole issue presented in this appeal is whether isn has carried its burden of showing that erisa preempts state law breach of contract claim as well as its alternative and virtually identical state law claim for unjust enrichment.
our review of this issue on appeal from the grant of summary judgment is de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to isn,the nonmoving party.see holland washington hom
