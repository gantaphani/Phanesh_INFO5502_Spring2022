orchard hill master fund,fore multi strategy master fund,silverback arbitrage master fund limited,smi defensive lp,and capital ventures international collectively,plaintiffs appeal from an october,judgment entered in the southern district of new york batts,granting sba communications corporation sbac motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs owned two convertible notes issued by sbac.after converting the notes into equity cash,plaintiffs brought this breach of contract claim,alleging that sbac failed to pay the interest owed on the underlying notes following the conversion.the district court dismissed the claim with prejudice,holding that there was no reasonable interpretation of the underlying contract that entitled the plaintiffs to both the benefits of the conversion and the final interest payment.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the contract unambiguously entitled them to the interest payment.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue that the contract was ambiguous and that the court should have conducted fact finding to allow the plaintiffs to submit evidence of industry custom and usage for similar convertible debt instruments.plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred by denying plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs complaint.
background 
plaintiffs held two sets of sbac issued convertible notes collectively,notes.one set of notes was issued in and matured in,and the other was issued in and matured in.the notes were hybrid instruments pursuant to which plaintiffs lent money to sbac,and in return,plaintiffs received periodic interest payments.plaintiffs also had the option to convert the notes into sbac shares or into cash.sbac issued the notes pursuant to two indentures that were substantively identical to one another except for the applicable interest rates,dates,and offering amounts.the indentures dictated the terms of the notes and the obligations of the parties.plaintiffs converted their notes into equity shares cash near the date at which the notes were to mature.plaintiffs assert that under the indentures sbac was required to pay them interest after the conversions.
structure of the interest payments 
section c of the indentures payment of interest clause states the parties obligations surrounding interest payments.the provision states in part that 
interest shall be payable on the two interest payment dates of each year to the person in whose name any note is registered on the register at the close of business on any regular record date with respect to the applicable interest payment date,except that the interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal amount is paid.
under the indentures,therefore,sbac was required to pay interest to noteholders on specified dates interest payment dates which were scheduled every six months throughout the term of the notes.two weeks before every interest payment date was a regular record date.the noteholders on the regular record date were entitled to receive the interest payment for the upcoming interest payment date.as noted above,the payment of interest clause creates an exception to this arrangement such that the final interest payment would be paid to the person to whom the principal would be paid.
section b of the indentures payment on maturity provision describes the parties obligations if a noteholder declines to convert the notes before the maturity date.section b states 
the notes shall mature on the maturity date,unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with the provisions hereof.on the maturity date,each holder shall be entitled to receive on such date in cash for each principal amount of notes,together with accrued and unpaid interest to,but not including,the maturity date.
b.the wash clause and maturity exception 
under the terms of the indentures,plaintiffs had the right to convert their notes at any time up until two trading days before the maturity date.at.plaintiffs refer to the later portion of section c as the wash clause.the wash clause applies to noteholders who convert their notes during the two week period after the regular record date but before the interest payment date.the wash clause provides 
notwithstanding the payment of interest clause any notes surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the regular record date for an interest payment date but prior to the applicable interest payment date shall be accompanied by payment from the holder of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such interest payment date.
thus,if a noteholder converts between the regular record date and the interest payment date,the payment by the noteholder under the wash clause cancels out the interest payment received by the noteholder on the interest payment date.a noteholder who wishes to avoid the impact of the wash clause and receive both the interest payment and equity shares cash may choose to hold the note until it receives the interest payment and then convert the note after the interest payment date.
section c i maturity exception states that no wash clause payment need be made with respect to conversions after the close of business on the final regular record date prior to the maturity date.at.plaintiffs allege that market convention has developed the maturity exception to allow noteholders who want to convert and receive the final interest payment and who would have converted immediately after the interest payment date in other periods,to do so in the final period.
plaintiffs conversions 
plaintiffs were noteholders on the final regular record date of the notes term but converted their notes prior to the maturity date.plaintiffs thus converted their notes during the final period.pursuant to the maturity exception to the wash clause,plaintiffs did not pay sbac in the amount of interest payable on the maturity date.sbac did not pay plaintiffs the interest on the notes for the final six month period.plaintiffs assert that under the plain language and structure of the indentures,sbac was obligated to pay them interest because they were noteholders on the final regular record date and received conversion compensation on the maturity date.plaintiffs contend that sbac has improperly withheld more than million in accrued interest.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed suit against sbac in the supreme court of new york,new york county on november.in their complaint,plaintiffs assert two identical causes of action a breach of contract claim for each set of notes.one month after suit was filed,sbac removed the case to federal court.sbac moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion,holding that there was no reasonable interpretation of the underlying contract that entitled the plaintiffs to both the benefits of the conversion and the final interest payment.plaintiffs appeal.
