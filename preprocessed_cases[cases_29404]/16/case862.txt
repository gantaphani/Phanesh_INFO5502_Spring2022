background 
plaintiff is a nondenominational ministry providing religious services and other assistance to migrant farm workers in eastern new york state.defendant is a national food service provider headquartered in connecticut that provides food and related services for,inter alia,outdoor public events such as the event at the heart of this appeal.
on april,defendant entered into a food,beverage,and merchandise concession agreement with the promoter of woodstock,a outdoor concert in saugerties,new york.to staff its concession stands,defendant solicited local nonprofit organizations to provide volunteer labor in return for a share of the profits.plaintiff accepted defendant offer,and the two parties signed a contract in august.under the contract,plaintiff was to receive between seven and eight percent of the gross sales of the food booths its volunteers managed.on appeal,the parties dispute how many volunteers plaintiff was to provide under the contract.plaintiff alleges that it was a maximum of twenty volunteers per booth per day,while defendant claims that it was a maximum of twenty volunteers per booth per shift with several shifts each day.regardless of what the contract provided,the parties agree that plaintiff supplied over volunteers.
woodstock did not go as planned.according to plaintiff,the individuals managing the festival were incapable of dealing with the severe weather and unruly crowds.hundreds of people entered the concert without paying and widespread looting of concession stands occurred.plaintiff alleges that defendant failed to provide adequate food,kitchen staff,and restroom facilities,failed to sell the festival scrips that concert attendees needed to buy concession stand food,failed to keep the booths open and accessible,and failed to provide adequate protection from looters.plaintiff also alleges that it did not receive payment under the contract.
in july,plaintiff filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,asserting causes of action based on quantum meruit,unjust enrichment,and breach of contract.jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship.the complaint sought a judgment for the full value of the services plaintiff provided to defendant or alternatively for damages incurred by defendant breach of contract in the approximate amount of plus interest.the complaint further sought punitive damages,costs,and attorney fees.
by order dated january,then district court judge barrington parker,granted defendant motion for summary judgment on plaintiff quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims to the extent that plaintiff sought damages based on the number of hours worked by the volunteers.the court held that such wage based damages could be at by the volunteers themselves.the court left open for trial,however,whether plaintiff could recover quantum meruit damages based on another theory.the court denied plaintiff for summary judgment on the quantum meruit claim.
visiting district court judge samuel conti of the northern district of california took over the case in july.prior to trial,he ruled,based on judge parker earlier order precluding a measure of damages,that plaintiff could not introduce evidence related to the value of the work of its volunteers.judge conti explained any costs that plaintiff expended in getting the extra people would be quantum meruit costs,but any amount of money attributable to them,to their worth is their own private cause of action,as i read judge parker order.after all evidence had been presented at trial,judge conti determined that any remaining quantum meruit claims were subsumed by the contract claim.the court dismissed the quantum meruit claim while allowing the contract claim to proceed.
the jury found defendant liable for breach of contract,but awarded damages of only.pursuant to an indemnity clause in the parties contract,plaintiff sought in attorney fees and in costs.the district court agreed that the contract entitled plaintiff to recover reasonable attorney fees,but the court set the awarded amount at,well below plaintiff request.the court based its reduction of the award on defendant earlier offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure,the small size of the damages award,and the arrangement between plaintiff and its attorney.both parties appealed.
discussion 
quantum meruit and unjust enrichment 
plaintiff claims that t he district court erred when it determined that plaintiff did not have standing to pursue quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims.this is not,however,what the district court held.rather,judges parker and conti held that because plaintiff lacked standing to bring suit on behalf of its volunteers,plaintiff could not measure damages in the quantum meruit action by reference to a valuation of the volunteers work.the court left open the possibility that could recover quantum meruit damages on a theory that was not.when the district court ultimately dismissed the quantum meruit claim,it did so not for lack of standing but rather because the evidence adduced at trial had demonstrated that the quantum meruit claim was indistinguishable from the contract claim.
plaintiff brief does not make clear whether it seeks to sue in quantum meruit on its own behalf,on behalf of its volunteers,or both.plaintiff opening brief,for example,claims that the district court holding on standing was erroneous because plaintiff had brought the quantum meruit claims on its own behalf and not on behalf of its volunteers.later in that same argument section,however,plaintiff explains that it has standing to sue as a representative of the volunteers.in one particularly confusing sentence,plaintiff argues that it has standing to bring such claims on its own behalf based on matter of dental society of the state of new york carey,in which a professional society was found to have standing to sue on behalf of its members emphasis added.
despite these points of confusion,we will construe the briefs liberally as raising an objection to the district court quantum meruit ruling in its entirety.paramedics electromedicina comercial,ltda.ge med.info,cir reaching a claim where certain language in the brief could be liberally construed as raising it.we will also assume that plaintiff intends to raise the quantum meruit claims both on its own behalf and on behalf of its volunteers.see id.reviewing the issues de novo,we affirm the judgment of the district court.see shain ellison,cir the existence of standing is a question of law that we review de novo.grochowski phoenix,cir noting that this court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo.
plaintiff has standing to sue on its own behalf but not on behalf of its volunteers.
where,as here,jurisdiction is predicated on diversity of citizenship,a plaintiff must have standing under both article iii of the constitution and applicable state law in order to maintain a cause of action.see bano union carbide,cir applying federal law of standing in a diversity action and holding that plaintiff organizations lacked standing to bring damages claims belonging to their members official comm.of the unsecured creditors of color tile,coopers lybrand,llp,cir applying state law of standing in a diversity action to determine if plaintiffs had standing to bring claims of breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract see also metro.express,city of kansas city,cir holding that a plaintiff in a diversity action must establish standing under applicable state law as well as under article iii.applying new york and federal law,we hold that plaintiff has standing to bring suit on its own behalf for injuries it sustained as an organization but that it lacks standing to sue on behalf of its volunteers.
we address first plaintiff standing to sue as a representative of the volunteers.to the extent that the volunteers in the instant dispute were members of the plaintiff claims that at least some of them standing inquiry turns on whether plaintiff has associational or organizational standing to sue on behalf of its members.under new york and federal law,an organization may sue as a representative of its members only if the members have standing to sue in their own right.united food commercial workers union local brown group,d quoting hunt washington state apple adver.comm n,d see mfy legal,dudley,is an indispensable requirement for standing.see jenkins united states,cir new york propane gas ass new york state dep t of state,dep t same.plaintiff argues that its volunteers were injured because they had donated valuable labor to the ministry,and the ministry had not been fully compensated for it.we need not reach the question of whether the member volunteers allegedly unfulfilled interest in seeing that plaintiff received the compensation for which they had worked gave rise to an,because even if we were to hold that they suffered a legally cognizable injury,the extent of the injury would vary among the member volunteers,who did not all invest the same amount of labor.the need for an individualized inquiry would defeat the association standing,because a plaintiff normally lacks associational standing to sue on behalf of its members where the fact and extent of injury would require individualized proof.bano,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.we know of no supreme court or federal court of appeals ruling that an association has standing to pursue damages claims on behalf of its members.
to the extent that plaintiff seeks to sue on behalf of volunteers who are not members,it may pursue its claim only on a theory of standing.in addition to meeting the constitutional prerequisites of standing,namely,causation,and redressability,a plaintiff seeking standing in federal court must also satisfy the prudential prerequisites of standing by demonstrating a close relation to the injured third party and a hindrance to that party ability to protect its own interests.lewis thompson,cir citations omitted.plaintiff lacks standing because it has not demonstrated a hindrance to the volunteers ability to protect their own interests.
whether plaintiff has standing to sue on its own behalf presents an entirely different question.see irish lesbian gay org.giuliani,cir dudley,at.there is no doubt that an organization may sue on its own behalf for injuries it has sustained.see irish lesbian gay,at mixon grinker,dep t.in accordance with basic principles of standing under state and federal law,however,the plaintiff must allege an that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and which is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.jenkins united states,at emphasis omitted see soc y of the plastics,county of suffolk.here,plaintiff alleges that it expended resources as an organization to locate,recruit,manage,train,and supply volunteers to defendant beyond what was required by their contract,and that defendant failure to compensate plaintiff for those extra services constitutes unjust enrichment.we agree with the district court that this claim satisfies standing requirements under new york and federal law.
b.the existence of a valid contract nevertheless bars plaintiff claim for quantum meruit relief.
applying new york law,we may analyze quantum meruit and unjust enrichment together as a single quasi contract claim.see newman schwartz asplundh tree expert,cir citing seiden,anc holdings,explaining that quantum meruit and unjust enrichment are not separate causes of action,and that unjust enrichment is a required element for an,or quasi contract,and quantum meruit,meaning as much as he deserves,is one measure of liability for the breach of such a contract,rev on other grounds,cir.in order to recover in quantum meruit under new york law,a claimant must establish the performance of services in good faith,the acceptance of the services by the person to whom they are rendered,an expectation of compensation therefor,and the reasonable value of the services.revson cinque cinque,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.new york law does not permit recovery in quantum meruit,however,if the parties have a valid,enforceable contract that governs the same subject matter as the quantum meruit claim,long island rail road,ellis abbey ellis,dep t mariacher contracting,kirst,dep t.this restriction on quantum meruit claims bars recovery by plaintiff here.having successfully brought a claim based on defendant failure to compensate it for the services it provided,plaintiff may not recover a second time through quantum meruit.see,at,it is impermissible to seek damages in an action sounding in quasi contract where the suing party has fully performed on a valid written agreement,the existence of which is undisputed,and the scope of which clearly covers the dispute between the parties.
plaintiff claims that this restriction on quantum meruit actions does not apply to the instant case because the contract at issue required plaintiff to provide only twenty volunteers per day.compensation for providing additional volunteers,plaintiff contends,remains recoverable in a quantum meruit action.plaintiff is certainly correct that a valid contract bars a quantum meruit action only where the scope of the contract clearly covers the dispute between the parties.see also curtis props.greif,dep t a party is not precluded from proceeding on both breach of contract and theories where the contract does not cover the dispute in issue.see also east,west communications,cir r ecovery in outside the existing contract may be had if a party has rendered additional services upon representations by the other party.on the other hand,a plaintiff entitlement to recover in quantum meruit outside of a valid contract may depend on a showing that the additional services are so distinct from the contractual duties that it would be unreasonable for the defendant to assume that they were rendered without expectation of further pay.id.quoting bry,further citation omitted.we doubt that plaintiff could make such a showing here.
the real flaw in plaintiff argument,however,is simply that its claim,as plaintiff presented it to the jury,sought damages based on the provision of all of the volunteers.the contract suit thus encompassed the work of providing all of the extra volunteers for which plaintiff seeks compensation in quantum meruit 
in his arguments to the jury,for example,plaintiff attorney repeatedly emphasized that pursuant to defendant request,plaintiff had recruited a large number of in work at the festival.despite plaintiff compliance with defendant request,the attorney explained,defendant failed to live up to its promise under the contract to provide adequate food for those volunteers to sell.plaintiff consistent emphasis on the full complement of volunteers defeats its claim on appeal that the majority of the volunteers were extra volunteers not encompassed in the action before the district court.it is worth noting that the executive director of the ministry,who signed the contract with defendant on behalf of plaintiff,testified at trial that according to the contract,plaintiff was to provide twenty people per booth per shift,not merely twenty people per day.moreover,although defendant arguably had an interest in reducing the scope of the contract claim in order to reduce its liability,the defense attorney,like plaintiff attorney,represented to the trial judge and jury that the contract provided for the full number of volunteers who worked at the festival.the defendant strategy was simply to claim that it was not responsible for the festival troubles.
the district court rulings further reflect the understanding of the parties at trial that the claim encompassed the work of providing all volunteers.before closing,for example,the district court dismissed the quantum meruit action,finding that the cause of action for quantum meruit is exactly the same cause of action as breach of contract.given that the quantum meruit claim was based on plaintiff provision of the extra volunteers,the court finding that the quantum meruit claim was identical to the contract claim indicates unambiguously that the court,like the parties,viewed the contract claim as covering all of the volunteers.indeed,at the time the district court dismissed the quantum meruit claim,plaintiff gave no indication to the district court judge that its claim was limited to twenty volunteers per day,or that it was willing to so limit its claim if the district court allowed the quantum meruit claim to survive.
finally,the district court judge,as part of his instruction on the claim,explained to the jury that if the parties mutually agreed to perform specific duties outside the contract and if both parties were fully aware of the contents of such specific agreements,then the parties would be bound by those additional agreements.in light of the fact that both parties argued to the jury that plaintiff and defendant had mutually agreed to the provision of over volunteers,the district court instruction to the jury that such a mutual agreement would fall within the contract claim eliminates any doubt that the claim considered by the jury encompassed plaintiff provision of all volunteers 
in sum,we can not credit plaintiff claim before this court that the work of providing the extra volunteers was beyond the scope of its action.having recovered damages in that action,plaintiff is barred from seeking duplicative relief in quantum meruit.see,at,see also reilly natwest mkts.group,cir holding that once jury had found that plaintiff had an enforceable contract,plaintiff could not seek recovery in quantum meruit under new york law.
ii.attorney fees 
we apply new york substantive law to resolve the dispute regarding plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees.see banker nighswander,martin mitchell,cir holding in a diversity action that s tate law creates the substantive right to attorney fees quoting riordan nationwide mut.fire ins,cir.we review an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion if the district court has awarded the fees under a valid contractual authorization.fidelity guar.braspetro oil servs,cir.we review de novo,however,the district court interpretation of the contract.id.
a.the contract indemnity clause provides for attorney fees in actions between the parties.
because promises in a contract to indemnify the other party attorney fees run against the grain of the accepted policy that parties are responsible for their own attorneys fees,oscar gruss son,hollander,cir,courts applying new york law should not infer a party intention to provide counsel fees as damages for a breach of contract unless the intention to do so is unmistakably clear from the language of the contract.id.quoting hooper,ags computers.applying this rule in hooper associates,the new york court of appeals refused to read an attorney fees provision as including claims between the parties themselves,as opposed to claims,where the provision did not exclusively or unequivocally refer to such claims or otherwise support an inference that defendant promised to indemnify plaintiff for counsel fees in an action on the contract.at.reading the contract as a whole,the court also observed that its narrow interpretation of the indemnity clause was supported by other provisions in the contract which unmistakably relate d to claims.id.to read the indemnity clause as covering suits between the parties,the court found,would render other provisions meaningless.id.applying a similar rationale in oscar gruss son,this court refused to read an indemnity clause as providing for attorney fees in suits between the parties where the subsection of the contract providing for indemnification also contained language that indisputably applie d solely to claims.at see also,recovery credit,cir applying new york law and holding that a contractual indemnity provision did not apply to a suit between the parties where its language could easily be read as limited to third party actions.
as originally written,the contract now before us included only one of the two indemnification provisions that appear in the contract final form.this first provision requires indemnification of defendant by plaintiff in certain actions brought by third parties 
the ministry will indemnify and hold harmless fine host,woodstock ventures,polygram diversified ventures,the town of saugerties and other entities from any and all liabilities bodily injury,damage property,expenses including reasonable attorney fees,court costs,and other costs or actions of any kind or nature,arising,growing out of,or otherwise connected with any activity under this agreement arising by the negligence of ministry personnel.
emphasis added.
before signing the contract,the parties added an addendum to the agreement that includes a second indemnification provision requiring indemnification of plaintiff by defendant.that is the provision at issue here.significantly,the parties did not simply copy the structure and wording of the first provision in drafting the second instead,they wrote an indemnity clause that sweeps more broadly,providing for reimbursement of attorney fees regardless of the nature of the underlying action 
the ministry shall be indemnified and held harmless from any actions resulting from the negligence of defendant from any and all liabilities bodily injury,damage property,expenses including reasonable attorney fees,court costs,and other costs or actions of any kind or nature arising,growing out of,or otherwise connected with any activity under this agreement.
we agree with plaintiff that the broad language of the second provision,when read in conjunction with the first provision,indicates unmistakably,hooper,at,that the parties intended for the second provision to apply to actions of any kind or nature,including actions between the parties.see also sagittarius broad.evergreen media,dep t holding,where language limiting indemnification to actions appeared in only one of two key sentences in an indemnity clause,that the more expansive sentence encompassed attorney fees in suits on the contract between the parties.accordingly,we reject defendant cross appeal and affirm the district court decision to award fees.
plaintiff is entitled to no more than in fees.
the district court found that p laintiff and its counsel agreed to a contingency fee arrangement,and held that this amount a reasonable estimate of the awardable attorney fees.we agree with plaintiff that the court misstated the relevant provision of the retainer agreement,which provides that plaintiff and its counsel agree to the rate of either of any gross settlement or judgment,or the amount of fees received from defendants,pursuant to the contract with fine host corporation,whichever is greater emphasis added.despite this error,we affirm the district court decision to cap awardable fees at.construing the parties indemnity clause strictly,as we must under new york law,see hooper,at,we agree with defendant that the clause does not permit plaintiff to demand from defendant greater expenses than plaintiff has itself incurred see id.when a party is under no legal duty to indemnify,a contract assuming that obligation must be strictly construed to avoid reading into it a duty which the parties did not intend to be assumed.
the contract provision requiring defendant to pay attorney fees is by its p
