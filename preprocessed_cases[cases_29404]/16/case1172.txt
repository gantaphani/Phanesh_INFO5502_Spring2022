opinion of the court 
this dispute arises out of a supply relationship gone bad.the plaintiff is kirk brisbin,an individual doing business as specialty manufacturing specialty superior valve company superior,one of the named defendants,was acquired by defendant harsco corporation in the fall of.after a bench trial,judgment ultimately was entered in favor of specialty in the amount of.on appeal,we review the magistrate judge conclusions regarding adequate assurance and damage issues.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
factual background and procedural history 
in brisbin and superior began negotiating supply contracts whereby specialty would sell superior certain industrial goods.the result was two separate contracts in may the first was for the sale of brass valves hereinafter referred to as the valves.the second contract was for the sale of,and brass shell castings hereinafter referred to generally as shells.
the performance of both contracts was subject to certain quality control standards.before specialty could manufacture either the valves or any of the shells on a basis,it had to receive approval from superior.the initial step in the approval process was known as first article inspection fai.stated briefly,fai would test whether the material and dimensions of the item met requirements.upon fai approval,specialty would begin a run of pieces.superior would then conduct tests to evaluate the consistency of the pieces.only after superior approval of the samples from the run could specialty begin production.
according to a memorandum written by ed wingenroth,superior director of quality assurance,superior gave fai approval to specialty for the shells on january.superior then ordered a run.specialty completed the order in march.but because the shells were manufactured in south korea superior did not receive them until the beginning of june.brisbin testified that wingenroth tested the shells in april in south korea prior to shipment.superior,however,conducted additional testing in late july.several superior employees testified that this testing uncovered problems with the bronze alloy with which the shells were made.
for the valves,wingenroth gave fai approval in a letter written may.superior claims that it never authorized wingenroth to give fai approval because the valve samples did not meet testing requirements.yet superior asked specialty to begin the run for the valves in early june.
specialty could not complete this run.according to brisbin,his south korean manufacturers were unable to source six of the required component parts for the valves.in a june letter,brisbin formally requested that superior supply these component parts.superior previously had supplied a limited number of component parts,enabling specialty to manufacture samples and thus facilitating the fai approval process.superior,however,decided not to supply the components for the run specialty apparently was not informed of this decision.
beginning in late june and continuing through july,brisbin was frustrated with what he perceived as superior dilatory tactics.
well,i had spent over two years now of my time,considerable expense to my family,my business,and i was just not getting any direction at that point management clearly was not supporting the programs.i was having trouble having correspondence returned as of june,i will say late june,there was just starting to become a total collapse of effort and support in showing good faith toward the programs.
the one person at superior with whom brisbin corresponded was joe kilmer,the director of purchasing.but brisbin testified that,while kilmer was helpful in the sense that he actually returned calls,he did not facilitate brisbin repeated attempts to get feedback on the valves and shells projects.
at the end of july,brisbin spoke with kenneth president and general manager of a division of harsco the projects status.as a result,brisbin and various superior employees held a conference call on august.according to brisbin,superior told him for the first time that the fai approvals for both the shells and the valves were either missing or did not exist.he was also informed that superior would require additional testing for the valves,a superior engineer allegedly informed brisbin on the call that the project was a low priority and would not receive any attention for several weeks.despite brisbin repeated requests,superior never supplied specialty with any of the test results for either the valves or the shells demonstrating product nonconformance or the specific requirements specialty would have to meet in order to be reapproved.
brisbin memorialized his frustrations with superior in an august fax to miller.it contained the following statements 
additionally,i am now hearing my programs have not passed first article inspections,when i have signed documents from your quality control manager at the time saying they are 
i can not continue to pour my money into these programs,having never asked superior valve company to pay one penny,if your employees are going to continue to deny,stall,fabricate,lose documents,lose samples,deny documents exist,issue incorrect purchase orders,change requirements.
i require these three invoices be paid to me,and that i receive this check of in its entirety,before the close of business on thursday,august,in my office in texas.
i want very much for these programs to go forward,but i must have,after two years,your company come forward and finally illustrate its good faith and pay the tooling and molding costs in as much sic as they continue to find reason to stall these programs.
i would certainly expect some sort of preliminary agreement be signed by me agreeing with the reason the payment is being made,and to show clearly what my obligations are for this payment.
brisbin received two responses to his august fax.in an august letter,superior formally rescinded the fai approvals given by ed wingenroth for the shells and the valves.the letter informed brisbin that a review of inspection documents shows that some required tests were not performed,and some dimensions were in nonconformance to e ngineering specifications.in an august fax,miller accused brisbin of attempting to establish a breach of contract and denied that superior was obligated to make any payments,but suggested that the parties arrange another conference call.
as a result,another conference call took place on august.in a fax that same day,brisbin wrote 
i am certainly interested in these programs and only wish they move forward as originally intended.
however,understand specialty manufacturing believes,and has overwhelming documentation to support,our belief,that our products have already been fully test ed and approved.
if additional testing and approvals are now required by superior valve understand.if this is the case,however,specialty manufacturing needs these new requirements in writing,and as soon as possible,and would expect superior valve company to bear the additional costs incurred by specialty manufacturing in complying with these new conditions.
in view of the delays in moving forward,i believe it is time for superior valve company to now absorb these startup costs.as earlier stated to you,we request this immediately be discussed and agreed upon.i will discuss different options or arrangements than previously required,but this very importantly needs to be resolved,and soon.
miller responded with a short fax to brisbin disagreeing with his characterization of the phone conversation.
on september,brisbin faxed to miller a final attempt to reconcile the situation.after summarizing the past communications between the two companies,brisbin stated 
if superior valve has any last minute ideas which would allow these programs to move forward,i would certainly listen,as i always have.up to this point,however,i have not seen an expressed interest for these programs forward movement by management 
the only response to this fax was a september letter by irene ratajczak,a senior administrative assistant at superior,declaring its intention to refer this matter over to our legal department.
brisbin subsequently filed suit in the western district of pennsylvania seeking damages for breach of contract.specifically,he requested lost profits from the two written contracts and the purported oral contract.with the consent of the parties,the matter was assigned to a magistrate judge for trial.
after conducting a bench trial,the district court chief magistrate judge entered judgment for specialty in the amount of subsequently reduced to.he concluded that specialty possessed reasonable grounds for insecurity under of the uniform commercial code and made reasonable requests for adequate assurance.the magistrate judge also held that superior failure to provide any assurance of future performance and its decision to disengage from the relationship materially breached the supply contracts.
for damages,the magistrate judge awarded specialty its lost profits for the valves and shells contracts.he calculated profits for the valves on the basis of three full years of production at the original quantity estimate in the contract at the profit rate of per valve.he based profits for the shells contract on five full years of production for each model,the shells,the shells,et at the quantities and prices listed in the attachment to the contract.finally,the magistrate judge held that the evidence was insufficient to award lost profit damages for the valves project,but awarded reliance damages instead.
shortly thereafter,superior filed a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to amend certain findings of fact and the damages award.in february the magistrate judge affirmed his findings and,with a small exception,the damages award.upon submission of specialty calculations,however,the magistrate judge denied specialty request for prejudgment interest.

iii.analysis 
superior attacks the magistrate judge conclusion that specialty grounds for insecurity and requests for adequate assurance were reasonable.it also challenges his damages calculation.
specialty raises two issues on.first,it argues that lost profits,not just reliance damages,are recoverable for the valves project.second,it claims it is entitled to prejudgment interest on the damages awarded in its favor.
we address each argument in turn.
insecurity and adequate assurance 
applicable legal standards 
we have found no pennsylvania cases discussing whether a trial court conclusions on adequate assurance under.are findings of fact or conclusions of law.courts and commentary discussing have concluded that these issues are generally questions of fact,but may sometimes be decided as a matter of law.see,cmts,baii banking upg,cir it is generally a question of fact whether a buyer has reasonable grounds for insecurity under.there are circumstances,however,where this issue may be resolved as a matter of law.citations omitted amf mcdonald,cir whether in a specific case a buyer has reasonable grounds for insecurity is a question of fact.trust for usl,wien air alaska,wl,at.lexis at cir.may,the district court found that while what constitutes adequate grounds for insecurity is often a factual question,conduct may be sufficiently extreme as to be capable of decision as a matter of law.we agree.lance int l menominee paper,wl,at,dist.lexis at.july,a question of fact is presented as to whether the request for adequate assurances was proper and reasonable under the circumstances.personnel data grand casinos,wl,at,dist.lexis at.july,a demand for adequate assurances under the ucc presents an issue of fact that can not be decided on summary judgment.for a court of appeals sitting in review of a district court,the inquiry of whether conduct was so egregious or,conversely,so innocuous as to allow a conclusion on adequate assurance as a matter of law is functionally the same as whether a district court finding of fact was clearly erroneous.as the cases cited above suggest,we may not overturn the magistrate judge conclusions unless the evidence reasonably supports only one conclusion.
turning to the merits,pennsylvania uniform commercial code provides that when reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance.a.failure to provide such assurance within a reasonable time not exceeding days constitutes repudiation of the contract.id.d.
what constitutes reasonable grounds and adequate assurance is to be defined by commercial,not legal,standards.id.b.comment to of the provides that the grounds for insecurity need not arise from or be directly related to the contract in question,and comment states that repeated delinquencies must be viewed as cumulative.further,comment indicates that what constitutes adequate assurance will vary depending on the circumstances and that the requested assurance need not be due under the contract.what constitutes adequate assurance is to be determined by factual conditions a party must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards his satisfaction must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary or capricious.cinicola scharffenberger,cir quoting richmond leasing capital bank,cir 
on appeal,superior challenges the magistrate judge adequate assurance findings on three grounds specialty could not be insecure because any project delays were its own fault,specialty inability to source the six internal components for the valves and the quality control problems with both the shells and the valves specialty request for payment of was unreasonable because no contractual right to this payment existed and the magistrate judge erroneously interpreted internal superior documents and improperly relied on this evidence in making his findings.the magistrate judge findings,however,are fully supported by the factual record.
as to superior first challenge,we agree with the magistrate judge that specialty ability to manufacture the valves and shells in accordance with superior quality control standards is irrelevant.this inquiry pertains to the damages calculation,but it has no bearing on whether,in august,specialty had reasonable grounds to feel insecure about superior commitment to these projects.
as detailed above,a variety of evidence supports the magistrate judge decision that specialty had reasonable grounds to feel insecure.the run for the shells had been delivered to superior by the late spring of.even assuming there were problems with the brass alloy used to manufacture the shells,the additional testing by superior did not begin until a month and a half after their arrival.as for to the valves,even assuming the fai approval was unwarranted,the record indicates and superior does not dispute that wingenroth had authority to give this approval.as such,brisbin reliance on wingenroth authority was reasonable.superior argument also ignores that it asked specialty to start the run with knowledge that testing had not been completed.and while superior may not have been obligated to supply the six component parts for the valve,it should have informed specialty of its decision not to do so.
by june,over a year had gone by since the contracts had been signed.yet specialty had not begun production on any item.the record also indicates that,despite numerous attempts,brisbin received little to no feedback on the status of these projects for at least a month and a half.when he finally received feedback during the august conference call,he was told for the first time that superior had either never given certain approvals or had lost them and that it would require additional testing from specialty perspective,superior reversed its position on the fai approvals after two months of silence and without any explanation as to why.brisbin repeated requests for the test results demonstrating noncompliance and the proper quality control protocols also went unanswered.in this context,reasonable grounds existed for specialty to feel insecure about superior commitment to the projects.
the record also supports the magistrate judge finding that specialty requests for adequate assurance of superior performance were reasonable.admittedly,the tone of brisbin august fax was strident and specialty had no right under the contract to recover the brisbin demanded as one means of assuring superior performance but we analyze a request for adequate assurance in a practical way,and such a request need not be tied to a contractual right.see,cmts.in light of superior dilatory behavior and its reversal of position,specialty had good cause to doubt superior commitment to the projects.further,specialty was in a vulnerable position because it could not begin recouping startup costs until superior had given all approvals.as such,we conclude specialty decision to ask for assurance of superior performance in this manner was reasonable,notwithstanding the lack of a contractual right to demand or receive the 
further,brisbin august fax indicates a willingness to entertain alternative forms of assurance in lieu of immediate payment of the.even his september letter demonstrates a continued interest in reaching an amicable solution.despite these entreaties,superior neither presented a single counterproposal nor gave any indication that it was willing and able to perform its obligations under the contract in good faith.instead,superior decided to cease all communications and referred the matter to its legal department.
lastly,we turn to superior claim that the magistrate judge erroneously interpreted and improperly relied on internal superior documents.the evidence in question was generated by superior employees in august,after the august conference call.a handwritten note by jon carter,a purchasing manager for superior,at an august meeting states create enough issues to eliminate the interest.another handwritten note from this meeting,this time by joe kilmer superior purchasing director,instructs.a third note,written by kilmer on august,advises that the agreements signed by superior were not adequate and needed to be rewritten.finally,an august this one by bill recktenwald,an employee in superior engineering department states that,after additional testing,the valves and shells projects may not be appealing from a cost savings standpoint.
the magistrate judge relied on this evidence,in part,in concluding that superior severance of its relationship with specialty did not comport to standards of good faith and fair dealing.on appeal,superior raises two objections.concerning the carter and kilmer notes,superior argues that they are ambiguous and that the magistrate judge interpreted them in a way contrary to both carter and kilmer testimony.as for the documentary evidence,superior claims that the magistrate judge reliance on this evidence was improper because specialty had no knowledge of these items at the time.
first,the decision finding not credible the testimony of carter and kilmer should be overruled only if clearly erroneous.see anderson,at.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.this is so even when the district court findings do not rest on credibility determinations,but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.internal citation omitted scully wats,cir stating that the credibility of witnesses is quintessentially the province of the trial court,not the appellate court internal citation omitted palazzo corio,cir the weighing of the evidence is a matter for the trier of fact,not the court of appeals,and the clearly erroneous standard of review is a deferential one.the mere presence of evidence to support an inference contrary to that drawn by the trier of fact does not mean that the factual findings were clearly erroneous.as previously discussed,the evidence supports the conclusion that superior was engaging in dilatory behavior.therefore,the magistrate judge hardly erred in disregarding carter and kilmer testimony and interpreting their handwritten notes as evidence of superior bad faith.
further,the magistrate judge did not improperly rely on the documentary evidence to make adequate assurance findings.as superior suggests,a analysis must be based on the facts and circumstances known at the time adequate assurance is requested.if a party had no knowledge of certain facts,it follows that the reason for insecurity and the decision to ask for adequate assurance was not based on those facts.but as previously discussed,specialty grounds for insecurity and requests for adequate assurance were reasonable based upon the information it had at the time.such a conclusion does not depend on the documentary evidence to which superior objects,and the magistrate judge did not rely on the evidence for this purpose.he merely cited this evidence to support an entirely separate superior breached the contracts by failing to respond to the requests for adequate assurance and by disengaging from its relationship with specialty.
lost profits for the valves and shells contracts 
the magistrate judge awarded specialty lost profits for both the valves and shells contracts.superior raises a number of challenges to this award on appeal.we agree that certain conclusions of the magistrate judge were in error,and we remand in order to afford him the opportunity to make additional findings based on the record made at the bench trial.
applicable legal standards 
lost profits may be recovered under pennsylvania law if there is evidence to establish the damages with reasonable certainty,the damages were the proximate consequence of the wrong,and the damages were reasonably foreseeable.advent.unisys,cir citing delahanty first.bank.proof of damages need not be mathematically precise,but the evidence must establish the fact with a fair degree of probability.id.at quoting exton,home indemnity.lost profits,however,can not be recovered where they are merely speculative,delahanty,at,and pennsylvania courts are reluctant to award them when a business venture is not established.id.at a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing lost profits.id.at.
duration of the contracts and length of production 
to calculate lost profits,the magistrate judge multiplied the estimated profit for each individual item for a year of production by the total length of the contract,three years for the valves contract and five years for the shells contract.but as of the date of superior breach approximately fifteen months into the contracts,specialty had not begun production on either the valves or any of the shells.undeterred,the magistrate judge concluded that,under pennsylvania law,it would be reasonable to extend the contracts beyond their expiration dates to allow specialty to receive its full expectation interest.this decision to calculate damages on the basis of three and five years of production erred as a matter of law.
in support of the magistrate judge conclusion,specialty argues that,because development costs were incorporated into unit prices and would be recouped over the life of the contracts,they make economic sense only if they continue for three and five years of production.yet this is not how they are written.the valves contract states that the agreement is effective for a term beginning may,and ending may.the shells contract contains identical language,but expires on may.the contracts neither provide for development time nor guarantee a minimum period of production.sympathy aside,it is axiomatic that a court may not rewrite the clear provisions of a contract to make it more reasonable or to protect a party against an unwelcome result.see sultan chemists,epa,cir state farm mut.
