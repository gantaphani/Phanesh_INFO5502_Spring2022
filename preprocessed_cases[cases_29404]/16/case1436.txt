this case arises from defendant casualty refusal to defend and indemnify plaintiffs vrv development vrv,marken management gp marken,and kenny marchant marchant collectively,vrv in an underlying lawsuit in texas state court.the district court held that vrv is not entitled to defense and indemnity because vrv is not covered under two commercial general liability cgl policies issued to vrv we affirm on the alternative ground that the underlying lawsuit does not allege a covered occurrence of property damage within the effective period of the cgl policies 
background 
events giving rise to this litigation 
vrv entered into a contract to develop residential lots in dallas county for goodman family of builders,goodman successor in interest,hovnanian,llc hovnanian,eventually built new homes on the developed lots and sold them to individual homeowners.
in may,during the development process,vrv purchased a cgl policy from.vrv was designated as the named insured,and its form of business was identified as a corporation.kenny marchant was covered under the policy as vrv executive officer.the policy was effective from may,until may.
vrv hired subcontractors to design and build retaining walls on the residential lots.the retaining walls at issue in this case were located within the property lines of four individual homeowners.
effective january,vrv converted into a texas limited partnership,vrv.the cgl policy with was renewed from may,until may,but vrv continued to be designated as the named insured,and its form of business continued to be identified as a corporation.there is no evidence or allegation that was informed of vrv conversion into vrv vrv did not renew its cgl policies after may.
a homeowner inspection conducted sometime between may and july identified a crack in a retaining wall.in january and march,after periods of heavy rainfall,the retaining walls collapsed,damaging the four homeowners backyards and undermining support for a public utility easement owned by the city of dallas 
in april,hovnanian sued,in relevant part,vrv for negligence and breach of contract.the four homeowners intervened in the lawsuit and sued,in relevant part,vrv and marken for negligence and breach of implied warranties.the city of dallas also intervened and sued,in relevant part,vrv for breach of duty to provide lateral and adjacent support for the city easement 
vrv demanded defense and indemnity from,and filed this action after rejected its demands.asserts that vrv is not insured under the cgl policies issued to vrv,no property damage is alleged to have occurred during the effective policy periods,and certain policy exclusions preclude coverage.the district court granted summary judgment to solely on the ground that vrv is not insured under the cgl policies.
b.the cgl policies 
the two cgl policies at issue in this case are standard in the industry and identical in most respects.the cgl policies require to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage,and to defend vrv against any lawsuit seeking such damages.the property damage must,however,be caused by an occurrence during the policy period.property damage means 
a physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
b loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
an occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.property damage that occurs during the policy period includes any continuation,change or resumption of that property damage after the end of the policy period.
notwithstanding general obligation to cover property damage that occurs during the policy period,the cgl policies at issue in this case do not cover property damage to work performed by vrv or its subcontractors.specifically,exclusion l to the cgl policies precludes coverage for p roperty damage to your work arising out of it or any part of it and included in the operations hazard.your work means,inter alia,w ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf.the p operations hazard means any property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your work except w ork that has not yet been completed or abandoned.additionally,to the extent property damage is not included in the operations hazard,exclusion j to the cgl policies precludes coverage for damage to t hat particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.
ii.standard 
the district court summary judgment order is reviewed de novo.city of plano,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see also celotex catrett,d matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party,but a party can not defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated assertions.little liquid air,cir.vrv bears the burden of showing that the allegations in the underlying lawsuit are covered by the cgl policies,but bears the burden of establishing that a policy exclusion applies.see,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,puget plastics,cir lincoln ins.reyna,cir.
iii.discussion 
the district court held that vrv is not entitled to defense and indemnity because only vrv and not vrv is insured under the cgl policies.we need not determine whether vrv acquired some or all of vrv rights to defense and indemnity when the latter converted its organizational form pursuant to article of the texas business corporations act even if vrv rights to defense and indemnity transferred by operation of law to vrv the hovnanian plaintiffs still do not allege a covered occurrence of property damage during the effective period of the cgl policies.
duty to defend 
texas substantive law governs the insurance contracts at issue in this diversity action.see erie tompkins.bexar cnty.hosp.dist.factory mut.ins,cir.under texas law,an insurer duty to defend is determined by the eight corners rule,that is,by the four corners of the underlying pleadings and the four corners of the relevant insurance policies.northfield ins.loving home care,cir king dallas fire ins.in most cases,the underlying pleadings and insurance policies are the only documents relevant to an insurer duty to defend.liberty mut.ins.graham,cir guideone elite ins.fielder.baptist church.the insurer is obligated to defend the insured if the underlying allegations,taken as true,potentially assert a claim for coverage under the insurance policies.paul fire marine ins.green tree fin,cir.the duty to defend does not rely on the truth or falsity of the underlying allegations,and facts ascertained before suit,developed in the process of litigation,or determined by the ultimate outcome of the suit do not affect the duty to defend.ooida risk retention,williams,cir zurich am.ins.nokia.all doubts regarding the duty to defend are resolved in favor of the insured.northfield,at.nonetheless,in reviewing the underlying pleadings,the court must focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than on the legal theories advanced.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,merch.fast motor lines.the court may not read facts into the pleadings or imagine factual scenarios which might trigger coverage.gore design completions,hartford fire ins,cir pine oak builders,great am.lloyds ins.if a petition does not allege facts within the scope of coverage,an insurer is not legally required to defend a suit against its insured.merchants fast,at.
our first step is to identify the relevant allegations in the four corners of the underlying pleadings.each of the hovnanian plaintiffs alleges that vrv or its subcontractors negligently designed and built the retaining walls during the policy period,that is,between may,and may.the homeowners allege that they
