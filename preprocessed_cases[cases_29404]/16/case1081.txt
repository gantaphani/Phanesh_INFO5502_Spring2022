opinion of the court 
former employees of at t at t and lucent technologies lucent appeal the dismissal of their putative class action relating to the termination of a pensioner death benefit provided for in the governing benefit plan.we conclude that this benefit was an unvested welfare benefit and that neither the employee retirement income security act erisa,nor unilateral contract principles prohibited its termination.we thus affirm.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs allege the following.we assume the truth of these facts for the purpose of this appeal of the district court order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see phillips county of allegheny,cir o n a rule b motion,the facts alleged must be taken as true and a complaint may not be dismissed merely because it appears unlikely that the plaintiff can prove those facts.
at t adopted a pension and disability benefit plan in.this plan was called the plan for employees pensions,disability benefits and death benefits when erisa was enacted in.
at t spun off lucent in.lucent assumed the obligation to provide retirement benefits equivalent to those under the at t plan to the retirees transferred to lucent.it created a plan called the lucent technologies.management pension plan plan that expressly incorporated the terms of the at t plans.the plan included the following provisions 
pensioner death benefit amount 
in the event of the death of any person who at the time of death is receiving,or who at the time of death is a former employee of a participating company,is not employed by a lucent controlled group entity,and is eligible to receive,a pension granted under section a or c of this plan,the committee or the bcac the benefit claim and appeal committee,as applicable,in its discretion,but subject to the following provisions of this section,may authorize a death benefit to the spouse or dependent relatives of the pensioner the total amount of which shall not exceed the maximum amount which could have been paid as a sickness death benefit under the terms of section if the pensioner had died on his or her last day of active service before retirement on pension provided,however,that in the case of a pensioner who retired after the last day of the month in which the pensioner normal retirement age occurred,and whose pension was effective during the period from january,to august,inclusive,the death benefit shall not exceed the maximum sickness death benefit which could have been paid if the pensioner had died on the last day of the month in which the pensioner normal retirement age occurred.
power to amend 
the board of directors,or its delegate,may from time to time make changes in the plan as set forth in this document,or terminate said plan,but such changes or termination shall not affect the rights of any employee,without his or her consent,to any benefit or pension to which he or she may have previously become entitled hereunder.
lucent amended its plan in to eliminate the pensioner death benefit for employees who retired after january.it further amended its plan in february to eliminate the pensioner death benefit for all management employees then living regardless of the date of retirement.
this litigation followed.three separate lawsuits were filed in and by at t employees who had retired in the.edward foss,vincent lucas arthur berendt,robert howard,and sarah conder collectively,the pensioners filed a consolidated amended complaint in the district of new jersey in november.that complaint included four claims under erisa and federal common law on behalf of a putative class of pensioners.it alleged that lucent had terminated the pensioner death benefit unlawfully and sought declaratory and injunctive relief reversing that termination.
the district court dismissed the complaint in november for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.it concluded that the plan documents were not ambiguous and therefore extrinsic evidence was not relevant to construing them.it held that the pensioner death benefit was an unvested welfare benefit and that neither erisa nor unilateral contract principles prohibited its elimination.
the pensioners timely appealed.

iii.analysis 
erisa recognizes two types of employee benefit plans pension plans and welfare plans.in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir.welfare plans provide medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment.pension plans provide retirement income to employees or result in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond.id.a.
the distinction between accrual the rate at which an employee earns benefits to put in the employee pension account and vesting the process by which an employee pension account becomes irrevocably the employee property is relevant to the protection of benefits.see generally digiacomo teamsters pension trust fund of philadelphia vicinity,cir quoting cent.laborers pension fund heinz,d,and discussing accrual and vesting.erisa provides elaborate requirements for the vesting of pension benefits,but it does not provide automatic vesting of welfare benefits.int l union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of am.skinner engine,cir.an accrued pension benefit is protected by erisa provision without any showing that it has vested.see g provision in re fruehauf trailer,cir under erisa provision,benefits accrued in a qualified plan are irrevocable an administrator or sponsor may not decrease them once they are granted.in contrast,a welfare benefit is protected from elimination only if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan provider had intended the welfare benefit to have vested despite not being obliged to do so by erisa.see skinner,at.
the pensioners contend that the pensioner death benefit is an accrued and vested pension benefit that is protected by erisa from unilateral termination.lucent,on the other hand,argues that the pensioner death benefit is an unvested welfare benefit that it may terminate unilaterally.see id.at.
is the pensioner death benefit a welfare benefit or a pension benefit 
erisa defines pension and welfare benefits as follows 
except as provided in subparagraph b,the terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan mean any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan,fund,or program 
i provides retirement income to employees,or 
ii results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond,
regardless of the method of calculating the contributions made to the plan,the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or the method of distributing benefits from the plan.a distribution from a plan,fund,or program shall not be treated as made in a form other than retirement income or as a distribution prior to termination of covered employment solely because such distribution is made to an employee who has attained age and who is not separated from employment at the time of such distribution.
a.in contrast 
the terms employee welfare benefit plan and welfare plan mean any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,a medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment,or vacation benefits,apprenticeship or other training programs,or day car
