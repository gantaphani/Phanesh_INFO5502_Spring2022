the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,app.west supp,governs every bill of lading which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade.app.cogsa limits a carrier liability for damage to cargo to per package or customary freight unit unless the nature and value of the cargo has been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading,id.app,and establishes a statute of limitation for the filing of actions seeking recovery for lost or damaged cargo,see id.c.while these cogsa defenses protect the carrier,not its agents,the benefits of the statute can be extended to stevedores or other agents of the carrier if the bill of lading so provides.a clause extending cogsa defenses to a carrier agent is called a himalaya clause.
since,p o and its predecessor in interest corporation of baltimore,has provided stevedoring services to arc vessels calling at the port of baltimore.the stevedoring contract between arc and p o requires all bills of lading issued by arc to include a himalaya clause,and the agreement further provides that p o is entitled to all defenses available to the carrier under the bill of lading against claims for cargo damage brought by the shipper,consignee,or cargo owner.the agreement states that if in a contract with a customer arc chooses to waive its right to limit liability,arc must give prior notice to p o.if arc waives its liability limit without prior notice,arc must indemnify p o for any damages assessed against p o that exceed the liability cap that otherwise would have applied under the bill of lading.
plaintiff aal had a contract with the united states government military traffic management command mtmc to transport the vehicles povs of government employees to foreign destinations.during the period relevant to this case,mtmc was aal only customer,and mtmc was also arc largest customer.
in february,arc entered into a service agreement with mtmc under which it agreed to transport povs and other military cargo overseas.under the contract,arc waived cogsa limitation period for the filing of actions seeking recovery for damaged cargo,and arc waived cogsa per package liability limitation,ultimately agreeing to a liability cap of per pov arc did not give p o prior notice of these waivers.
pursuant to the contracts previously entered into with mtmc,arc in october prepared to transport on the faust povs and other military cargo from the united states to various overseas military bases.the cargo included a aircraft tow tractor,which p o loaded and stowed athwartships across the width of the ship.the povs were loaded on decks below the tow tractor.
about a week after the faust left baltimore,the ship encountered very rough seas.the ship rolled degrees,and the tow tractor broke free of its lashings.the tractor rolled across the deck and punctured one of the ship fuel tanks.ten to fifteen tons of marine diesel fuel spilled onto the deck and eventually leaked down into the lower decks and onto the povs.
an initial examination of the povs indicated that all but five of them were contaminated to some degree by the diesel fuel,and more than one hundred were severely contaminated.because diesel fuel causes rubber and plastic to degrade,the diesel contamination of the povs could eventually cause brakes and other systems to fail.arc had concerns about the safety of the cars after the contamination,and arc did not want to release the cars to the individual service members.in december,arc and mtmc met to discuss the incident.they entered into a settlement agreement whereby arc agreed that all povs were totaled,and arc agreed to waive the liability cap established by contracts.arc agreed to pay the owners of the povs the full blue book value for each car,plus any additional amount necessary to satisfy any lien on the car,plus the cost of a rental car.arc took title to the cars,sent them back to the united states,and had them destroyed.according to its complaint,arc ultimately paid approximately to settle the claims of the pov owners.arc did not notify p o of the settlement.
on december,more than three years after the povs were damaged,arc,through its insurance carrier,brought this action against p arc asserted a negligence claim,alleging that its vessel was damaged because of p o negligence in stowing the tow tractor.arc also asserted a claim for contractual indemnification,seeking recovery of the amounts paid in settlement of the pov owners claims.
p o moved for summary judgment.p o contended that because arc obtained title to the povs after it settled the claims of the pov owner,arc was the cargo owner.because the bill of lading required the cargo owner to commence a claim for cargo damage within a year after the cargo was delivered,p o argued that arc negligence claim was time barred under the terms of the bill of lading.p o also contended that arc indemnification claim was barred by the limitations period.the bill of lading issued by arc gave p o the benefit of all defenses available to arc in an action by the cargo owner.when arc commenced this action,the limitation period on cargo claims had run,and p o argued that arc indemnification claim was subject to the same limitations defense that could be raised against a cargo damage claim.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of p o,concluding that both the negligence claim and the indemnification claim were barred by the limitation period contained in the bill of lading issued by arc to mtmc.this appeal followed.
at oral argument,arc expressly abandoned its negligence claim.we therefore consider only the question of whether arc indemnity claim was timely filed.
it is well established that a maritime claim for indemnity does not accrue until the indemnitee liability is fixed by a judgment against or payment by the indemnitee.united new york sandy hook pilots ass rodermond,cir accord hercules,stevens shipping,cir en banc federal commerce navigation calumet harbor terminals,cir.arc claim for indemnification thus accrued on december,when it paid the first of the claims of the pov owners.this action was commenced on december,within the limitation period established under the stevedoring agreement with p 
because its indemnification claim was filed within the period required under the terms of the stevedoring agreement,arc contends that the district court erred by applying the limitation period contained in the bill of lading.arc contends that the bill of lading governs the relationship between it and the pov owners,but does not govern the relationship between it and p o.that relationship is governed by the stevedoring agreement,and the indemnification claim was timely under the law that the parties selected to govern that contract.
p o does not contend that arc claim was untimely under the general rules governing indemnification claims.instead,p o contends that the stevedoring agreement incorporated the bill of lading limitation period and that arc indemnification claim was therefore untimely.
in support of this argument,p o points to section d of the stevedoring agreement.section d obligates arc and its related corporate entities to include a himalaya clause in their bills of lading and to state in the bill of lading that p o will not be liable to the shipper or cargo owner.section d goes on to state that
