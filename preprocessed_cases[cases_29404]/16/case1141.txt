opinion of the court 
this is a consolidated appeal by four objectors to an award of attorneys fees in the settlement of a securities fraud class action.the district court approved the settlement agreement,including the attorneys fees provisions.we will affirm.
on october,several plaintiffs filed federal securities fraud actions,alleging the at t corporation and its principal executives violated securities and exchange commission rule and b and a of the securities exchange act of.they alleged defendants made knowingly false statements between october,and may,about at t anticipated performance for the year to artificially inflate the company stock price.the district court appointed the new hampshire retirement system,secure holdings,robert baker,mohammed karkanawi,and mauline coon as lead plaintiffs and approved their retained counsel as lead counsel.plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on february.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss.on january,the district court denied the motion with respect to the b claims against at t and its chief executive officer and board chairman,michael armstrong,granted the motion with respect to all claims against other individual defendants,and certified a class.after two years of discovery,including depositions,the district court granted partial summary judgment for defendants,but concluded a disputed issue of fact existed with respect to whether armstrong statements made at a december,analyst to revenue growth for at t business services unit in made with actual knowledge of their falsity.
trial began on october.the jury was selected and impaneled,the parties gave opening statements,and plaintiffs called eleven witnesses.after eight days of jury trial,at the suggestion of the district judge,the parties began discussing settlement options.negotiations were successful and the parties entered a tentative settlement agreement.under the agreement,at t agreed to pay the class million by may,in return for complete release of the class claims.as soon as the funds were deposited into escrow,attorneys fees and expenses would be paid to class counsel in an amount equal to of the settlement fund million,in addition to costs and expenses of.the fee resulted from a sliding scale formula negotiated between lead counsel and the lead plaintiff new hampshire retirement systems at the beginning of the case.the formula provided attorneys fees would equal of any settlement amount up to million,of any settlement amount between million and million,and of any settlement amount over million.the plan of allocation required class members to submit claim forms by march.neither the settlement agreement nor the plan of allocation specified a timeline for payments to class members.class members have not yet been paid.
on october,the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement.notice was mailed to more than one million potential class members,eight of whom filed objections,including appellants marion washburn,william hoffman iii,jacquelynn frame,and donald frame.the objections related to the attorneys fees provisions,the form of notice,and certain erisa claims.there were no objections to the settlement amount.on february,the district court held a fairness hearing and on april,issued a memorandum opinion granting final approval of the settlement agreement,including the attorneys fees provisions.the district court denied objectors motion for reconsideration.
washburn,hoffman,and the frames now appeal contending the award of attorneys fees and expenses is unfair and unreasonable because it is excessive,it employs a sliding scale that provides for the fee percentage to increase rather than decrease as the settlement amount increases,and it provides for payment of the full amount of attorneys fees before class members will receive payment.objectors ask that fees be reduced to of the settlement fund,in addition to requested costs and expenses,and that the be staged,with the final installment withheld until class members have been paid.
the district court exercised jurisdiction over this federal securities fraud action under.we have jurisdiction to review the district court decision under.
we review a district court award of attorneys fees in a securities class action for abuse of discretion.in re rite aid.sec,cir.the standards employed calculating attorneys fees awards are legal questions subject to plenary review,but t he amount of a fee award is within the district court discretion so long as it employs correct standards and procedures and makes findings of fact not clearly erroneous.id.quoting pub.interest research group of,windall,cir.we require district courts to clearly set forth their reasoning for fee awards so that we will have a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.rite aid,at.
attorneys fees are typically assessed through the method or through the lodestar method.see id.at.the method applies a certain percentage to the settlement fund.see in re cendant.prides,cir.the lodestar method multiplies the number of hours class counsel worked on a case by a reasonable hourly billing rate for such services see id.at.
in common fund cases such as this one,the method is generally favored because it allows courts to award fees from the fund in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure.rite aid.at quoting in re prudential ins.of,cir.but we have recommended that district courts use the lodestar method to the reasonableness of a fee award.see rite aid,at prudential,at.the crosscheck is performed by dividing the proposed fee award by the lodestar calculation,resulting in a lodestar multiplier w hen the multiplier is too great,the court should reconsider its calculation under the method,with an eye toward reducing the award.rite aid,at.the lodestar,while useful,should not displace a district court primary reliance on the method.see id.at.
in girsh jepson,cir,we set forth factors a district court should consider when reviewing a proposed class action settlement.the girsh factors are 
the complexity,expense and likely duration of the litigation the reaction of the class to the settlement the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed the risks of establishing liability the risks of establishing damages the risks of maintaining a class action through the trial the ability of defendants to withstand a greater judgment the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best recovery and the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.
rite aid,at citing girsh,at.
the girsh factors do not provide an exhaustive list of factors to be considered when reviewing a proposed settlement.in prudential,we held because of a in the nature of class actions since girsh was decided in,district courts should also consider other potentially relevant and appropriate factors,including,among others 
t he maturity of the underlying substantive issues,as measured by the experience in adjudicating individual actions,the development of scientific knowledge,the extent of discovery on the merits,and other factors that bear on the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of liability and individual damages the existence and probable outcome of claims by other classes and subclasses the comparison between the results achieved by the settlement for individual class or subclass members and the results likely to be other claimants whether class or subclass members are accorded the right to opt out of the settlement whether any provisions for attorneys fees are reasonable and whether the procedure for processing individual claims under the settlement is fair and reasonable.

when analyzing a fee award in a common fund case,a district court considers several factors,many of which are similar to the girsh factors.see rite aid,at.these include 
the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms fees requested by counsel the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved the complexity and duration of the litigation the risk of nonpayment the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs counsel and the awards in similar cases.
id.at quoting gunter,at.this list was not intended to be exhaustive.see gunter,at prefacing the list by stating a mong other things,these factors include.in prudential,we noted three other factors that may be relevant and important to consider the value of benefits accruing to class members attributable to the efforts of class counsel as opposed to the efforts of other groups,such as government agencies conducting investigations,prudential,at the percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been subject to a private contingent fee agreement at the time counsel was retained,id.at and any innovative terms of settlement,id.at.we stated that whenever a district court awards attorneys fees in class action cases,w hat is important is that the district court evaluate what class counsel actually did and how it benefitted the class.id.at.
in reviewing an attorneys fees award in a class action settlement,a district court should consider the gunter factors,the prudential factors,and any other factors that are useful and relevant with respect to the particular facts of the case.the fee award reasonableness factors need not be applied in a formulaic way because each case is different,and in certain cases,one factor may outweigh the rest.rite aid,at quoting gunter,at.in cases involving extremely large settlement awards,district courts may give some of these factors less weight in evaluating a fee award.see in re cendant,cir prudential,at.what is important is that in all cases,the district court engage in robust assessments of the fee award reasonableness factors,rite aid,at,recognizing an especially acute need for close judicial scrutiny of fee arrangements in class action settlements.cendant prides,at internal quotations omitted.
in its memorandum opinion dated april,the district court explained in detail its reasons for approving the settlement and attorneys fees award,providing us with an adequate and sufficient basis for review.see rite aid,at requiring district courts to clearly set forth their reasoning for fee awards so that we will have a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.the court first analyzed the overall settlement in terms of the nine girsh factors.its subsequent discussion of the attorneys fees provisions incorporates this analysis by reference.accordingly,even though objectors challenge only the attorneys fees award,we begin by reviewing the district court analysis of the settlement as a whole 
the district court concluded none of the girsh factors weighed against approval of the settlement and factors one through five weighed overwhelmingly in favor of approval.app.under the first factor,the court noted from its inception,the case involved complex legal and factual issues.app.though partial summary judgment had narrowed the issues,the remaining factual issue was not straightforward or simple as plaintiffs were left with the formidable task of proving defendants had actual knowledge their statement was false or misleading.id.furthermore,plaintiffs had the burden of proving loss causation and damages,which would likely involve conceptually difficult economic theories and complex calculations based on experts with diametrically opposed opinions.id.the court noted uncertainty as to whether the report and testimony of plaintiffs damages expert would be admissible at trial,a question it reserved for the damages phase of trial.the court concluded the first factor weighed strongly in favor of approval.
under the second girsh factor,the court noted that out of more than one million class members notified of the proposed settlement,only eight objected.none of the objections opposed the settlement amount,and only four opposed the attorneys fees award.no objections were filed by institutional investors,those with the greatest financial stake in the settlement.the district court characterized this low level of objection as rare and concluded the second factor weighed in favor of approval.
under the third girsh factor,the district court observed that because the case had been vigorously litigated for over four years,app,class counsel had a thorough and exhaustive appreciation for the merits of the case prior to settlement,app.the court noted the extent of discovery 
plaintiffs reviewed and analyzed over million pages from defendants document production,and over additional pages from witnesses.plaintiffs conducted numerous informal interviews,deposed more than eighty fact witnesses,and produced over pages of documents in response to defendants requests.
app.the court noted the filing of several motions,including motions to dismiss,complex discovery motions,a motion for class certification,and a motion for summary judgment.furthermore,the case went to trial,which proceeded for two weeks before settlement.the court concluded class counsel had a thorough appreciation of the merits of the case prior to settlement and that the third factor weighed in favor of approval of the settlement.
the district court noted high risks involved in establishing both liability and damages under the fourth and fifth girsh factors.to succeed at trial,plaintiffs would have to prove the december,statement was made with actual knowledge of its falsity.the district court noted the difficulty of this task,given that defendants vehemently denied any wrongdoing,asserted a reasonable basis existed for the statement,and intended to call key witnesses who would support this assertion.app.the court concluded that whether the jury would have returned a favorable verdict for the class remains uncertain.app.as for the risk of establishing damages,the court again noted the likelihood of a battle of the experts,and the possibility of plaintiffs damages expert being excluded from trial.
the court concluded girsh factors six through nine weighed slightly or moderately in favor of approval.app.it noted risks that the class would be narrowed and that a larger settlement would force at t into bankruptcy.it also noted the reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the risks of establishing liability.the court concluded the settlement represents an excellent result for the class considering the substantial risks plaintiffs faced,and the absence of any guarantee of a favorable verdict.app.
having concluded the overall settlement warranted approval under the girsh factors,the district court turned to the issue of attorneys fees and expenses,explicitly acknowledging its duty to engage in a robust assessment of the fee award reasonableness factors.app.citing rite aid,at.it cited cendant for the proper standard that should be applied in class action lawsuits brought under the private securities law reform act.this standard entailed afford ing a presumption of reasonableness to fee requests submitted pursuant to an agreement between a lead plaintiff and lead counsel,a presumption that would be rebutted when a district court finds the fee to be prima facie clearly excessive.app.quoting cendant,at.the district court noted the fee resulted from a sliding scale formula negotiated by lead counsel and lead plaintiff new hampshire retirement systems at the beginning of the case,and had been subsequently approved by each lead plaintiff.the court concluded the requested fee was presumptively reasonable and the relevant inquiry for the district court is whether this presumption has been rebutted.app.
the presumption of reasonableness set forth in cendant was intended to take into account the changes wrought by the reform act.cendant,at.prior to the private securities law reform act,lead counsel were often instrumental in selecting lead plaintiffs.under the pslra,the court appoints as lead plaintiff the plaintiff it determines is most capable of adequately representing the class interests.the plaintiff with the largest financial stake in the action is presumptively the most adequate representative.once appointed,the lead plaintiff is responsible for selecting and retaining lead counsel,subject to court approval.
but the pslra has not eliminated all difficulties with establishing fair and reasonable attorneys fees in class action suits.as objectors note,the adversarial process is often diluted or entirely suspended during fee proceedings,and fee requests often go unchallenged.appellants br.quoting goldberger integrated res,cir.lead plaintiffs,having previously negotiated a fee arrangement with lead counsel,will rarely oppose a fee request.class members may have little incentive to oppose a fee request,since any reduction will only result in a minor increase in their share of the settlement.and defendants have little incentive to oppose a fee request,since usually they are not impacted by the way in which the settlement fund is distributed.
even more problematic are arrangements,such as where a law firm makes campaign contributions to elected officials who control governmental pension funds and is selected as the fund lead counsel.in these instances,the relationship between lead plaintiff and lead counsel may entail conflicts of interest.these arrangements have been noted in law review articles,see john coffee,the attorney as gatekeeper an agenda for the sec,colum,in newspaper articles,see daniel fisher,bedfellows,forbes,at karen donavan,legal reform turns a steward into an activist,times,april,at daniel fisher and neil weinberg,the class action industrial complex,forbes,at kevin mccoy,campaign contributions or conflicts of interest,usa today,at and even in congressional testimony,see outlook for capital markets,transcript of cong.testimony of james copland,director,manhattan institute,before the comm.on financial services,subcomm.on capital markets,insurance and government sponsored enterprises,wlnr.
we recognized this problem in cendant,noting that district courts should be particularly attuned to the risk of,a development congress may not have contemplated when it enacted the pslra.at.yet we did not specifically discuss the problem in relation to the presumption of reasonableness.we only noted,in general terms,an arguable tension between the general schema of the pslra on the one hand and its overarching provision that requires the court to insure that counsel fees not exceed a reasonable amount,on the other.id.at internal citation omitted.we acknowledged the court independent obligation to ensure the reasonableness of any fee request.id.at.
we now emphasize that the presumption of reasonableness set forth in cendant does not diminish a court responsibility to closely scrutinize all fee arrangements to ensure fees do not exceed a reasonable amount.we caution against affording the presumption too much weight at the expense of the court duty to act as a fiduciary guarding the rights of absent class members.id.at.
after noting the presumption,the district court reviewed the fee award reasonableness factors and explained g iven the similarity and overlap of the girsh factors with the factors the court must consider here,the court incorporates by reference the reasons given for approval of the settlement.app.the court then addressed additional reasons that support approval of attorneys fees in this matter.id.these included the absence of substantial objections to the requested attorneys fees,the excellent,sizeable settlement amount,the number of persons who would benefit from the settlement,the skill and efficiency of the attorneys,and the substantial amount of time and effort invested by lead counsel.the district court concluded the fee award was both fair and reasonable under the fee award reasonableness factors.
the district court the percentage fee award using the lodestar method,comparing the million award to a million lodestar calculation based on the hours submitted by counsel multiplied by the blended billing rates of all attorneys and paraprofessionals who worked on the case.the court concluded the corresponding multiplier of indicated a truly reasonable fee award.app.finally,the district court approved class counsel request for reimbursement of expenses in the amount of,finding these expenses were reasonably and appropriately incurred during the prosecution of this case,and sufficiently documented in the declarations.app.
the district court analysis and discussion demonstrates it considered the fee award reasonableness factors relevant to the facts of the in its discussion of fees and indirectly in its discussion of the girsh factors.a review of these factors demonstrates the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the attorneys fees award.
the district court addressed the first fee award reasonableness factor directly,stating w ith regard to the size and nature of the common fund and the number of persons benefitted by the settlement lead counsel were able to obtain an excellent,sizeable result on behalf of the class despite the substantial risks they faced in establishing liability.app.the court noted that many thousands of people would likely participate in settlement,given that notice of the settlement was sent to over a million potential class members.
objectors contend the size of the settlement amount is misleading,since relative to the size of the class,million dollars is not such a large fund.they also note it represents only recovery of the total damages claimed.at oral argument,class counsel contended the figure was misleading.they noted the class original damages claim of which the settlement amount represents approximately was asserted long before the class position was severely weakened by the grant of partial summary judgment for the defendants.based on a defense expert estimate of damages after summary judgment of share,class counsel contends the settlement amount share represents approximately recovery.
as the district court noted in its discussion of the eighth girsh factor,t he fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential recovery does not,in and of itself,mean that the proposed settlement is grossly inadequate and should be disapproved.app.quoting in re cendant.sec,d.rather,the percentage recovery,must represent a material percentage recovery to plaintiff in light of all the risks considered under girsh.id.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that in light of the risks of establishing liability and damages,the million settlement was an excellent result,weighing in favor of approval of the attorneys fees award.
the district court addressed the second fee award reasonableness factor both in its discussion of the second girsh factor and its discussion of attorneys fees,concluding that the absence of substantial objections by class members to the fees requested by counsel strongly supports approval.app.the court noted that out of one million potential class members to whom notice was sent,only eight objected.the district court did not abuse its discretion by characterizing this low level of objection as rare.see rite aid,at characterizing two objections,after notice of a settlement and fee request was mailed to class members,as a low level of objection that was a rare phenomenon internal quotations omitted.
the third fee award reasonableness skill and efficiency of the attorneys prosecuting this addressed under the third girsh factor and in the discussion of attorneys fees.in concluding this factor favored approval of the award,the court observed,lead counsel displayed excellent lawyering skills through their consistent preparedness during court proceedings,arguments and the trial,and their and thoroughly researched submissions to the court.app.given the length of the case and the difficulty of the issues involved,we do not think the district court abused its discretion in concluding this factor weighed in favor of approval of the attorneys fees.
the district court addressed the fourth fee award reasonableness complexity and duration of the its discussion of attorneys fees and in its analysis under the first girsh factor.in both places,it noted the substantial risks plaintiffs faced in establishing liability and damages.in rite aid,we emphasized the difficulty of proving actual knowledge under b of the securities exchange act,and concluded this factor weighed in favor of approval of the fee request.see rite aid,at.here,too,plaintiffs faced the difficult task of proving defendants had actual knowledge of the falsity of the statement made on december.we do not believe the district court abused its discretion in concluding the potential difficulty of this task weighed in favor of approval of both the settlement and the fee award.
the district court addressed the fifth fee award reasonableness factor,the risk of nonpayment,under its analysis of the seventh girsh factor.the court noted plaintiffs contention that at t may not have been able to withstand a or billion dollar judgment,and cited cendant for the proposition that the possibility of bankruptcy is quite real when the settlement or judgment numbers sufficiently increase.app.quoting cendant,at.we think the chances of at t going bankrupt are small,but we do not think the district court abused its discretion in concluding that because of a minor risk in this regard,the risk of nonpayment weigh ed in favor,albeit only slightly,of approval of the settlement and by implication,of the fee award.app.
the sixth fee award reasonableness amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs with the third.as noted,the district court repeatedly emphasized that class counsel efforts in achieving this settlement were substantial.the court stated,h aving accepted the responsibility of prosecuting this class action on a contingent fee basis and without any guarantee of success or award,lead counsel nonetheless maintained vigor and dedication throughout.app.considering the number of motions class counsel litigated,the extent of discovery,and the two weeks of trial,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding class counsel efforts weighed in favor of approval.
the district court addressed the seventh fee award reasonableness in similar addressing the objections that were made to the amount of attorneys fees under its discussion of the second fee award reasonableness factor.the court acknowledged a study,cited by objectors,concluding was the average percentage for fee awards in class actions resulting in settlements over million.but the district court noted this lawsuit may be characterized as anything but average,and objectors had not cited controlling authority that would require this court to make a downward adjustment.app.the court concluded objectors had failed to present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness 
other than the size of the settlement fund,this last in similar the only one that objectors address on appeal.they contend the fee arrangement was not adequately negotiated or contested because the lead plaintiff who originally negotiated the fee arrangement,new hampshire retirement systems,was no longer a lead plaintiff at the time of settlement.they contend there is no evidence that any subsequently appointed lead plaintiff engaged in any rigorous negotiation,revisited the agreement,or did anything other than to rubber stamp the deal.appellants br.in cendant,we stated the presumption of reasonableness would likely be abrogated entirely by a showing that unusual and unexpected factual legal developments materially altered the original premises of the negotiated agreement.cendant,at.were it the case that new hampshire retirement systems was no longer a lead plaintiff at the time of settlement,and that subsequent lead plaintiffs had not carefully reviewed the fee arrangement,we could be justified in holding that the presumption of reasonableness had been abrogated.id.at.we would then review the fee request using the traditional standards.id.but new hampshire retirement systems was a lead plaintiff at the time of settlement.see app.and even under traditional standards,in the absence of a presumption,we would conclude the district court had not abused its discretion in declining to reduce the fee award.
objectors contend courts are increasingly finding that class counsel can be reasonably compensated by a fee award that is substantially less than of the settlement fund.appellants br.they cite a study,which they cited to the district court,concluding the average award for fees and costs in class action cases whose settlements were valued over million was,and the average award for fees and costs in all cases was.see stuart logan,jack moshman,and beverly moore,attorney fee awards in common fund class actions,class action.they also cite several cases awarding percentages lower than what class counsel received here,allegedly demonstrat ing that the awarded to class counsel is excessive and unreasonable.appellants br.see,in re cendant,d,on remand from cir reducing initial fee award of million,about of settlement,to million goldberger integrated,cir upholding fee of of settlement in re interpublic sec,wl,dist.lexis,awarding fee of of settlement amount in re infospace.sec,d,awarding fee representing approximately of settlement amount in re cylink sec,d,concluding fee award of award was fair,adequate and reasonable in re bankamerica.sec,d,awarding fees of of settlement amount rather than the requested.
class counsel contends the cases cited by objectors as supporting a lower fee award can be distinguished on two grounds.first,they lack the extent of litigation involved here which entailed four years of litigation and two weeks of trial,leading to a total of hours spent by lead counsel in discovery,motion practice,and trial.second,the cited cases involved significant disparities between the originally requested fee award and the lodestar.for example,lead counsel in goldberger sought a million fee,but its lodestar was million,leading to a lodestar multiplier of ten.here,the lodestar produced a multiplier of.we have noted that the lodestar multiplier need not fall within any range,provided that the district court analysis justifies the award.rite aid,at.but we think a multiplier of is well within a reasonable range,particularly given the district court emphasis on the significant time and effort devoted to the case by class counsel.
as a comparison,we approved of a lodestar multiplier of in cendant prides,in a case we stated was neither legally nor factually complex.at.the case lasted only four months,discovery was virtually nonexistent id.at,and counsel spent an estimated total of hours on the case,id.at.we noted,the case was relatively simple in terms of proof,in that cendant had conceded liability and no risks pertaining to liability or collection were pertinent.id.if a lodestar of was reasonable in a short and relatively simple case,we believe the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding a lodestar of was reasonable in this lengthy,relatively complex case.
furthermore,class counsel in this case was not aided by a government investigation.in prudential,we noted this as a significant factor for district courts to consider.there,we remanded the fee award for the district court further consideration after determining the court had failed to distinguish between benefits created by class counsel and those created by a life insurance task force,organized to investigate allegations against the defendant.see prudential,at.we concluded the district court had improperly credited class counsel with creating the entire value of the settlement.id.here,class counsel was not aided by the efforts of any governmental group,and the entire value of the benefits accruing to class members is properly attributable to the efforts of class counsel.this strengthens the district court conclusion that the fee award was fair and reasonable.
objectors acknowledge that b oth class counsel and objector counsel have cited numerous cases supporting their view of the reasonableness of attorney fees,and concede that e ach could many more cases supporting its position.reply br.they contend that at the very least,the mere fact
