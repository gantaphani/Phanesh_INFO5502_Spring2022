a warehouse located in harahan,louisiana,was damaged by hurricane katrina.the warehouse owner filed suit against its insurer due to the parties disagreement over the amount owed under the policy.after a jury trial,a substantial amount above what the insurer offered was awarded.statutory damages and penalties were also imposed.judgment was entered accordingly.the insurer appealed.
we disagree with the district court interpretation of charges and expenses in the loss provision.we vacate that portion of the award.we also vacate the award of statutory damages and penalties.we remand on those issues.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
facts and procedural history 
on august,lexington insurance company issued a insurance policy to consolidated companies,conco.the policy insured up to million in losses from interruption of business,extra expenses,and damage to conco property.the next day,hurricane a covered conco property and equipment.
conco resumed partial operations within ten days.during the period before complete restoration of operations,conco earned in revenues and incurred in expenses for a small net profit.
lexington initially advanced conco million under the policy.after adjusting the claim,it determined conco total loss was.conco,believing this payment insufficient,refused lexington check for the difference.by the time of trial,conco claimed in losses under the policy.this included in loss,consisting of for lost profits and for charges and expenses.the meaning of charges and expenses is a central dispute in this appeal.
conco filed this action alleging lexington breached the insurance contract.conco also alleged that lexington violated louisiana insurance statutes by failing to pay the full amount of conco damages within the statutes prescribed time periods.see.
throughout the controversy,lexington and conco have disagreed on the proper interpretation of the policy provision.the difference in the interpretation is whether certain charges and expenses,which the parties agree amount to about million,should be paid in full or reduced to the extent they were offset by income during the months.under the latter interpretation,which is the one we adopt,the income completely offset them.
the jury awarded conco for loss,a figure later slightly reduced by the district court it also found that lexington violated the louisiana statutes by withholding payment arbitrarily,capriciously,or without probable cause.this resulted in statutory damages of million under section and a statutory penalty of under section the jury also assessed million in penalties in addition to million in damages under section.the district court set aside this million penalty,and conco does not challenge the ruling.
the district court judgment disagreed with the verdict in other ways.a remittitur was ordered,reducing the jury verdict by million to account for an alleged failure by jurors to deduct the amount lexington had advanced to conco.second,the award was reduced by based on the conclusion that the jury improperly included inventory and discounts in computing the loss.third,the district court proportionately reduced the penalties to reflect the reductions.
final judgment awarded in compensatory damages,in statutory penalties under section,and in statutory damages under section.lexington timely appealed.
discussion 
interpretation of the provision 
lexington asserts the district court erred by not instructing the jury to reduce conco charges and expenses by revenues conco earned during its months of partially resumed operations.conco maintains the district court correctly interpreted the policy,and therefore the jury correctly awarded for loss 
the district court interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law that we review de novo.admiral ins.ford,cir.because this diversity case involves the interpretation of insurance policies issued in louisiana for property located in louisiana,that state substantive law controls.in re katrina canal breaches,cir.
we will start our de novo review by explaining louisiana principles of contract construction.we then quote the policy language.after examining the district court interpretation of that language,we will analyze it as well.
the louisiana civil code provides that a contract should be interpreted to effect the common intent of the parties,id.quoting.ann,and an insurance policy must be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy id.quoting.ann.louisiana has established rules of analysis for interpreting a policy that contains potentially ambiguous language 
the words of a contract must be given their generally prevailing meaning.when the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.if the policy wording at issue is clear and unambiguously expresses the parties intent,the insurance contract must be enforced as written.
where,however,an insurance policy includes ambiguous provisions,the ambiguity must be resolved by construing the policy as a whole one policy provision is not to be construed separately at the expense of disregarding other policy provisions.words susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the object of the contract.a provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with a meaning that renders it effective and not with one that renders it ineffective.
ambiguity may also be resolved through the use of the,by ascertaining how a reasonable insurance policy purchaser would construe the clause at the time the insurance contract was entered.the court should construe the policy to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in light of the customs and usages of the industry.a doubtful provision must be interpreted in light of the nature of the contract,equity,usages,the conduct of the parties before and after the formation of the contract,and of other contracts of a like nature between the same parties.
id.at citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
these interpretive rules reveal that louisiana recognizes two levels of ambiguity.if an ambiguity is perceived,then various tools of construction are applied that do not initially include construing the term against the drafter.if after applying the other general rules of construction an ambiguity remains,the ambiguous contractual provision is to be construed against the drafter,or,as originating in the insurance context,in favor of the insured.id.quoting.ins.guar.ass interstate fire cas,so d.further,that last principle applies only if equivocal provisions seek to narrow an insurer obligation,and only where an ambiguous policy provision is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.id.quoting cadwallader allstate,so d,emphasis in original.
we will need to apply these rules to the provision.we will quote only the relevant parts.it begins with something of a definition.
business interruption means loss resulting from necessary interruption of business conducted by the insured and caused by direct physical loss or damage by any of the perils covered herein during the term of this policy to real personal property as covered herein.
this is fairly.it has a few terms of art,but nothing about them are central to the dispute.the next paragraph,though,is key 
if such loss occurs during the term of this policy,it shall be adjusted on the basis of the actual loss sustained by the insured,during the period of restoration,consisting of the net profit or loss which is thereby prevented from being earned and of all charges and expenses excluding ordinary payroll,but only to the extent that they must necessarily continue during the interruption of business,and only to the extent to which they would have been incurred had no loss occurred.
some important terms are here.the period of restoration was much in dispute in the district court,as it established the period for which the business interruption was compensable.it is accepted on appeal that the months that began when katrina came ashore is the restoration period.ordinary payroll is defined as being the entire payroll expenses for all employees of the insured except officers,executives and department managers.
this paragraph also introduces the concept of charges and expenses.as explained in the policy itself,they are such expenses as would have been incurred without the loss and have to continue during the business interruption the actual loss consists of the net profit or loss which the business interruption prevents from being earned,and of all charges and expenses excluding ordinary payroll,as defined in the policy.
a condition of the policy was that conco resume operations if that would reduce the loss.
resumption of operations it is a condition of this insurance that if the insured could reduce the loss resulting from the interruption of business,
a by a complete or partial resumption of operations,or 
b by making use of other available stock,merchandise or location 
such reduction will be taken into account in arriving at the amount of loss hereunder,but only to the extent that the business interruption loss covered under this policy is thereby reduced.
from all this,we conclude the policy has a fairly clear set of rules.recoverable are those profits conco would have earned during the period that it instead was shut down due to the hurricane.so are the usual expenses that conco still incurred even though not operating.there is no appellate dispute as to the calculation of those bedrock company expenses.the policy would put a completely conco in the position it would have been if not for katrina,by paying the profit it did not make and paying the costs necessary to exist.those are the compensable actual losses.
conco business,of course,did not stay closed.within ten days,conco had started its return to operations.over the next months,approximately million of expenses were incurred and million of income was received,with a net profit of not very much.there was evidence extrapolated from past experience that conco would have had a profit of if not for katrina.the actual profits were then subtracted to yield.the difference between actual and expected profit was recoverable.conco also introduced evidence that the costs that fit within the narrow category of charges and expenses under the policy amounted to.
we have reviewed the rules of construction and the policy language.we now turn to how the provision was interpreted by the district court.the continuing dispute is whether to offset the approximate million in charges and expenses with any of the million of income.
in the district court,conco argued that there could not be any reduction for charges and expenses recouped during operations.the district court agreed.the issue was joined at several points in the proceedings.the jury instructions may be the most direct statement of the district court interpretation 
the relevant instruction started with background considerations,such as that the policy paid only for actual loss incurred during the period of restoration.it also informed jurors that the policy was not designed to put the insured in a better position than if no loss or interruption of business had occurred.
the critical language concerned how jurors were to deal with the partial resumption of operations.the court described four steps jurors were to take.the first was to decide when the period of restoration ended.that was a substantial issue at trial but does not remain one on appeal.thus we do not explain the first step.we start at the district court second step.
the second step is to determine from the evidence the net profit that conco would have earned and then you should subtract from this number any actual net profit conco earned for that period.
the third step is to determine from the evidence the charges and expenses excluding ordinary payroll incurred by conco during the period of restoration,but only to the extent that they must necessarily have continued during the interruption of conco business,and only to the extent to which they would have been incurred had hurricane katrina not occurred.
notably absent from this third step is any reduction in charges and expenses that resulted from the resumption of operations.
the fourth step requires you to add the two figures derived from steps two and three and the combined total will constitute your award to conco for its business interruption losses under paragraph b of the policy.
the district court interpreted the policy as allowing lost profits to be reduced by the amount of actual profits,but not permitting a reduction in charges and expenses due to actual recoupment of such costs.the district court restated the reasoning behind this interpretation in a order denying lexington motion for judgment as a matter of law.the policy does not address charges and expenses in the event of a resumption of operations and does not clearly state the effect that a resumption of operations has on the calculation of charges and expenses.the district court was referring to the absence of any mention of charges and expenses in the section of the policy.we note,though,that the section similarly fails to mention profits.instead,it refers to whether the insured can reduce the loss by some level of resumption.the district court then relied on the maxim that ambiguity in an insurance policy is construed against the insurer,and determined that no reduction in charges and expenses was permitted.
we disagree with the district court analysis.to explain,we examine the first question required by the rules of construction under louisiana law,which is whether the relevant language is ambiguous on its face.in re katrina canal breaches,at.
some of the relevant wording is in the clause.as a condition of coverage,operations had to be resumed if the insured could reduce the loss resulting from the interruption of business by such a resumption.the policy states that such reduction will be taken into account in arriving at the amount of loss hereunder,but only to the extent that the business interruption loss covered under this policy is thereby reduced.
this clause does not elaborate on what the loss resulting from the interruption of business means.meaning is found in the general section immediately before the resumption of operations subparagraph.there,actual loss from an interruption of business is said to consist of the net profit that the interruption prevented the insured from earning plus all charges and expenses excluding ordinary payroll,but only to the extent that they must necessarily continue during the interruption of business,and only to the extent to which they would have been incurred had no loss occurred.three paragraphs later,the policy addresses the effect of the insured resuming operations if the insured could reduce the loss resulting from this interruption of business by a complete or partial resumption of operations such reduction will be taken into account in arriving at the amount of loss.emphasis added.this is the same loss that is defined as being expected net profit plus charges and expenses.there is no ambiguity.
therefore,when a partial resumption in operations reduces the actual loss,anticipatable profits and unavoidable costs,so substantially as to create some profit,all charges and expenses have,by definition,been covered by income.the only recovery in such an event is for the diminished profit.
taking the actual dollar amounts presented in this case,we repeat that conco earned in revenues and incurred in expenses for a net profit of.the charges and expenses for which the policy would pay had there been no resumption of operations was shown to be.as the policy requires,those expenses are ones that necessarily continue during the interruption of business,and only to the extent to which they would have been incurred had no loss occurred.thus,they are not independent of the costs that are incurred during usual operations,but are a subset of them.consequently,the roughly million in expenses must be part of the million in expenses that were incurred during resumed operations.all expenses were recouped from the income of the business and are not a loss to be compensated under the policy.
because the policy language unambiguously provides for this interpretation,it is not necessary to take the second step of analysis of an insurance contract.we do anyway because the next step gives us another reason to conclude that this is the correct interpretation.had we held loss to be ambiguous in some way relevant to the dispute,any ambiguity would be considered in the context of the entire policy and its purpose.
the proper reading of a policy term is the one that gives it the meaning that best conforms to the object of the contract.see in re katrina canal breaches,at quoting.ann.the fundamental principle of a property insurance contract is to indemnify the owner against loss,that is to place him or her in the same position in which he would have been if no hurricane had occurred.bradley allstate ins,cir quoting berkshire mut.ins.moffett,cir.this represents the reasonable expectations of the parties in light of the customs and usages of the industry,in re katrina canal breaches,at,and the policy should be construed in accordance with them.
the district court calculation method required jurors to give conco a windfall.if the charges and expenses had already been paid by the revenue of the business,requiring the policy also to pay them is not placing conco in the same position it would have been had no damage been suffered.in other words,the only reasonable reading of the policy in the light of the goal of making conco whole is that the policy requires reduction of actual loss by income earned during the partial resumption of operations.just as conco would have paid the charges and expenses out of its revenue if katrina had never struck,the policy provides for conco to pay them,to the extent it could do so,out of the revenue from partially resumed operations.only if revenue did not offset the charges and expenses would the insurance policy be called upon for payment.
we acknowledge that the district court informed jurors that this policy is designed to place the insured in the position that it would have been in if there had been no interruption,but the court did not allow jurors to make the reduction for charges and expenses necessary to do that.conco was placed in a better position than if there had been no interruption.
because conco was able to pay all of its charges and expenses with revenue during the restoration period,we vacate the award of in charges and expenses.no part of that amount can be recovered in this case.
sufficiency of conco proof of damages 
lexington next claims conco proof was insufficient to support the portion of its damages.specifically,lexington maintains that some of conco lost profits were caused by the generally poor business conditions.lexington claims those losses are not covered,and that they must be distinguished from lost profits caused by damage to conco property.according to lexington,conco failure to offer evidence sufficiently distinguishing these two types of damages should result in reversal of the damages.
although lexington styles this challenge as going to the evidence sufficiency,its arguments rest entirely on its interpretation of the insurance policy.in that regard,we review de novo the policy interpretation underlying lexington contention.leonard nationwide mut.ins,cir.if lexington interpretation is incorrect,its sufficiency contention has a false premise,and our inquiry ends.otherwise,we proceed to consider the sufficiency of the evidence.
the policy language relevant to the kind of evidence needed to prove the amount of loss states,
experience of business in determining the amount of net profit or loss,charges and expenses covered hereunder for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of loss sustained,due consideration shall be given to the experience of the insured business before the date of damage or destruction and to the probable experience thereafter had no loss occurred.
the district court informed the jury that the amount of this loss need not be proved with mathematical precision.broad latitude is given in proving this loss.nevertheless,losses for business interruption can not be based on conjecture or speculation.
we recently interpreted similar policy language under mississippi law.catlin syndicate imperial palace of,cir.a casino insurance policy contained an experience of business provision stating that due consideration shall be given to experience of the business before the loss and the probable experience thereafter had no loss occurred.id.at emphasis added.
under that policy,the insurer catlin brought a declaratory judgment action against the insured casino imperial palace to resolve their dispute over the amount of imperial palace loss.id.at.the dispute centered on whether the policy allowed consideration of imperial palace revenues to determine the profits imperial palace lost during the interruption.these were much greater than the casino revenues because it was one of the first casinos to reopen,thereby providing one of only a few choices for gamblers.id.catlin argued that only historical sales figures should be considered to determine loss imperial palace asserted that the policy allowed consideration of revenues.id.
to the district court,catlin argued that under the provision,imperial palace recovery should be based on net profits imperial palace would probably have earned if hurricane katrina had not struck the mississippi gulf coast and damaged its facilities.id.at.on the other hand,imperial palace argued that the correct hypothetical was not one in which hurricane katrina did not strike at all it was one in which hurricane katrina struck but did not damage imperial palace facilities.id.the district court granted summary judgment for catlin.
we affirmed.we rejected imperial palace argument that catlin interpretation of the provision improperly conflates the term loss with the idea of an occurrence,explaining that 
hurricane katrina was the occurrence,which inflicted losses on many victims,one of which was imperial palace.imperial palace asserts that catlin asks us to interpret the provision in such a way that the phrase had no loss occurred morphs into had no occurrence occurred.imperial palace argues that instead,we should disentangle the loss from the occurrence and determine loss based on a hypothetical in which hurricane katrina hit mississippi,damaged all of imperial palace competitors,but left imperial palace intact the occurrence occurred,but the loss did not.while we agree with imperial palace that the loss is distinct from the least in also believe that the two are inextricably intertwined under the language of the provision.without language in the policy instructing us to do so,we decline to interpret the provision in such a way that the loss caused by hurricane katrina can be distinguished from the occurrence of hurricane katrina itself.
id.at.in sum,we held that the calculation does not involve the company business experience after the hurricane.we supported this conclusion with a case from texas involving a similar insurance policy.see finger furniture commonwealth ins,cir the contract language does not suggest that the insurer can look prospectively to what occurred after the loss to determine whether its insured incurred a loss.
catlin and finger furniture do not directly control because this action arose under louisiana law.there are not,however,any material differences among the states relevant laws.compare.ann.the words of a contract must be given their generally prevailing meaning.with puckett fire ins,when there is no ambiguity in an insurance contract,it is the court duty to give the words used their plain meaning.and fidelity and guar.of martin,so d,i f an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous,then it must be interpreted as written.we conclude that louisiana courts would interpret this policy language in the same way as mississippi and texas courts.we follow the clear guidance our court has provided in catlin.
with this background,we consider lexington contention that conco did not sufficiently prove its damages because it failed to examine conco likely performance after hurricane katrina if conco property had not been damaged.the premise is
