discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
we exercise plenary,de novo review of a district court assumption of subject matter jurisdiction.local int l longshoremens ass,cir.

to determine whether a cause of action presents a federal question we examine the plaintiff complaint.louisville nashville mottley.a suit arises under the constitution and laws of the united states only when the plaintiff statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon those laws or that constitution.generally,the plaintiff is the master of her complaint.carpenter wichita falls.school,cir.under the complaint rule,federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.caterpillar williams,d.as a general rule,absent diversity jurisdiction,a case will not be removable if the complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim.beneficial bank anderson,d.
a defendant may not remove on the basis of an anticipated or even inevitable federal defense,but instead must show that a federal right is an element,and an essential one,of the plaintiff cause of action.carpenter,at internal quotation marks omitted.for example,a defense that relies on the effect of a federal statute will not provide a basis for removal.beneficial.at citation omitted.as we have explained,a plaintiff with a choice between claims may elect to proceed in state court on the exclusive basis of state law,thus defeating the defendant opportunity to remove,but taking the risk that his federal claims will one day be precluded.carpenter,at.
the complaint rule,however,is not without its exceptions.in certain situations,congress has created the exceptions.see beneficial.at describing the unusual provision in the act which expressly provides for removal of actions brought in state court even when they assert only claims.in other contexts,the supreme court has construed certain federal statutes as not only preempting state law but also authorizing removal of actions that sought relief only under state law.id.determining that and of the national bank act provide for complete metropolitan life ins.taylor,d finding complete in of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,avco machinists,d construing of the labor management relations act lmra,to provide complete.in these contexts,the federal statute so forcibly and completely displace s state law that the plaintiff cause of action is either wholly federal or nothing at all.carpenter,at.
in her original state court petition,hoskins alleged that she entered into agreements whereby bekins would first store,then transport her belongings from texas to virginia.hoskins alleged that at the time of delivery,she noticed that many of her belongings were missing or damaged.she further alleged that bekins acted as the initial,connecting,and delivering carrier for her shipment of goods.hoskins asserted claims against bekins for negligence,breach of contract,and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act.she sought damages,including punitive damages,as well as attorney fees.hoskins original state court petition does not affirmatively present a federal claim.this,of course,does not end our inquiry.
as the supreme court recently expounded,a state claim may be removed to federal court in only two congress expressly so provides,or when a federal statute wholly displaces the cause of action through complete.beneficial.at emphasis added.because the carmack amendment does not expressly provide for removal of state law claims,bekins properly removed this case only if the carmack amendment completely state law claims for loss or damage to goods arising from the interstate transportation of those goods by a common carrier.when the federal statute completely the cause of action,a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,is in reality based on federal law.id.
in beers north american van lines,this court found that removal was improper where the plaintiffs state law complaint was based entirely on state law,cir.the plaintiffs in beers paid a common carrier an additional sum of money to obtain full replacement value for any items lost or damaged during their interstate move,with a maximum liability of per pound shipped.id.numerous items were lost or damaged during the move and a dispute arose over the extent of the carrier liability because the two bills of lading issued were reflected the extra coverage,while the other did not.id.the plaintiff brought suit in state court,alleging tortious loss of goods,tortious breach of the insurance contract,breach of fiduciary duties,fraud in the inducement to contract,and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.this court found that removal was improper because neither the state court complaint,nor the defendants defense of federal,conferred federal question jurisdiction.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we noted the existence of the complete doctrine and explained the following 
t he supreme court,while extending avco to erisa cases,emphasized the limited nature of this exception.in metropolitan life ins.taylor,d,the court cautioned even an obvious defense does not,in most cases,create removal jurisdiction.further,the court required a clearly manifested congressional intent to make state claims removable to federal court.taylor.at,d at.
id.at.we then rejected complete under the carmack amendment as a basis for removing the plaintiffs state law claims to federal court based on our determination that the plaintiffs claims did not fall within the narrow exception of avco and its progeny.id.specifically,we found no manifest congressional intent,of the type contemplated in taylor,to make this state claim removable to federal court.id.
in a subsequent case,moffit bekins van lines,cir,this court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendant common carrier on each of the plaintiff state law claims arising from an interstate move,based upon the effect of the carmack amendment.although the plaintiff case,which consisted solely of state law claims,was removed to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction,this court did not address the propriety of that removal.
our decisions in beers and moffit have resulted in conflicting decisions among district courts within our circuit regarding the complete effect of the carmack amendment.compare ervin stagecoach moving storage,wl stating that moffit must yield to beers as the prior panel decision,thus no complete,and the schaper transportation brokerage,wl relying on beers to find no complete in the carmack amendment,with kimmel bekins moving storage,d,sustaining removal of state law claims based on the complete effect of the carmack amendment,citing to moffit and morris covan world wide moving,cir,duerrmeyer alamo moving storage one,d,concluding that complete applies and removal was proper in light of moffit,and simmons united parcel service.finding that the carmack amendment completely all state law claims against a common carrier based,in part,on moffit.other courts have attempted to align beers and moffit.see bear mgc cutlery estes express lines,d,noting that beers arguably held that the carmack amendment did not completely preempt state law for removal purposes,while moffit neither overturned beers nor referenced it lamm bekins van lines,d,stating that moffit engaged only the issue of the scope of ordinary preemption by the carmack amendment rather than the jurisdictional issue of complete preemption but see reeves mayflower transit,d,finding that beers does not represent the current governing view of the carmack amendment and noting that in moffit,a later panel of the fifth circuit retreated from the views expressed in beers.
we adhere to our earlier decision in beers until that decision is overruled,expressly or implicitly,by either the united states supreme court or by the fifth circuit sitting en banc.cent.pines land united states,cir quoting united states kirk,cir.as we will explain,the supreme court recent decision in beneficial national bank anderson expressly overruled the analysis used in beers to reject the complete effect of the carmack amendment.because the legal landscape surrounding the complete preemption doctrine has shifted,we are no longer bound by our holding in beers.
under this court precedent,in order to demonstrate complete over a plaintiff otherwise purely state law claims,the defendant must show the following 
the statute contains a civil enforcement provision that creates a cause of action that both replaces and protects the analogous area of state law there is a specific jurisdictional grant to the federal courts for enforcement of the right and there is a clear congressional intent that claims brought under the federal law be removable.
johnson baylor,cir quoting heimann nat.elevator.pension fund,cir emphasis added.in beers,we found no clearly manifested congressional intent that state law claims for loss or damage to goods during an interstate shipment by a common carrier be other words,the third element of the complete analysis was lacking.similarly,in beneficial the respondents argued before the supreme court that the requisite congressional intent to make state usury claims against national banks removable was lacking in the national bank act in particular,the respondents noted that the national bank act was enacted prior to the removal statutes.the supreme court held that o nly if congress intended of the national bank act to provide the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks would the statute be comparable to the provisions that we construed in the avco and metropolitan life cases.at emphasis added.the supreme court explained that 
because the proper inquiry focuses on whether congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusive rather than on whether congress intended that the cause of action be removable,the fact that these sections of the national bank act were passed in,years prior to the passage of the statute authorizing removal,is irrelevant,
id.at.we view beneficial as evidencing a shift in focus from congress intent that the claim be removable,to congress intent that the federal action be exclusive.
this court holding in beers rested on its finding that no manifest congressional intent,of the type contemplated in metropolitan life taylor,to make this state claim removable to federal court existed.beers,at.prior to beneficial,this finding would have ended our inquiry now,however,we must instead determine whether congress intended the carmack amendment to provide the exclusive cause of action for claims arising out of the interstate transportation of goods by a common carrier.see beneficial.at t he analysis in today opinion implicitly contradicts by rendering inexplicable taylor discussion of and removal.scalia,dissenting.
t he carmack amendment was adopted without discussion or debate.rini united van lines,cir see also bear mgc cutlery,d at t here is a dearth of legislative history surrounding the carmack amendment.nevertheless,the supreme court,and this court,have attempted to ascertain congressional intent from an analysis of the carmack amendment itself,and detailed its broad purpose.most notably,in adams express company croninger,the supreme court stated the following 
t his branch of interstate commerce was being subjected to such a diversity of legislative and judicial holding that it was practically impossible for a shipper engaged in a business that extended beyond the confines of his own state,or for a carrier whose lines were extensive,to know,without considerable investigation and trouble,and even then oftentimes with but little certainty,what would be the carrier actual responsibility as to goods delivered to it for transportation from one state to another.the congressional action has made an end to this diversity for the national law is paramount and supersedes all state laws as to the rights and liabilities and exemptions created by such transaction.this was doubtless the purpose of the law and this purpose will be effectuated,and not impaired or destroyed,by the state court obeying and enforcing the provisions of the federal statute where applicable to the fact in such cases as shall come before them.
quoting southern crenshaw.furthermore,the supreme court found that because a lmost every detail of the subject is covered so completely that there can be no rational doubt but that congress intended to take possession of the subject and supersede all state regulations with reference to it.id.at.
in missouri,of harris,the supreme court summarized its holding,from a series of cases beginning with adams express,as follows t he special regulations and policies of particular states upon the subject of the carrier liability for loss or damage to interstate shipments,and the contracts of carriers with respect thereto,have been superseded.see also new york,nothnagle.with the enactment in of the carmack amendment,congress superseded diverse state laws with a nationally uniform policy governing interstate carriers liability for property loss.the supreme court reiterated this view in charleston western carolina railway varnville furniture,when it noted that state laws are by the carmack amendment if they in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affect the g
