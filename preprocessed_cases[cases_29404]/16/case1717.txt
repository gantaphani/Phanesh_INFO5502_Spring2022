harrell equipment company,harrell equipment appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for suntrust bank of georgia suntrust regarding a brought by harrell equipment against suntrust alleging fraud,conversion,tortious interference with property rights,detrimental reliance,and fraudulent breach of contract.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
harrell equipment is a agricultural equipment manufacturer.suntrust was harrell equipment bank during the following series of events 
in march of,harrell equipment granted suntrust a security interest in all of its immovable and movable property,both current and.for the better part of the next decade,the parties business relationship remained amicable.in,harrell equipment began to experience the slump in the agriculture industry that was occurring.therefore,suntrust told harrell equipment that in order to receive further financing,harrell equipment would have to reduce its outstanding debt,lower its expenses and sell more of its inventory.harrell equipment agreed and reduced its outstanding debt by million suntrust,however,later refused to grant harrell equipment further financing.the agreement,or lack thereof,that resulted from this refusal is the subject of this appeal.
because harrell equipment could not get further financing,it asserts that it considered filing for bankruptcy as its only solution.harrell equipment claims that it did not file for chapter protection because suntrust branch president,will sims,offered,what seemed at the time,a better deal.pursuant to his offer,harell equipment claims that suntrust fraudulently induced it to forego plans to file for bankruptcy by entering into an oral agreement whereby harrell equipment would allow suntrust to take possession of all its assets suntrust would continue to advance additional funds to harrell equipment to maintain business as usual harrell equipment would reduce its indebtedness to less than million over the following year and thereafter,suntrust would sell the remaining inventory and assets to a third party designated by harrell equipment the parties,however,did not reduce this agreement to writing.
on march,the superior court of decatur county,georgia issued a writ granting suntrust immediate possession of all movable property of harrell equipment subject to its security interest.harrell equipment claims this action was taken in furtherance of its agreement not to file for bankruptcy suntrust claims this action was taken in furtherance of its role as a secured creditor.for the remainder of the year,suntrust controlled all of harrell equipment operations.the parties even executed a lease whereby suntrust had access to harrell equipment main facility in vada,georgia,and all movable property therein.on november,however,suntrust foreclosed on harrell equipment immovable property,mooting the vada facility lease.
by the end of,harrell equipment reduced its debt to under million and claims it did so pursuant to the parties previous oral agreement.thereafter,abiding by the terms of the alleged agreement,harrell equipment selected vada investors corporation vada as the third party purchaser of its inventory and assets.suntrust,however,disagreed and instead sold harrell equipment assets and inventory to lmc bainbridge on january,
on february,tommy condrey filed suit against suntrust,lmc bainbridge and harrell equipment in the united states district court for the western district of louisiana.condrey had developed a cotton handling feeder system in the late he called this system modtrack.after receiving his first patent for modtrack,condrey entered into a licensing agreement with harrell equipment.this licensing agreement,and the copyrighted blueprints of the modtrack system,formed the basis of his lawsuit.see condrey suntrust bank of,wl cir.in response to condrey allegations,harrell equipment filed a against suntrust asserting that suntrust fraudulently induced harrell equipment to agree to the march deal because suntrust never intended to follow through with the agreement caused harrell equipment to partially perform and thus detrimentally rely on suntrust oral promises fraudulently converted harrell equipment property because suntrust foreclosure proceedings involved violations of state law duties regulating professional conduct in foreclosure proceedings breached its contract with harrell equipment when it failed to sell the assets to vada,the third party purchaser selected by harrell equipment tortiously interfered with harrell equipment business opportunities during its daily operation of harrell equipment and concealed and destroyed evidence that would support harrell equipment claims.
in response to these claims,suntrust filed for summary judgment on april.united states magistrate judge karen hayes filed a report and recommendation granting the motion on april,finding that all of harrell equipment claims failed because it had suffered no damages.further,she found that no matter to whom the assets and inventory were sold,harrell equipment would,nonetheless,have no interest in the assets.the fact that harrell equipment would rather have had vada than lmc bainbridge purchase its assets did not create a claim.further,the magistrate judge found that hugh harrell interest as harrell equipment largest shareholder in having vada purchase harrell equipment assets and inventory and his purported loss as a result of lmc bainbridge purchase was immaterial,as he was not a party to the lawsuit 
even though the absence of damages rendered all of harrell equipment claims meritless,the magistrate judge considered the remainder of its claims.on the fraud claim,she found that,according to georgia law an action for fraud can not be based on a promise that is unenforceable at the time it is made.because the parties agreement involved a surety agreement the sale of land a commitment to lend money and the sale of goods exceeding and because georgia statute of frauds specifically requires that these kinds of agreements be in writing,the magistrate judge recommended that the fraud claim be dismissed.
in dissecting the part performance allegation,the magistrate judge determined that the statute of frauds forbids such an investigation because part performance requires that suntrust actions be consistent with the existence of an alleged oral agreement and inconsistent with the lack thereof.though the magistrate judge found that the evidence may be consistent with the oral agreement asserted by harrell equipment,she also found that suntrust actions were also consistent with what a secured creditor would do in the case of a defaulting debtor.therefore,she determined that the doctrine of part performance did not apply because evidence was not inconsistent with the lack of an oral contract.logically,the magistrate judge then found if the doctrine of part performance does not apply,harrell equipment breach of contract claim must also fail because no contract existed for suntrust to breach.
additionally,because the superior court of decatur county,georgia issued a writ granting suntrust all of harrell equipment property,the magistrate judge found that the conversion and tortious interference with property rights claims were improper collateral attacks on the underlying state court judgments those judgments terminated harrell equipment interest in its assets and inventory.the magistrate judge also found the promissory estoppel claim failed because the alleged agreement was too vague to enforce.finally,the magistrate judge determined that the spoliation of evidence claim also failed harrell equipment did not claim or show that any documents were missing or that these missing documents would contain necessary information supporting harrell equipment allegations.
on june,the united states district court,judge robert james,adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and granted suntrust motion.harrell equipment now appeals the district court judgment 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.fierros.dep t of health,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and evidence demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.directv,budden,cir.the initial burden to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists is on the movant.see celotex catrett,d.upon showing there is an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the case,the burden shifts to the party opponent to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute.id.at.
summary judgment 
lack of evidence of damages incurred 
in determining whether harrell equipment demonstrated a material issue as to whether it suffered damages,we consider harrell equipment statement that the district court improperly acted as an advocate in this case.harrell assertion is not supported by the record.in fact,by failing to refer to any fact or evidence of loss in the record that would allow it to overcome the evidentiary threshold for summary judgment,the grant of summary judgment is compelled.in short,nothing in the record or explain to us how harrell equipment is damaged by the events which we have described.
even if suntrust had succeeded in what it referred to in oral argument as the showdown,and even if it sold the assets and inventory of harrell equipment to a third party of harrell equipment choice vada,harrell equipment assets and inventory would still belong to someone other than harrell equipment.furthermore,as the district court explained,the claimed damages we discuss are damages pertaining to harrell equipment,not hugh harrell.that hugh harrell individually might have been better off had vada purchased harrell equipment is not at issue in this appeal.moreover,it is not enough for harrell equipment to state,as it did in its brief,that harrell was left holding the bag.without concrete evidence of loss or deprivation by harrell equipment,the district court correctly rejected it claims for damages.
having determined that harrell equipment has not raised a material issue as to damages it incurred and can not assert the rights of another party,namely hugh harrell or vada,we now determine how this conclusion impacts harrell equipment additional claims 
on its fraud claim,the lack of damages is fatal because one of the requirements of a fraud action is that the plaintiff suffer damages as a proximate result of the defendant false representations.longino bank of ellijay,listing the five elements for fraud and emphasizing that the plaintiff must sustain a loss as a result of the fraud.further,to establish a cause of action for fraud,one must show that actual damages,not simply nominal damages,flowed from the fraud alleged.stiefel schick.therefore,because harrell equipment has shown no actual damages and because georgia law does not provide for nominal damages in a fraud claim,the district court was correct in awarding summary judgment to suntrust on this issue.
to understand how a lack of cognizable damages affects harrell equipment promissory estoppel claim,we look to the statutory definition under georgia law of this equitable doctrine 
the defendant made a promise or promises the defendant should have reasonably expected the plaintiff to rely on such promise the plaintiff relied on such promise to its detriment and an injustice can only be avoided by the enforcement of the promise,because as a result of the reliance,plaintiff changed its position to its detriment by surrendering,forgoing,or rendering a valuable right.
ann.turning to the final element,in rental equipment group,llc maci,llc,the georgia court of appeals explained the relevance of damages in analyzing a claim of detrimental reliance.in that case,rental equipment group entered into a written agreement with maci to purchase its rental assets,but rental equipment group later backed out of its commitment.id.thereafter,maci filed suit claiming that,among other allegations,the doctrine of promissory estoppel applied and acted to hold rental equipment group to its part of the bargain.id.in analyzing the detrimental reliance issue,the court stated that maci,
i n reliance upon the agreement acted to their detriment by rebuffing other potential purchaser repeated offers to purchase by selling off needed equipment that rental equipment group did not want to buy by not moving the store from an unprofitable location and by delaying the installation of a newly purchased computer system,which was not compatible with the rental equipment group computer system.maci delayed obtaining financing and had a resulting cash flow problem after the sale did not go through,because they had to rely upon financing.
id.at.the maci court went on to hold that,
r easonable reliance by the plaintiffs to their detriment is an essential element,and the evidence supports such detriment with the rejection of another bona fide offer to purchase,change in value,sale of inventory later needed,failure to obtain permanent financing,failure to change business locations,nonuse of a new computer system,and other harm shown by the evidence.
id.at.in the case before us,however,there is no such evidence.there is nothing in the record to convince us that suntrust actions were detrimental to harrell equipment interests.we are unpersuaded about how the selling of harrell equipment assets to a third party of suntrust choosing rather than harrell equipment choosing,even if suntrust did make such a promise,supports the notion that harrell equipment relied to its detriment on suntrust promise.thus,harrell equipment lack of damages indicates a lack of detriment and ultimately a lack of a successful promissory estoppel claim.
regarding harrell equipment breach of contract claims,its lack of damages is not fatal.georgia law explains that i n every case of breach of contract the injured party has a right to damages,but if there has been no actual damage,the injured party may recover nominal damages sufficient to cover the costs of bringing the action.ann.therefore,that harrell equipment has put forth no evidence of damages is not dispositive of all claims against suntrust.we turn now to harrell equipment breach of contract claim and its remaining claims.
breach of contract 
harrell equipment claims that the district court erred in dismissing its breach of contract claim on the basis that georgia statute of frauds bars consideration of the alleged oral contract.harrell equipment is mistaken.under georgia law,
t o make the following obligations binding on the promisor,the promise must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person lawfully authorized by him 
a promise by an executor,administrator,guardian,or trustee to answer damages out of his own estate 
a promise to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another 
any agreement made upon consideration of marriage,except marriage articles as provided in article of chapter of title 
any contract for sale of lands,or any interest in,or concerning lands 
any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof 
any promise to revive a debt barred by a statute of limitation and 
any commitment to lend money.
ann.emphasis added.additionally,a contract for the sale of goods for the price of or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made.ann.emphasis added.thus,based on the plain language of the georgia code,we agree with the district court the alleged oral agreement is barred by the statute of frauds.
we hold that the purported harrell agreement is barred by the georgia statute of frauds because it involved a commitment to lend money,a sale of goods for more than and a sale of land.harrell equipment asserts,however,that the agreement does not involve a commitment to lend money,but merely discusses money already lent by suntrust.in fact,harrell equipment refers in its brief to the premise that the agreement contained a commitment to lend money as a red herring.we reject this assertion as meritless.
harrell equipment major contention in this appeal involves the agreement regarding who would finan
