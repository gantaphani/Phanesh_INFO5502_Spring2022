plaintiff dpc industries,appeals the summary judgment rendered against it and the dismissal of its claim for additional insurance coverage against its liability insurer,american international specialty lines insurance.we affirm.
this case involves an insurance coverage dispute relating to a release of a toxic chemical from a plant operated by an affiliate of the plaintiff which is one of the insureds under the disputed policy.american international specialty lines insurance aislic issued a combined primary and umbrella comprehensive general liability policy to the named insured dx holding company,dx holding.the primary policy provides a limit of million per occurrence and a general aggregate limit of million under both coverage a for general liability for bodily injury and property damage and coverage d parts and for pollution coverage.the umbrella policy provides a second layer of coverage with a policy limit of million under coverage a and million under coverage d.the higher limit under coverage a was a major reason for this litigation.
endorsement to the policy adds a broad form named insured definition which includes as a named insured any subsidiary or subsidiary thereof of the named insured.dpc industries,industries,the appellant in this case,is a subsidiary of dx holding,the named insured.dpc enterprises,is a subsidiary of industries.dpc enterprises is general partner of dpc enterprises,collectively enterprises.dx holding and its subsidiaries will be collectively referred to as the dx entities or dx subsidiaries.because the limit under coverage a is and the limit for pollution damage under coverage d is only,industries sought to get as much coverage as possible under coverage a as opposed to coverage two other provisions of the insurance policy are relevant to this case.the policy contains a separation of insureds provision.that provision reads 
except with respect to the limits of insurance,and any rights or duties specifically assigned to the first named insured,this insurance applies 
a.as if each named insured were the only named insured and 
separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought.
the effect of this provision is that each insured is treated individually as far as determination of available coverage,except that one insurance limit applies to all insureds collectively.
the policy also includes an exclusion to coverage a referred to as the covered by other coverages exclusion or exclusion 
exclusions 
this insurance does not apply to 
covered by other coverages 
any claim or part thereof which may be alleged as covered under this coverage of this policy,if we have accepted coverage or coverage has been held to apply for such claims or part thereof under any other coverage in this policy.this exclusion does not apply to any claim for medical expenses under coverage c caused by bodily injury which is covered under coverage 
a similar exclusion applies to coverage under coverage these exclusions prevent stacking of insurance coverages provided in the policy and make it clear that the coverage under coverage a and the coverage under coverage for pollution are mutually exclusive for each insured.
enterprises owns and operates a plant described as a chlorine repackaging facility in festus,missouri.industries provides technical support and training to the festus facility.the accident giving rise to the personal injuries and property damage in this case occurred on august,when chlorine gas was released from the festus facility.aislic was notified of the accident by jack holcomb of dx service company.on august,aislic accepted coverage for the claim under the above described policy coverage d,subject to a reservation of rights.the only insured referenced in the august letter is dx parent of industries and enterprises.dx response on august,only mentions coverage for dpc enterprises,
numerous claimants filed claims for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the release.lawsuits were brought against enterprises and other subsidiaries of dx holding.unsettled claims were consolidated and certified as a class action in a lawsuit styled jeanette adams,et al,dpc enterprises.et al,in missouri state court.goodwin brothers construction company filed a separate lawsuit against enterprises,industries and jason wisdom,manager of the festus facility,in april.the goodwin suit specifically named industries as a defendant.
starting in october,holcomb of dx service company began efforts to obtain coverage under coverage a and thereby obtain the benefit of the higher liability policy limit for subsidiaries of dx holding who were not owners of the festus facility.numerous letters were sent to and responses received from aislic.holcomb notified aislic that the claims asserted against dx entities which did not own and operate the festus plant,including industries,were entitled to the benefit of coverage a in the policy.holcomb noted that those entities do not own and operate the festus facility and that the allegations involved claims of negligent training,supervision and maintenance of the facility.accordingly,dx holding put aislic on notice that they were making a claim for coverage under coverage a of the policy.aislic denied coverage under coverage a on the basis of the pollution exclusion in exclusion,the professional services exclusion in exclusion.and exclusion every letter sent by aislic contains a reservation of rights to assert a defense to coverage.
aislic entered into multiple settlement agreements with plaintiffs on behalf of the dx entities.every settlement obtained releases for all dx entities including industries.aislic also settled the goodwin litigation by paying to settle the suit.aislic obtained releases for all defendants,including industries,which is a released party in the goodwin settlement agreement.aislic also paid defense costs for all the dx entities,including industries.the adams suit against dx entities including industries was not settled at this point.upon exhausting its policy limits under coverage,aislic withdrew its defense.
industries and its affiliates settled the adams litigation with their own funds in may for.industries filed suit against aislic in texas state court for breach of contract,damages and attorneys fees based on aislic wrongful denial of coverage under coverage a of the general liability policy and sought reimbursement of its settlement costs from the million differential between the policy limits of coverage a and the policy limits of coverage d of the umbrella policy.aislic timely removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.aislic filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that exclusion,the other coverages exclusion,exclusion,the pollution exclusion,and exclusion,the professional services exclusion,preclude coverage under coverage industries filed a for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of aislic,finding primarily that aislic provided coverage to industries under coverage and therefore that exclusion precludes coverage under coverage a.this appeal followed.
the issue presented to us is whether industries is entitled to the benefit of the additional limit of liability under coverage a of the defendant policy.as an initial matter not specifically addressed by the parties,we note that the pollution coverage provided in coverage applies to the chlorine release and the injuries and damages resulting therefrom.coverage states 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as loss because of claims in the coverage territory for bodily injury,property damage or costs beyond the boundaries of the insured property within the specified time frame of the policy.
as described by industries,the claims against it in the adams and goodwin cases were claims of negligent training,supervision and maintenance of the facility.industries role in the dx entities was to provide technical support and training to the festus facility.accordingly,claims of bodily injury,property damage and clean up costs arising from industries alleged negligence that contributed to the chlorine release fall within cov
