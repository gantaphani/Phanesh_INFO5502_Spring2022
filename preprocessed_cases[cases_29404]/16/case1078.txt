opinion of the court 
appellants,pacific dunlop holdings usa,pdh usa,and four of its foreign affiliates,pacific dunlop holdings europe limited pdh europe,international pty limited pd int l,pacific dunlop holdings hong kong limited pdh hong kong,and pacific dunlop holdings singapore pdh singapore collectively,the pdh foreign entities,appeal the bankruptcy court denial of their motion to remand to state court,abstain from,their claims against three foreign subsidiaries of exide technologies,exide corporation exide namely,exide holding europe exide europe,exide holding asia limited exide asia,and exide singapore,bluewall exide singapore collectively,the exide foreign entities and their motion for reconsideration.
the crux of the appeal is whether the bankruptcy court properly decided that the state law cause of action between parties,the pdh foreign entities and the exide foreign entities,was a core bankruptcy proceeding under b b and c over which exclusive bankruptcy jurisdiction was appropriate.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred and we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
pdh usa and pdh foreign entities,collectively,owned the gnb companies gnb,a global automotive and industrial battery business each of the pdh entities owned portions of gnb in designated territories around the world.in may and june of,pdh usa and the pdh foreign entities entered into a series of sale agreements to sell their interests in gnb to exide and the exide foreign entities.pdh usa sold its interests in gnb to exide,and each of the four pdh foreign entities sold its respective interests to the three exide foreign entities separate agreements were concluded between the companies counterparts.each agreement provided that buyer sole and exclusive indemnification obligations under this agreement are set forth in the coordinating agreement.app.on may,the coordinating agreement was concluded and,inter alia,set forth procedures to deal with potential disputes,including various provisions addressing venue,submission to jurisdiction,and governing law.app.it included a forum selection clause,pursuant to which any claims arising under the agreement were to be filed in a state or federal court located in the county of cook,state of illinois.app.
according to the pdh entities,after the sale closing,exide and the foreign entities swept gnb cash accounts and appropriated approximately million of cash at hand that was due to the sellers under the sales agreements.the pdh entities reportedly asked that the cash be released to them,but the exide entities refused all such requests.
thus,on july,the pdh entities filed suit against the exide entities in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,alleging breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and conversion the specific claims and amounts were as follows 
pdh singapore against exide asia in the amount of for breach of contract the india agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment 
pdh singapore against exide singapore in the amount of for breach of contract the singapore agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment 
pdh hong kong against exide asia in the amount of for breach of contract the hong agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment 
pdh europe against exide europe in the amount of for breach of contract the uk agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment 
pd int l and pdh europe against exide europe in the amount of for breach of contract the european agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment and 
pdh usa against exide in the amount of approximately for breach of contract the usa agreement,conversion,and unjust enrichment 
the complaint included a demand for a jury trial.
the exide defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on september,under illinois code of civil procedure section,arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a valid cause of action.in their motion,they asserted,inter alia,that the plaintiffs contractually agreed to waive the claims of breach of contract,conversion,and unjust enrichment and were only entitled to seek indemnification.furthermore,they contended,the plaintiffs had not alleged a breach of a covenant made by exide,defined as exide and the exide foreign entities.the motion was subsequently denied by the illinois trial judge overseeing the case.accordingly,the exide defendants filed an answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaim on january.in their answer,the exide foreign entities raised several defenses but did not assert that they were not proper parties to the litigation or that the exclusive remedy for breach was against exide alone.
discovery had just begun in the state court action when exide and several of its domestic subsidiaries,who are not parties here,filed petitions for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware on april.none of the exide foreign entities filed for bankruptcy,and exide is the only defendant to the illinois action that is involved in bankruptcy proceedings.
recognizing that the automatic stay under a applied to its claims against exide,pdh usa did not pursue them further in illinois state court.the pdh foreign entities,however,continued to prosecute their claims against the defendants.the exide foreign entities consequently asked the state court to stay discovery on the claims against them as well,which it initially did.after three hearings,however,the judge lifted the stay on july,holding that the stay did not apply to the defendants and ordering that the case move forward without exide.
the exide foreign entities then filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them for lack of necessary party.rather than wait for the state court ruling,however,on august,the day before a hearing was to be held in state court on the motion to dismiss,the exide defendants removed the action to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois.they also moved to transfer the action to the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.
the pdh foreign entities in turn moved for remand to state court or,in the alternative,abstention.they argued that removal was improper because the claims asserted against exide subsidiaries did not arise under the bankruptcy code or arise in exide bankruptcy case and were not related to the bankruptcy case as required for the court to exercise jurisdiction under.
the exide foreign entities argued that the claims were at minimum related to exide bankruptcy case and thus subject matter jurisdiction should be found to exist.the crux of their argument was that the coordinating agreement provided that exide was the sole indemnitor and,therefore,the exclusive remedy available to the pdh foreign entities was a direct claim against exide,not the foreign subsidiaries.
exide arguments that only it had assumed indemnification obligations turned on the meaning of the term buyer as used within the first phrase of section a of the coordinating agreement,which set forth remedies available against the exide entities under the sales agreements and provided 
indemnification by buyer 
a subject to sections b,c,and d,buyer agrees to indemnify and hold seller and the international sellers and their affiliates harmless from and against any and all losses and expenses incurred by seller or the international sellers and their affiliates in connection with or arising from 
i any breach by buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in the sale agreements or in this agreement 
ii any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation by buyer contained in the sale agreements,or 
iii any breach by buyer of any covenant contained in section or section of the agreement or the corresponding provisions in the other sale agreements.
app.under the coordinating agreement,pdh usa and its affiliates were seller and international sellers,respectively.as to the buyers,the first page of the coordinating agreement identified exide corporation as buyer and the exide subsidiaries as international buyers.under the definitional section of the coordinating agreement,however,the term buyer,as used in articles and to,inclusive,was further defined to mean buyer as the context may require any international buyer.app.the coordinating agreement used these terms throughout and was meant to provide a single avenue of recourse for indemnification claims arising under the sale agreements.app.
the exide foreign entities took the position before the bankruptcy court that a fixed liability on exide alone and that the exide foreign entities were not named indemnitors under the agreement.according to this interpretation,the term buyer in the heading to and the opening clause of a means only exide,rather than buyer any international buyer.more specifically,exide claimed that amendment,one of three lengthy amendments to the coordinating agreement,had altered this indemnification provision and made unambiguous that it was the only proper defendant to the pdh foreign entities claims.amendment provided section a i is hereby amended to insert the words or,for the sake of clarification,any international buyer after the word buyer in the first line of such section.app.with the new language inserted,the relevant part of the section read 
buyer agrees to indemnify and hold seller and the international sellers and their affiliates harmless from and against any and all losses and expenses incurred by seller or the international sellers and their affiliates in connection with or arising from 
i any breach by buyer or,for the sake of clarification,any international buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in the sale agreements or in this agreement 
app.because amendment added or,for the sake of clarification,any international buyer to only one subsection of a,as the argument goes,buyer in the remainder of the section can not include international buyers.
on february,judge sonderby of the bankruptcy court in illinois ruled on the exide defendants motion for transfer.although she observed that i t appears,from a review of the agreements and the parties contentions,that there may be an ambiguity on the indemnification issue,she did not resolve the issue.app.instead,she found at least related to jurisdiction over the removed action,app,and,accordingly,transferred the action,including pdh foreign entities pending motion to remand or abstain,to the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware in the meantime,april,was set as the deadline for filing proofs of claim in exide bankruptcy case.pdh usa and each of the pdh foreign entities filed proofs of claim.pdh usa proof of claim,which is not at issue on appeal,was against exide directly.the pdh foreign entities proofs of claims,by contrast,were contingent,indicating a right of recovery against exide only if they succeeded in their action against the defendants and they proved unable to satisfy the judgment.typical of the pdh foreign entities proofs of claim is pdh europe proof of claim,which indicates that it claimed approximately,from the debtor subsidiary,exide holding europe,on the grounds set forth in a complaint filed in cook county,illinois app.the proof of claim explains the background of litigation in the bankruptcy courts in both illinois and delaware and then continues,
as set forth in the memorandum opinion of the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois transferring the litigation,the parties disagree regarding the liability of the debtor for any breaches of the sale agreements.it is pdh europe position that exide holding europe is primarily liable for its breaches,and that the debtor is secondarily liable to the extent that exide holding europe is unable to satisfy pdh europe.the debtor contends that it is the sole indemnitor for breaches by it or its subsidiaries under the related sales agreements.accordingly,if the appropriate court determines that the debtor is the sole indemnitor,pdh europe has a direct claim against the debtor for any breaches.conversely,if the appropriate court determines that exide holding europe is primarily liable for its breaches,pdh europe has a contingent claim against the debtor,which is dependent on exide holding europe ability to satisfy pdh europe claims.
on october,pdh foreign entities filed a renewed motion in the delaware bankruptcy court for remand or abstention.in their motion,the pdh foreign entities argued that the forum selection clause in the parties coordinating agreement compelled remand to illinois state court the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction principles of equitable remand under b should be applied and mandatory abstention under c applied.
the exide entities filed a response to the motion to remand arguing that,under the coordinating agreement,exide should be understood to be the sole indemnitor of all of the pdh foreign entities claims,and therefore,the pdh foreign entities were not entitled to any remedy against exide foreign entities.the exide entities also argued that the automatic stay under the bankruptcy code should be extended to pdh foreign entities claims against the exide foreign entities.under the local bankruptcy rules,pdh had no right to file a reply,unless ordered to do so by the court.d.
on november,the delaware bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion to remand.at the outset of the hearing,the judge opined as to the key issue,noting that it clear to me that by virtue of the filing of the proofs of claim that in large measure the matters before me are core.app.he then continued,
it seems to me that the mandatory abstention part of the motion is one i going to deny for the reason that these are,at least in large measure,core,and secondly,by virtue of the filing of the proof of claim you the forum selection falls away,because,as some of the cases say,once you done that you chosen your forum.
nonetheless,the parties made their arguments.exide counsel asserted that the language in the coordinating agreement was unambiguous and clearly stated that any claims could only proceed against exide as the sole indemnitor and,thus,should be litigated in bankruptcy court.in the alternative,counsel argued that the claims against the entities and the claims against the debtor were so inextricably intertwined that it was impossible as a practical matter to disentangle them,and urged the court to follow in re rbgsc inv,and find that the claims against the were core.app.pdh counsel protested that the merits of the coordinating agreement should not be determined on a motion for remand and that they had had no opportunity to reply to exide merits arguments.moreover,the claims against the exide entities,he argued,should be deemed and,consequently,mandatory discretionary abstention should apply.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court held 
while judge sonderby points out that there may be ambiguity in the language of the coordinating agreement,i conclude as a matter of law that there is none.and that exide is the sole i ndemnitor under and i reach this conclusion,largely as a result of amendment number,where the parties specifically chose to include language which addressed the very issue of what the buyer should mean in that subsection that why i make that conclusion.this results in making exide solely liable for the asserted breaches 
app.it,therefore,found the claims within its jurisdiction under b b and b c and determined that remand and abstention were not warranted.it requested that counsel jointly draft an order memorializing its decision.
on december,the order was entered and provided 
for the reasons articulated on the record on november,plaintiffs motion is denied.the court finds that section a of the coordinating agreement as modified by amendment of the coordinating agreement is unambiguous,that debtor exide is the sole indemnitor thereunder,and that consequently the foreign pacific dunlop entities have no right of recovery against the exide entities.the court also finds that all the claims asserted by the plaintiffs,including those of the foreign pacific dunlop entities,are core proceedings to which the automatic stay applies,that the court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to b b and c,that mandatory abstention pursuant to c is inapplicable,and that neither remand pursuant to b nor discretionary abstention pursuant to c is warranted.
app.the order also extended the automatic stay to the claims against the exide foreign entities.
the pdh foreign entities subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration,urging the court to allow them to adduce evidence to counter this interpretation of the coordinating agreement because they had not anticipated that the meaning of this agreement would be decided as part of their motion to remand or abstain.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion on february,but did not issue a decision for approximately months.
in the interim,exide reorganization plan was confirmed on april,and became effective two weeks later.under the plan,the reorganized exide created a new foreign subsidiary and merged exide europe and exide asia into it.pdh foreign entities rights against exide foreign entities were not impaired by the reorganization plan.in fact,in providing for the discharge of claims against exide,the confirmation order expressly stated excepting,however,that any claims of the pacific dunlop holdings entities against subsidiaries of the debtors are not affected hereby.app.
more than a year after the plan was confirmed,the bankruptcy court denied pdh motion for reconsideration.app.the clerk docketing of the order characterizes it as a dismissal of the pdh foreign entities claims against the exide foreign entities.
pdh appealed the denial of their motions to the united states district court for the district of delaware.at oral argument,the district court focused largely on the pdh foreign entities filing of proofs of claim and said i think you have to choose whether you are going to try to collect against the debtor or you are going to choose to withdraw your proofs of claim and do what you say you want to do,which is just proceed against the nondebtor entity.app.see also app,i do think the bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction at all but for the contingent claim.when the hearing concluded,it requested supplemental briefing on whether filing proofs of claim when there is an indemnity relationship between debtor and gives the bankruptcy court core jurisdiction over the underlying cause of action between.
on march,the district court issued a memorandum order,denying the pdh foreign entities appeal and affirming the orders of the bankruptcy court.first,it decided that the pdh foreign entities four proofs of claim against exide invoked the claims allowance process and were core proceedings second,it agreed with the bankruptcy court that the coordinating agreement was unambiguous in its designation of exide as the sole indemnitor.it concluded that,
o nce exide was identified as the sole indemnitor for the state claims brought by the pdh foreign entities against the exide foreign entities,it follows that the pdh foreign entities,through their proofs of claim,have direct claims against the debtor and its bankruptcy estate and that the resolution of the claims through the claims process is a core proceeding subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
app.in support of its conclusion,the court cited pacor higgins,cir,as representing our recognition that a debtor agreement to indemnify a third party gives rise to jurisdiction over nonbankrupt controversies with that third party,especially where the third party has filed a claim against the debtor.app.pdh usa and the pdh foreign entities timely appealed the district court order.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction to hear the pdh foreign entities appeal from the bankruptcy court denial of their motion to remand abstain and motion for reconsideration,respectively,pursuant to a.the district court subsequent affirmance of the bankruptcy court orders on march,gave rise to this appeal,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to d and.we review the appeal of the ruling not to exercise mandatory abstention under d.stoe flaherty,cir.the consequent ruling not to remand,however,is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of title.b.
our review of the bankruptcy court orders is the same as that exercised by the district court.in re zinchiak,cir.we review its rulings as if we were reviewing it in the first instance,and our review is plenary.see stonington partners,lernout hauspie speech prods,cir zinchiak,at in re continental airlines,cir.we,therefore,exercise plenary review of the questions of whether the claims at issue are core proceedings and whether the mandatory abstention provision of c applies to this removed case.stoe,at.because the district court acted as an appellate court,our review of its decision is similarly plenary.in re myers,cir.
iii.discussion 
bankruptcy jurisdiction extends to four types of proceedings cases under title,that is,the bankruptcy petition proceedings arising under title proceedings arising in a bankruptcy case and proceedings related to a bankruptcy case.b in re combustion eng g,cir.the first three categories are core proceedings in which the bankruptcy court has power to hear,decide,and enter orders and judgments.b.the fourth category,related to proceedings,are proceedings,which the bankruptcy court can hear,but in which it can only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court,not issue orders.halper halper,cir.as we have said,a proceeding belongs to the broader universe of all proceedings that are not core proceedings but are nevertheless related to a bankruptcy case.id.at internal citations omitted.they,therefore,need not necessarily be against the debtor or against the debtor property,but,rather,need only be such that the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.pacor,at see also in re global,cir.
whether claims are considered core or proceedings dictates not only the bankruptcy court role and powers but also the availability of mandatory abstention,see b,and the enforcement of forum selection clauses,see in re diaz contracting,cir.if the claims of the pdh foreign entities against the exide foreign entities are merely related to the debtor bankruptcy case,abstention and enforcement of the forum selection clause of the coordinating agreement are appropriate.the dispositive issue,therefore,is whether the claims asserted by the pdh foreign entities against the exide foreign entities in state court are core bankruptcy claims within the meaning of b.we accordingly will begin by examining the bases upon which the bankruptcy court found that the claims at issue were core.
core proceedings 
in order to evaluate whether a claim is core,a court must first look to the illustrative list of core proceedings found in b.it must then conduct this court test,according to which a claim will be deemed core if it invokes a substantive right provided by title or if it is a proceeding,that by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.halper,at citing in re guild gallery plus,cir.each claim within the same cause of action must be analyzed claim by claim and each alone must satisfy this test in order to be considered a core proceeding.halper,at.a single cause of action may include both core and claims.the mere fact that a claim is filed with a core claim will not mean the second claim becomes core.see in re best reception systems.
here,the claims brought by the pdh foreign entities are state law claims,respectively,breach of contract,conversion,and unjust enrichment,asserted against defendants.none of the claims fall neatly into the list of core proceedings under b 
even assuming that the claims fall within the list,its a substantive right under the bankruptcy code.each claim is a state law cause of action,sounding in contract and tort.each the filing of the bankruptcy petition and were filed in state court and,consequently,do not appear to be proceedings that could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.it is important,however,that a court not simply apply the terms of the statute but rather analyze the nature of the underlying claim to determine whether,given constitutional constraints on bankruptcy jurisdiction,that claim should be considered a core proceeding.meadowlands commc n,banker trust.
here,the bankruptcy court determined that the pdh foreign entities claims,although seemingly between,were actually claims against the debtor estate and,therefore,core proceedings under b b and c.in reaching this conclusion,it adopted two alternative theories.according to the first,the pdh foreign entities claims against the exide foreign entities were,in actuality,claims directly against exide,over which the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction.as the argument goes,article a of the coordinating the pdh entities right of recovery to an action for indemnification against exide alone as the sole defendant.their claims were,therefore,against the debtor and core proceedings pursuant to b b the counterclaims asserted in the defendants complaint similarly became core proceedings under b c.according to the second theory,the pdh foreign entities voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court by filing proofs of claim in exide bankruptcy case.because the bankruptcy claims allowance process can arise only in the context of a title bankruptcy and the pdh foreign entities filed proofs of claims against the debtor,their claims constituted core proceedings.
on appeal,the pdh foreign entities challenge both grounds.first,they assert that their claims in the state court action are strictly between plaintiffs and defendants and,therefore.second,they say,their filing contingent proofs of claim indicates only that the debtor might be called upon if the exide foreign entities are unable to pay it does not transform the claims into a core proceeding.the bankruptcy court,therefore,either was required to abstain or to enforce the forum selection clause and remand the action to state court.the appellees,by contrast,contend that the coordinating agreement designates the debtor exide as the sole indemnitor for claims arising under the sales agreements and,consequently,the pdh foreign entities claims against the exide foreign entities are barred and actually claims against the debtor directly and the pdh foreign entities filing proofs of claim against the debtor subjects them irrevocably to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court for the purposes of deciding the cause of action originally filed in state court.the appellees also assert that,even if these other two arguments were unavailing,the claims should be deemed core,because they are so intertwined with claims against the debtor in the same cause of action.
we will examine each of the grounds for the bankruptcy court decision in turn,as well as appellees contention that the claims are core because they are intertwined with core claims.as the discussion below will make clear,we disagree with each of these bases for finding core jurisdiction.
b.the coordinating agreement and the sole indemnitor theory 
the bankruptcy court and the district court each relied heavily on exide interpretation of the contractual language in the coordinating agreement in finding core jurisdiction.both looked to the language of the coordinating agreement and the merits of the exide defendants contractual interpretation argument and held that the claims,although ostensibly against the exide foreign entities,were actually more properly understood as leveled directly against the debtor,exide.in so concluding,they found the coordinating agreement excludes all indemnification obligations of the exide foreign entities by clearly and unambiguously designating exide as the sole indemnitor,with the result that the pdh foreign entities have no valid claim against the exide foreign entities.because only the debtor is an appropriate defendant,the pdh foreign entities claims become claims of against a debtor,the resolution of which must take place in bankruptcy court.
on appeal,the pdh foreign entities argue that they did not have a fair opportunity to respond to this merits argument as the extant court rules provided them no right of reply.d.they also contend that,because their motion to remand or abstain was a procedural and jurisdictional motion which did not present the issue of contract interpretation,the bankruptcy court decision on the merits of their claims against the exide foreign entities took them by surprise.according to the appellants,the court erred in considering the merits of exide interpretation of the coordinating agreement and should have confined itself to the jurisdictional issues presented,instead of reaching any issues regarding the claims and defenses of the parties.
in response,the exide entities insist that the appellants were not unfairly surprised by the court order dismissing their claims against the exide foreign entities because they had every reason to expect that exide would address the interpretation of the coordinating agreement in its response to the remand motion and because they could have sought leave of the court to file a reply they argue that the court properly reached the merits and correctly concluded the relevant contract language was clear and unambiguous.
given the requirement that a court carefully evaluate every claim individually to determine if it is core,or unrelated to the bankruptcy case,we agree with the exide appellees that both the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly decided that the issue of the coordinating agreement interpretation had to be resolved in order to decide the motion to abstain or remand.a determination as to whether the pdh foreign entities claims had to proceed against the debtor alone was necessary to the disposition of the motion.however,we believe that both courts erred in concluding that the coordinating agreement was unambiguous.
indeed,the contractual provision at issue is anything but clear.article a,entitled indemnification by buyer,delineates the obligations of buyer to pdh usa and the pdh foreign entities seller and international sellers,respectively as follows 
a subject to sections b,c,and d,buyer agrees to indemnify and hold seller and the international sellers and their affiliates harmless from and against any and all losses and expenses incurred by seller or the international sellers and their affiliates in connection with or arising from 
i any breach by buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in the sale agreements or in this agreement 
ii any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation by buyer contained in the sale agreements,or 
iii any breach by buyer of any covenant contained in section or section of the agreement or the corresponding provisions in the other sale agreements.
app.the provision does not define buyer to mean only exide nor does it use the term sole indemnitor or establish that exide would be exclusively a proper party for any claims.for the purposes of the coordinating agreement,the term buyer is in fact to mean buyer as the context may require any international buyer.app.
the bankruptcy court and the district court,however,reasoned that amendment to the coordinating agreement clarified the provision and unambiguously designated exide as the sole indemnitor and the only proper party for any breach of the sales agreements.after the amendment,subsection i read any breach by buyer or,for the sake of clarification,any international buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in the sale agreements or in this agreement new inserted language emphasized.the remaining language in a was unchanged.
based on the amendment,the bankruptcy court held there was no ambiguity in a and exide was unambiguously solely liable for the asserted breaches.app.it reasoned,
i reach this conclusion,largely as a result of amendment number,where the parties specifically chose to include language which addressed the very issue of what the buyer should mean in that subsection,and it strikes me that there no other reasonable inference to be drawn from the making of that amendment other than the parties intended to make that clarification with respect to section a small roman i that why i make that conclusion.this results in making exide solely liable for the asserted breaches 
id.its order similarly provided 
the court finds that section a of the coordinating agreement as modified by amendment of the coordinating agreement is unambiguous,that debtor exide is the sole indemnitor thereunder,and that consequently the foreign pacific dunlop entities have no right of recovery against the exide entities.
app.faced with the pdh foreign entities motion for reconsideration,the bankruptcy court further reasoned that 
by virtue of amendment,the parties specifically and deliberately carved out only one clause of section a to clarify.the other parts of section a remained unchanged.therefore,the only reasonable inference that arises from amendment is that the parties intended that the term buyer,as used in the remainder of section a,means only exide corporation.
app.on appeal from the bankruptcy court order,the district court agreed with this conclusion.
this was error.amendment does not make clear that exide is the sole indemnitor under the coordinating agreement.even after the amendment,article a does not unambiguously state that only one of the numerous contracting buyers assumed indemnification obligations.nothing in the agreement indicates that the sole recourse of the pdh foreign entities is against exide or provides a waiver of rights as against the exide entities.no amendment provided that the term in the heading or first phrase of a should no longer be defined as buyer international buyer.
we find illogical the bankruptcy court assertion that the only reasonable inference from the amendment is that buyer means only exide in the other subsections of the provision.it simply does not follow that,because the amendment clarified that the term buyer in subsection a i meant exide or one of the exide foreign entities,it also established that buyer used elsewhere in a unambiguously meant only exide.in fact,buyer as used in other subsections of article a is more reasonably read to mean both exide and the exide foreign entities.subsection iii,for instance,provides as an event for which the sellers will be indemnified any breach by buyer of any covenant contained in section or section of the agreement or the corresponding provisions in the other sales agreements.app.the reference to buyer here could mean only both exide and the exide foreign entities because exide was not a party to the other sales agreements and could not,therefore,have breached any covenants therein.thus,buyer has to mean exide and the exide foreign entities.the language of subsection ii suggests a similar interpretation.
accordingly,the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that the coordinating agreement unambiguously designates the debtor as the sole indemnitor and only proper party to the pdh foreign entities claims.
this error was magnified by the court somewhat precipitous consideration of this important and dispositive issue.the court gave no notice to the parties that it would decide this issue as to the meaning of the agreement at the hearing.the pdh entities had no right to reply to exide merits argument.yet,at the very outset of the hearing,the court stated that it considered the claims to be core.it,in essence,credited the defendants argument before pdh counsel had even had an opportunity to address the issue.
in so doing,the court failed to provide the pdh foreign entities with adequate notice and opportunity to present arguments regarding the proper interpretation of the contract under illinois law.prior to the hearing,neither party had even researched illinois law applicable to the presentation of extrinsic evidence or the interpretation of the contract.counsel for pdh protested that the exide foreign entities had acknowledged that they could be held liable under the coordinating agreement and perhaps waived the sole indemnitor theory,saying,
i should point out that there was in the state court in the first complaint an answer filed by the exide entities collectively.and in the answer,which i have and can submit i do think there would be any dispute about that,it a no defense asserted.you ca sue us,the foreign entities it not in there.they did raise that.they did raise that for a good long time in the litigation in illinois.why not because they understood that there was a right to sue them there.so that another factor by way of the behavior of the parties to show the understanding and their intent.
app.he further noted that exide counsel did not disagree that the exide defendants answer and counterclaim in state court failed to raise the sole indemnitor theory asserted before the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy court had not yet received the pleadings from illinois state court and never even addressed this argument.
the pdh foreign entities should have had the opportunity to pursue their contention that they were entitled to sue their respective contracting exide foreign entities based on illinois state law and the contracting parties understanding of the coordinating agreement.in their motion for reconsideration,the pdh foreign entities urged the court to reconsider its decision not to consider any extrinsic evidence,its apparent decision that there was not even a latent ambiguity in the agreements at issue between the parties,and its narrow interpretation of a portion of amendment to the coordinating agreement app.they argued that illinois law supported consideration of extrinsic evidence and they raised the defenses of mutual mistake and latent ambiguity as well.at the hearing on the motion,counsel for pdh urged the court to reconsider its decision because the motion for remand had not presented the contractual interpretation issue on which the court based its decision and he had not been prepared to argue the issue and fully develop defenses.yet,in ultimately denying reconsideration months later,after exide bankruptcy plan had been confirmed,the bankruptcy court dismissed this argument as new legal theories that could have been raised previously.app.
because the court acted precipitously,it failed to permit the pdh foreign entities to challenge exide proposed interpretation of the coordinating agreement.based on its holding that the relevant provision was unambiguous,it also refused to consider extrinsic evidence.accordingly,although we now reverse the court determination that exide is unambiguously the sole indemnitor,we can not evaluate the contract interpretation on its merits because the record was not developed in the bankruptcy court.while the court correctly determined that an analysis of the indemnification provision in the coordinating agreement was necessary to determine whether the pdh foreign entities claims were actually directed against the debtor and therefore core,it erred in concluding that the provision was unambiguous and failing to allow extrinsic evidence to be introduced.see,farm credit bank of louis whitlock,noting that when a contract is capable of being understood in more sense than one,parol evidence is admissible.
we will,therefore,remand in order to permit the bankruptcy court to evaluate the issue more thoroughly.upon remand,the court should allow the parties to brief the issue of whether the coordinating agreement makes exide solely liable for all of the pdh foreign entities claims,to present extrinsic evidence,and to develop the evidentiary record.in evaluating whether the claims are core proceedings,the court should also exercise care to analyze each claim individually we note that,although,as the exide foreign entities point out,the pdh foreign entities did not specifically address this issue in connection with their motion to remand or abstain,they had no right to file a reply.they should be permitted to respond to it on remand.
proofs of claim and core proceedings 
although we hold that the bankruptcy court erred and should consider anew the meaning of the coordinating agreement,we must also address the second,alternate and potentially dispositive ground upon which the bankruptcy court and district court,that the pdh foreign entities filing proofs of claims in exide bankruptcy case rendered their claims against the exide foreign entities core proceedings.
section b b provides that core proceedings include allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate.both courts reasoned that,by filing a proof of claim in the debtor bankruptcy case,the pdh foreign entities invoked the allowance process and their claims became core.we could accept this reasoning if it were premised upon the coordinating agreement designation of exide as the only proper party to the pdh foreign entities claims so that the subject matter of the proofs of claim is the same as that of the state law action.however,the bankruptcy court suggested that,whenever a proof of claim is filed by a claimant in the debtor bankruptcy case,whatever claims are referenced therein become core proceedings under b b.even before considering the sole indemnitor argument,the bankruptcy court stated,it clear to me that by virtue of the filing of the proofs of claim that in large measure the matters before me are core app.on appeal,the district court similarly expressed a belief that by filing proofs of claim against the debtor,the pdh foreign entities were precluded from proceeding against the defendants.it stated,it seems to me that if they had filed cont ingent proofs of claim in bankruptcy,that,truly,the bankruptcy court would not have had necessarily jurisdiction over this dispute so long as there was any recourse to the debtor.app.it then concluded that,when the pdh foreign entities filed their four proofs of claim against the exide bankruptcy estate,they irrevocably consented to have their claims heard and decided by the bankruptcy court.app.it is this proposition that we must now examine.
on appeal,the pdh foreign entities argue that their filing of contingent proofs of claim in the debtor bankruptcy case does not establish that claims against constitute core proceedings.the proofs of claim were for contribution or indemnification from exide,contingent on securing a judgment against the exide foreign entities and their not being able to pay it,and,while they might have submitted the pdh foreign entities to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court,they did not render the claims against the exide defendants core.
in response,the exide foreign entities urge us to affirm the bankruptcy court decision,contending that the filing of proofs of claims against the debtor rendered the pdh foreign entities claims textbook core proceedings.the contingent language within the proofs of claims,they say,has no bearing on the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.
to address these arguments properly,we must first clarify the effect the filing of a proof of claim in a debtor bankruptcy has on the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over claims against.as the following explains,we believe the case law is clear that the filing of a proof of claim may cause claims against to be deemed related to proceedings,but will not result in their being considered core proceedings.
we agree,as exide observes,that it is axiomatic that filing a proof of claim triggers the claims allowance process under et,which,by its very nature,is a core proceeding that can arise only in a title case.appellee br.see also in re argus group,debtors proposition that the filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy transforms a state law claim which was filed in state court before the bankruptcy into a core proceeding is sound.indeed,it has long been black letter law that 
the filing of the proof invokes the special rules of bankruptcy concerning objections to the claim,estimation of the claim for allowance purposes,and the rights of the claimant to vote on the proposed distribution.understood in this sense,a claim filed against the estate is a core proceeding because it could arise only in the context of bankruptcy.of course,the right underlying the claim could be enforced in a state court proceeding absent the bankruptcy,but the nature of the state proceeding would be different from the nature of the proceeding following the filing of a proof of claim.

nonetheless,the case law belies the assertion that,when a plaintiff files a proof of claim in a debtor bankruptcy case,it creates core bankruptcy jurisdiction over claims against defendants as well.for example,in holiday rv superstores,plaintiffs brought state law claims of fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and successor liability against the debtor principal and successor,but did not name the debtor.although one of the plaintiffs filed a proof of claim,which included a copy of the complaint,the court held that it established only that the plaintiffs may have a claim against someone other than the estate for the same claim and did not transform a proceeding into a core proceeding.id.at.similarly,in cit communications finance level communications,llc,plaintiff state court action against,asserting breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and conversion arising from an equipment lease the defendants had purchased from the debtor,was found to be unrelated to the bankruptcy case.d.despite the defendants assertions that the debtor was the responsible party whom they would need to implead and the plaintiff filing a proof of claim that concerned the same lease,the court rejected the defendants jurisdictional argument because plaintiffs are alleging two separate contractual breaches,one attributable to the debtors before they sold their assets,and the other for defendants subsequent,independent failure to make the monthly payments to plaintiff after purchasing those assets.id.at.
exide,however,claims our decision in travellers int l ag.robinson,cir,dictates that because the pdh foreign entities filed proofs of claim,their claims are core proceedings.we disagree.in travellers,we held that w here a creditor has filed a claim,even though the claim is couched in protective language and is contingent,that creditor has submitted to the bankruptcy court equitable jurisdiction and waived any seventh amendment right to a jury trial.id.at.our decision,however,was limited to t he sole legal question of whether a contingent proof of claim filed against a bankrupt estate,arising from a judgment in favor of a creditor,subjects the creditor corporation to the equitable jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.id.at emphasis added.we did not purport to do away with our traditional analysis,nor did we indicate that filing a proof of claim renders claims between core.
we can find no authority to support exide broad assertion as to the impact of filing proofs of claim.we agree with the appellants that,as a general rule,actions asserted by those plaintiffs who filed actions against parties exclusively,regardless of whether they filed a proof of claim,are presumptively.in re best reception systems,at accord in re harrah entm t.sec,civ,wl,while langenkamp might stand for the proposition that plaintiffs have waived their jury trial right against the debtor by submitting a proof of claim in the debtor bankruptcy proceedings,langenkamp do es not stand for the broader proposition that plaintiffs have waived their jury right in a proceeding against defendants simply by filing a proof of claim against a debtor in a related bankruptcy case in re argus group,at rejecting debtors argument that the plaintiff proofs of claims filed in their bankruptcy cases transformed his state law causes of action against the debtor operating entity which was not in bankruptcy into a core proceeding.
the proposition that a contingent proof of claim against a debtor for contribution or indemnification somehow changes the analysis,rendering state court claims against core,similarly receives no support in the case law.see,kerusa.llc real estate,civ gel,wl,may,even if the proofs of claim filed by the plaintiffs in the jones bankruptcy render their claims against jones core,they have no effect on the claims against the other defendants or the many among defendants other than jones,all of which are clearly.hickox leeward isles resorts,finding related to jurisdiction where plaintiff suit against defendant over the promissory notes may conceivably affect the administration of the debtor estate because debtor served as guarantor of the defendant loan and proofs of claim had been filed davis merv griffin,finding related to jurisdiction where a proof of claim filed by defendant claimed he was entitled to indemnification by debtor.in davis life investors insurance company of america,the court considered and rejected an argument like the one exide now advances.there,life investors,a defendant in a state court action,attempted to establish core bankruptcy jurisdiction over the state court cause of action because it had an alleged contractual right to indemnity from debtor for any judgment the plaintiff might obtain against it and had filed a proof of claim in the debtor bankruptcy case.id.at.the court was not persuaded and held that the case was not a core proceeding merely because the outcome of this case,if adverse to life investors,will result in a claim or support the existing contingent claim by life investors against the debtor bankruptcy estate which in turn might affect the assets of the estate.id.at.in sum,there is no authority that a party with a contingent claim for indemnification can bootstrap its claim onto the bankruptcy court core jurisdiction.in re amanat.
yet,the district court stated that our decision in pacor higgins provides just such authority.in concluding that the pdh foreign entities claims were core,it pacor stands for the proposition that a debtor agreement to indemnify a third party gives rise to jurisdiction over nonbankruptcy controversies with that third party,especially where it has filed a claim against the debtor.app.citing pacor,at.this is not accurate.pacor clearly holds that in the event of such an indemnification obligation,related to jurisdiction might exist.to the extent that the filing of a proof of claim against a debtor who has an obligation to indemnify is relevant,it is so because it transforms the improbable into the conceivable,thereby rendering the underlying claims involving indemnitees related to the bankruptcy core.in re salem mills,observing that a bsent the filing of a proof of claim involving a indemnification action,it is unknown whether the original indemnitor will assert a claim if prevailing davis,at without doubt,the filing of a proof of claim asserting a right to indemnification and consequently the demand to share in the pro rata share of distribution of the estate in connection with plaintiff action has some effect on debtor estate and its rights,liability and freedom of action.accordingly,claims between may be related to a bankruptcy case,but generally do not qualify as core proceedings under b.see,pacor,at in re holdings,in re global,supra in re athos steel and aluminum.
this case does not differ in any meaningful way from the cases referenced above in which there were state court claims against,proofs of claim filed,and a duty of the debtor to indemnify,and the claims were found to be proceedings here,the pdh foreign entities filed state law causes of action exclusively against the exide foreign entities,making the claims at issue strictly between.the proofs of claim submitted against exide are separate from the right to proceed against the foreign entities and were filed in light of an imminent claim bar date.the proofs of claim do not assert the state law causes of action against exide,but rather assert a right to collect from exide,should the pdh foreign entities win a judgment that the exide foreign entities are unable to satisfy.they are essentially contribution or indemnification claims where the claimants are looking to the for payment in the first instance and are clearly different from the breach of contract,conversion,and unjust enrichment claims asserted against the exide foreign entities in state court.the language of the proofs of claim filed make apparent the distinction,noting their position that each of the exide foreign entities is primarily liable for its breaches,and that the debtor is secondarily liable to the extent that the individual exide foreign entity is unable to satisfy the judgment against it.see,app.
as the pdh entities note,only by erasing the distinction between the pdh foreign entities state court claims against the exide foreign entities and their proofs of claim against the exide estate,is exide able to argue that the pdh foreign entities state law claims are core.to follow exide argument to its logical conclusion,whenever a plaintiff sues multiple defendants and one files for bankruptcy,if that plaintiff files a proof of claim against the debtor,his or her claims against the remaining would become core proceedings as well.we know this is not the case.in the context of mass tort or securities cases,involving large numbers of defendants and indemnity relationships,courts routinely find that the remaining claims between are or even entirely unrelated to the bankruptcy case 
therefore,we now hold that,by filing proofs of claim in exide bankruptcy proceeding,the pdh foreign entities have not transformed their state law claims against defendants into core matters that the bankruptcy court must resolve.the claims asserted in the pdh foreign entities proofs of claim are not the same as the claims against the defendants in the state court action.see in re argus group,at.the pdh foreign entities filing of contingent proofs of claim does not render the dispute between plaintiffs and defendants core.the proofs of claim for indemnification against the debtor merely demonstrate that the claims against the exide entities are related to exide bankruptcy case as they could conceivably have an effect on the bankruptcy estate.pacor,at halper,at noting that c ertainty or likelihood is not a requirement 
accordingly,if,after remand,the bankruptcy court decides that,based on the coordinating agreement,exide is the only proper party against whom the pdh foreign entities may seek a remedy,then the claims would be core proceedings.if,however,the court decides that the coordinating agreement permits the pdh foreign entities to pursue their claims against the defendants,the claims will be not only,but also subject to mandatory abstention and enforcement of the agreement forum selection clause and should accordingly be returned to the illinois state court for trial.
intertwined claims and in re rbgsc inv.corp 
although appellees rely heavily on their sole indemnitor theory,they aver there is yet another ground on which to base a finding of core jurisdiction.they say,assuming arguendo that the pdh foreign entities had independent claims against the affiliates the bankruptcy court still has core matter jurisdiction over the removed state court actions because of the indemnitor and subsidiary relationships between the parties.appellee br.citing in re rbgsc inv,at.urging us to adopt the approach of the district court in in re rbgsc inv,they claim that a state court action involving debtors and becomes core if the core and claims are so intertwined that merely to disentangle them would be with a resolution of the merits of the disputes.id.the exide entities made a similar argument to the bankruptcy court,which it seemed to credit 
lest the bankruptcy court be persuaded by exide intertwinement argument on remand,we now consider and reject it.
in in re rbgsc inv,the only case exide cites for the rule that intertwined claims become core,plaintiffs asserted a variety of state court claims,including injunction,specific performance,defamation,and breach of various agreements,arising out of a series of complex business arrangements,against the debtor rbgsc and defendants jointly.after rbgsc removed the state court action to bankruptcy court and filed a motion for relief from orders the state court had entered prior to removal,its filed similar motions in response,the plaintiffs moved for abstention and remand.at.the bankruptcy court denied the plaintiffs motion on the ground that their claims against the defendants were core and essentially claims against the debtor.id.at.
the district court on appeal held that 
where the links between and among the various parties,including the state court plaintiffs and the debtor and defendants,are so intertwined by virtue of the many agreements defining these relationships,we can not see how appellants state court claims could be viewed,in the wake of the bankruptcy,as anything other than a claim on the estate.
id.at.because plaintiffs had asserted state court claims against rbgsc and the defendants jointly,the court concluded that identifying claims from the state court complaint that are not tied to rbgsc would in itself present a daunting legal task and,therefore,the claims against the were core proceedings whose determination would be with a resolution of the merits of the disputes.id.at.
as an initial matter,it strikes us that in re rbgsc inv.is distingushable from the present case.here,instead of asserting claims directly against the debtor,jointly with other defendants,each of the pdh foreign entities made discrete claims against each of the and did not assert those claims against debtor or assert joint liability.indeed,it is simple to separate the pdh foreign entities claims against the exide foreign entities from the claims against the debtor,and from one another,because they are stated separately.each referenced separate agreements and was filed against either one or two of the exide foreign entities.
nonetheless,insofar as in re rbgsc inv.holds that claims against are rendered core because of close business relationships between the debtor and or intertwinement with a claim against a debtor,it is legally unsound and must be overruled.we reiterate that courts must engage in a analysis to determine whether a proceeding is core.halper,at.each state court claim removed to bankruptcy court must be considered individually claims do not become core simply by virtue of being pursued in the same litigation as core claims.accordingly,the intertwinement theory can not be sustained.
we note that the in re rbgsc inv.decision has not received subsequent support among district courts in this circuit or others.see,mirant southern,disagreeing with the bankruptcy court that claims were so intertwined with the other claims in the complaint that core bankruptcy jurisdiction lay davis,at rejecting defendant argument that the state court cause of action is a core proceeding merely because it is intertwined with its indemnity claim in re winstar commc n,evaluating claims arising out of a contract between plaintiff and three sellers,two chapter debtors and subsidiary,and holding that the mere fact that there may be common issues of fact between a civil proceeding and a controversy involving the bankruptcy estate does not bring the matter within the scope of section b.
accepting the rule that exide urges would turn virtually every claim contained in an action in which the debtor is one of the defendants and which is later removed to bankruptcy court into a core proceeding.the pdh foreign entities can not be required to have their rights against exide subsidiaries be determined by the bankruptcy court solely because exide invoked its protection.adoption of the intertwinement theory would cause debtors to 
bring every wholly owned subsidiary into every bankruptcy case regardless of the circumstances and without the safeguards afforded by schedules,statements of financial affairs,notices to creditors,or meetings of creditors and could result in debtors and others abusing the system by withholding from bankruptcy or bringing into bankruptcy subsidiaries in a revolving door fashion.
in re winstar commc n,at.moreover,permitting core bankruptcy jurisdiction to stretch so far would present serious constitutional questions.mirant,at observing that t he principles announced in marathon would be violated if such an intertwinement theory were to be given effect.
thus,we now conclude that the intertwinement theory espoused by in re rbgsc inv.corp has no place in our core jurisprudence.
iv.conclusion 
as we set forth above,the bankruptcy court committed several errors in reaching the conclusion that the claims at issue here are core proceedings under b b and c.the state of the record,however,does not permit us to decide whether the claims can properly be deemed core.
we,therefore,will vacate the district court memorandum order entered on march,and remand the case to the district court with instructions to 
vacate the decisions of the bankruptcy court dated december,entered december,and june,entered june,and 
remand this case to the bankruptcy court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

the appellees devote a large section of their brief to procedural barriers they allege defeat the pdh foreign entities argument that the bankruptcy court decision on the merits surprised them and improperly prevented them from presenting defenses.they alternately contend that the appellants waived the argument,endorsed the bankruptcy court order and are estopped from challenging it,and are precluded from challenging it because it did not dispose of their are not persuaded.as to waiver,the appellants repeatedly objected to the bankruptcy court decision as having ambushed and surprised them.they raised the argument before the bankruptcy court on reconsideration and the district court on appeal and preserved it for our lacking in merit is the exide foreign entities theory that appellants should be estopped from challenging the order because their counsel suggested the language used therein and therefore endorsed it.the bankruptcy court issued its ruling at the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to remand or abstain and simply requested that counsel draft the order to memorialize its decision.the fact that appellants counsel
