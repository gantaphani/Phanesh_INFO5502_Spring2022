to secure a loan to their publishing,and paul attard granted a security interest in all of their multicom stock to the lender,finova mezzanine capital,fmc.the attards also executed a guaranty agreement promising to absolutely assign their stock to fmc free of all claims in the event of multicom default,failing which they agreed to be personally liable for the debt.when fmc subsequently notified the attards that multicom was in default and demanded the assignment of their stock,the attards signed the appropriate assignment form,but included a letter stating that the assignment was executed under duress.
fmc filed suit,claiming that,by virtue of the duress letter,the attards had not unconditionally assigned their stock and were therefore personally liable for the balance of the multicom debt pursuant to the guaranty agreement.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the attards.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
the attards founded multicom,a multimedia publishing company,in.multicom entered into a million loan agreement with a predecessor of fmc in.as part of the loan transaction,multicom granted fmc a security interest in substantially all of mutlicom assets.
as further security for the loan,the attards signed a stock pledge agreement pledge agreement on october,that granted fmc a security interest in their multicom stock,which was perfected by fmc possession of the stock certificates.the attards also executed a conditional continuing guaranty and assurance guaranty,wherein they agreed that if multicom defaulted on its obligations to fmc,the attards would absolutely assign all of their multicom stock to fmc within two days following a written demand by fmc.section five of the guaranty provided that the attards 
agree that if a designated default occurs,then,within two calendar days following the written demand of lender,the attards shall absolutely assign to lender or its designee,pursuant to ordinary instruments of assignment to be prepared by lender,all of the stock of borrower multicom that is then pledged to lender to secure the obligations.this conveyance will vest title in the transferee free of any claim of the attards and free of any other encumbrance,and without reduction in the obligations that borrower then owes to lender.
in the event that the attards failed to comply with section five absolute assignment of multicom stock,the guaranty provided that they would become personally obligated,both jointly and severally,for muticom debt to fmc.section six of the guaranty specifically stated that s hould either of the attards fail to comply fully with their obligations in section above,the attards hereby jointly and severally guarantee to lender the timely payment and performance of all of the obligations.
fmc sent a letter to the attards on november,advising them that multicom had defaulted on its obligations to fmc and demanding the immediate,absolute conveyance of the pledged stock to fmc.the letter also stated that if the attards failed to convey the pledged stock by november,then they would become personally liable for multicom obligations.fmc followed up on november with a form titled absolute assignment of stock.on november,the attards tendered to fmc the completed absolute assignment of stock form,but accompanied the signed form with a letter from their counsel expressly reserving certain of the attards rights against fmc.the letter stated,in pertinent part 
please be advised that my clients forward this document under duress,in order to mitigate their damages,and with full and absolute reservation of all of their rights at law and in equity.these rights include,without any limitation whatsoever,the right to challenge as null and void the underlying documents pursuant to which fmc purports to proceed the right to challenge the alleged default asserted by fmc and the right to challenge the activities of fmc and multicom in pursuing foreclosure of the subject shares of stock 
fmc initially responded with a letter dated november,informing the attards that fmc was also reserving all of its rights against them.the next significant event was on february,when fmc sold all of the assets of multicom to multimedia,for million.eight days later,on february,fmc wrote the attards to inform them that the duress letter caused their assignment of multicom stock to not be free of all claims,thus subjecting them to personal liability under the guaranty.

b.the effect of the duress letter on the assignment of the attards stock to fmc 
on appeal,the key issue is whether the attards fully complied with their obligations under the guaranty to absolutely assign all of the stock that they had pledged to fmc under the pledge agreement.the guaranty explicitly states that t his conveyance will vest title in the transferee free of any claim of the attards and free of any other encumbrance emphasis added.fmc argues that the attards claim of duress in their november,letter,in addition to their full and absolute reservation of all their rights at law and equity,does not represent an assignment free of any claim of the attards.the attards respond that the guaranty did not include or require any disclaimer of duress or other legal or equitable rights.they also contend that the november letter did not create an adverse claim rendering the assignment ineffective.
the guaranty states,and the parties do not contest,that it shall be interpreted in accordance with tennessee law.under tennessee law,a contract signed under economic duress is voidable by the victim,not void.cumberland ohio of texas first am.bank,cir united states fidelity guar.cassel,in re mcneil,a contract or other instrument is voidable under tennessee law on the basis of duress a voidable contract is one where one or more parties have the power,by a manifestation of election to do so,to avoid the legal relations created by the contract,or by ratification of the contract to extinguish the power of avoidance.restatement second of contracts.
the district court recognized that by claiming duress,the attards had informed fmc that the assignment was voidable under tennessee law.according to the district court,however,merely asserting duress,as opposed to actually rescinding the assignment,did not constitute a claim on the stock that made the assignment invalid.we respectfully disagree.by claiming that they executed the assignment under duress,the attards put fmc on notice that they were retaining the right to rescind the assignment of their stock.their letter in effect materially modified the terms of the assignment.see restatement second of contracts,a writing is interpreted as a whole,and all writings that are part of the same transaction are interpreted together.
fmc supports its argument that the attards letter constituted a claim in violation of the guaranty by relying upon the definition of an adverse claim in ann.a hereinafter referred to as ucc a.sect
