doner is an s corporation incorporated under the laws of michigan.donald riesett,a citizen of maryland,worked for doner until february.while employed at doner,riesett held doner stock,pursuant to a shareholder agreement,which provided 
u pon the termination of a shareholder employment with the company for any reason company will buy,and such shareholder will sell,all of such shareholder shares for the price established under section or below,as applicable,with settlement to be made in accordance with section below.
doner did not redeem the stock after riesett termination of employment,and on june,riesett filed a complaint against doner,under the diversity jurisdiction of,alleging breach of contract and violations of state law.on february,the parties entered into a settlement agreement that required doner to pay riesett several hundred thousand dollars in damages some of it payable immediately,the remainder payable in monthly installments.doner also agreed to redeem riesett stock for subject to adjustments,most of it payable in four yearly installments,each due on may.in the event of default by doner,the settlement agreement provides 
riesett shall provide doner with written notice of such untimely payment.if doner fails to make any payment required under this agreement with sic five business days of receipt of notice from riesett,then all further amounts due under this agreement or those agreements shall become immediately due and payable.
doner further agreed to provide riesett accountant with information reasonably necessary to form an opinion as to the proper valuation of riesett stock in doner.
despite the settlement agreement,further litigation ensued.riesett filed an amended complaint in the district court,with two new counts.count xiii sought an order requiring doner to produce certain documents that riesett believed to be relevant to the valuation of riesett doner stock.in count xiv,riesett asserted his right,as a shareholder of doner,to a distribution to defray taxes on his income,which the other shareholders of doner received in january.finally,riesett filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement by accelerating all the stock redemption installment payments because the scheduled may,payment arrived late.
the district court granted summary judgment to riesett on count xiii,but granted summary judgment to doner on count xiv.finally,the district court granted in part and denied in part riesett motion to enforce the settlement agreement.the district court refused to accelerate the remaining stock redemption installment payments,as riesett requested,but instead ordered doner to pay riesett interest at the prime rate for the delay in the payment that should have arrived on may.
because the district court entered a final judgment on all these claims pursuant to.b,we have jurisdiction over the parties.
we begin with count xiv of riesett amended complaint,where riesett seeks enforcement of his rights as a shareholder of doner.doner is an s corporation,and its shareholders receive distributions,at the beginning of each calendar year,to help them defray taxes on the income allocated to them by doner and reflected on their statements.in january of,doner gave each of its shareholders a check for of the income allocated on their form to defray tax liabilities.
doner refused to give riesett such a disbursement because doner claimed he was no longer a shareholder.riesett still received his form on march,which allocated nearly in taxable income to riesett for doner fiscal year ending on february,and faced a significant personal tax liability on that income,without receiving the customary distribution from doner to defray this cost.riesett claims he is still a doner shareholder notwithstanding his termination of employment,and claims that doner violated.comp.laws ann.by withholding the distribution and treating him differently than other shareholders in the same class.
the district court concluded that riesett shareholder status terminated when his employment ended in february,even though,by march,riesett had not yet surrendered his stock certificates to doner and had not received full payment for the stock.the district court reasoned that t he unconditional requirement that riesett transfer his shares to doner upon termination of his employment clearly indicates that the parties contemplated that riesett would be a shareholder only while employed for the corporation.
we do not agree with the district court that doner was entitled to summary judgment on the ground that riesett was no longer a shareholder.the shareholder agreement does not state that title to an employee stock immediately passes to doner upon that employee termination rather,it merely obligates the employee to sell and the company to buy all of the shares the employee owns at some point in time after termination of employment.the text of the shareholder agreement bears repeating 
u pon the termination of a shareholder employment with the company for any reason company will buy,and such shareholder will sell,all of such shareholder shares for the price established under section or below,as applicable,with settlement to be made in accordance with section below.
emphasis added.section provides when the closing or such a sale or purchase of stock would take place 
the closing date will be b if the purchase is made other than under clause a above,the later of days after the date of the event giving rise to the purchase of shares from the shareholder and days after the financial statements needed to determine the book value of such shareholder shares have been completed.
a reasonable jury could certainly conclude that,under the shareholder agreement,a terminated employee retains his rights as a shareholder until closing,and that riesett therefore retained his rights as a shareholder after termination.indeed,it is even possible,although we need not reach the issue,that the shareholder agreement unambiguously means that an employee does not automatically lose his shareholder status upon termination of employment.the agreement did not require riesett to sell his stock immediately and he did not,nor did it automatically strip riesett of his status or rights as a shareholder upon termination.the agreement easily could have been drafted with provisions that would have eliminated any ambiguities and clearly stated that employees immediately lose their rights as shareholders upon termination of employment it was not so drafted,and the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this ground.
we nevertheless affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to doner on count xiv because,regardless of whether riesett remained a shareholder of doner,he released this claim through the settlement agreement he signed on february.riesett agreed to release doner from 
any claims for any other relief which have or could have arisen out of the employment relationship,or any other occurrence whatsoever to the date of execution of the agreement,whether presently asserted or otherwise,whether known or unknown,whether suspected or unsuspected.
emphasis added.riesett claim accrued in january of,when the distribution to the shareholders occurred.see.comp.laws ann.a claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when the damage results.the settlement agreement was signed after that and therefore released doner from liability for not making a distribution to riesett.riesett argument that the claim accrued on march,is without merit.although riesett received his form on that date,the allegedly wrongful distribution to doner shareholders,with riesett excluded,occurred in january.perhaps,riesett learned of his claim on march,but the release covers claims known or unknown that existed on february.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment to doner on count xiv is affirmed.
we next address count xiii.after the parties executed the settlement agreement,riesett accountant demanded the following documents from doner doner annual audited financial statements and federal tax returns,a complete analysis of stockholder equity transactions that occurred from march,through february,and any analysis of shareholder retained earnings for the period through.doner refused to turn them over,and riesett sued.the district court granted riesett motion for summary judgment on count xiii,concluding that riesett accountant was entitled to these documents pursuant to the settlement agreement,which provides 
riesett accountant shall have the right to obtain from doner accountants all information reasonably necessary to form an opinion as to the proper valuation of riesett stock in doner.upon receipt of the requested information,riesett accountant will have the right to obtain from doner accountants additional information necessary and appropriate to form an opinion as to the proper valuation of riesett stock in doner.
emphasis added.
doner deems this request unreasonable and unnecessary to calculate book value as defined in the shareholder agreement,and further contends that the only documents necessary to calculate the book value as defined in the shareholder agreement are the balance sheet and schedule of combined book value per share of common stock for the end of the fiscal year.doner arguments are beside the point because they disregard the language of the settlement agreement.as the district court correctly observed,the settlement agreement does not require that the information requested by riesett accountant be relevant to book value as defined in the shareholder agreement.rather,the only limitation on the information available to riesett accountant is that it be reasonably necessary to form an opinion as to the proper valuation of riesett stock.emphasis added.nowhere does the settlement agreement define proper valuation as book value under the shareholder agreement indeed,the agreement does not provide any definition of proper valuation.because the parties used such an imprecise term,we conclude,as did the district court,that the settlement agreement entitles riesett to make an independent assessment of the value of his stock,and that the requested documents are reasonably necessary to that end.the district court grant of summary judgment to riesett on this issue is affirmed.
finally,we turn to riesett contention that the district court should have accelerated doner payments because of the late arrival of an installment due on may.the settlement agreement provides that,in the event of default by doner,
riesett shall provide doner with written notice of such untimely payment.if doner fails to make any payment required under this agreement with sic five business days of receipt of notice from riesett,then all further amounts due under this agreement or those agreements shall become immediately due and payable.
emphasis added.
doner had agreed to redeem riesett stock for subject to adjustments,with most of that sum payable in four yearly installments,each due on may.when doner failed to make payment on may,riesett sent a notice of default addressed to barry levine vice chairman of doner by certified mail.a return receipt shows an indecipherable signature but not levine and a date of delivery of june.doner claims that levine does not recall receiving the letter of may,but that when levine learned of the default on july,he promptly cured the default by mailing a payment of to riesett on july.this was the amount due riesett on may,but without interest for doner delay.
the district court found that even though riesett complied with the notice requirement,it would be unreasonable and unconscionable to impose upon doner the harsh sanction of accelerating the entire amount due riesett for the redemption of his stock.instead,the district court ordered doner to pay interest at the prime rate for the delay in payment from may,to august,when the check of was received by riesett.id.we must address two issues first,whether the conditions for enforcing the acceleration clause were satisfied,and second,if they were,whether we should nevertheless deny enforcement of that contractual provision.
under the settlement agreement,only two conditions must be met for riesett to invoke the acceleration clause.first,riesett must provide doner with written notice of the untimely payment.second,doner must fail to make the delinquent payment with sic five business days of receipt of notice from riesett.we find it difficult to credit doner argument that riesett failed to provide doner with written notice,emphasis added,as did the district court,which found doner arguments on this point to be specious.someone at doner signed the certified mail receipt,and although riesett addressed the notice to levine,nowhere does the settlement agreement require that levine,or any specific officer at doner,personally receive notice from riesett.nor does the settlement agreement require that notice be sent to doner counsel,as doner appears to believe.see appellant br.at.we conclude,as did the district court,that riesett notice,addressed to levine and sent by certified mail,with the return receipt signed and received,sufficed to provide doner with written notice of the late payment.
we are also satisfied that doner fail ed to make the delinquent payment within five business days of receipt of notice from riesett,as the certified mail receipt was signed on june,and doner did not mail the payment to riesett until july.again,the acceleration clause hinges on whether doner was provided with notice,not whether levine or any particular officer at doner received notice.we know that someone at doner received notice and signed the certified mail receipt.perhaps this employee dropped the ball by failing to deliver the package to levine,or perhaps levine received the package but forgot about did not deny receiving the certified mail sent by riesett,but merely asserted that he did not recall receiving it.whatever the story,missteps by doner personnel do not render riesett notice defective under the language of the settlement agreement.riesett fulfilled his obligations to notify doner,and doner failed to make the late payment within the required five days.
notwithstanding riesett notice to doner,the district court denied enforcement of the acceleration clause,in part because it believed that enforcement of the clause would be unconscionable given the circumstances of this case.to the extent the district court opinion suggests or intimates that doner could rely on the unconscionability doctrine to escape its contractual obligations under the settlement agreement,this was a mistake.when the substantive terms of a contract are so that a court is led to conclude that some defect in bargaining process such as fraud,duress,or incompetence of a contracting party led to the formation of the contract,then the unconscionability doctrine may be useful in helping courts ferret out such contracts,whose enforcement would neither promote the autonomy of the contracting parties nor enhance social welfare the unconscionability doctrine has no application to contracts,such as the settlement agreement in this case,which were entered into by sophisticated parties who bargained at arms length and were represented by counsel throughout the negotiations.see stenke masland development,refusing to find a lease agreement unconscionable because it was extensively negotiated by experienced and knowledgeable persons 
doner attempts to defend the district court decision not to accelerate by claiming that it substantially performed its contractual obligations,because the payment arrived days late and levine promptly corrected the breach when it was brought to his attention.doner misunderstands the doctrine of substantial performance.first,liability for breach of contract is strict,so doner contention that levine acted in good faith by promptly sending payment to riesett once the breach was brought to his attention is not sufficient to establish that doner substantially performed its obligations under the settlement agreement.notwithstanding the observation in jacob youngs,kent,that the contractor failure to use the reading pipe specified in the contract had been unintentional,the court finding of substantial performance in that case rested on the facts that the performance wa
