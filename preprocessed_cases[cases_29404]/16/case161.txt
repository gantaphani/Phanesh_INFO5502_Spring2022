appellant back bay spas,back bay,seeks specific performance of a contract termed the letter agreement giving it the right to purchase the space it occupies in a building slated for conversion to condominium units.three factors complicate the scenario the other party to the letter agreement needed the written consent of its mortgage bank for the sale,but no such writing exists that seller no longer owns the condominium property,having lost it in a foreclosure sale and the current owner,appellee stuart marketing,llc marketing,is a subsidiary of the lender,corus bank the bank.
the district court found no basis for enforcing the letter agreement against marketing.it concluded that a massachusetts statute imposing obligations on lenders taking over condominium developments after a foreclosure was inapplicable,see.laws ch,and it rejected back bay claim that it was entitled to specific performance because the bank had consented to the deal by its conduct and silence.on appeal,back bay does not challenge the adverse ruling on consent,arguing only that the court erred in concluding that does not require marketing to carry out the letter agreement.thus,in effect,back bay argues for the first time on appeal that the letter agreement is enforceable without the bank consent.this new theory is not only undeveloped,but,more importantly,it is too late.hence,we affirm summary judgment for marketing.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the facts and any reasonable inferences drawn from them in favor of the party.barry moran,cir.here,the material facts are undisputed.
factual background 
appellant back bay has operated a women health club at stuart street in boston since,renting its space under a lease that is renewable through.in may,a developer stuart street associates,llc associates purchased the building and subsequently obtained a zoning variance allowing the premises to be converted into condominium units.back bay appealed the variance in april,and,after lengthy negotiations with associates,agreed to drop its objections to the redevelopment project in exchange for associates promise to sell it a unit,identified as commercial unit b,that essentially consists of the space the health club occupies.their letter agreement,signed in october,called for the parties to enter into a separate purchase and sale agreement within days,and it set a closing date for days later,in early january.
under its construction mortgage and related loan agreement with corus bank,associates was required to obtain the bank written consent for a sale of any condominium unit at stuart street.see mortgage,loan agreement,the loan agreement also specified a minimum sales price for the building retail units that is higher than the price for commercial unit b stated in the letter agreement.see plaintiff response to stuart marketing,llc statement of undisputed material facts plaintiff response.that deviation from the loan agreement terms also required written approval from the bank.id.see also loan agreement a no waiver of any provision of this agreement or any other loan documents shall be effective unless set forth in writing signed by lender.despite these explicit limitations on associates authority to carry out the deal outlined in the letter agreement,that agreement did not mention the need for consent and no document showing the bank approval was obtained.
back bay,however,was aware of the consent requirement.its president,mark harrington,acknowledged in an affidavit that he had been repeatedly told during the negotiations leading to the letter agreement that associates could not enter into the letter agreement or agree to terms we were negotiating without approval of corus bank.in addition,in august,more than a year before the parties completed that agreement,back bay had signed a subordination,non disturbance and attornment agreement the sndaa with associates and the bank that referenced the mortgage.the sndaa stated that back bay lease would be subordinated to the mortgage,but it protected the health club rights under the lease and provided that a foreclosure on the mortgage would not terminate the lease.see plaintiff response.back bay thus had at least constructive notice of the written consent requirement,as contained in the publicly recorded mortgage,well before it challenged the variance and negotiated the settlement with associates.the loan agreement is specifically referenced on the first page of the mortgage.
harrington further stated in his affidavit,however,that he had been assured by associates that the letter agreement had been approved by the bank.he asserted that back bay had relied upon these assurances and corus bank silence in agreeing to settle the zoning appeal.he continued 
back bay spas would not have executed the letter agreement and dismissed the zoning appeal if there was any doubt as to corus bank assent or as to conveyance of commercial unit b free and clear of the corus bank mortgage.
it is undisputed that the bank was aware of the negotiations leading to the letter agreement and that the bank official responsible for the project had reviewed an unsigned version of the contract,but there is no evidence in the record that bank officials ever directly communicated with back bay.see defendant stuart marketing llc response to plaintiff statement of additional material facts marketing response,response,response affidavit of paul carlson,carlson deposition,at.
beginning with back bay challenge to the variance,associates encountered serious difficulties in moving forward with the condominium project.see marketing response,response plaintiff response.associates loan agreement originally required it to obtain the necessary permits and begin construction by march,but the developer inability to obtain a variance until back bay withdrew its appeal delayed issuance of a building permit and,consequently,there was neither a permit nor a construction contract at the time the letter agreement was signed in october.see plaintiff response,marketing response.in addition,because of the project delays,the bank had stopped advancing funds on the loan in the summer of.plaintiff response.
the building permit eventually issued in march,and associates recorded the condominium master deed in june.both events occurred well after the january closing date specified in the letter agreement for back bay purchase of commercial unit b.as time passed,various disputes arose between back bay and associates about terms of the letter agreement,including the delay in the closing.see plaintiff response,marketing response.
litigation background 
in september,back bay filed this action in a massachusetts state court seeking specific performance of the letter agreement and breach of contract damages against associates associates filed a counterclaim seeking rescission of the letter agreement.back bay complaint also alleged violation of massachusetts deceptive business practices act.laws ch,against associates and a related entity the bank was named as a necessary party for the specific performance claim.
meanwhile,associates plans for stuart street remained unrealized.although the maturity date for associates loan was extended three times,the bank declared the developer in default in early and foreclosed on the mortgage in april.after the bank was the winning bidder at a public auction,it created a subsidiary,stuart marketing,llc marketing,to take title to the property.back bay then amended its complaint to add a count of specific performance against marketing.the bank subsequently failed,and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic was appointed receiver.after the fdic was substituted for the bank as a necessary party in the litigation,the agency removed the lawsuit to federal court.
shortly thereafter,marketing moved for summary judgment on the ground that the foreclosure sale had extinguished any rights back bay held under the letter agreement with associates.in its response,back bay argued,inter alia,that marketing was required to honor the letter agreement based on a massachusetts statute providing that a lender taking over a condominium development mu
