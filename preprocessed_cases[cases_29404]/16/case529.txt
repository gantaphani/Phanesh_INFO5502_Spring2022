this case requires us to evaluate the district court application of an exception to the general rule that silence does not constitute acceptance of the terms of a contract offer.
bell microproducts,bell mailed george mcgurn a signed offer of employment,which stipulated that if mcgurn was terminated without cause during the first twelve months of his employment with bell he would receive a severance package worth.in countersigning and returning the offer letter,mcgurn crossed out the word twelve and replaced it with.mcgurn initialed his alteration,but otherwise did nothing to call it to bell attention.bell terminated mcgurn thirteen months later and refused to pay him the severance package on the ground that the period stipulated in the offer letter had passed,and that mcgurn replacement of twelve with was a counteroffer which bell had never accepted.
mcgurn filed an action in the massachusetts superior court to collect the compensation he claimed bell owed him under the contract,and bell removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.the parties agree that massachusetts law governs this dispute.presented with for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for mcgurn,finding that bell silence in response to mcgurn counteroffer constituted an acceptance of the termination clause.we find that conclusion premature.the import of bell silence can not be decided as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment because of genuine issues of material fact about whether bell knew or should have known of mcgurn counteroffer.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
except as noted,the following facts are undisputed.bell microproducts is a distributor of semiconductor parts and components with headquarters in san jose,california.mcgurn is a resident of massachusetts.in march of,bell president,donald bell,met with mcgurn,who at the time was gainfully employed elsewhere,to discuss the position of vice president for the eastern region at bell.mcgurn said that if he came to work for bell he would require a written contract that included a termination clause stipulating that he would receive six months salary and half his commissions in the event that he was fired.during the next few months mcgurn communicated several times with bill murphy,the bell official to whom mcgurn would report,and expressed interest in pursuing the position.
based on these discussions,murphy secretary prepared an offer letter and delivered it to linda teague,bell director of human resources.teague dated the letter june,signed it,and mailed it to mcgurn.upon receipt of the letter,mcgurn telephoned murphy to discuss the offer and the absence of a termination clause.mcgurn then had a series of telephone conversations with donald bell in which a termination clause was discussed.on june,mcgurn requested a termination clause that would remain in force as long as he worked for bell.however,he also said to donald bell that he would consider one that was limited to the first twenty four months of his employment.according to mcgurn,donald bell replied that a month termination clause would be acceptable.
teague then drafted a second offer letter,in consultation with donald bell,which she signed and dated july.the letter included a termination clause stipulating that i f your status as an employee with bell microproducts is terminated within the first months of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct,upon termination you will receive a severance package.in response,mcgurn drafted his own proposed offer letter,dated july,which included a paragraph on termination for cause,defined as conviction of a felony or gross negligence or misconduct on the job,and a paragraph on termination without cause,which was 
t he company may terminate your employment without cause.in such event,you will continue to receive your base salary for a period of six months following your termination of employment,and you will receive an additional amount equal to or of annual incentive.
mcgurn faxed his proposed offer letter to murphy.
mcgurn next contact with bell was his receipt of an offer letter dated july,signed by teague.the letter included the following paragraph on termination without cause we have underlined the material change from mcgurn july proposal 
t he company may terminate your employment without cause.in the event that this occurs within your first twelve months of employment,you will continue to receive your base salary for a period of six months following your termination of employment,and you will receive an additional amount equal to or of annual incentive.
the letter concluded with teague request that mcgurn sign an acknowledgment of this offer of employment and return to me for our files.the following appeared under teague signature 
i acknowledge my acceptance of the offer as described above and my start date will be.
signed date 
mcgurn signed his name and entered in the other two blank spaces.in addition,he crossed out the word twelve in the termination clause,inserted twenty four directly above it,and initialed the change.the alteration was in the center of the second page of the letter,five inches above mcgurn signature.mcgurn returned the letter to teague or possibly to murphy,and started work on july,
mcgurn advised no one at bell that he had modified the july offer letter,and teague,murphy,and donald bell all deny having viewed the letter upon its return.the human resources department did receive the letter,but teague testified that she herself would only have been notified if the letter had not been received,as mcgurn could not have been paid unless a countersigned copy of the offer letter was in bell files.although there is no direct evidence that anyone in the human resources department examined the returned letter,there was evidence that it was bell practice to check that returned offer letters had been signed by the employee.
in or around april of,brian clark murphy successor at bell concluded that mcgurn performance was not satisfactory.at some point after clark made this determination,but before he fired mcgurn on august,murphy discovered mcgurn alteration of the offer letter,and discussed it with teague and donald bell.upon learning of his termination on august,after approximately months at bell,mcgurn conveyed to clark his belief that his contract included a termination clause.clark disagreed,and bell refused to pay the amounts specified in the termination clause.
mcgurn sued bell for breach of contract in the superior court of middlesex county,massachusetts.based on diversity of citizenship,bell removed the case to federal district court.a.the parties filed for summary judgment.in a memorandum and order dated february,the district court granted mcgurn motion and denied bell motion.the district court found that mcgurn alteration of the july offer letter constituted a counteroffer which,in the circumstances of this case,bell had accepted by its silence.the court entered judgment for mcgurn in the amount of plus interest,and bell filed a timely notice of appeal.
the parties agree that mcgurn alteration of bell offer letter constituted a rejection of that offer and created a counteroffer.see restatement second of contracts a reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror assent to terms additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a.what is in dispute is whether bell accepted mcgurn counteroffer.the district court concluded that it did because bell should have known about the change made by mcgurn,and hence its silence constituted an acceptance of mcgurn counteroffer 
although no one on behalf of the defendant signed mcgurn counteroffer,the defendant admits it received the offer and accepted mcgurn services for thirteen months.a presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter,particularly after weeks of negotiation,does so at its own peril.thus,in the circumstances of this case,the defendant failure to read the terms of the offer does not preclude the formation of a contract.the defendant accepted the terms of the plaintiff offer when it decided to and did employ the plaintiff for thirteen months.
urging a different theory than the should have known theory adopted by the district court,mcgurn argues that bell silence in the face of his counteroffer amounted to an acceptance because bell knew that mcgurn had amended the termination clause,but gave no indication that it rejected the change.bell denies that it knew about mcgurn alteration of the offer letter.
as a general rule,silence in response to an offer to enter into a contract does not constitute an acceptance of the offer.see restatement second of contracts cmt.a acceptance by silence is exceptional.polaroid rollins envtl.servs.nj,noting that silence does not ordinarily manifest assent.there is,however,an exception to the rule against acceptance by silence w here an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation.restatement second of contracts a.
in gateway charlotte theatres,cir,a case in many respects similar to this one,the defendant had sent the plaintiff two copies of a document which reduced to writing an oral agreement for the defendant to install air conditioning in the plaintiff movie theater,with one copy to be countersigned and returned.id.at.the plaintiff signed,but also inserted a provision that the work would be performed by a certain date.id.the plaintiff returned the countersigned contract with a cover letter noting its understanding that the work would be performed by that date although the letter made no reference to the alteration of the contract itself.id.at.we stated that i n the absence of actual knowledge of the alteration of the contract,the test is whether there was reason for the defendant to suppose that such addition might have been made.id.at.we held that because of the cover letter flagging the issue,defendant silence could constitute acceptance of plaintiff counteroffer.
importantly,we also noted in gateway that absent the cover letter,the case would seem more like kidder greenman.gateway,at.in kidder,a tenant had signed and returned a lease to her landlord with the understanding that the landlord would fill in certain blank spaces pursuant to an oral agreement.the landlord then completed the lease so as to include a term contrary to the oral understanding,signed it,and returned it to the tenant,who did not look at the lease at the time she received it except to slit the envelope and see it contained a lease.kidder,at internal quotation marks omitted.the court declined to enforce the disputed term against the tenant on the ground that she had no reason to think that the landlord had not completed the lease in the authorized manner and,therefore,had no occasion to examine it,when it was returned to her,to see if he had done so.id.at.the kidder court concluded that i n these circumstances the doctrine that a person who accepts an instrument without reading it is charged with knowledge of its contents is not applicable.id.citations omitted.
we distill from the restatement and the gateway and kidder precedents the legal rule in massachusetts that silence in response to an offer may constitute an acceptance if an offeree who takes the benefit of offered services knew or had reason to know of the existence of the offer,and had a reasonable opportunity to reject it.see restatement second of contracts a gateway,at kidder,at.we turn now to the application of that rule in this case.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,a court may enter summary judgment if the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and examine the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment had been entered,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor,cir.we note that disputes about whether a contract has or has not been formed as the result of words and conduct over a period of time present interpretive issues traditionally understood to be for the trier of fact.charbonnages de france smith,cir.this is so unless the manifestations of intention of both parties to be bound,or of either not to be bound,are so unequivocal as to present no genuine issue of fact.id.at.
a.the district court opinion 
in response to bell assertion that it did not notice mcgurn alteration of the offer letter until just before his termination,the district court observed that absent fraud,a party to a contract is bound by the terms of the contract whether or not he read them.the court added it will not do for a man to enter into a contract,and,when called upon to respond to its obligations,to say that he did not read it when he signed it,or did not know what it contained.the district court legal proposition is sound,but inapposite to this case.the disputed term was added to the offer after bell had signed it.the relevant question is why,as a matter of law,bell should be expected to an offer it had written and signed,upon its return with mcgurn countersignature.
in response to that question,the district court declared that a presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter,particularly after weeks of negotiation,does so at its own peril.although the logic of this generalization has some appeal,its generality is an insurmountable problem.unless the record establishes that bell knew or had reason to know that mcgurn had modified what bell had the district court points to no facts in the record that would support such a can not say that bell silence,as a matter of law,constituted an acceptance of mcgurn counteroffer.
although we decline to endorse the district court generalization,we may affirm a summary judgment order on any ground revealed by the record.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.we therefore examine the record to see if,drawing all reasonable inferences in bell favor,the evidence nevertheless compels the conclusion that responsible officials at bell knew or should have known about mcgurn counteroffer far enough in advance of his termination that bell had a reasonable opportunity to reject the termination clause if it wished to avoid being bound.summary judgment for mcgurn would be proper if bell had actual or constructive knowledge of mcgurn counteroffer at the time he returned the offer letter,or if,when clark discovered the counteroffer,he had a reasonable opportunity to reject it before he fired mcgurn,but instead continued to take the benefit of mcgurn services without speaking up.restatement second of contracts a.
there are three possible grounds for affirmance suggested by the record,two involving alleged actual knowledge and one involving constructive knowledge.we examine them in turn.
prominence of the alteration 
mcgurn argues that bell had actual knowledge of the alteration of the offer letter at the time of its return.although mcgurn advances no direct evidence that anyone at bell noticed his revision of the termination clause,he points out that the alteration was made on the same page that bore his signature,which bell acknowledges an unknown employee checked pursuant to company policy.mcgurn infers from this that the unknown employee had to have seen the change in the duration of the termination clause,because one eyes are immediately drawn to the change made by mcgurn and his initials above that change.
while an inference that bell had to have seen the change would be permissible based on the evidence in the alteration was in the center of the very page mcgurn had can not say that a factfinder would be required to conclude that the bell employee who checked for mcgurn signature must have noticed mcgurn alteration of the termination clause up the page.that is,the evidence that a bell employee must have seen mcgurn alteration is not so that mcgurn must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
