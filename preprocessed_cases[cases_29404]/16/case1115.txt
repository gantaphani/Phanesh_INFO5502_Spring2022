this appeal requires us to decide whether the district court properly held that it was foreclosed by the doctrine of issue preclusion from making an independent determination whether appellee greenway center,gci is a successor in interest to winco acquisitions,winco a company which was insured by appellant essex insurance company essex.the district court found that a state court had already decided the,that gci is a successor in interest to winco,and therefore held that essex is obligated to defend and indemnify gci in the state court action brought by appellee annette maione against gci.because we find that the requirements for the application of issue preclusion have not been met,we vacate the judgment in favor of gci and remand to the district court for an independent determination,on the merits,of whether gci is a successor in interest to winco.
in,winco,a pennsylvania corporation,began operating a substance abuse detoxification center named greenway center greenway in henryville,pennsylvania on june,winco filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of pennsylvania.approximately one week later,on june,mark willet was admitted for treatment at greenway.the following morning,june,willet was found dead,giving rise to a wrongful death action brought in the pennsylvania court of common pleas by annette maione,willet wife and administratrix.as a result of this incident,the pennsylvania department of health revoked winco license to operate greenway,and greenway temporarily ceased operations in november.
in march,while winco was still in bankruptcy,greenway was reopened by an entity named healthcare management associates,hma,which was authorized by the bankruptcy court to operate the facility as an agent for winco.in september,gci,in the present case,was incorporated in pennsylvania by the owners of hma.on october,hma submitted to the bankruptcy court on behalf of winco a debtor plan of reorganization and a debtor disclosure statement on september,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the plan.after the plan was confirmed,hma continued to operate greenway until the pennsylvania department of health license was transferred to gci in january.gci then began operating greenway.
beginning at least as early as february,essex issued a general liability insurance policy covering certain liabilities arising from the operation of greenway.the named insured on the policy was winco acquisition,greenway center.the policy contained a clause,which states your rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without our written consent except in the case of death of an individual named insured.
on june,appellee annette maione,mark willet wife and the administratrix of his estate,filed a wrongful death action in the court of common pleas of monroe county the state court action.maione named as defendant in the action only gci and not winco.gci was not a named insured on essex policy.
essex initially engaged attorney frank baker to represent gci in the state court action.however,at some point essex came to the conclusion that gci was not insured under its policy and,on december,essex sent gci a letter formally denying coverage in the state court action.on or about march,baker formally withdrew from representing gci.
because gci did not come into existence until a year after willet death and winco bankruptcy,that only be held liable for the death if it were found to be a successor in interest to winco.thus,by filing her action against gci,maione had named the wrong defendant.
on july,in an effort to remedy her error,maione filed a second wrongful death action in the court of common pleas of monroe action named winco as defendant.essex retained counsel to defend winco,its named insured,in this second action.on december,this second action was dismissed on the grounds that willett had died in and thus the statute of limitations had expired.
on june,maione filed a motion to correct name of defendant in the state court action.the motion sought an order allowing maione to amend the caption so as to name the defendant as winco acquisition,greenway center or greenway center,as successor in interest to winco acquisition,in support of this motion,maione asserted that 
on the date that the subject writ of summons was served,both greenway center,and winco acquisition,greenway center operated under the identical name,greenway center,operated the identical business at the identical mailing address and at the identical location where the death of plaintiff decedent occurred.
allowing a correction of the name of the defendant will allow the court to secure a determination of this case based upon the merits rather than a mere technicality.
essex engaged frank baker the same attorney it had retained to defend winco in the second wrongful death action,which had been dismissed to file on behalf of a petition to intervene to oppose maione motion to amend.in the petition,winco asserted that the plaintiff motion is an improper attempt to join winco well after the expiration of the statute of limitations.together with the petition to intervene,winco also filed an answer to plaintiff motion to correct name of defendant.in the answer,winco stated that gci has never been,nor is now,a partner with winco acquisition,winco further argued that winco acquisition,is an entirely separate and distinct legal entity from greenway center,and that the plaintiff attempt to improperly substitute or add winco to this case beyond the expiration of the statute of limitations would be highly prejudicial to winco.an evidentiary hearing on the motion was held on september.
on october,the state court,per judge peter,pennsylvania court of common pleas,issued a decision and order granting maione motion to the extent of amending the caption in the state court action to rename the defendant as greenway center,as successor in interest to winco acquisitions,because the crucial issue presented in the present appeal is the effect of this decision on the issue raised in this,whether,under pennsylvania law,gci is a successor in interest to winco and therefore responsible for its liabilities and entitled to rights under its insurance contract,judge decision merits a detailed discussion.
in the findings of fact section of his opinion,judge stated that the facility to which willet was admitted was,both prior to the admission of plaintiff decedent and through the current date identified and operated as greenway center.he further found that,in the fall of,winco submitted a debtor plan of reorganization to the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the opinion then quotes the following provision contained in the plan,adding emphasis as below 
class security holders.an equity security holder is a party which has equity or an investment interest in the debtor.with respect to the herein chapter case,the equity security holders are the shareholders.this class is impaired,and shall surrender ownership in the debtor corporation upon confirmation.this plan will not violate the absolute priority rule because the shareholders are not retaining their stock and all stock shall be vested in greenway center.see section b.
judge also found that the attorney who had executed the debtor plan of reorganization on behalf of winco had specifically represented to the bankruptcy court that all of the stock of winco acquisition,would be vested in greenway center.apparently based upon the foregoing,judge concluded that greenway center,was set up to assume the stock from winco acquisition,when the bankruptcy was closed,and to act as its successor in operating the facility in henryville.
the discussion portion of judge decision consists,in pertinent part,of the following 
in the case at bar,it is apparent that greenway center,is the successor in interest to winco acquisition,by virtue of the reorganization plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court.it is further evident that the initial process was served on the appropriate representative of either or both corporate entities and there is no prejudice to any party in allowing this action to continue.as the supreme court observed in paulish bakaitis,supra 
since from the record it is clear that the same bertocci business enterprise was involved throughout,there is here no substitution of parties,but the correction of the designation under which the right party was originally sued.
therefore,we will allow the requested relief.
it is significant that judge opinion contains no discussion of pennsylvania successor in interest law.indeed,the decision cites no legal authority whatsoever with respect to the liability of a successor corporation under pennsylvania law.the decision does,however clearly hold that greenway center,is the successor in interest to winco acquisition,by virtue of the reorganization plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court.
in,gci filed the present declaratory judgment action in the monroe county court of common pleas seeking a declaration that,because gci is named in the state court action as a successor to winco acquisition,essex has an obligation to defend and indemnify it in maione state court wrongful death action.on may,essex removed the action to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.on april,a trial was held before judge james munley.maione,as well as gci and essex,participated in the trial.
two witnesses testified at trial wallace slatinsky,former executive director of greenway and a principal of gci,and richard dowling,a senior claims examiner at essex.slatinsky testified,in relevant part,that,while winco proposed bankruptcy plan called for all winco stock to be vested in gci,no such stock transfer ever took place.slatinsky also testified that winco remained in existence after the bankruptcy plan was confirmed and that winco was not involved with greenway center or any other facility,after that time.maione and gci also introduced into evidence certain filings that hma had submitted to the bankruptcy court on behalf of winco.at the conclusion of the trial,counsel for all parties presented their closing arguments.gci and maione both argued that the doctrine of issue preclusion applies to bar the court from considering,on the merits,whether gci is a successor in interest to winco because that issue had already been determined by the state court.gci and maione also argued that,under substantive pennsylvania law,gci was a successor in interest to winco.essex disputed both of these claims.
the district court first scrutinized judge opinion and determined that the state court had,in fact,already decided the issue presented in this,whether gci is a successor in interest to winco.the district court then applied the test set forth in veltri new kensington,to determine whether issue preclusion applies to that finding 
the district court found that,in the present case,each of the requirements under veltri had been met.the district court began by finding that the first and second requirements had been,that the issue in the present action is identical to that decided by the state court and that the state court decision constitutes a final judgment.dist.op.at.as to the third requirement,the district court found that essex,by virtue of its retention of counsel on behalf of winco,was in privity with a party to the state court action 
c ounsel hired by essex filed a motion to intervene on behalf of winco,which the state court eventually denied as moot as it found greenway to be winco successor.accordingly,essex or winco who was in privity with essex as its insured was involved in the underlying action.
id.emphasis added.
the district court thus held that winco was involved in the underlying action and that essex was in privity with winco as a result of the relationship that existed between them.finally,the district court found that the fourth veltri essex had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue before the state also been met 
essex filed a brief with regard to the motion to amend the caption,and its counsel was present at the hearing.the state court judge provided him the opportunity to participate at the hearing,and an opportunity to submit law after the hearing.he was also provided the opportunity to object to exhibits,questions,and witnesses.
id.at internal citations omitted.
the district court therefore found that it was precluded from readdressing th e issue of whether gci is a successor in interest to winco and held that,pursuant to the state court order,gci is a successor in interest to winco.as a result,on july,judge munley issued a memorandum and verdict in favor of gci,finding that issue preclusion applied and that,pursuant to judge state court ruling,essex is therefore liable to defend and indemnify gci in maione state court action.because it found issue preclusion applicable,the district court did not make its own determination,on the merits,whether gci is a successor in interest to winco.this timely appeal followed.
essex argues before us that the requirements for applying issue preclusion in the present context have not been met.to determine whether essex is barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion from disputing its liability to defend and indemnify gci because of the state court order,we must look to the law of the adjudicating state,which is pennsylvania.see liberty mutual ins,cir gregory chehi,cir.under pennsylvania law,issue preclusion applies only where the following four requirements are satisfied 
the issue decided in the prior adjudication was identical with the one presented in the later action there was a final judgment on the merits the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication and the party against whom it is asserted has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in a prior action.
shaffer smith,safeguard mut.ins.williams,see also greenleaf garlock,cir dici commonwealth of,cir.the party asserting issue preclusion,here appellees gci and maione,bear the burden of proving its applicability to the case at hand.dici,at.
essex argues that none of the four shaffer greenleaf criteria is satisfied in this case.essex arguments with respect to the first two shaffer requirements have little merit and we readily dispose of them.
with respect to the first shaffer of the issues in the present and prior argues that the state court decision did not decide the substantive question of law presented in this,whether,under pennsylvania law,gci is deemed a successor in interest to winco.essex asserts that the state court ruling was merely procedural it allowed an amendment to the case caption but did not determine any substantive rights or obligations of the parties.that this is so,argues essex,is evident from the discussion section of the state court decision,which does not address or cite any legal authority relating to pennsylvania successor in interest law.
essex arguments is directly contradicted by the language of the state court decision.the state court,whether right or wrong,clearly a matter of substantive gci was a successor in interest to winco greenway center,is the successor in interest to winco acquisition,by virtue of the reorganization plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court.it is true that the state court opinion lacks a detailed discussion of successor in interest law.however,the state court did provide some reasoning for its holding by citing winco proposed bankruptcy plan,which provided that,upon confirmation,all winco stock was to be vested in gci.
essex also argues that judge state court decision is not a final judgment for the purposes of applying the doctrine of issue preclusion.in shaffer,the pennsylvania supreme court looked to section of the restatement second of judgments to define final judgment in the issue preclusion context 
f or purposes of issue preclusion as distinguished from merger and bar,final judgment includes any prior adjudication of an issue in another action that is determined to be sufficiently firm to be accorded preclusive effect.
shaffer,at quoting restatement second of judgments.
we do not agree with essex argument that the state court opinion is not a final judgment.there is nothing tentative or about judge decision.see greenleaf,at quoting res
