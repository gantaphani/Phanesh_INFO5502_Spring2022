herrmann holdings,annem investments,and herrmann technology trust collectively,the herrmanns appeal the district court dismissal,for failure to comply with federal rules of civil procedure b and b,of their claims against lucent technologies lucent.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
first we will summarize the facts alleged in the herrmanns second amended complaint,which for purposes of lucent motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b and b are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the herrmanns 
the herrmanns owned all of the outstanding shares of common stock of herrmann technology,hti,which designed and developed passive thin film filters for use in telecommunications optical networking.on june,lucent and the herrmanns signed an agreement and plan of merger agreement,whereby lucent acquired hti for shares of lucent stock,worth approximately million based on the closing stock price of that day.
the herrmanns could not sell any of their lucent stock in a public transaction on the open market until lucent filed,and the securities and exchange commission sec declared effective,a form registration statement.the herrmanns insisted that this happen as soon as practicable.to that end,section of the agreement provides that 
lucent shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare,file and cause to become effective,as promptly as practicable after lucent shall have received all relevant information to be provided by the company or the shareholders in connection with such filing,the registration statement covering the public resale of such shares of lucent common stock to be issued in connection with the merger 
agreement emphasis added.the herrmanns provided lucent with all of the relevant information for lucent preparation of the prior to the june closing.section of the agreement similarly obligated lucent to 
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,and to do,or cause to be done,all things necessary,proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable,the transactions contemplated by this agreement including i the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,or to avoid an action or proceeding by any governmental or regulatory authority.
id.emphasis added.section q of the agreement defined reasonable best efforts as prompt,substantial and persistent efforts as a prudent person desirous of achieving a result would use in similar circumstances provided that the company,the shareholders,lucent or acquisition,as applicable,shall be required to expend only such resources as are commercially reasonable in the applicable circumstances.id.lucent was obligated to pay all costs,expenses,and fees in connection with the registration of the.
on june,the herrmanns called lucent counsel to check on the status of lucent filing of the.on june,eleven days after the hti acquisition,lucent acquired chromatis networks chromatis,a much larger optical networking company,for approximately billion in lucent stock based on the closing stock price of.that day,lucent counsel reported to hti that lucent was preparing the filing and asked whether it was okay to delay filing the hti for a week or two to build in the hti into our chromatis.the next day,the herrmanns responded that they did not want delay,did not want lucent to combine the hti with the chromatis,and instructed lucent to please proceed with the preparation of the for hti only.
on june,lucent sent the herrmanns questionnaires seeking information for preparing the.although the herrmanns had given this information to lucent before closing,the herrmanns completed and sent back the questionnaires on july.on july,the herrmanns contacted lucent counsel about the status of the.lucent counsel said that he did not understand the cause for the delay and would check on it.when the herrmanns called lucent counsel again,he reported that lucent expected to file the sometime during the following week.
on july,lucent reported disappointing third quarter results,a net loss of million compared with the net income of million a year earlier,and lowered its fourth quarter estimates.lucent stock price fell that day from to.the following day,lucent sent the herrmanns a draft,which combined the hti and the chromatis.
lucent filed the combined on july,six weeks after the hti acquisition.the sec declared the effective on august.lucent stock closed that day at per share and continued to decline,due in part to disappointments in its optical networking business.
on march,the herrmanns brought suit against lucent.in their second amended complaint,the herrmanns alleged claims for breach of contract and violations of article of the texas securities act and section of the texas business and commerce code.on may,lucent filed a motion to dismiss the herrmanns claims pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.on october,the district court granted the motion,refused the herrmanns request for leave to amend their complaint,and entered final judgment in favor of lucent.the herrmanns now appeal.

ii.breach of contract 
the herrmanns complain first that the district court erred in dismissing their breach of contract claim.the resolution of this issue turns on whether,under texas law,the herrmanns allegations that lucent failed to use its reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a covering the shares of lucent stock,as required by and of the agreement,give rise to a claim against lucent for breach of contract.as our jurisdiction in this case is based on diversity of citizenship,we have a duty to apply texas law.see erie tompkins.the texas supreme court has not yet ruled on the enforceability of best efforts clauses in breach of contract actions.accordingly,in deciding this case,we are required to make an erie guess as to what the texas supreme court would most likely decide.barfield madison county,cir.our task is to attempt to predict state law,not to create or modify it.united parcel service,weben,cir.in making an erie guess,we defer to intermediate state appellate court decisions unless convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.first bank of durant trans terra,cir.we may also refer to rules in other states that texas courts might look to.hill london,stetelman,kirkwood,cir.the texas courts have not considered contractual obligations to use reasonable best efforts to file a as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable.no texas case precludes the herrmanns recovery for breach of such obligations.based on our review of decisions by texas courts and courts in other jurisdictions,we conclude that the texas supreme court would decide that dismissal of the herrmanns breach of contract claim at the b stage is premature.
the district court found an intermediate appellate texas court ruling on the enforceability of best efforts clauses in breach of contract actions to be instructive.see ckb,moore mccormack petroleum.in ckb,the dallas court of appeals considered ckb agreement to use its best efforts to process barrels per day of crude oil into the volumes of refined products reflected on exhibit a,with variations not to exceed plus or minus one percent.id.at.the court explained that 
to be enforceable,a best efforts contract must set some kind of goal or guideline against which best efforts may be measured.a contracting party that performs within the guidelines fulfills the contract regardless of the quality of its efforts.when a party misses the guidelines,courts measure the quality of its efforts by the circumstances of the case and by comparing the party performance with that of an average,prudent,comparable operator.
id.at internal citations omitted.the goal set by the best efforts clause of the contract was the production of a specified volume of refined crude oil.id.at.ckb failed to meet this specific contractual goal,thus miss ing the guideline.id.consequently,in determining whether the best efforts clause had been violated,the court considered evidence of the circumstances surrounding ckb performance.id.at.the court found,as a matter of law,that ckb breached its contractual obligation to use its best efforts to produce the volumes specified in the contract,and affirmed summary judgment for moore mccormack petroleum on its breach of contract claim.id.
relying on ckb,the district court dismissed the herrmanns claim pursuant to rule b after concluding that they had no claim for breach of contract.the district court determined that,in the absence of any specific date in the contract by which filing or registration was to be accomplished,the only objective goal or guideline established in the agreement was for lucent to file and cause to become effective a covering the herrmanns shares.the court held that because lucent met that goal when the was filed on july,and became effective on august,lucent satisfied its contractual obligations,regardless of the quality of its efforts.the district court reasoned that the law of texas does not contemplate that in considering whether the goal has been accomplished in the first instance,a court should have to look to the circumstances of the case or to comparable performances.
being,the district court was correct in relying on the analysis in ckb to determine whether the herrmanns stated a claim against lucent for breach of its obligation to use best efforts.according to ckb,it must initially be determined whether the best efforts contract set some kind of goal or guideline,the objective to be accomplished by a party best which the party best efforts may be measured.at.if the answer to this threshold question is no,the best efforts contract is not enforceable.id.if,however,there is a goal,the next inquiry is whether the party met the goal.id.at.if the answer to this question is yes,the analysis ends and whether the party used its best efforts is irrelevant.id.if,however,the goal is not met,it becomes necessary to measure the party efforts by the circumstances of the case and by comparing the party performance with that of an average,prudent,comparable operator.id.
we must part company,however,with the district court application of this framework to the herrmanns claim.specifically,the district court error lies in its narrow reading of the some kind of goal or guideline that is required to enforce a best efforts clause under ckb.the district court held that as long as lucent filed the and caused the to become effective,it met the only objective goal or guideline established in the agreement.in doing so,the court found that without any specific date in the agreement,by which lucent registration tasks were to be accomplished,the as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable language of the agreement was not a suitably objective goal against which lucent efforts could be measured.we find that this reading is problematic for the following reasons.to begin with,placing no limit on how long lucent could wait to file the renders the timeliness language in,and q of the agreement meaningless in an action seeking damages for breach of contract.as a general rule of contract interpretation,courts should attempt to give meaning to each clause in a contract.balandran safeco ins.of,our primary goal is to give effect to the written expression of the parties intent.we must read all parts of the contract together,striving to give meaning to every sentence,clause,and word to avoid rendering any portion inoperative.internal citations omitted.thus,it would be inappropriate to disregard the time requirement that lucent act as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable,which modifies the ultimate objective of filing and causing the to become effective.
moreover,neither ckb nor any other texas case supports the position that in a case where the best efforts clause relates to timeliness or the time that a task must be completed,the some kind of goal or guideline must be date specific.indeed,ckb was a quantity case,as opposed to a time case.although the goal set by the best efforts clause that was enforced in ckb was the production of a specified volume of refined crude oil,ckb does not stand for the proposition that only goals which set forth a definite quantity are enforceable.requiring contracting parties to fix a date certain in order to set a temporal guideline in which to complete a certain task demands more definiteness than texas law requires.
finally,the possibility that compliance with a goal or guideline would have to be decided at the summary judgment stage or later does not justify refusing to enforce it.here,the district court could not address whether or not lucent accomplished the goal of filing and causing the to become effective as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable without looking beyond the complaint to some sort of evidence,such as the time involved in any of lucent prior filings.the district court concluded that because this analysis would involve considering the circumstances of the case or comparable performances,which,under ckb,does not come into play until a failure to meet the goal has been established,the timeliness language could not be included in the goal or guideline of the agreement.again,we do not agree with this restrictive application of ckb.while ckb held that in the final stage of the analysis,courts determine whether a party used its best efforts by looking to the circumstances of the case and comparable performances,ckb did not suggest that courts can not consider such evidence in the previous stage of the analysis to determine whether a party met the goal or guideline against which a party best efforts are measured.
case law from other jurisdictions supports factoring the as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable language into discerning the goal or guideline of the agreement.in kers atc communications group,the contract obligated atc communications group,atc to as soon as practicable,use its best efforts to effect the registration of register shares subject to a purchase option after kers company kers made a demand for registration.d.the contract also gave atc the option to delay filing of its registration for up to ninety days from its receipt of the request.id.after receiving kers request,atc had the discretion to postpone filing for almost three months,but delayed registering the shares for almost four months.id.at.the court granted summary judgment for kers on its breach of contract claim,finding that the uncontroverted facts established that atc violated its obligation to use its best efforts to register the shares.id.at.
in thomas de la rue ag united states banknote,the united states banknote corporation banknote acquired a company,transferring banknote stock to thomas de la rue ag tdlr as part of the consideration for the sale,and agreed that,upon the tdlr written request that banknote register the shares,it would prepare and file the registration statement as expeditiously as possible and would thereafter use its best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective.the contract did not contain any specific time limit for filing the registration statement.id.banknote did not file the registration statement until nearly six months after the tdlr written request for registration.id.this delay was the result of banknote potential acquisition of another company and a debt restructuring.id.the tdlr sued banknote for breach of contract.id.at.the tdlr moved for partial summary judgment,seeking a determination,as a matter of law,that banknote breached the provision requiring it to register the stock as expeditiously as possible.id.the court held that the registration provision is not ambiguous it imposes an obligation on the defendant to act as expeditiously as reasonably possible under the circumstances.id.at.the court also held that genuine issues of material fact,precluding summary judgment,existed as to whether the defendant acted as expeditiously as possible in registering the stock and,thus,it was for the jury to decide whether the delay was a breach of the defendant obligations under the contract.id.at.
thus,we conclude that the goal or guideline established by the best efforts provision in the agreement was for lucent to file and cause to become effective,as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable,a registration statement covering the herrmanns shares.here,by alleging that the parties had a contract,that it contained two best efforts provisions that required lucent to file and cause the to become effective as promptly as practicable and in the most expeditious manner practicable,that lucent breached that contractual obligation,and that the herrmanns suffered damages as a result of that breach,the herrmanns successfully state a claim for breach of contract.see,in re absolute res,d,pegasus energy group,cheyenne petroleum,cadle castle.therefore,the district court erred in dismissing the herrmanns breach of contract claim.
iii.texas securities act 
the herrmanns next argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claim under article of the texas securities act tsa.the tsa imposes liability on those who offer or sell securities by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,not misleading.stat.ann.art.vernon supp.
in count of their complaint,the herrmanns allege that lucent offered and sold a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact,and by means of an omission to state a material fact.specifically,the herrmanns allege that lucent failure to perform its contractual obligations to use its reasonable best efforts makes its representations in and of the,that it would use its reasonable best efforts to prepare,file and cause to become effective the and would use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,and to do or cause to be done,all things necessary in the most expeditious manner practicable to file the and make it statements of a material fact.the herrmanns also allege that lucent omitted to tell the herrmanns that lucent intended to and would delay filing the hti form,and more particularly that it would delay filing the hti until it could be combined with the chromatis.further,for purposes of the tsa claim only,the herrmanns expressly disavow ed and disclaim ed an allegation of fraud.
the district court concluded that,in representing that it would use its best efforts to file the,lucent was making a promise of future performance,as opposed to a statement of past or existing material fact.recognizing that,u nder texas law,the herrmanns can only state a cognizable claim for misrepresentation of a future promise by establishing a lack of intent to perform at the time of the promise,the district court dismissed the herrmanns tsa claim because they expressly rejected the notion that lucent never intended to use its reasonable best efforts to file the.the herrmanns,however,argue that fraudulent intent or scienter is not an element of a claim under article,and that they alleged that lucent made untrue statements of an existing material fact in the agreement,as well as untrue promises of future performance 
we first address the contention that the herrmanns expressly and by reasonable inference alleged that lucent made untrue statements of a present and existing fact.the herrmanns identify as the source of the alleged untrue statements of existing material fact.specifically,they point to allegations that at the time lucent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to prepare,file and cause the to become effective,as promptly as practicable after lucent shall have received all relevant information,lucent had already received all relevant information.thus,they contend that lucent had an existing obligation in addition to its future obligation.we reject this argument.whether lucent could begin the process of preparing the immediately,having received all relevant information,or one month after the signing of the agreement,the statements on which the herrmanns rely concern future actions.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that the herrmanns are stating a claim under article for an untrue promise to do a future act,as opposed to an untrue statement of existing material fact.
the herrmanns claim,thus,raises the question of whether article untrue statement of material fact language encompasses an untrue promise of future action.the texas supreme court has not addressed this issue.the only case cited by either the parties or the district court as to whether article creates liability for a false promise of future performance in connection with securities does not bode favorably.in ferguson williams,the austin court of appeals held that the rule that a promise of future performance will constitute fraud if it is made without intent to perform and with the intent,design,and purpose of deceiving is applicable to common law fraud and,thus,would not be applicable to a case dealing solely with article.
even if we assume,as the district court appears to do,that a claim for an untrue promise of future action is cognizable under article,the district court dismissal of the herrmanns claim was proper because such a claim would require proof of fraudulent intent,and the herrmanns expressly disavowed this essential element in their complaint.this court has previously recognized that unlike a common law fraud cause of action an article claim does not require,proof that the speaker knew that the representation was false,or made it without regard to its truth or falsity.wood combustion eng g,cir.while lucent does not dispute that article liability for an untrue statement of an existing material fact or an omission to state a material fact does not require proof of scienter,lucent argues that fraudulent intent is an element of a claim based on an allegation of an untrue promise of future performance.we have not found,nor have any of the parties suggested,any decision in which the texas supreme court has addressed whether fraudulent intent is an element of a claim under article based on an untrue promise of future performance.we must therefore make an erie guess as to how that court would decide yet another issue.in doing so,we may refer to the district court ruling in this case.hill,at cir.as the district court recognized,b ecause of the obvious similarities between the tsa and the federal securities acts,texas courts look to decisions of the federal courts to aid in the interpretation of the tsa.quest,apprill,cir.accordingly,it is persuasive that we have held,in the context of the federal securities laws,that predictive statements are actionable only if they were false when made.shushany allwaste,cir.as we observed in isquith middle south utilities 
w hen necessary,courts have readily conceded that predictions may be regarded as facts within the meaning of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws most often,whether liability is imposed depends on whether the predictive statement was false when made.the answer to this inquiry,however,does not turn on whether the prediction in fact proved to be wrong instead,falsity is determined by examining the nature of the emphasis on whether the prediction suggested reliability,bespoke caution,was made in good faith,or had a sound factual or historical basis.
