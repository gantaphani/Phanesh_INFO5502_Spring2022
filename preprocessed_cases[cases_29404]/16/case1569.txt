facts and proceedings 
the broussards biloxi home was completely destroyed during hurricane katrina,leaving only the foundation slab.the broussards,who did not have flood insurance,brought a claim under their state farm homeowners policy.the state farm claims adjuster who inspected the site concluded that the e vidence suggests the home was more damaged by flood than wind,and state farm denied the broussards claim in its entirety.
the broussards homeowners policy contained two types of coverage.they had in named peril coverage for their personal property,which covered losses caused by a list of perils,including windstorms.they had in open peril coverage for their dwelling,which covered any accidental direct loss to their home.both the personal property and the dwelling coverage excluded losses caused by water damage.both coverages were also subject to an cause acc clause,which stated 
we do not insure under any coverage for any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.we do not insure for such loss regardless of a the cause of the excluded event or b other causes of the loss or c whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss 
it is undisputed that the broussards personal property and dwelling were a total loss and that the value of their personal property and dwelling met or exceeded the policy limits.
after state farm denied their claim,the broussards filed suit against state farm in mississippi state court.the broussards claimed breach of contract and bad faith on the part of state farm and sought the policy limits of their coverage,damages,and punitive damages.state farm removed the case to the southern district of mississippi.the case was tried before a jury in two phases,causation and damage.following the close of the evidence in the causation phase of the trial,both sides made oral motions for jmol.the district court granted jmol in favor of the broussards on both the personal property and dwelling claims.with regard to the personal property claim,the district court found that the parties had stipulated that the broussards property was destroyed during hurricane katrina,that hurricane katrina was a windstorm,and that state farm was liable under the named peril personal property coverage because windstorm was a named peril.with regard to the dwelling claim,the district court held that state farm bore the burden of proving that the broussards loss was caused by the excluded peril of flooding.the district court noted that state farm expert admitted that he could not distinguish between the wind and water damage to the broussards home with any reasonable degree of probability.in light of this admission,the district court found that there was no sound evidence upon which the finder of fact could rationally determine that state farm had met its burden of proof and entered jmol for the broussards.
during the damage phase of the trial,the district court gave the jury a punitive damage instruction.the jury awarded the broussards million in punitive damages,which the district court remitted to million.
state farm appeals the entry of jmol on both the personal property and dwelling claims and seeks reversal or remittitur of the jury punitive damages award.state farm also appeals the district court denial of its motion to strike the testimony of the broussards expert,james slider,a structural engineer who testified that wind or a tornado destroyed the broussards home before the katrina storm surge arrived.finally,state farm appeals the district court denial of its motion for change of venue.
ii.discussion 
the broussards argue that their home was destroyed by tornadic winds before the katrina storm surge arrived,and that they are entitled to recover under their homeowners policy for any losses which state farm can not show were caused by water,which is an excluded peril under both the personal property and dwelling coverages.this court has issued several insurance decisions since this case was tried in early,including tuepker state farm fire casualty,a mississippi slab case interpreting a state farm homeowners insurance policy whose provisions were identical to the broussards policy in all significant respects,cir see also leonard nationwide mut.ins,cir holding that nationwide mutual homeowners insurance policy,which included an acc clause,was valid and enforceable under mississippi law.these and other recent cases inform this decision.because we hold that the district court erred as a matter of law in entering jmol for the broussards,we reverse the district court,vacate the award of punitive damages,and remand for a new trial.
judgment as a matter of law 
the standard of review for rulings on motions for jmol is de novo.evans ford motor,cir.this court has held that motions for jmol should be granted 
only if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict on the other hand,if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions,that is,evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions,the motions should be denied 
brown bryan county,cir internal quotations omitted.when evaluating the district court grant of jmol,we consider all of the evidence,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the party,state farm.id.
personal property named peril coverage 
we reverse the district court grant of jmol with regard to the broussards named peril personal property coverage.the district court erred when it found that the destruction of the broussards personal property by hurricane katrina was sufficient to establish the separate assertion that the property was destroyed by windstorm,a named peril under the broussards personal property coverage.
lunday lititz mutual insurance considered damage sustained by a mississippi home during hurricane camille and held that,under named peril coverage,the burden of proof was on the insured to prove that the damages sustained were covered by the peril insured against,that is,by direct action of the wind.so d.although there was no question that the insured property was destroyed during hurricane camille,the lunday court did not find that this automatically established that it was damaged by wind.id.likewise,a stipulation that the broussards personal property was destroyed by hurricane katrina is insufficient to establish that it was destroyed by a windstorm,since hurricane katrina unleashed both wind and water forces.accordingly,we reverse the grant of jmol with regard to the broussards personal property claim and remand to permit the broussards to carry their burden of proving that the personal property was destroyed by a peril covered under their policy.
dwelling open peril coverage 
we also reverse the district court grant of jmol to the broussards on their dwelling open peril coverage.the district court granted jmol because it found that there was no sound evidence upon which the finder of fact could rationally determine that state farm had met its burden of proof to show that the broussards home was destroyed by an excluded peril.this court reviews the determinations that the parties met their burdens of proof under the clearly erroneous standard.stevens shipping terminal japan rainbow ii mv,cir.
the district court conclusion that state farm failed to meet its burden of proof under the dwelling coverage was clear error.state farm experts introduced sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find in its favor.two of state farm experts,kurt gurley and robert dean,testified that the damage to the actual structure of the broussards home came from the storm surge.gurley stated that it was likely that wind caused a relatively small amount of damage to the broussards roof before the storm surge arrived,but that hurricane katrina winds were not strong enough to cause structural damage to the home.gurley also opined that,given the data available regarding the broussards home,no other wind engineer could state more definitively whether there was wind damage or specify the extent of the damage more precisely.
state farm evidence was more than sufficient to withstand a motion for jmol.a rational jury could conclude,based on the testimony of state farm experts,that the broussards home and personal property were destroyed by water.wall swilley,so d,unless the evidence is so lacking that no reasonable jury could find for plaintiffs,the motion must be denied.we reverse the district court entry of jmol for the broussards on the dwelling coverage and remand for a new trial.
burdens of proof 
state farm also argues that the district court erred in allocating the burdens of proof.this court reviews the allocation of the burden of proof de novo stevens shipping,at.
under mississippi law a plaintiff has the burden of proving a right to recover under the insurance policy sued on,and this basic burden never shifts from the plaintiff.britt travelers ins,cir see also home ins.greene,so d,an insured seeking recovery on a policy insuring against fire has the burden of proving the loss and its extent.in this case,the parties agreed that the home and its contents were a total loss,and the disputed issue is which peril caused the loss.
the parties bear different burdens of proof under the personal property and dwelling coverages.
for personal property named peril coverage the plaintiff has the burden of proving that any losses were caused by a peril covered by the policy.under dwelling open peril coverage the plaintiff still has the basic burden of proving his right to recover.however,under open peril coverage the insurer bears the burden of proving that a particular peril falls within a policy exclusion,and must plead and prove the applicability of an exclusion as an affirmative defense.
tuepker,at internal quotations and citations omitted.the broussards personal property and dwelling coverages are both subject to a water damage exclusion identical to the exclusion in tuepker.id.at the parties do not dispute that this exclusion applies to any damage caused by the hurricane katrina storm surge.
state farm argues that under the dwelling coverage,once it advances evidence to establish its affirmative policy exclusion defenses,the burden shifts back to the broussards to prove that there is an exclusion to the defenses or to segregate covered from damages.in support of its theory,state farm points to texas cases such as britt cambridge mutual fire insurance,which hold that o nce an insurer has pled an exception to the insurance policy,the burden is on the insured to prove that the occurrence in question did not come within the exclusion of the policy.mississippi courts have not explicitly addressed shifting burdens of proof under open peril policies,so we must make an educated erie guess as to how the mississippi supreme court would resolve the issue.leonard,at.
the mississippi supreme court rejected a rule similar to state farm shifting back theory in a hurricane camille slab case construing a named peril policy.lititz mut.ins.boatner,so d.the factual similarities between boatner and the case at hand are striking.in boatner,nothing was left of the insureds home and its contents but a concrete slab.id.at.the insureds argued that their home was destroyed by wind prior to the arrival of the tidal wave.id.at.the insurer admitted that some wind damage was probable,but withheld full payment under the policy because it argued that the home was actually destroyed by the tidal wave,an excluded peril.id.at.the jury found in favor of the insureds and the mississippi supreme court affirmed.id.the court held that the insureds were required to introduce some evidence regarding causation to recover under a named peril policy,but rejected the rule that the burden of proof was upon the homeowners to also show that their home was in no respect damaged by tidal wave id.
in grace lititz mutual insurance,another hurricane camille case,the mississippi supreme court sustained a jury verdict for the insureds under a windstorm policy which excluded water damage.so d.the grace court stated that t he rule is well established in this state that where the question presented to the jury was whether the loss was due to windstorm or to water,the entire question of proximate cause is treated as one of fact independent of the explicit application of any rule of law.id.citing commercial union ins.byrne,so d.the grace court also reversed the trial court remittitur of and awarded damages in the amount of the policy limits because the insurer never contested the fact that the insureds property was a total loss and did not offer any evidence at any time during the trial of what value or of what part of the insureds property was destroyed by water prior to its destruction by wind.id.at.
boatner and grace involved named peril policies under which the insured was required to prove that his loss was caused by a specified peril as part of his prima facie case.the mississippi supreme court has not explicitly addressed the shifting back theory when considering an open peril policy.we think it unlikely,however,that the court would reject rules similar to state farm shifting back theory when considering named peril policies and embrace them when considering an open peril policy under which the insurer must prove causation by an excluded peril as an affirmative defense.
in support of this view,we note that the rule that causation is a fact question for the jury applies equally to open peril and named peril policies.in byrne,a hurricane camille case involving an open peril policy,the mississippi supreme court held that a directed verdict was not proper where the plaintiff introduced some evidence that his house and personal property were damaged by wind prior to the arrival of flood waters from a nearby bayou.so d at.in language later quoted in grace,the byrne court held that causation was a question of fact independent of the explicit application of any rule of law which would take the issue away from the jury.see grace,so d at.state farm shifting back theory seems to be the sort of rule of law which would operate in many cases to take the issue of causation away from the jury.
in light of boatner,grace,and byrne,we hold that state farm shifting back theory is not the rule in mississippi.grace,so d at boatner,so d at byrne,so d at.on remand,the parties must meet their burdens of proof as outlined in tuepker,at,and the ultimate allocation of wind and water damages under the broussards dwelling coverage is a question of fact for the jury.grace,so d at.
punitive and consequential damages 
we also reverse the district court decision to submit the punitive damages question to the jury.in insurance contract cases,the trial court is responsible for reviewing all evidence before it in order to ascertain whether the jury should be permitted to decide the issues of punitive damages.lewis equity life ins,so d,internal quotations omitted.if,upon reviewing all the evidence,the district court concludes that the insurer acted in bad faith,or that reasonable minds could differ regarding whether the insurer acted in bad faith,then the district court should send the issue of punitive damages to the jury.id.at.the district court denied state farm motion for jmol on punitive and damages and sent the issue to the jury.we review the district court ruling on state farm motion for jmol de novo.sobley natural gas,cir.
