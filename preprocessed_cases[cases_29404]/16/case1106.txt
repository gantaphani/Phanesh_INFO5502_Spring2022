opinion of the court 
introduction 
the parties appeal and from a judgment and orders in this action that emerald investors trust emerald trust brought,predicated on the district court asserted diversity of citizenship jurisdiction,seeking recovery on two unpaid promissory notes and foreclosure of the mortgages securing the notes.the district court,over the defendants objection,held that it had diversity of citizenship jurisdiction because the sole beneficiary of emerald trust was emerald investors emerald,a corporation incorporated in the british virgin islands where it had its principal place of business,and the defendant partnerships,all of which are undoubtedly citizens of states within the united states,are not citizens of the british virgin islands.
as always,after we are satisfied of our own jurisdiction the threshold,and,indeed,as it turns out,the only issue on this appeal is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.inasmuch as we can not determine if the district court had diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and there is no other basis for it to have exercised jurisdiction,we do not reach the merits of the case.rather,we will remand the matter to the district court to resolve the jurisdictional issue after allowing discovery and conducting any hearing that it deems necessary.
ii.facts and procedural history 
defendants,gaunt parsippany partners,cherry hill associates,cherry hill associates,and horseheads commercial development partners,whose three principal owners and partners were newby toms,mitchell wolff,and joel hoffman the partners,were in the business of owning and operating office buildings.though the three partners conducted their business through these four entities,horseheads was the only one existing at the time that emerald trust filed the complaint in this case.nevertheless,all of the four entities,along within reckson operating partnership,have been defendants in this case and all five entities filed the first,and as it turns out,the principal appeal after completion of the district court proceedings.
the case may be traced back to january,when the properties the partners owned in parsippany,new jersey,which consisted of two sites,the cherry hill property and the cherry hill property the nj properties,were performing poorly this circumstance caused the partners to refinance these properties with the united bank of kuwait the united bank,an undertaking requiring them to increase the debt on property they owned in horseheads,new york,by million to be used by the partners for the nj properties.at that time the partners entered into certain agreements relating to the refinancing first,they agreed to treat the million as a loan from them,rather than from united bank,to the entities that owned the nj properties even though united bank supplied the million.in exchange,each of the two entities owning the nj properties gave each of the partners a note for secured by a mortgage that was subordinate to the united bank senior mortgage.the notes bore a annual rate of interest and were due on december.the partners created the subordinated mortgages to protect their equity in the properties from partnership creditors.as a result of the subordinated mortgages,the partners appeared to be secured creditors instead of equity owners with respect to the million.the partners also entered into parity agreements that provided that they ranked equally among themselves with respect to payment of or security on the loans.
thereafter,the relationship among toms,wolff,and hoffman deteriorated leading toms to seek to withdraw from their business dealings.accordingly,in the partners began negotiating the terms of an agreement for hoffman and wolff to acquire toms interests in the horseheads and nj properties.as a result of the negotiations,the partners simultaneously entered into six related agreements first,they entered into two mortgage modification agreements modifying the notes and subordinated mortgages so that the sum due on each was increased from to with the notes simultaneously becoming bearing.at the same time the face value of the notes was reduced to,the reduction being contingent on installment payments on them being timely made.the mortgage modification agreements also provided that repayment was to be made only to the extent that any refinancing or sale of the properties resulted in net proceeds.the partners also entered into two subordination agreements with united bank that provided that the partners were not entitled to any payment on their loans until the senior united bank mortgages were paid in full.finally,the partners entered into two second mortgage parity agreements providing for them to share equally in any net proceeds realized from a sale of the properties.in august toms assigned his notes and mortgages to emerald trust,an entity that he controlled.
in august reckson,which is completely separate from and independent of the other four defendants,purchased the nj properties for.as far as we can ascertain this purchase was in an transaction.at that time,even though approximately was due to united bank on the debts its mortgages on the nj properties secured,it nevertheless accepted on the debts and mortgages and discharged the mortgages,treating them as satisfied.app.at.according to defendants,united bank discharged its mortgages on the nj properties for less than was due on them because the approximately million shortfall to satisfy the obligations to united bank in full was added to the debt that the mortgage united bank held on the horseheads property secured.
wolff and hoffman also discharged their subordinated mortgages on the nj properties marking them as paid and satisfied upon receipt of in the form of reckson operating units.according to wolff and hoffman,they did so because they had no need to retain the mortgages.emerald trust,however,did not discharge the subordinated mortgages that toms had assigned it.thus,at the closing on the sale of the nj properties to reckson all of the mortgages in favor of united bank,wolff,and hoffman on the nj properties were satisfied,leaving the subordinated mortgages previously held by toms but since assigned to emerald trust as the only outstanding mortgages on the properties inasmuch as emerald trust mortgages remained outstanding,hoffman and wolff entered into an indemnity agreement with reckson title insurance company for the nj properties promising to indemnify it should emerald trust make any claims on the nj properties by reason of the liens created by the mortgages that toms assigned to it.on december,when emerald trust notes secured by the nj properties came due,none of the defendants nor anyone else paid the notes,defaults that caused emerald trust to file this action on april,to recover on the notes and to foreclose its subordinated mortgages on the nj properties 
subsequently,emerald trust moved for summary judgment seeking a judgment of foreclosure but on august,the district court denied emerald trust motion and on october,the court also denied a motion emerald trust filed seeking reconsideration of the august,order.the court thereafter conducted a bench trial on the merits of the controversy in january.prior to and during the trial the defendants did not raise any issue regarding the court subject matter jurisdiction which,as we have noted,emerald trust predicated on diversity of citizenship between emerald trust on one hand and the defendants on the other.the defendants,however,did raise an issue regarding diversity of citizenship in submissions.to resolve the jurisdictional issue the district court directed the parties to submit affidavits explaining their citizenship following which it heard oral argument regarding the parties citizenship and the court diversity jurisdiction.at the oral argument the defendants requested an opportunity to engage in further discovery on the jurisdictional issue but the court rejected that request,though it did permit the parties to submit further briefing on the issue.
ultimately the court found that emerald trust was an unincorporated business trust and it concluded that the law applied in this circuit directs a court to look to the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries when determining the citizenship of such a trust as we already have indicated,the court found that emerald trust sole beneficiary was emerald,a corporation incorporated in the british virgin islands where it also had its principal place of business,and thus emerald trust was a citizen of the british virgin islands for jurisdictional purposes.it is interesting that this finding was inconsistent with emerald trust complaint in this case as it asserted in the complaint that it was a citizen of florida.inasmuch as defendants conceded that they were not citizens of the british virgin islands and undoubtedly were citizens of states within the united states,the court concluded that it did have diversity of citizenship subject matter jurisdiction 
after determining that it had jurisdiction the district court reached the merits of the case with respect to which it concluded 
at its core,this case concerns two partners attempt to dispose of secured properties without the consent of their former partner despite their former partner secured interests in the properties.unable to obtain toms consent to release his mortgages on the nj properties,wolff and hoffman decided to take their chances that under the relevant agreements specifically,the mortgage modification agreements they would owe nothing to toms despite the properties sale.they therefore agreed to indemnify the title insurer on the transaction.hoffman and wolff,however,miscalculated.under the mortgage modification agreements emerald was entitled to recover on its notes at least its share of the in net proceeds from the sale of the properties.however,defendants having breached this and other obligations under the mortgage modification agreements,the mortgage modification agreements ceased to place any limitation on emerald rights under the notes and mortgages after december.nor did the subordination agreements or second mortgage parity agreements continue to place any limitations on emerald rights under the notes and mortgages once united bank,hoffman,and wolff released their mortgages.thus,when the notes came due in december and nothing was paid,emerald became entitled to recover on the terms stated on the faces of its notes and mortgages.

accordingly,the district court found that emerald trust was due on each note,plus in prejudgment interest,a rate that the parties had fixed,calculations that yielded a total judgment of.this calculation did not allow emerald all of the interest it sought to recover.of course,if defendants did not pay this sum there would be a sale of the nj properties to satisfy the judgment.defendants then appealed from the order entering judgment and emerald trust from the order denying its motion for summary judgment,the order denying reconsideration of the denial of that motion,and the judgment and order partially denying its claim for interest.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court attempted to exercise diversity of citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to a and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.the parties raise numerous issues on this appeal and which we would review under various standards if we reached them.but our disposition of this appeal begins and ends with an examination of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.thus,the principle that a determination of w hether the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction is an issue of law which this court reviews de novo governs our review.in re,cir.if we determined that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction we would direct it to dismiss the case even at this late stage of the litigation.see great fire proof hotel jones.
iv.discussion 
as we have explained,the district court decided that it could exercise diversity of citizenship jurisdiction because emerald trust is an unincorporated business trust a court determines the citizenship of an unincorporated business trust by determining the citizenship of its beneficiary or beneficiaries the sole beneficiary is emerald,a corporation incorporated in the british virgin islands and having its principal place of business there and none of the defendants are citizens of the british virgin islands.the court did not consider the citizenship of michael houlis,a citizen of florida,the trustee of emerald trust,in making this determination.this appeal requires us to determine whether,when ascertaining the citizenship of a trust for diversity of citizenship purposes,we should look to the citizenship of the trust beneficiary,its trustee,or both,or use an alternative method to determine citizenship based on the functions of the trustee and beneficiary with respect to management of the trust in the particular case it is surprising that at this date after so many years of litigation involving trusts that the method for determination of a trust citizenship rather than being settled is a subject of great differences of opinion.
the supreme court navarro savings and carden.
in,we looked to the citizenship of both the trustees and the investors beneficiaries in determining the citizenship of a trust for diversity purposes.riverside mem l mausoleum,umet trust,cir but since riverside,the supreme court has decided navarro savings association lee,d,and carden arkoma associates,d,which require us to reconsider riverside as we have not considered the place of a trust citizenship since these supreme court decisions.
in navarro,eight individual trustees of a business trust,suing in their own names,brought an action for breach of contract.at.at.the plaintiffs premised federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship,an allegation that the defendants disputed,as they claimed that the trust beneficiaries,and not the trustees,were the real parties to the controversy and the citizenship of the beneficiaries from whom they were not diverse should control.thus,the question before the court was whether trustees of a business trust may invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts on the basis of their own citizenship,rather than that of the trust beneficial shareholders.id.at.at.
the court looked at the role of the trustees and the shareholders with respect to the trust.under the trust,the trustees had exclusive authority over the property.id.at.at.moreover,the declaration of trust authorized the trustees to take legal title to trust assets,to invest those assets for the benefit of the shareholders,and to sue and be sued in their capacity as trustees.id.at.at.in contrast,the shareholders did not have such authority.id.
the court found that a trustee is a real party to the controversy for purposes of diversity jurisdiction when he possesses certain customary powers to hold,manage,and dispose of assets for the benefit of others,and t he trustees in this case have such powers.id.at.at.the court concluded that trustees who meet this standard may sue in their own right,without regard to the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries.id.at.at.
ten years later in carden,the plaintiff,a limited partnership,brought a complaint concerning a contract dispute in a district court relying on diversity of citizenship for federal jurisdiction.at.at.the court rejected the limited partnership attempt to extend a corporation treatment to the partnership for the purposes of determining citizenship,id.at.at,and further rejected the limited partnership attempt to have the court determine citizenship of the partnership solely by reference to the citizenship of its general partners,without regard to the citizenship of its limited partners.id.at,at.the court concluded that in a suit by or against an artificial entity,diversity of citizenship depends on the citizenship of all the members.id.at.at citation omitted.carden distinguished navarro,remarking that navarro had nothing to do with the citizenship of the trust,since it was a suit by the trustees in their own names.id.at.at.
thus,in light of navarro and carden,the supreme court has established the following rules.in a suit by or against the individual trustees of a trust,where the trustees possess certain customary powers to hold,manage and dispose of assets,their citizenship,and not that of the trust beneficiaries,is controlling for diversity of citizenship purposes.navarro,at.at.the rule,however,is different when an artificial entity sues or is sued in its own name.in that situation,because artificial entities,unlike corporations,are not citizens under,diversity jurisdiction by or against an artificial entity depends on the citizenship of all the members.carden,at.at.
the four alternatives.
in the light of navarro and carden and other cases that we have examined we conclude that a court might determine the citizenship of a trust by selecting among four possible tests a look to the citizenship of the trustee only b look to the citizenship of the beneficiary only c look to the citizenship of either the trustee or the beneficiary depending on who is in control of the trust in the particular case or d look to the citizenship of both the trustee and the beneficiary 
a look to the citizenship of the trustee 
navarro,though involving an action that the trustees themselves brought,could be understood as suggesting that a court should look to the citizenship of the trustee in determining the citizenship of a trust without regard to the citizenship of the beneficiary,so long as the trustee possesses certain customary powers to hold,manage,and dispose of assets for the benefit of others.navarro,at.at.in the circumstances,it is not surprising that some courts of appeals,with citation to navarro,have held that the citizenship of a trust is that of the trustee.hicklin eng g,bartell,cir see also johnson columbia props.anchorage,lp,cir a trust has the citizenship of its trustee or trustees.indiana gas home ins,cir.indeed,before navarro,in a dictum in general heat power diversified mortgage investors,cir,we said the citizenship of a trust is generally that of the trustee.
we are reluctant,however,to agree with those courts,or for that matter regard ourselves as confined by general heat,as we do not join in those courts reading of navarro in creating this rule,and surely their opinions are inconsistent with riverside.moreover,we decided general heat before riverside and before the supreme court decided navarro and carden.navarro simply does not say that the citizenship of a trustee determines the citizenship of a trust.after all,as the court emphasized in carden,in navarro the trustees were suing in their own names and,as we already have recognized,t he question before the court was whether trustees of a business trust may invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts on the basis of their own citizenship,rather than that of the trust beneficial shareholders.trent realty assocs.first fed.sav.loan ass of philadelphia,cir quoting navarro,at.at.
in contrast to navarro,in the above cases,as well as in this case,the question is what is the citizenship of an entity when the entity itself is a party to the action navarro simply does not address that question as carden made clear when it said that navarro had nothing to do with the citizenship of the trust,since it was a suit by the trustees in their own names.carden,at,at.we are not at liberty to disregard this observation.
additionally,the rule in an action by the trust itself seems to contradict carden because that case held that an artificial entity,a term that we will treat as including a trust,should assume the citizenship of all of its members.id.at.at.the rule may contravene carden because it disregards the citizenship of the trust beneficiary who may be in a position similar to that of the limited partners in a limited partnership.
b look to the citizenship of the beneficiary 
the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit took the different approach that carden made clear that the citizenship of the members,who it believed were only the beneficiaries,determines the citizenship of a business trust.see riley merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir this alternative,though not inconsistent with carden unless,of course,a trustee is a member of the trust,is not the best rule because in many cases the rule may lead to an untoward result,as for example,would be the situation if a trust in which the beneficiary has delegated all control of the trust to the trustee brings the action.it seems to us that reliance only on the citizenship of the beneficiary in these circumstances would be inconsistent with the reasons justifying the existence of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction because in that situation it is logical to think that if the trust had a local advantage or faced a local prejudice it would be on the basis of the identification of the trustee not the beneficiary 
c look to the citizenship of either the trustee or the beneficiary depending on who is in control of the trust in the particular case 
the third alternative is a less definite,rule.in this regard wright miller in their well known treatise suggest that t he citizenship of an active trustee,rather than that of the beneficiaries of the grantor,is decisive,but again a different result is reached with regard to a passive trustee who has only a naked legal title to the property.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed footnote omitted.the problem with this rule is that it places a great and unnecessary burden on both the litigants and the courts themselves.the wright miller rule would require that in each case where a trust is a party and the plaintiff relies on the court diversity of citizenship jurisdiction,the court would have to monitor jurisdictional discovery to the same extent that it monitors any discovery in the case,and make findings with respect to the roles of the trustee and beneficiary in the affairs of the trust,all in a case that might be dismissed,or,if removed from a state court,remanded to it 
considering the burdens created by a approach,it is not surprising that some courts of appeals have resisted efforts to base determinations of citizenship on functional considerations.may dep t stores fed.ins,cir see also kuntz lamar,cir j urisdictional rules should be as simple as possible,so that the time of litigants and judges is not wasted deciding where a case should be brought and so that fully litigated cases are not set at naught.quoting cote wadel,cir saadeh farouki,shr.braun,cir.though we recognize that,as this case demonstrates,rejection of the wright miller rule will not ensure that a diversity of citizenship determination will not require discovery and a hearing,we nevertheless would be reluctant to adopt a test and thereby aggravate the burden on the litigants and the courts that we have identified.
d look to the citizenship of both the trustee and the beneficiary 
the final alternative is to look to the citizenship of both the trustee and the beneficiary in all cases in which a trust is a party.we consider that approach to be best for several reasons.first and foremost,this rule does not contradict the supreme court precedent in either navarro and carden,which,of course,we can not do.navarro is not implicated because it dealt with a situation in which the trustees brought the action in their own names,a situation different from that here in which the trust is the plaintiff.moreover,the dual rule does not offend carden,a case we discuss at greater length below,because the dual approach asks a court to look at the citizenship of all of the members,at least the beneficiary of the artificial entity,and merely directs a court to look at the citizenship of the trustee as well.
the concern with respect to carden is raised by treating that case as applying to a trust.in this regard we point out that,so far as we are aware,historically the term members has not been applied in the context of a trust.nevertheless,applying carden to a trust,as we shall explain below we do not see why a trust members include only its beneficiary and not its trustee.of course,if a trustee is a member of a trust then when carden is applied to a trust,a court in determining its citizenship must consider the trustee citizenship.
a second reason for adopting the dual rule is that it obviates the possibility of an illogical outcome under a trustee or approach in a case in which the trustee controls the trust and the beneficiary is merely passive,or vice versa.a third reason is that a rule is preferable to a functional rule as it is the most efficient rule to utilize in determining whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction.
moreover,the dual rule approach best accommodates our concerns of judicial economy and of due respect for the principles of federalism when matters of diversity jurisdiction are implicated.carlsberg res.cambria sav.loan ass n,cir.in carlsberg,we recognized that the extension of diversity jurisdiction 
would impose additional burdens on a federal judicial system which already strains to process cases that are necessarily lodged with it.relaxation of diversity requirements,intentional or otherwise,inevitably will increase access to the federal courts by litigants now confined to state courts,thereby augmenting the volume of business of the federal tribunals.such an occurrence also may postpone or even forestall the vindication of the rights of and are properly in the federal courts.
even more serious would be the disservice rendered to the cardinal precepts of federalism by its very nature,the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts interferes with the autonomy of state tribunals by diverting litigation,ordinarily handled by such courts,to federal forums.although the rule of erie tompkins.requiring that state law be applied in diversity cases,operates to ameliorate the dislocative impact of such diversion,the fact remains that diversity jurisdiction prevents the states from adjudicating and resolving important matters that they otherwise would handle.since conflict resolution constitutes one of the core public functions of state government,the exercise of diversity jurisdiction necessarily encroaches,in some fashion,on the ability of the states to engage in this traditional activity.
id.at footnote omitted see also city of indianapolis chase bank of.the dominant note in the successive enactments of congress relating to diversity jurisdiction is one of jealous restriction,of avoiding offense to state sensitiveness,and of relieving the federal courts of the overwhelming burden of business that intrinsically belongs to the state courts in order to keep them from for their distinctive federal business.internal quotation marks omitted.the comments that we made years ago in carlsberg with respect to the burdens on the federal courts now are true to an enhanced degree as it is a matter of common knowledge that there has been a massive increase in the quantity of litigation in the federal courts for the last years,far outpacing the growth in the size of the federal judiciary 
for the foregoing reasons,after considering navarro and carden,we reaffirm the rule that we adopted almost years ago in riverside that the citizenship of both the trustee and the beneficiary should control in determining the citizenship of a trust 
in reaching our result we discuss carden further because we recognize that that case might be understood as pointing to a rule.thus,it is important to emphasize that the issue before the court in carden was very different than the issue now before us.in carden the issue was whether a court can look to the citizenship of less than all of the partners of a limited partnership to determine the partnership citizenship.see carden,at.at the question presented in this case is whether,in a suit brought by a limited partnership,the citizenship of the limited partners must be taken into account to determine diversity of citizenship among the parties.in its holding,the court reject ed the contention that to determine,for diversity purposes,the citizenship of an artificial entity,the court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity members.id.at.at emphasis added.
thus,it is clear that carden tells us that a court must take into account not less than all of the entity members when determining the citizenship of an artificial entity.obviously,because the court was looking at a partnership,which is owned by all the partners who under any theory are its only members,there could not be a need to look to any persons other than the partners and other than the partners there could be no one else to look to.but because carden was dealing with a partnership,the court did not deal with the entirely separate question of whether citizenship treatment may extend to individuals in addition to members with respect to other entities,and in any event,the court did not consider the critical question of who is a member of such entities.
our decision can not be inconsistent with the holding in carden as we are not concluding that a court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity members in a citizenship determination.rather,our opinion does not offend carden no matter how one decides to define member in the context of a trust.if a trustee is not a member,then rather than looking to less than all of the entity members,we are looking beyond that criterion because of the unique characteristics of a trustee,a situation that carden does not address.on the other hand,if a trustee is a member,then clearly we must look to his citizenship under carden.in either circumstance,our holding is not inconsistent with carden.
moreover,assuming that carden governs trusts and that a court should look only to the citizenship of a trust members for the purposes of diversity of citizenship,we believe that a member,a term left undefined by carden which thus can be applied to different artificial entities in various ways,includes a trust trustee as well as its beneficiary.we reach this conclusion in recognition of the law that a trustee is more than a mere manager of a trust inasmuch as title to a trust assets is fragmented with its legal title being vested in the trustee and its equitable title being vested in the beneficiary.see in re columbia gas,cir restatement second of trusts cmt.f.a court should not ignore the legal interest held by the trustee as congress itself has treated it as important as the equitable interest held by a beneficiary.thus,in requiring that a judge must recuse himself in cases in which he has a financial interest,congress defines that term as including a legal or equitable ownership interest.see b,d.overall,we see no reason why a trustee,who,in fact,has a significant ownership interest in the title to the assets of the trust in addition to management responsibilities,should not be deemed a member of a trust for purposes of determining the trust citizenship in a diversity of citizenship case see also a with exceptions all legal or equitable interests of the debtor become property of the bankruptcy estate.
finally in adopting the dual approach to determining citizenship of a trust we point out that our result is not inconsistent with chapman barney.that case concluded in a result that still is followed that corporations but not unincorporated business entities are citizens for purposes of diversity of citizenship.we are in no way acting inconsistently with that principle as we do not suggest that a trust should be assimilated to the status of a corporation for diversity purposes,a task that if it is to be done at all is for congress and not for us.see carden,at.at.
application of the dual approach to this case 
we now apply the rule we have adopted to the facts here.the facts relating to the citizenship of the parties follows the plaintiff is emerald trust,the beneficiary of which is emerald,a corporation incorporated in the british virgin islands with its principal place of business there as well michael houlis,a florida citizen,is the trustee of emerald trust.
defendant reckson operating partnership,is a delaware limited partnership whose sole general partner is reckson associates realty,a maryland corporation with its principal place of business in new york.according to an affidavit filed in the jurisdictional inquiry proceedings,among its limited partners are individuals residing in new york,florida,connecticut,virginia,new jersey,maryland,arizona,and illinois.app.at emphasis added 
defendant horseheads commercial development partners,is a limited partnership whose sole general partner is horseheads commercial development,a new york corporation.its sole limited partner is stratford business associates,a limited partnership with its general partner cannon street properties,itself a limited liability company with new jersey citizens wolff and hoffman as its sole members,and with limited partners wolff and hoffman.
thus,as the record now stands,plaintiff emerald trust appears to be a citizen of the british virgin islands the citizenship of the beneficiary corporation and florida the citizenship of its trustee.defendant reckson,a limited partnership,has a limited partner or partners that resides or reside in florida but we do not know the state or states of reckson citizenship inasmuch as the district court did not make a determination as to the domicile and thus the citizenship of its limited partners it does appear that defendant horseheads is not a citizen of the british virgin islands.
clearly our uncertainty as to the citizenship of the parties requires us to remand this case to the district court to determine if it has diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.in this regard the citizenship of reckson limited partners may be pivotal as the trustee of emerald trust apparently is a citizen of florida and reckson also may be a citizen of florida because more often than not an individual who resides in a state is a citizen of that state and reckson has a limited partner or partners who reside in florida.therefore we have grave doubts as to whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons we will vacate the judgment and orders from which the parties have appealed and,namely the order entering judgment of july,in favor of emerald trust,the order of august,denying emerald trust motion for summary judgment,the order of october,denying emerald trust motion for reargument and reconsideration with respect to the august,order,and the judgment and order of august,partially denying emerald trust request for prejudgment interest.we will remand the matter to the district court which should allow full discovery on the issue of the parties citizenship.nothing that we have stated with respect to the facts relating to the parties citizenship will bind the district court on the remand from making contrary factual findings predicated on the more complete record that will be developed on the remand.
at the conclusion of discovery the district court,at its discretion,may hold such hearing or hearings,if any,as it regards necessary to determine its jurisdiction,and shall make findings as to whether it has subject matter jurisdiction in this case.in making those findings it will apply the principles that we have set forth.it then either will reinstate the judgment and orders we have vacated or dismiss the action,depending upon whether it determines that it does or does not have jurisdiction.but nothing herein shall preclude the district court from modifying its judgment or orders in accordance with any procedure applicable under the federal rules of civil procedure.see.we do not retain jurisdiction so that any further appeals in this matter shall be from the reinstated judgment and orders,the order for dismissal to be entered on the remand,or such other judgments or orders as may be entered on the remand the parties will bear their own costs on this appeal.
clearly,we do have appellate jurisdiction.
the facts in this case are unusually complicated but we have focused on what needs to be explained for purposes of this opinion.if we were reaching the merits of the case we would have had to explain much more.the district court set forth the facts at greater length in its opinion in emerald investors trust gaunt parsippany partners,wl july.
their four entities were also parties to these agreements but we need not detail which entity was a party to which agreement.rather,as a convenience we refer to the agreements as if only the partners signed them.
we do not detail the entities roles in these agreements.
this sum included principal and interest.
we are addressing only preexisting debt and are not considering any new mortgage that reckson may have placed on the properties for if there was such a mortgage it would not be material to the issue on this appeal.
at that point the emerald trust mortgages no longer may have been subordinated to any other mortgage as the united bank mortgages to which the emerald mortgages had been subordinated were discharged.we,however,are not making any determination on that point which could involve intricate principles of new jersey law.see east rutherford sav.loan.ass neblo,eq.
this conclusion was directly contrary to a dictum in general heat power diversified mortgage investors,cir,in which in a case involving a business trust we said,without limiting the type of trust to which we were referring,that the citizenship of a trust is generally that of the trustee.
a court accepting a party representation as to its citizenship might be problematical as a party by a false concession seemingly could create subject matter jurisdiction by consent,something it can not do.in this case,however,we are satisfied that the concession was correct as we can discern nothing in the record suggesting that any defendant could be a citizen of the british virgin islands or was a citizen anywhere other than in the united states.
we address certain of the defendants arguments at this point because their disposition will not be controlling and it is convenient to consider them at the outset of the discussion section of the opinion.defendants argue emerald trust is a traditional express trust and not,as the district court held,an unincorporated business trust,and,thus,we should look to the citizenship of its trustee who it asserts is a citizen of florida apparently emerald trust which alleged in the complaint that it was a citizen of florida originally also believed that citizenship of its trustee controlled.even if emerald trust is a business trust and we should look to the citizenship of its beneficiary,emerald,to determine emerald trust citizenship,emerald principal place of business is in new york.thus,emerald trust is a citizen of new york and there would not be complete diversity of citizenship between emerald trust and the defendants and emerald trust,though the plaintiff,is not the real party to the controversy and thus its citizenship is not the determinative factor in a diversity of citizenship research,however,has not led us to conclude that the type of trust calls for a difference in treatment when determining a trust citizenship for diversity of citizenship jurisdictional purposes.the distinction between a traditional express trust and a business trust is that i n what are called business trusts the object is not to hold and conserve particular property,with incidental powers,as in the traditional type of trusts,but to provide a medium for the conduct of a business and sharing its gains.morrissey comm r of internal.the cases defendants cite do not support its contention calling for differential treatment based on the type of trust.moreover,emerald trust may be,as the district court believed,a business trust for the trust agreement states the purpose of the trust shall be to make,hold,liquidate,and distribute investments of any lawful kind or character in trust for and for the benefit of grantor,without regard to any rule of prudent investment by fiduciaries.app.at.the reference to nonapplicability of limitations on fiduciaries suggests that emerald trust may not be a traditional express trust.but we reach no conclusion on that second argument is also without merit as the record now appears.the district court determined that the british virgin islands was emerald principal place of business,basing its determination on the affidavit of john usher,the director of the company,valdex investments,that caused the formation of emerald trust.usher stated that the emerald only office was in the british virgin islands and all of its directors always have been in t
