background 
in,the state authorized the levee board to acquire land to build the bohemia spillway however,in,the louisiana legislature directed the levee board to return the land to its former owners and to provide a thorough accounting concerning all revenues received from the affected property.after unsuccessfully challenging the constitutionality of this law the levee board issued quitclaim deeds to the landowners or their successors.however,the levee board did not pay the landowners the mineral royalties that the levee board received between june and the time the land was returned.
in february,haspel davis milling planting,jean connell joseph torre bohemia planting,leonie rothschild and arthur davis,on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated,former owners of property expropriated as part of the bohemia spillway or their successors,filed a class action in state court seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment decreeing that title to the mineral and other royalties vested with the original owners as of the effective date of act of the landowners subsequently amended and supplemented their petition numerous times to assert,inter alia,a claim that an unconstitutional taking occurred when the levee board continued to collect and failed to return the mineral royalties.
after years of litigation in state court,the parties entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement,which was approved by the state court via a consent judgment.in the settlement agreement,the landowners settled all their claims against the levee board in return for a payment of immediately and another as and if funds are appropriated thereof.pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,if the levee board did not pay at least per year,the landowners could exercise their rights to enforce the consent judgment in accordance with this agreement and law.although the levee board made numerous payments under the settlement agreement,the payments were less than the per year called for by the settlement agreement 
in july,the landowners filed this action in federal court,alleging that the levee board failure to pay the amount contemplated by the state court consent judgment was an unconstitutional taking of their property.in response,the levee board filed a rule b motion to dismiss on grounds that,inter alia,the levee board failure to discharge its obligations under the consent judgment and settlement agreement did not give rise to a takings claim.according to the levee board,the landowners chose to compromise their takings claim and,in doing so,converted any takings claim into a claim for breach of contract 
citing our decision in vogt board of commissioners of the orleans levee district vogt i the landowners filed a motion for partial summary judgment,maintaining that the levee board intentional failure to satisfy the state court judgment did constitute a violation of the takings clause.
the district court agreed with the landowners,and denied the levee board motion to dismiss and granted the landowners motion for summary judgment the district court then entered a judgment awarding the landowners,plus unquantified prejudgment interest,interest,costs,and attorneys fees.
the levee board filed a conditional notice of appeal from the district court judgment,although it disputed that the district court judgment constituted a final,appealable judgment under 
while this appeal was pending before us,the levee board moved in the district court for an automatic stay of execution without bond of the court judgment,pursuant to fed.civ.proc.f,which was denied by the district court.we affirmed the district court denial,concluding that rule f was inapplicable to this case.
the landowners then began taking steps to execute the judgment by arranging for the issuance of writs of fieri facias and garnishment orders,which the levee board moved to vacate as a violation of fed.civ.proc.a and.const.art.xii.alternatively,the levee board sought a stay pending appeal under fed.civ.proc.d.around this time,the state also moved to intervene in the action solely to enforce state laws prohibiting the seizure and garnishment of public property and funds.the district court denied all motions.
the state and the levee board appealed these rulings.however,we subsequently dismissed the appeal on the ground that the district court judgment was not final because it failed to calculate prejudgment interest 
on remand,the levee board again moved the district court to vacate its writs of seizure and related orders.although the district court granted the levee board motion,it made clear that,upon entry of a final judgment and expiration of the requisite delays,the landowners could again seek execution of the judgment.the district court then entered an amended judgment awarding the landowners,along with prejudgment interest in the amount of,and interest,costs,and attorneys fees.the levee board then filed the instant appeal.
the levee board again moved the district court to stay the judgment without bond and to prohibit further seizures,which were denied.the levee board then moved this court to stay execution without bond and to vacate seizure orders.we granted the levee board stay of execution,but carried the motion to vacate the seizure orders with the case.
the levee board appeals the district court money judgment in favor of the landowners and the denial of its motion to vacate the writs of seizure.in addition,the state appeals the denial of its motion to intervene.
ii.takings claim 
we review both the district court grant of summary judgment and its denial of the motion to dismiss de novo 
the levee board argues that its failure to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement and the consent judgment only gives rise to a breach of contract claim and,thus,the landowners have no valid takings claim.according to the levee board,the instant suit is nothing more than an attempt by the landowners to have a federal court enforce the state court consent judgment approving the settlement agreement.
the landowners,on the other hand,maintain that the levee board alleged intentional failure to satisfy the state court judgment constitutes an unconstitutional taking.the landowners contend that we previously rejected the levee board argument in vogt 
the instant case is distinguishable from the situation we faced in vogt prior to filing suit in federal court,the landowners in vogt i brought suit in state court requesting,inter alia,a declaratory judgment confirming their ownership of disputed mineral royalties an accounting of all mineral royalties paid to the levee board after june,and a money judgment for the royalties that the levee board collected.after the levee board produced an accounting of revenues received from the subject property,the state trial court granted the landowners motion for summary judgment and ordered the levee board to pay when the levee board refused to pay the royalties in spite of this judgment,the landowners unsuccessfully sought writs of mandamus and seizure in the state court.
in a further attempt to collect the royalties due,the landowners filed suit in federal court,claiming that the levee board refusal to pay the judgment was an unconstitutional taking.the district court subsequently dismissed the suit on eleventh amendment immunity grounds
