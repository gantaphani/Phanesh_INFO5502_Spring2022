taita chemical company sued westlake styrene for breach of contract,arguing that westlake failed to sell taita styrene monomer at a lower price to which taita was entitled under the contract.westlake asserted affirmative defenses,including the aiding and abetting of a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.westlake also pled aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and fraud as counterclaims.the jury found that taita aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty and that it defrauded westlake.the jury awarded taita nothing on its contract claim,but awarded westlake million on its aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty counterclaim.westlake also recovered attorneys fees based on the fraud finding.
taita argues that the jury findings must be reversed because the jury instructions were erroneous.we affirm the judgment denying taita recovery under the contract and awarding westlake attorneys fees,but reverse the judgement award to westlake on the counterclaim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.
this is the second time this contract dispute comes before us westlake is a joint venture formed in to produce and sell styrene monomer.there were four original shareholders of westlake taita owned btr nylex,which also held the majority interest in taita,owned the chao group owned and the sumitomo corporation and sumitomo corporation of america owned.
the previous opinion discussed the contract and the parties differing interpretations of it 
on january,taita and westlake entered into a contract known as the agreement.this agreement was a contract,under which taita agreed to purchase of westlake styrene monomer production capacity each month for the duration of the contract.price was to be determined on a monthly basis in accordance with the contract pricing clause.this clause provided that each month taita was to receive the lowest of three alternative prices 
the contract price per pound of product delivered or ordered for delivery,including deemed delivery,during each month shall be the gulf coast styrene monomer prices,net after all discounts,for contract transactions as last published in each month by dewitt company,incorporated in its benzene derivatives newsletter,or the price for such month charged by wsc westlake styrene to a consumer under a firm contract or the posted contract market price for comparable volumes of product,whichever is lower.should such publication cease to be published,buyer and seller shall mutually select other representative publications.
the meaning of this pricing clause and the parties conduct with respect to its terms lies at the center of the earlier dispute.in essence,taita argues that westlake overcharged it for styrene because westlake did not extend taita a lower price provided by westlake to another customer as required under taita interpretation of the second pricing mechanism.this second provision states that taita shall receive the price for such month charged to a consumer under a firm contract.the parties have referred to this provision as the most favored nations clause,for the obvious reason that it ensures that taita,as westlake largest investor and principal styrene purchaser,will receive the best available price.westlake disputes taita interpretation of the pricing clause,but urges that,in any event,the evidence demonstrates that taita undeniably acquiesced in westlake differing reading of the contract 
affirming the district court,we held that the pricing clause entitled taita to the lower price given to other customers,regardless of the volume of the other sales however,we reversed the district court decision to grant summary judgment on defendant affirmative defenses.
on remand,taita argued that it was entitled to reimbursement for the amount it overpaid.in response,westlake argued that the contract on which taita based its claim was secured by the board members breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.the alleged breach consisted of board members remaining silent about their interpretation of the nation provision until after westlake entered into a contract with another company.only then,argues westlake,did taita reveal its interpretation of the contract and claim the price reduction.westlake argued that the contracts would not have been formed but for taita aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty.that is,if the rest of the board knew of taita impending claim to the lower price,the board would not have ratified the contracts.therefore,westlake argued that taita encouragement of the members to remain silent amounted to aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud,and as a result,taita should not recover.these allegations also formed the basis of westlake counterclaims for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.
the jury found that taita should recover nothing taita aided and abetted the directors of westlake in their breach of fiduciary duty any price discounts to which taita may have been entitled resulted from its aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty taita committed fraud westlake was entitled to million for its aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty counterclaim and westlake was entitled to attorneys fees.
taita argues on appeal that the judge erroneously instructed the jury,affecting the outcome of the case.taita argues that the court instructions were erroneous because in explaining a fiduciary duty to disclose information,the instructions did not limit the obligation by the principle of inquiry notice by not adequately explaining actual and apparent authority,the instructions did not allow the jury to attribute the bad acts to btr,a different company and the instructions did not include damages as a required element of westlake aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty counterclaim.
there are three requirements to successfully challenge jury instructions first,the appellant must show that viewing the charge as a whole,the charge creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.second,even if erroneous,the appellate court will not reverse if the error could not have affected the outcome of the case.third,the appellant must show that the proposed instruction offered to the district court correctly stated the law.perfection is not required as long as the instructions were generally correct and any error was harmless this standard provides the district court with great latitude concerning the charge.
a litigant also must have preserved the error in the charge to complain on appeal.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure outlines the requirements that one must satisfy in order to assign error for failing to give,or erroneously giving,jury instructions.one may not complain of a jury instruction unless that party objects thereto,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.general objections to jury instructions are insufficient to meet rule requirements furthermore,submission of an alternative instruction does not necessarily preserve error for appeal the proposed instruction must make one position sufficiently clear to the court to satisfy rule objection requirement.
a party may be excused from rule strict requirements if the party position has previously been clearly made to the court and it is plain that a further objection would be unavailing.to find reversible error in this instance,the appellate court must be certain that the district court was adequately informed of the objection examples of this exception involve clear cases where the exception is justified a litigant who fails to object when invited to do so but who had previously filed sufficient objections a litigant who fails to object after the court intimated that no more objections would be heard and a previous emphatic ruling by a judge made later objections futile 
if error is not preserved,we review for plain error.to meet this standard,a party must show that an error occurred that the error was plain,which means clear or obvious the plain error must affect substantial rights and not correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputat
