the bankruptcy trustee the trustee for debtor total realty management,llc trm appeals the dismissal of his adversary action against real estate development companies north development,and north development i,and several of their sales and marketing affiliates collectively,the trustee alleges that trm and north jointly engaged in a scheme to sell properties at inflated prices in recently developed subdivisions in north carolina and south carolina.the trustee seeks contribution from north for trm liabilities under the interstate land sales full disclosure act interstate land sales act,which prohibits developers from making fraudulent and misleading statements to purchasers in the course of real estate transactions.but trm is not entitled to contribution as a matter of law because it has yet to make any payment to aggrieved purchasers stemming from interstate land sales act violations.consequently,we affirm.
according to the trustee,during and,trm and north engaged in a real estate fraud scheme.north development developed the cannonsgate subdivision in carteret county,north carolina,and north development i developed the summerhouse subdivision in onslow county,north carolina.maryville partners,maryville,which is not a party to this appeal,developed the craven grant subdivision in georgetown county,south carolina.maryville contracted with north to assist in the marketing and sales of craven grant properties.
under the scheme,trm purchased a number of,summerhouse,and craven grant parcels from north and maryville at value.within hours of purchase,trm resold the parcels to individual purchasers at a substantial premium and substantially above value.trm then used the proceeds from the sales to finance its purchases from north and maryville.
trm attracted buyers by holding seminars for real estate investors.sales and marketing affiliates of north provided electronic and marketing materials to trm to distribute at the seminars and videos to post on its website.during the seminars,trm employees and agents of north would give presentations regarding the investment potential of the three subdivisions,including testimonials from investors who had previously made money through purchasing and reselling lots in the subdivisions.at the seminars,trm falsely represented to prospective buyers that it owned the lots it was selling and that it purchased the lots at a bulk discount from north.north was aware that trm made these false representations at the time they were made.sales affiliates of north also assisted trm summerhouse purchasers in obtaining financing by telling lenders that trm had agreed to buy nearly all of the parcels in the subdivision.
richard watts who served as sales manager for the subdivisions and was compensated by southeastern waterfront marketing,a sales and marketing unit of north participated in trm scheme.in particular,at trm seminars,watts showed videos and made presentations about the subdivisions,and he informed purchasers that southeastern waterfront marketing would assist them in reselling their lots.watts told purchasers that southeastern waterfront marketing would charge a brokerage fee for assisting in resales,making purchasers more likely to buy from trm because it only charged a brokerage fee for resales.watts also interacted with trm representatives on a regular basis to promote sales of lots in the three subdivisions.
the trustee contends that north benefited from this scheme in at least three ways trm aggressive sales tactics allowed r.north to exhaust its inventory more quickly,freeing it from blanket mortgages on the subdivisions that could not be released until a certain percentage of lots were sold the premium prices paid by trm purchasers made north prospective direct purchasers more likely to buy lots because north prices appeared to be below market value and the scheme allowed north to tout to its direct purchasers the possibility of reselling their lots to trm customers,who were paying inflated prices.
this case procedural background is somewhat circuitous.one group of aggrieved purchasers brought actions under the interstate land sales act against trm and north in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.see beth feeley total realty management,cv filed.that group of aggrieved purchasers put trm into involuntary bankruptcy in.north reached a settlement with all but six of the feeley plaintiffs.a separate group of purchasers filed suit in the circuit court of prince william county,virginia,asserting essentially the same claims against north and other defendants.see christina blake michael mccracken,no.the circuit court dismissed the complaint without leave to amend on the basis that the plaintiffs could not pursue claims against north under the interstate land sales act,either directly or via an agency theory.
this appeal arises from an adversary proceeding brought by the trustee for trm against north on april,in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia.the action sought statutory contribution from north related to trm alleged liability to aggrieved buyers under interstate land sales act provisions that allow for rescission of violative sales counts i vii and damages stemming from fraudulent and misleading actions taken in the course of covered real estate transactions counts viii xiv.the allegations in the trustee action are substantially similar to the allegations in feeley and blake.
north successfully moved to withdraw and transfer the trustee action from the bankruptcy court to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.thereafter,north moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted north motion on all claims,concluding that the statutory contribution claims failed as a matter of law because north would not have been liable if sued separately the complaint failed to allege with sufficient particularity that trm acted as north agent and r.north could not be sued separately as an agent under the interstate land sales act.the trustee appealed.

on appeal,the trustee challenges the district court decision regarding the damages claims,but not the rescission claims.the trustee argues that the district court failed to directly address its damages claims,incorrectly determined that trm purchasers had no recourse against north under the interstate land sales act as a matter of law,and erred in holding that the complaint failed to satisfy the federal pleading standards.
the interstate land sales act provides that e very person who becomes liable to make any payment under this section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who,if sued separately,would have been liable to make the same payment.u.d.therefore,to state a claim for contribution under the interstate land sales act,a complaint must allege that the plaintiff has become liable under the statute,the defendant is independently liable for the same conduct,and the plaintiff is entitled to contribution from the defendant.id.
following the district court approach,we will begin by assuming,without deciding,that trm is liable to purchasers of properties in the subdivisions.thus,to state a claim for statutory contribution,the trustee complaint must establish both that north is independently liable under the interstate land sales act to trm purchasers and that trm is entitled to contribution from north.
the trustee contends that north is independently liable to trm purchasers under the interstate land sales act provision barring developers from engaging in fraudulent or deceitful acts in the course of covered real estate transactions.in particular,section makes it unlawful for any developer directly or indirectly with respect to the sale or lease,or offer to sell or lease to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud or to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser a a,a c see also a allowing purchasers to bring damages actions for sales made in violation of section a.the statute broadly defines developer as any person who,directly or indirectly,sells or leases,or offers to sell or lease,or advertises for sale or lease any lots in a subdivision.
the trustee asserts that north is individually liable for trm sales because north participated in the sales and marketing efforts for the properties at issue.by contrast,north contends that even if it participated in trm sales and marketing efforts,it can not be liable because trm purchasers must look to the developer from whom they purchased the lot.appellee br.at.in particular,north maintains that such a limitation conforms to the interstate land sales act definition of developer and requirement that a defendant fraudulent action be made with respect to a sale.id.
this court has not had occasion to address whether liability under the interstate land sales act extends to entities that were not party to a challenged real estate transaction but engaged in fraudulent advertising or marketing activities in the course of that transaction.however,we have said that the language of the interstate land sales act should be read broadly to effectuate its goal of protect ing purchasers of land which is part of a common promotional scheme.olsen lake country,f d,cir per curiam.
when interpreting a statute,we begin with the plain language.crespo holder,cir.in doing so,we give the terms their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended it to bear some different import.id.internal quotation omitted.to determine a statute plain meaning,we not only look to the language itself,but also the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.holland big river minerals,cir quotation omitted.
principles of statutory construction require a court to construe all parts to have meaning and,accordingly,avoid constructions that would reduce some terms to mere surplussage.psinet,chapman,cir.canons of construction also require that,to the extent possible,identical terms or phrases used in different parts of the same statute be interpreted as having the same meaning.healthkeepers,richmond ambulance,cir.this presumption of consistent usage ensure s that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.quotation omitted.
to determine whether north is potentially liable to trm purchasers,we first look to the definition of developer under the interstate land sales act.here,the definition of developer encompasses entities that sell or advertise for sale properties in covered subdivisions.emphasis added.expressly including advertising as a basis for treating an entity as a developer indicates that congress intended to extend the interstate land sales act liability beyond just those entities that sell properties.see reiter sonotone,canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings,unless the context dictates otherwise.
nevertheless,north maintains liability is limited to the party that sold the property to the buyer bringing suit because section a only covers fraudulent acts taken by a developer with respect to a sale.appellee br.at.however,when one compares section a with the interstate land sales act preceding clause,a,which deals with disclosure requirements,it is readily apparent that the language of the statute does not support such a limitation.section a provides 
it shall be unlawful for any developer directly or indirectly with respect to the sale or lease of any lot 
a to sell or lease any lot unless a statement of record with respect to such lot is in effect 
b to sell or lease any lot unless a printed property report has been furnished to the purchaser in advance of the signing of any contract or agreement 
c to sell or lease any lot where any part of the statement of record or the property report contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or 
d to display or deliver to prospective purchasers advertising or promotional material which is inconsistent with information required to be disclosed in the property report 
a emphasis added.by using the term to sell in sections a a c,congress limited liability under those clauses to the sellers of property.this is particularly apparent when sections a a c are compared to section a d,which deals with advertising and promotion and prohibits display ing or deliver ing rather than sell ing,indicating that congress intended to hold advertisers and promoters liable for certain acts,even if they did not sell a property.were we to construe the phrase with respect to the sale in section a as limiting liability to sellers,we would render the term to sell in sections a a c meaningless.principles of statutory construction require that we reject such an interpretation.see psinet,at.a better reading of the phrase with respect to the sale,which gives meaning to all of the terms in the statute,is that the phrase is intended to limit liability to claims stemming from prohibited actions taken in relation to consummated sales.
therefore,since the phrase with respect to the sale in section a can not reasonably be interpreted as limiting liability to sellers,we should not interpret the identical phrase in section a as requiring such a limitation.see healthkeepers,at.the fact that congress effectively distinguished in section a between conduct for which only sellers would be liable and conduct for which all developers would be liable only reinforces this interpretation.had congress wanted to limit liability under section a to sellers it simply could have used the same limiting language it used in sections a a c.
furthermore,the legislative history of the statute does not support limiting liability under section a to sellers.the interstate land sales act was enacted in during the rapid expansion of the interstate land sales industry and in response to a number of cases of misleading and fraudulent marketing and sales of properties to buyers,particularly retirees.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of williams.in introducing the bill,senator williams noted that the bill was intended to broadly address the promotion of land sales across state lines because buyers generally rely on what they are told in advertising,telephone conversations,sales parties,and by salesmen,indicating that congress was just as concerned with the promotion and advertising of properties as it was with the selling of properties.
additionally,we observe that though we have not addressed this issue,our district courts have found that parties can be held liable under the interstate land sales act as developers if they are engaged in the sales and marketing of a development,even if they are not the sellers.for example,in nahigian juno loudoun,llc,d,the eastern district of virginia found that ritz carlton could be held liable as a developer under the interstate land sales act when it leant its name to a development marketing materials and participated in marketing efforts,despite the fact that the did not purchase the property from ritz carlton.id.at.similarly,in hammar cost control marketing sales management of virginia,the western district of virginia held that a bank could be held liable as a developer under the interstate land sales act,even though it had not sold the properties at issue,explaining that w hen a financial institution allows its name to be used in advertisements or announcements for a development,it is in effect lending its prestige and good name to the sales effort.id.at.
