micrel,and trw,automotive electronics group,entered into agreements for micrel to design and supply electronic circuits to be used in airbag passive restraint systems.after trial on their competing claims and counterclaims for breach of contract,the jury returned its verdict in favor of trw and awarded damages in the amount of.judgment was entered accordingly,and micrel motion for new trial was denied.micrel appeals from the verdict,arguing that the district court erred by allowing trw claim for cover or expectancy damages failing to properly instruct the jury concerning the contract claims or the proper measure of damages and refusing to give the jury interrogatories it requested.micrel also appeals from the district court pretrial order granting summary judgment to trw on micrel claim of fraudulent inducement.after review of the record and the arguments presented on appeal,we affirm.
trw automotive electronics business included assembling and selling components for airbag passive restraint systems to car manufacturers,including toyota,honda,and.the airbag modules required three integrated circuits asics the dual,the quad,and the power supply supply,monitor,and send electrical signals that fire the initiators that deploy the airbags.the dual squib is capable of triggering two airbags,the quad can trigger four,and the power supply provides power to all of the circuitry within the airbag control module.trw asics were being supplied by national semiconductor corporation,but trw wanted to find a new supplier to provide lower cost replacements for the asics supplied by national.the search led trw to micrel.
in january,trw and micrel executed the asic agreement agreement.they agreed that micrel would design the three asics to trw specifications and,if they conformed,trw would purchase of its asic requirements from micrel through at least.in february,development had not been completed and the relationship broke down.trw claimed that micrel had failed to perform timely and terminated the agreement,while micrel claimed that trw had failed to give written notice of the deficiencies and an opportunity to cure.trw and micrel claimed to have incurred damages of and million,respectively.mediation followed,but it was unsuccessful.
trw and micrel had a meeting in march to discuss a possible business solution to their dispute that would involve trw purchase of other products from micrel.during those discussions,micrel commented that it was a shame that the project had ended so close to completion,and trw indicated that it wanted the potential lawsuit off the books because it had become a possible acquisition target.trw suggested they consider resuming work on the asic project,and discussions followed over several months.micrel insists that restarting the program depended on its ability to recoup the million expended and many millions in profits lost under the agreement.
during the discussions,trw provided micrel with estimates of the production volumes it anticipated for the years,and.trw did not provide estimates beyond,and disclosed that the asics would be replaced with a next generation asic already in development with another supplier.micrel was unable to get trw to commit to any minimum production quantities or provide estimates beyond,but was assured that the volume of sales would decline slowly and not fall off a cliff after.micrel made its own projections of somewhat reduced quantities for and,and was orally assured that those quantities were reasonable conservative estimates.micrel was also concerned about whether there were windows by which it would have to deliver the asics,and was told that there were none.
on october,micrel and trw executed three agreements the settlement and mutual release agreement,the asic development agreement,and the asic supply agreement.through these agreements,trw and micrel mutually released their respective claims under the agreement and agreed to resume their plans to develop and produce the asics to replace the units trw was still purchasing from national.the settlement recited that consideration for the releases specifically included the concurrent execution of the development and supply agreements.all three agreements specified that ohio law would govern,and each contained an integration clause 
in the development agreement,micrel committed to developing and testing asics that would meet trw specifications and trw agreed that,if the asics met the acceptance criteria,trw would purchase production level quantities as provided for in the supply agreement.the development agreement incorporated a development schedule that provided for a production release date of the third week of june declared that time was of the essence in micrel performance and allowed for modification of the schedule to accommodate the design process upon the written approval of both parties.micrel was to do internal testing and produce up to units for trw to test,and trw agreed to promptly conduct its testing and to use commercially reasonable efforts to qualify micrel asics for use in trw customer applications.trw agreed to pay upon execution of both the development and the supply agreements on successful completion of micrel internal qualification of the asics and,finally,on successful completion of trw qualification.failure of either party to complete their obligations would be cause for termination,but termination would not become effective unless the breaching party failed to correct the deficiencies within a mutually agreed upon period not to exceed three months.if either party terminated the agreement for cause,then the asic supply agreement would also be deemed terminated for cause.
in the supply agreement,trw committed to purchasing of its requirements for the asics from micrel,if micrel completes all development obligations under the asic development agreement,and if trw has orders from its customers for air bag modules that incorporate micrel products.trw schedule of estimated production requirements for,and,totaling roughly million parts,was attached to and incorporated into the supply agreement.the supply agreement made clear,however,that these quantities were just.the supply agreement also provided that this obligation is not,and will not be construed as a proscription against trw purchasing next generation asics,or asics for other applications,from another supplier.in fact,the same paragraph provided,in part,that 
upon successful completion of micrel internal qualification,trw will discuss with micrel commitments regarding production introduction of the products and will provide production forecasts which are based on trw customer forecasts at that time.trw can not guarantee that customers will accept airbag modules that incorporate the products,or that customers will order airbag modules from trw consistent with historic levels.however,trw will use reasonable commercial efforts in connection with micrel,to cause trw customers to approve the use of airbag modules that incorporate micrel product micrel recognizes that it will take time for trw to qualify air bag modules manufactured for trw customers using micrel product.micrel recognizes that time is of the essence in meeting delivery deadlines,since trw customers have no obligation to approve the asics without adequate lead time.micrel and trw will use reasonable commercial efforts to cause trw customers to approve the use of micrel product in trw air bag modules.
lest this be unclear,this paragraph closed by stating that notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary,trw will only be obligated to purchase product if it has orders from its customers for air bag modules that incorporate micrel products.micrel recognizes that the ultimate decision whether to purchase airbag modules that incorporate the products lies with trw customers.trw also reserved the right to make changes to the specifications by written agreement.if any change caused an increase or decrease in development or production costs or the time required for production or delivery of the asics,micrel was required to promptly notify trw in writing.in such event,an equitable adjustment would be made and the agreement modified by written amendment to reflect the mutually agreed adjustment.
there is no dispute that there were further delays in development.on march,trw director of purchasing,phil roberts,wrote to micrel area sales manager,steve carter,articulating concerns about the development program and explaining that trw was missing specific program application opportunities for micrel product due to micrel delays in delivering product to trw that will pass component and subsequent module qualification.roberts identified several model year my product validation testing opportunities that had been missed indicated that design validation opportunities for my had also been missed and expressed trw understanding that,based upon all issues known today and micrel schedule projections,trw should see samples of the next revision of all three parts in approximately weeks.trw also confirmed that it was expecting a revised schedule shortly.
micrel did not object,and sent trw a proposed revised schedule on march,which would delay the asic production releases until september dual,october quad,and november power supply.on april,trw reluctantly accepted the revised schedule,but advised that due to the delays the potential volumes for micrel product will be significantly lower than the estimated volumes.in fact,trw added that there did not appear to be any opportunity for production volume for calendar year and that the delays were beginning to adversely impact potential volumes for calendar year.trw closed by saying it would not be inclined to accept further delays.
micrel sent another revised schedule to trw on may,pushing the production release dates into january and february.on may,trw rejected this proposed revision,declared the development agreement terminated for cause,and acknowledged micrel right to an opportunity to correct the deficiencies within a period not to exceed three months.trw added that under this proposed schedule,production validation in january or february would equate with a production volume start opportunity of july or august.trw added that several customers were requiring new design features that would not allow micrel asics to be used.at that time,trw provided a much reduced estimate of the remaining production potential for and under the newly proposed schedule.
this letter prompted an internal assessment by micrel,dated may,in which it was acknowledged that there had been significant slip in the development schedule from production releases in june to february.also,going forward,micrel faced additional development costs,reduced estimates for production volumes,and a reasonable chance that the schedule could slip further.micrel response to trw on june,rejected trw characterizations of the reasons for the delay,accused trw of breaching the agreement,and expressed extreme disappointment with the drop in the estimated production volumes which it believed were disproportionate to the schedule delays they had experienced.micrel closed by stating that,absent new forecasts,it would consider the development agreement terminated.
in december,micrel filed a complaint seeking rescission of the settlement and mutual release agreement on several grounds,including fraudulent inducement asserting claims under the agreement,including breach of contract and alleging that trw breached the development and supply agreements.trw answered and asserted its own claims for breach of the agreements.trw filed a motion for partial summary judgment on all of micrel claims except for breach of the agreements,which was granted in part and denied in part in an order entered august.although that order is not appealed from,it is of interest that the district court denied summary judgment on the fraudulent inducement claim to allow micrel further discovery on the issue of whether trw estimates were made in good faith,and whether trw had a good faith intent in to purchase significant quantities of asics from micrel.
after further discovery had been conducted,trw renewed its motion for partial summary judgment.on may,the district court concluded that micrel had not demonstrated a material question of fact for trial on the claim for fraudulent inducement.as discussed below,micrel appeals from that decision.the remaining claims and counterclaims for breach of the development and supply agreements were tried before a jury in july.after two weeks of trial,the jury found in favor of trw and against micrel and awarded damages to trw for.judgment was entered accordingly,and micrel moved for a new trial arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,that the instructions were improper and the interrogatories insufficiently specific,and that the damage award was irreconcilable with the evidence at trial.for the reasons set forth in an order entered december,the district court denied micrel a new trial.this appeal followed.
fraudulent inducement 
in its first claim of error,micrel contends that it was error to grant summary judgment to trw on the claim for rescission of the settlement and mutual release agreement on the grounds of fraudulent inducement.we review a district court decision granting summary judgment de novo.smith ameritech,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
under ohio law,a contract procured by fraudulent inducement may be rescinded.when a plaintiff seeks to set aside a written document,clear and convincing evidence of fraud is required.household fin.altenberg,ohio.to prove fraud or fraudulent inducement,a plaintiff must establish a false representation concerning a fact or,in the face of a duty to disclose,concealment of a fact,material to the transaction knowledge of the falsity of the representation or utter disregard for its truthfulness intent to induce reliance on the representation justifiable reliance upon the representation under circumstances manifesting a right to rely and injury proximately caused by the reliance.lepera fuson,ohio app d,see also cohen lamko,ohio.
the district court addressed each allegedly false representation or concealment of fact and found that none could support micrel claim of fraudulent inducement.the claim includes allegations that trw intentionally misrepresented and overstated the estimated production volumes falsely represented that there were no windows that had to be met falsely represented the intention to work with micrel to get the asics qualified falsely represented that introduction of the asic would have no impact on the estimates and concealed the fact that the asic would replace the parts micrel was developing.without directly contesting the bulk of the district court findings,micrel argues that the district court misapprehended its claim for promissory fraud and misapplied the parol evidence rule.on the contrary,we find that the district court accurately stated the relevant law and did not err in finding that micrel failed to come forward with sufficient evidence from which a rational juror could find,by clear and convincing evidence,that trw fraudulently induced micrel to enter into the settlement and mutual release agreement.
the district court did not err in recognizing that,as a general rule,fraud can not be predicated upon representations concerning future events because they are more in the nature of predictions or opinions about what the future may hold.link leadworks,ohio app d,v.the yogurt exchange,ohio app d.it is also true,as micrel argues and the district court noted,that a promise made with a present intention not to perform constitutes a misrepresentation of existing fact even if the promised performance is to occur in the future.link,at see also tibbs homes constr,ohio app d,the requisite misrepresentation of an existing fact is said to be found in the lie as to his existing mental attitude and present intent.
on appeal,micrel characterizes its claim as one based on promissory fraud and contends that parol evidence may be used to prove promissory fraud.while generally true,the ohio supreme court has explained that it is not always so.the parol evidence rule as applied in contracts is simply that as a matter of substantive law,a certain act,the act of embodying the complete terms of an agreement in a writing the integration,becomes the contract of the parties extrinsic evidence is excluded because it can not serve to prove what the agreement was,this being determined as a matter of law to be the writing itself.galmish cicchini,ohio,citation omitted.because the parol evidence rule can not be used as a shield to prevent proof of fraud,however,it does not prohibit a party from introducing parol or extrinsic evidence for the purpose of proving fraudulent inducement.id.nonetheless,the parol evidence rule may not be avoided by a fraudulent inducement claim which alleges that the inducement to sign the writing was a promise,the terms of which are directly contradicted by the signed writing.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the parol evidence rule does apply to such promissory fraud if the evidence in question is offered to show a promise which contradicts an integrated written agreement.unless the false promise is either independent of or consistent with the written instrument,evidence thereof is inadmissible.id.at citation omitted see also glazer lehman,cir,cert.denied,d.with this in mind,we turn to micrel claim that it was induced to release its claims by trw implied promise to perform in good faith under the development and supply agreements.
micrel continues to argue that trw falsely inflated the estimated sales volumes.the district court did not err in finding that the estimates themselves were predictions of future facts that could not establish fraud.nor could micrel rely on oral promises to purchase the estimated quantities or assurances that sales volumes would not fall off a cliff with the introduction of the asic.because such promises would contradict the terms of an integrated written agreement,the parol evidence rule precludes reliance on them even to establish promissory fraud.as discussed earlier,the supply agreement made plain that the estimates were only estimates and the purchase of production quantities depended on a number of variables,including conformance to specifications,successful product testing and validation,and the approval of trw customers.even so,as the district court observed,the evidence showed that trw purchases of the asics from national for,and actually met or exceeded the estimated quantities incorporated into the supply agreement 
relatedly,micrel also argued that trw misrepresented the impact that the asic would have on the estimates for the three asics being developed by micrel and supplied by national.it is undisputed that trw informed micrel that the developed and go into new designs and would reduce trw requirements for the current asics.micrel relied on parol evidence to show that trw knew in august,before the agreements were signed,that the asic would substantially reduce the applications for the asics to be developed by micrel.specifically,micrel relies on an internal from early august referencing alternative projections of estimated requirements for the current generation asics.the first chart estimated total requirements for,and of million,while the second chart estimated a total of million on the assumption that the next generation asic would be incorporated into new designs for specific platforms.ronald muckley,identified by micrel as trw top decision maker,responded to the interjecting 
in order to cut short on sic discussion of alternatives.we had to provide micrel with minimum volumes for three years.those included most if not all the current volume planned for national.we will not under any circumstances deviate from those commitments.thank you.
micrel would interpret this as a directive to withhold from micrel the fact that the estimates provided had overstated the projected requirements for micrel asics.muckley testified,however,that it was an internal confirmation that trw would be committed to purchasing the asics consistent with the estimates provided to micrel.the recipients also testified that they understood the response to mean trw would live up to the forecasts and estimates to the best of its ability.the district court did not find that this evidence should be excluded by the parol evidence rule contrary to micrel assertion on appeal,but rather ruled that n ot only is micrel interpretation of this questionable,it is irrelevant because the estimates trw provided to micrel understated the quantity of asics that trw could have purchased from micrel and eventually purchased from national at higher prices.
next,without further explanation,micrel reiterates that it was assured that there were no windows that had to be met.specifically,according to micrel,when the question of windows came up about ten days before the agreements were signed,trw confirmed that there were none and assured micrel that product qualifications would begin as soon as the prototypes were delivered.as the district court aptly explained,however,all understood that there was a development schedule that required testing,validation,and customer approval before the asics could be incorporated into the airbag modules.delays in those steps would necessarily delay production release and would result in missed opportunities to get micrel asics qualified and approved as replacements for those being supplied by national.
in an attack on trw motivations,micrel asserts that trw never intended to perform in good faith under the agreements,but was simply contracting with micrel to extract price concessions from national while pursuing development of the asic with another supplier.micrel offered no direct evidence of this,but argued that it could be inferred from a chronology of the negotiations trw had with national and micrel,respectively.the evidence showed that trw demanded price reductions from its suppliers,including national,and even the agreement with micrel provided for at least three price rollbacks.given that national was trw only supplier for the asics,it is hardly significant that trw was periodically engaged in negotiations with national.
moreover,any inference of promissory fraud is negated by evidence that trw passed the promised cost savings from micrel asics on to its customers,engaged in internal planning to implement a switch to micrel parts,and expressed frustration internally when they missed opportunities for validation of micrel parts.it is also clear that trw had a financial incentive in having micrel succeed and provide asics to go into the airbag modules.in fact,there is no dispute that,at all times,trw paid national higher prices for the asics than trw had agreed to pay micrel for its asics.of course,as the district court observed,whether trw or micrel later breached the development and supply agreements was a separate question from whether trw entered into the agreements without a present intention to develop and purchase its requirements for the asics from micrel.
we find that micrel has failed to present sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude,by clear and convincing evidence,that trw entered into the agreements without a present intention to perform.accordingly,micrel has not demonstrated that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to trw on this claim 
trial error 
at the conclusion of trial,the jury was instructed both on micrel claim that trw breached the development and supply agreements,and on trw counterclaim that it was micrel that breached those same agreements.in seeking a new trial,micrel argued that the verdict in favor of trw was against the weight of the evidence.disagreeing,the district court concluded that overwhelming evidence at trial established that it was micrel,not trw,which breached the agreements.micrel does not appeal from that determination or otherwise contest the finding that it was in breach of its obligations under the development agreement.rather,micrel appeal attacks from several perspectives the award of damages based on the failure to supply production quantities of asics to trw.for the reasons that follow,we find the district court committed no reversible error.
measure of damages 
micrel argues that the district court erred by allowing trw to seek cover damages under the uniform commercial code ucc,or expectancy damages under the common law,which were based almost entirely on the unrealized savings it expected from the use of micrel replacement parts.before discussing whether these damages were available as a matter of law,it should be kept in mind that,although the issue is before us on appeal from the award in favor of trw,micrel also sought to recover expectancy damages equal to the lost profits it would have earned from the sale of production quantities of its asics under the supply agreement.
the district court instructed the jury in connection with both parties claims that if one party proved that the other breached the contracts,that party would be entitled to damages in an amount sufficient to place the party in the same position in which it would have been if the contracts had been fully performed by the other that the jury may not award damages that are remote or speculative and that the jury 
may only award those damages that were the natural and probable result of the breach,or that were reasonably within the contemplation of the parties as the probable result of the breach.this does not require that the breaching party actually be aware of the damages that will result from the breach so long as the damages were reasonably foreseeable at the time the parties entered into the agreements as a probable result of the breach.
with respect to micrel claim,the jury was instructed that micrel sought to recover lost profits and that to award lost profits,you must find that the profits were within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contracts were made and that the loss of profits was the probable result of trw breach the lost profits being,of course,based on the sale of production quantities of the asics under the supply agreement.in addition to the instructions for contract damages,the jury was also instructed on trw claim for cover damages.the district court explained that if micrel breached the parties contracts,and trw made reasonable purchase of substitute parts in good faith and without unreasonable delay,trw is entitled to recover the amounts by which the cost of the substitute parts exceeded the contract price.
in terms of trw proofs,nearly all of trw damage award was based on the differential between what trw paid national and what trw would have paid micrel for the replacement asics from the end of through.the amount of trw request of more than million took into account the extension of the production release dates,interest,and a reduction to present value.in denying the motion for new trial,the district court specifically found that the damage award of more than million was a reasonable number within the range of proof presented by the parties.
expectancy damages 
as the jury was instructed,ohio law provides that damages for a breach of contract are those which are the natural or probable consequence of the breach of contract or damages resulting from the breach that were within the contemplation of both parties at the time of the making of the contract.the toledo group,benton,ohio app d.micrel argues that damages based on the failure to supply the replacement parts were not in the contemplation of the parties,and were not the natural or probable consequence of the breach of obligations under the development agreement.we find that,although the jury was free to find that damages flowing from the failure to supply parts were not contemplated by the parties,the district court did not err in rejecting micrel argument that such damages were unavailable as a matter of law.
the agreements,although separate contracts,were executed concurrently and,by all accounts,with the intention to both develop and supply millions of replacement parts over a period.the development agreement stated at the outset that both parties wanted micrel to complete development of the asics,and that if the asics met the acceptance criteria,trw want ed to buy asics from micrel in production quantities as provided in the asic supply agreement being executed concurrently with this agreement.micrel makes clear that it would not have entered into those agreements unless they contemplated that micrel would supply trw requirements.in fact,the development and supply agreements provided the consideration for the mutual release of claims that each valued at more than twice the amount of damages awarded to trw.
micrel also argues that the development agreement did not incorporate a guarantee that its asics would be acceptable to trw.micrel did,however,expressly warrant that the asics developed during the development process would conform to the specifications and would meet all applicable quality requirements.in its reply brief,micrel relies on the provision in the development agreement that if micrel was unable to manufacture and supply the asics in a manner competitive in terms of quality,delivery,technology,and service,and micrel was unable to correct the deficiencies within months,trw may request that micrel provide to another supplier information for the manufacture and supply of the asics and micrel shall make commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a license with said supplier for any intellectual property rights micrel may hold.emphasis added.this,micrel seems to argue,limited trw remedies to finding a new supplier,but precluded recovery of the difference between micrel agreed prices and national prices.while this was certainly one of trw available remedies,the agreements did not provide that this would be trw exclusive remedy.
relatedly,micrel argues that damages for failure to supply the replacement asics could not be the natural and probable result of micrel breach of its obligations under the development agreement.the essence of this argument seems to be that even without micrel breach,trw could not show that the parts would have passed product qualifications,would have been produced at the agreed lower prices,or would have been approved by trw customers.arguing that it is impossible to know whether the replacement asics would have been acceptable to trw and its customers in terms of performance and price,micrel contends that damages based on the millions of replacement parts the parties anticipated micrel would produce were too speculative.the jury did not think so,and we can not agree with micrel that no reasonable juror could conclude that such damages were the natural and probable result of micrel breach.
finally,micrel argued that its claim for lost profits was not barred because it was trw breach that prevented micrel from performing and caused the failure of at least one condition precedent to its obligations under the supply agreement.in fact,this was the issue for the jury to determine,whether micrel or trw,or both,had breached the obligations under the development agreement.the jury was instructed generally and in connection with both the claim and counterclaim that 
a contract is breached when one party fails or refuses to perform its duties under the contract.
a party is in material breach of contract when it violates a term essential to the purpose of the contract.a material breach by one party excuses the other party from performing its remaining obligations under the agreement.mere nominal,trifling,slight or technical departures from the contract terms are not material breaches so long as they occur in good faith.
good faith means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction.
as part of a contract,parties may agree to a condition,which is to occur before performance under a contract becomes due.this is called a condition precedent.however,no party can insist upon a condition precedent when the nonperformance of the condition has been caused by that party.where a party conduct prevents the occurrence of a condition,that party can not avail itself of that conduct to avoid liability to t
