the district court granted defendant local motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claim under a of the labor management reporting and disclosure act of lmrda,a,their claim for breach of the duty of fair representation,and their state law defamation claims.plaintiffs,now appellants herein,are four members of other local unions under the umbrella of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew who worked as travelers at local.the district court had jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to,and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction under.we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
because we have before us only issues of law,we will set forth only those facts necessary to inform decision on the legal issues.in march,local referred appellants to work for guzzo electric at a project at newark liberty international airport.on june,after experiencing problems with both local and guzzo,appellants and of their fellow travelers working at the project signed a letter addressed to lawrence rossa,the for ibew third district,which encompasses local.in that letter the travelers letter,the thirty men expressed their concerns regarding guzzo late payment of the workers benefit contributions late payments on scheduled pay days and local refusal to provide the workers a copy of the collective bargaining agreement.
rossa received the letter on june,and sent a copy to appellee richard dressel,who,as business manager,was responsible for the daily operation of local,including its hiring hall.dressel responded on june,with an angry letter to the business managers of the local unions where the thirty men were members.in that letter,dressel first threatened that if any of the thirty men who signed the travelers letter quit the guzzo job,they will not be referred again from second,if they do quit,dressel wrote,i will fax their names and card numbers to all my sister locals in new jersey and southern new york and local.third,dressel stated that their actions have now forced me to suspend the referral for all traveling brothers of the ibew for at least a one month period i will not allow this situation to get out of hand whereby a few trouble makers are attempting to have the tail wag the dog.finally,dressel told the business managers,p lease do me a favor.keep your problem members at home and deal with them.these brothers are not welcomed here.attached to this letter was a list of the names and ibew membership numbers of each signatory to the travelers letter.
appellants claim that dressel letter became generally available at their workplace and that they faced hostility from other union members.additionally,they point out that local records show the number of its hiring hall job referrals of travelers dropped off markedly during the month after dressel letter.appellants claim that local and dressel engaged in improper discipline in violation of a of the labor management reporting and disclosure act of lmrda,a,by doing what was threatened in the dressel letter in retaliation for their letter and by blacklisting them.they claim,as well,that they were defamed by the dressel letter.
lmrda a claim 
section a of the lmrda states that n o member of any labor organization may be fined,suspended,expelled,or otherwise disciplined except for nonpayment of dues by such organization or by any officer thereof unless such member has been a served with written specific charges b given a reasonable time to prepare his defense c afforded a full and fair hearing.
a emphasis added.
the district court concluded that dressel and local did not violate a because the act is only implicated by discipline authorized by the union and the dressel letter amounts to no more than a threat of ad hoc retaliation by a union officer who was upset with the manner in which the travelers dealt with their grievances app.we agree.
in breininger sheet metal workers int l ass local union,d,the supreme court defined otherwise disciplined narrowly to encompass only punishment authorized by the union as a collective entity to enforce its rules,and not any act that deter s the exercise of rights protected under the lmrda.the court noted that because otherwise disciplined immediately succeeds an enumerated list of punishments that imply some sort of established disciplinary process,namely,fines,suspension and expulsion congress meant discipline to signify penalties applied by the union in its official capacity rather than ad hoc retaliation by individual union officers.id.at.additionally,the court pointed out that by its terms a provides procedural due process protections such as a full and fair hearing that are intended to safeguard against improper disciplinary action,and that would not apply to instances of unofficial,sub rosa discrimination.id.at.first emphasis added.
the petitioner in breininger claimed that his local violated a because its business manager and business agent refused to refer him for employment due to his political support for one of their rivals.the court held that he had failed to allege acts by the union amounting to discipline since he was not punished by any tribunal,nor was he the subject of any proceedings convened by the union.id.at.instead,he only claimed to be the victim of the personal vendettas of two union officers,and,thus,a was not implicated.id.
we do not imply that discipline may be defined solely by the type of punishment involved,or that a union might be able to circumvent a by developing novel forms of penalties different from fines suspensions,or expulsions.even respondent acknowledges that a suspension of job referrals through the hiring hall could qualify as discipline if it were imposed as a sentence on an individual by a union in order to punish a violation of union rules.
we applied this distinction in brenner local,united of carpenters joiners,cir.in brenner,plaintiffs filed a lmrda claim against their union,their local,and the local business agent,alleging that the business agent,who administered the local hiring hall,disciplined them by failing to refer them for employment in retaliation for their political opposition to the agent and his allies in the union.we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment,holding that,as in breininger,the plaintiffs had failed to allege acts by the union acting in its official capacity and instead raised only ad hoc retaliations by the individual union official.id.at.
although there can be a fine line between discipline and non discipline,we are not without guidance in this area.first,the suspension of job referrals by a hiring hall can qualify as discipline,just as can a fine,suspension or expulsion.breininger,at.second,the purpose of discipline must be to enforce the union rules,id.at,or to punish a violation of union rules,as opposed to engaging in ad hoc retaliation,id.at,motivated by personal vendettas such as a business agent anger over a member political views.id.at.third,the punishment must be authorized by the union,id.at,or carried out by the union in its official capacity,id.at,through some sort of established disciplinary process,id.at,such as being the subject of a tribunal or of proceedings conducted by the union.id.at.
here,appellants assert types of punishment that could be considered discipline within the meaning of the act,namely that dressel and local suspended their job referrals and blacklisted them.there is no indication in the record,however,that dressel actions had the purpose of enforcing the union rules,or of punishing a violation of those rules.there is no union rule that the travelers letter violated in fact,airing their dissatisfaction with local was an exercise of appellants right to express any views,arguments,or opinions under a.app.appellants acknowledge that the letter was not a formal complaint,but merely a request for assistance to rossa.retaliating against the authors of an informal complaint letter is not the enforcement of union rules.
even assuming that dressel did everything he threatened to do in the june,letter,these acts did not rise to the level of formality the supreme court has required for the
