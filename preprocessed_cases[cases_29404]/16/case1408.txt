on june,a shipment of aluminum that had travelled by sea from petersburg,russia,arrived at the port of baltimore,maryland.the carrier,the owner of the ship asserted a maritime lien against the cargo,and it subsequently filed in rem and in personam claims in the district of maryland,seeking to recover unpaid freight.the shippers,the owners of the cargo,in turn,filed a counterclaim contesting the lien and seeking damages.the district court granted the carrier motions for summary judgment.the shippers have appealed,and as explained below,we affirm.
intamex,and amalco,intamex and amalco or the shippers,are international metal traders.both are incorporated in switzerland and both are engaged primarily in the purchase and sale of aluminum.in the spring of,intamex and amalco bought aluminum in russia for sale to american buyers.in order to have the aluminum transported to the united states,they booked ocean carriage aboard the anangel fidelity the fidelity,a vessel owned by hawkspere shipping company,limited hawkspere,a bahamian corporation.
rather than contact hawkspere directly to book passage for the aluminum,intamex and amalco instead made the arrangements for ocean carriage through international commodities transport services icts,an alabama corporation.icts is a cargo consolidator it packages shipments bound for a common destination and charters a vessel to carry the cargo on behalf of various shippers.in the past,intamex and amalco had arranged several shipments using icts,either directly or through their russian agent,international transportation logistics itl.generally,intamex and amalco would remit payment for the ocean freight charges to icts in athens,alabama.icts would then deduct its commissions and forward the balance to the carrier.there were occasions,however,when intamex paid the ocean freight directly to the carrier,rather than by way of icts.it is undisputed that both intamex and amalco were aware that icts did not use its own vessels for shipping,and that it instead brokered the services of other companies.
on april,icts,as charterer,entered into a voyage charterparty with hawkspere,as owner,for the services of one of hawkspere ships,the fidelity.a voyage charterparty is simply a contract for the hire of a ship.see william tetley,marine cargo claims ed.the charterparty form employed in this instance was drafted in new york by the attorneys for icts,and it had been used in each of the approximately eight other charterparties that icts and hawkspere had executed.in each instance,the form was modified with different details and rider terms,depending on the nature of the particular shipment.the terms of the charterparty for this shipment were negotiated through a houston company,argosy shipping,and the charter was fixed,or made,in the united states.in addition to consolidating the cargo of intamex and amalco for the petersburg to baltimore voyage,icts also arranged for hawkspere fidelity to carry cargo belonging to two other shippers.
upon the loading of intamex and amalco aluminum on board the fidelity,hawkspere petersburg agent issued ocean bills of lading for the cargo on forms to intamex and amalco,as shippers.a bill of lading is a contract for the carriage of goods by sea.see tetley,marine cargo claims ed the last of the bills of lading was issued on may,and all of the bills were immediately sent to intamex and amalco.once intamex and amalco received the bills of lading,they were aware that the carrier of their cargo was hawkspere.both intamex and amalco were also aware,prior to the shipment at issue,that payment of the ocean freight charges would ultimately have to be made to hawkspere,the carrier of their cargo.
icts played no role in the preparation of the bills of lading,as the bills involved only hawkspere,as carrier,and intamex and amalco,as shippers.conversely,intamex and amalco were in no way involved with the charterparty.in fact,prior to the initiation of this admiralty proceeding,neither intamex nor amalco ever saw a copy of the charterparty,nor were they otherwise aware of its terms.moreover,neither shipper had any communication whatsoever with hawkspere prior to the june arrival of their cargo in baltimore.
on the fidelity voyage from petersburg to baltimore,intamex shipped metric tons of cargo,while amalco shipped metric tons.the shippers admit that,as a result of this shipment,intamex owed hawkspere in ocean freight,and amalco owed,for a total of.on may,hawkspere sent its invoice to icts for all the cargo carried on the fidelity.icts,in turn,billed itl intamex and amalco russian agent for their cargoes at a rate that included not only the ocean freight of per metric ton,but also stevedoring charges and icts commissions on the cargoes.itl then billed intamex and amalco,instructing them to remit the bulk of their payments directly to icts bank in athens,alabama,but also to wire to itl russian bank,apparently in payment of itl commission.
instead of paying hawkspere directly for the ocean freight that they owed,which intamex has admitted was an option,intamex and amalco claim to have paid their ocean freight in full to icts.hawkspere,though,never received payment.according to the bills of lading,the ocean freight for the cargo was to have been paid four business days after signature on the bills of lading covering the cargo the only monies that icts ever paid to hawkspere in connection with the fidelity voyage was a wire transfer of made on may,and that wire transfer did not indicate whose ocean freight intamex,amalco,or the two other shippers whose cargos were also consolidated on the fidelity was being paid.in order to avoid a dispute of material fact on the issue of the sum that the shippers still owed,hawkspere stipulated to a credit against the total freight charges.it is therefore undisputed that hawkspere never received ocean freight due for carriage of intamex and amalco cargo in the sum of.
the cargo of all shippers was discharged from the fidelity on or about june,at which time hawkspere exercised its possessory maritime lien against the cargo shipped by intamex and amalco on that vessel after several weeks of negotiations between counsel for hawkspere and counsel for intamex and amalco,an agreement was reached whereunder hawkspere would arrest the cargo shipped by intamex and amalco under bills of lading numbers and the cargo,and would release the remaining goods together,those two bills covered goods specifically,bundles of secondary aluminum and pieces of aluminum alloy sows whose value roughly equaled the amount of hawkspere claim against intamex and amalco for unpaid ocean freight.
on july,hawkspere sued in admiralty and obtained a warrant to arrest the cargo,in rem,pursuant to supplemental admiralty and maritime claims rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure supplemental admiralty rule c.the united states marshal carried out the arrest.on august,intamex and amalco executed a letter of security,pursuant to which they placed the sum of into the registry of the court,and the court released the cargo from arrest.on september,intamex and amalco filed their verified answer and claim to the cargo,as well as a counterclaim against hawkspere for wrongful arrest.on november,intamex and amalco brought a third party complaint against the cargo consolidator,icts,and its principal,tony gilbert.
on march,after discovery,hawkspere moved for leave to amend its complaint to add intamex and amalco as in personam defendants for breach of contract of carriage totaling,and to increase to the damages claimed in rem against the cargo on march,hawkspere moved for partial summary judgment against the cargo in rem under its original complaint and for summary judgment against intamex and amalco on their counterclaim.on april,intamex and amalco filed a for summary judgment on the original complaint and for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim.in their,intamex and amalco alleged for the first time that they were not the owners of the cargo at the time of the arrest.
on may,the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting hawkspere motion for leave to amend granting hawkspere motion for partial summary judgment on its original complaint against the cargo,in rem,in the sum of plus interest granting hawkspere motion for summary judgment on intamex and amalco counterclaim denying intamex and amalco for summary judgment and denying intamex and amalco motion for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim.hawkspere shipping bundles of secondary aluminum,mem.op.order,civ.no.s.may,the opinion.
on may,hawkspere filed its first amended complaint,adding intamex and amalco as in personam defendants.intamex and amalco answered the amended complaint on june,and added another though virtually identical counterclaim against hawkspere.on august,hawkspere moved for summary judgment on its amended complaint against the cargo in rem and against intamex and amalco in personam,and also moved to strike intamex and amalco new counterclaim.on september,intamex and amalco filed a for summary judgment on the amended complaint and a motion for partial summary judgment on their new counterclaim.
on october,the district court issued a memorandum opinion in which it both reiterated the findings contained in its may,opinion,and determined that intamex and amalco were liable to hawkspere in personam for the unpaid ocean freight.accordingly,the court entered an order granting hawkspere summary judgment on the amended complaint in the sum of granting hawkspere motion to strike intamex and amalco new counterclaim denying intamex and amalco for summary judgment on the amended complaint and denying intamex and amalco motion for partial summary judgment on their new counterclaim.hawkspere shipping bundles of secondary aluminum,mem.op.order,civ.no.s.
on october,intamex and amalco moved to alter or amend the court october,order,asking that prejudgment interest be set at the rate of,that separate judgments be entered against intamex and amalco,and that default judgments be entered against icts and tony gilbert on the complaint.on october,the court issued an order superseding that of october.in its order of october,the court entered judgment in hawkspere favor on its in rem claim in the sum of,plus prejudgment interest of.judgment was also entered in hawkspere favor on its in personam claims against intamex,in the sum of,and against amalco,in the sum of,both with prejudgment interest.hawkspere shipping bundles of secondary aluminum,mem.op.order,civ.no.s.
on december,the court entered its final order,including judgment in favor of intamex and amalco on their third party claims against icts and tony gilbert.intamex and amalco filed a timely notice of appeal on january,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review an award of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the.spriggs diamond auto glass,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact given the parties burdens of proof at trial.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.there is a material dispute of fact when the fact existence or could lead a jury to different outcomes.anderson,at.
appellants intamex and amalco contend that the district court erred in four primary respects first,they assert that the law of england,and not that of the united states,governs this dispute.on this point rest the shippers subsidiary contentions that the district court erred both in deciding that hawkspere had a right of arrest in rem,and in dismissing intamex and amalco wrongful arrest counterclaim.second,intamex and amalco contend that the court overlooked disputes of material fact regarding icts ostensible agency for receipt of ocean freight payments on hawkspere behalf.third,intamex and amalco maintain that the court erred in deciding that they were estopped from proving that all cargo had been sold before arrest.fourth,and finally,intamex and amalco assert that the court wrongly held them liable,in personam,to hawkspere,when the charterparty provided only for direct payments to hawkspere by icts.
addressing each in turn,the first question before us is whether the district court erred in ruling that this controversy is governed by the law of the united states.we hold that the court properly applied the law of this country,and thus that it also was correct both in deciding that hawkspere had a right of arrest in rem,and in dismissing intamex and amalco wrongful arrest counterclaim.
intamex and amalco contend that english law governs hawkspere rights with respect to the recovery of unpaid ocean freight,and that,pursuant to english law,there exists no right to assert a maritime lien against cargo,in rem,for unpaid freight.thus,they maintain,because supplemental admiralty rule c authorizes in rem actions only t o enforce any maritime lien.supp.c a,hawkspere wrongfully arrested their cargo and is limited to seeking an in personam remedy.see interocean shipping lygaria,claims otherwise maritime in nature,but not giving rise to a maritime lien,must be pursued in personam.hawkspere,by contrast,insists that this dispute is governed by united states law,under which it is not limited to an in personam remedy,but which instead entitles it to seize cargo to secure payment.see the bird of paradise,wall.hawkspere contends that,under united states law,it was entitled to arrest the cargo.
intamex and amalco maintain that english law applies because the charterparty between hawkspere and icts contained a law and arbitration clause,which provided that the charterparty itself was to be governed by and construed in accordance with english law.hawkspere response is first,it contends that the clause in the charterparty is inapplicable since a the charterparty is a contract to which intamex and amalco are not parties,and b the charterparty terms were not successfully incorporated into the bills of lading.second,hawkspere maintains that,even if successfully incorporated,the charterparty choice of law provisions are ambiguous.either way,hawkspere contends,there is no valid contractual choice of law,and the applicable analysis is that set forth in lauritzen larsen.under lauritzen,according to hawkspere,united states law governs.
w here the parties specify in their contractual agreement which law will apply,admiralty courts will generally give effect to that choice.chan soc y expeditions,cir enforcing clause in marine passenger ticket.in the absence of a contractual clause,federal courts sitting in admiralty apply federal maritime principles derived from the supreme court decision in lauritzen and its progeny.see sundance cruises v.the am.bureau of shipping,cir see also the bremen zapata,d holding that courts should enforce a clause when it is part of a freely negotiated private international agreement richards lloyd of london,cir same.
the contractual agreement at issue here is that contained in the bills of contracts between carrier hawkspere and shippers intamex and amalco for carriage of goods.while the bills themselves contain no clause,they do purport to incorporate a ll terms and conditions,liberties and exceptions of the charterparty the contract between carrier hawkspere and cargo consolidator icts for hire of a ship.and the charterparty,in turn,states that it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with english law.
quoting the provisions of the charterparty,intamex and amalco contend that english,not united states,law governs the charterparty between hawkspere and icts,they insist,was effectively incorporated into the bills of lading between hawkspere and themselves.as hawkspere notes,though,the incorporation is imperfect,in that while the bills of lading state that they are to be used with,the spaces provided for insertion of the date of the governing charterparty are left blank.hawkspere contends that,absent specific identification of the charterparty,its terms are not effectively incorporated into the bills of lading.
courts consistently hold that attempts to incorporate a charterparty into a bill of lading are ineffective when the spaces in the bill that would have identified the charterparty are left blank see benedict on admiralty at ed citing cases.decisions in which courts have found a proper incorporation are those in which the charterparty was identified in the bill of lading,at the least,by date.see,steel warehouse,at.identification is particularly important when,as here,there are multiple charter agreements between the same parties simultaneously.see id.in this case,the date of the charterparty was not included in the bills of lading.in fact,the bills contained no reference whatsoever to the relevant,april,charterparty,and intamex and amalco were provided no effective notice of the charterparty terms.under the circumstances,we can not say that there was a successful incorporation of that document terms.thus,we agree with hawkspere that the charterparty can not resolve for us the question of whether the law of england or that of the united states governs this dispute.
lacking a valid contractual choice of law,we turn to the analysis provided by the supreme court in lauritzen larsen.see cardinal shipping seisho maru,cir applying lauritzen principles in context of contractually derived maritime lien.under lauritzen,a court must consider seven factors in determining the governing law for a particular dispute the place of the wrongful act,if any the law of the flag the domicile of the plaintiff the domicile of the shipowner the place of the contract the inaccessibility of a foreign forum and the law of the forum.at.one of the causes of action asserted by intamex and amalco is wrongful arrest of the cargo and the arrest of the cargo clearly occurred in the united states.the law of the flag is unknown and not part of the record.the domicile of the plaintiffs,intamex and amalco,is switzerland.the domicile of the shipowner,hawkspere,is the bahamas.the place of contracting is russia,where the bills of lading were signed.and the forum is in the united states,which has the advantage of convenience at least to hawkspere.given,as well,that icts is an american corporation that the charterparty was drafted in new york and negotiated through a broker in houston that the goods were shipped to and seized in baltimore that intamex and amalco had substantial and ongoing ties with the united states and that the only contact with england is a clause in a charterparty that simultaneously attempts by way of its usa paramount provision to select the law of the united states,the district court did not err in holding that the united states has a stronger connection to this dispute than any other country,and that its law governs.
under united states law,a maritime lien arises for freight due from the cargo owner,the bird of paradise,at,and,as intamex and amalco concede,united states law permits an action in rem t o enforce any maritime lien,supp.c a.because the district court correctly concluded that this dispute is governed by the law of the united states,it follows that it was also correct in holding both that hawkspere had a right of arrest in rem,and in dismissing intamex and amalco wrongful arrest counterclaim.
intamex and amalco next assert that the district court overlooked substantial disputes of material fact concerning icts status as hawkspere ostensible or apparent agent.they principally contend that,under english law which they insist governs the case,icts was hawkspere ostensible agent because hawkspere always looked to icts to collect payment for it.appellants br.at.according to intamex and amalco,they each reasonably believed that icts was acting for hawkspere and relied on that.id.at.unlike united states law,which emphasizes the principal overt and direct representations in cases of apparent authority,english law,they assert,looks at the course of dealing,and the position in which the principal has placed the agent,asking generally,which party was in the better position of preventing the loss.appellants br.at.under this standard,they maintain,icts should be viewed as hawkspere agent,and the shippers payment to icts should discharge their obligation to pay hawkspere.
the district court rejected this ostensible agency argument on the ground that it was maintainable only under english law,which did not apply.opinion at.the court held that the applicable united states rule was that,where a shipper chooses to pay a cargo consolidator who does not remit the payment to the ocean carrier,the shipper assumes the risk that the consolidator might not pay the freight to the carrier,and the shipper duty to pay freight is not discharged,absent evidence that the consolidator was acting as the agent of the carrier.id.at.the court then noted that agency can be established,under united states law,only by evidence of overt acts on the part of the principal that would indicate an agency relationship the subjective beliefs of the persons dealing with the alleged agent are thus irrelevant to the inquiry.id.at.applying this rule of agency,the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact regarding whether icts was acting as hawkspere agent when it accepted payment from intamex and amalco.id.at.
as the district court properly recognized,were icts the agent of hawkspere,then intamex and amalco remission of payment to icts would relieve them of liability under the bills of lading.see strachan shipping dresser,cir.the court,however,concluded that intamex and amalco had failed to proffer the requisite overt acts on the part of the purported principal,hawkspere,that would indicate an agency relationship.we agree.
intamex and amalco,as the parties asserting the existence of a relationship between hawkspere and icts,have the burden of proof on this issue.see mclean contracting waterman,cir.since it appears to be undisputed that icts never had actual authority to act as hawkspere collection agent,intamex and amalco are presumably contending that we should construe icts relationship with hawkspere as one of apparent agency.to prove apparent agency,they would need to show that hawkspere held out icts as authorized to act on its behalf.see crothers commodity futures trading,cir.
the evidence of agency that the shippers proffer is thin,to say the least.intamex and amalco first note that hawkspere always looked to icts to collect payment for it.appellants br.at.that hawkspere did so,though,demonstrates nothing more remarkable than the fact that the fielding of payments was one of the services that icts chose to provide to the shippers for whom it consolidated.its provision of that service in no way indicates that it was acting as hawkspere collection agent.see strachan shipping,at refusing to infer agency from fact that carrier initially directed its collection efforts to cargo consolidator.the shippers next point out that they both presented unrefuted testimony,that each reasonably believed that icts was acting for hawkspere and relied on that.appellants br.at.under united states law,however,the shippers subjective beliefs are irrelevant to the inquiry only evidence of hawkspere conduct can prove agency.see overnite transp.nlrb,holding that agency is provable only by principal conduct,and not by subjective beliefs of those dealing with alleged agent auvil grafton homes,cir an agent authority must be conferred by some manifestation by the principal that the agent is authorized to act on the principal behalf.emphasis in original.finally,intamex and amalco observe that the evidence indicated that hawkspere paid icts no commission on the freight that icts collected for hawkspere.appellants br.at.this fact,though,cuts directly against agency,since it indicates that hawkspere and icts lacked any formal relationship at all.on this record,the court was correct to conclude that there was no triable issue of fact as to whether icts acted as an actual or apparent agent for hawkspere when it accepted payment from intamex and amalco.
given that icts was not hawkspere agent,it remains only to be determined whether there exists any other basis on which the shippers might be excused from their liability to pay hawkspere the freight that is due under the bills of lading.in this respect,it is worth noting that no party to this dispute has done other than what it was expected to do hawkspere carried the goods,and intamex and amalco tendered payment of freight.the trouble arises from the fact that the shippers sent their payments not to hawkspere directly,but rather by way of the consolidator,icts,who apparently then failed to forward the money on to its intended destination.thus,the question should intamex and amalco have to pay twice,or should hawkspere instead receive no payment at all 
there exists a split among the circuits on the question of which party,the shipper or the carrier,bears the risk that the cargo consolidator might,as here,fail to forward the freight payment to the carrier.under the assumption of risk view taken by the district shipper remains liable to a carrier,regardless of the shipper payment to a cargo consolidator like icts,unless the carrier intentionally released the shipper from its duty to pay under the bill of lading.see shipping of saudi arabia omni lines,cir adopting rule of liability for shippers,such that unless the carrier intends to release the shipper from its duty to pay under the bill of lading,the shipper remains liable to the carrier,irrespective of the shipper payment to a cargo consolidator strachan shipping,at holding that shipper is relieved of liability only if it can demonstrate that carrier actually released it serv.amstar.taking this approach,only if the carrier has released the shipper from liability under the bills of lading is the shipper discharged from his duty to pay the carrier by remitting payment to the consolidator otherwise,the shipper,by choosing not to pay the carrier directly,assumes the risk that the consolidator might fail to forward the freight payment on to the carrier.
under an alternative,equitable estoppel view,when a shipper pays freight to a consolidator and the consolidator subsequently fails to forward the payment on to the carrier,the shipper does not remain liable to the carrier,so long as the circumstances indicate that the carrier led the shipper to believe that payment to the cargo consolidator would discharge the debt see olson distrib.glasurit,cir holding doctrine of equitable estoppel barred carrier claim against shipper for payment of freight bills,after carrier documents and dilatory conduct led shipper to believe that carrier was receiving freight payments from cargo consolidator inman freight,olin,cir holding that carrier may be estopped from collecting freight charges from shipper who paid freight to consolidator in reliance on carrier representation that such payment would discharge shipper bill of lading obligation mediterranean shipping elof hansson,holding that carrier is estopped from collecting freight charges from shipper when shipper had paid consolidator in reliance on carrier misrepresentation that it had already received its payment from consolidator,and shipper would thus otherwise be unjustifiably liable for double payment.thus,under the approach taken by the sixth and eighth circuits,a shipper need not demonstrate that the carrier actually released it from its duty of payment in order to escape liability rather,the shipper needs merely to show that the carrier actions would have led a reasonable shipper in his position to believe itself to be released.
this issue appears to be one of first impression in this circuit,and we here adopt the assumption of risk approach.shippers such as intamex and amalco can always avoid the loss by simply paying their carrier directly.when,as here,they choose not to do so,it is they who appropriately bear the risk that such a choice creates.as the eleventh circuit explained,the bill of lading is a contract between the shipper and the carrier and the carrier has a contractual right to expect payment pursuant to that bill.should the shipper wish to avoid liability for double payment,it must take precaution to deal with a reputable cargo consolidator or contract with the carrier to secure its release.shipping,at.the eleventh circuit also quoted with approval the reasoning of the fifth circuit 
w e think that our result comports with economic reality.a cargo consolidator provides a service.he sells his expertise and experience in booking and preparing cargo for shipment.he depends upon the fees paid by both shipper and carrier.he has few assets,and he books amounts of cargo far exceeding his net worth.carriers must expect payment will come from the shipper,although it may pass through the forwarder hands.while the carrier may extend credit to the forwarder,there is no economically rational motive for the carrier to release the shipper.the more parties that are liable,the greater the assurance for the carrier that he will be paid.
id.quoting strachan shipping,at.we find this reasoning persuasive and conclude that,where a shipper chooses to remit payment by way of a cargo consolidator,rather than directly to the ocean carrier,the shipper assumes the risk that the consolidator might not forward the freight payment to the carrier.the shipper duty to pay freight is not discharged,absent evidence that the carrier has actually released the shipper from its duty to pay under the bill of lading.because intamex and amalco have offered no evidence that hawkspere in fact released them from liability,the district court was correct to hold the shippers remained liable for the ocean freight charges.
shippers intamex and amalco next contend that the district court erred in applying equitable estoppel to bar them from denying ownership of the cargo.the shippers asserted below that,even if united states law applies,there was no valid maritime lien,since they had sold the cargo before hawkspere lien attached.the court rejected this contention,holding that the shippers were estopped from denying ownership,since they had previously claimed the cargo.accordingly,the court denied both the shippers for summary judgment on hawkspere in rem claims,and their motion for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim for wrongful arrest.
the shippers contend that the court erred in failing to make a specific finding that hawkspere relied to its detriment on any misrepresentation by intamex and amalco as to the ownership of the cargo.see carneiro da cunha standard fire ins,cir stating that detrimental reliance on misrepresentation is required element of equitable estoppel under federal common law marine transp.servs.python high performance marine,cir same,and noting that federal common law of estoppel applies in cases arising under admiralty jurisdiction.they assert that it was hawkspere obligation to inquire into the ownership of the cargo before asserting its lien,rather than intamex and amalco obligation to disclose their lack of ownership.appellants br.at.
hawkspere responds that it was the obligation of the shippers to disclose their alleged.hawkspere claims that it relied to its detriment on the shippers de facto misrepresentation of ownership in litigation strategy and discovery,when it proceeded on the assumption that there was no issue regarding ownership.intamex and amalco,hawkspere contends,engaged in misconduct when they failed to disclose their lack of ownership,and they should not be permitted to benefit from that misconduct.
under the doctrine of equitable estoppel,a party is precluded from asserting rights he otherwise would have had against another when his own conduct renders assertion of those rights contrary to equity.int l paper schwabedissen maschinen,cir.here,hawkspere asserted its possessory maritime lien on june,and it obtained a warrant for the cargo arrest on july.until they filed their for summary judgment on april,intamex and amalco failed to disclose that the cargo carried under bills of lading and allegedly was sold to third parties prior to the notice of lien.by that point,they had bypassed multiple opportunities to inform hawkspere and,later,the court of the purported change in ownership,including in response to hawkspere june written notice of the claimed lien during their several weeks of negotiation with hawkspere over which cargo would be arrested in a judicial proceeding that they could have requested but did not request under supplemental admiralty rule e to contest the validity of the arrest in their september answer,counterclaim,and claim to the cargo and throughout the extended discovery p
