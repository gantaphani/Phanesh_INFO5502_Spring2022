before this court is a dispute between an airline company and a pilots association arising from an arbitration board hearing and the subsequent appeal to the district court.while judicial review of an arbitration board determination is admittedly confined,this controversy is one of the unwonted cases in which overturning an arbitrator award is proper.as such,we affirm the judgment of the district court,which vacated the arbitrator award.
the issues in this appeal concern a collective bargaining agreement cba or agreement entered into in september by american eagle airlines,american eagle,and air line pilots association,international alpa to govern the working conditions of pilots employed at american eagle.included within the agreement were provisions dictating the conditions for which a pilot may be terminated as well as the procedures to be followed by american eagle to secure a termination.the cba permits american eagle to terminate pilots only for just cause,a term the agreement fails to define.
section of the cba elucidates the grievance process by which an employee may challenge his termination.a pilot must request initiation of the grievance process within days of receiving written notice of the charges against him,or the employment decision of american eagle becomes final.if the process is timely invoked,a first step hearing will be held at the pilot domicile within days of the date written request is received by american eagle.within days of the hearing,american eagle must issue an opinion on the matter.if the decision is unsatisfactory to the pilot,he may appeal within days by furnishing written notice to the system board the board,which serves as a neutral arbitrator under the contract.
section g then notes 
if american eagle fails to provide a written decision to the pilot or hold a required hearing within the time limits specified,the pilot and the association may consider the grievance denied.
section then details the duties and functions of the board.composed of three members,the board has jurisdiction over grievances filed pursuant to the terms of this agreement.the cba also protects the board right to act in an independent manner without consequences for its relationship to american eagle or alpa.
on november,captain terry balser,an american eagle pilot,struck up a discussion with boris walckhoff,a cleaning and catering employee of american eagle,on board the aircraft balser piloted at the los angeles international airport.over the course of the conversation,balser discussed the ongoing war in chechnya,and questioned why walckhoff,an immigrant of african,russian,and german decent,was not fighting in it.balser then displayed a medal with a reverse swastika on it and mentioned his displeasure that government money was being spent on and latinos.walckhoff felt intimidated by this conversation and filed a complaint with american eagle.
in response to walckhoff complaint,american eagle conducted an investigation of balser,which included holding two investigative meetings in november.these meetings revealed that balser regularly carried a dirk with a three and blade into secure areas of the airport,as well as on board the aircraft he flew.captain balser also admitted to having nodded off at times while on the clock.
on november,american eagle issued a notice of termination to balser,advising him that he was being discharged for harassing walckhoff,failing to observe security regulations regarding weapons in secure areas,violating california penal law and federal aviation administration regulations by bringing weapons on board an aircraft,and violating company policy against sleeping on board an aircraft.on december,days after receiving the notice of termination,alpa grievance chair mark taylor wrote to american eagle informing it of balser intention to invoke the grievance procedures outlined in the cba.taylor again wrote american eagle on february,noting that american eagle had not scheduled a hearing.the letter referenced a conversation with los angeles chief pilot janette mcmurtrie on january,in which mcmurtrie indicated her desire to forego the hearing,and told balser and alpa to treat the grievance as denied by american eagle.the matter was then submitted to the board by alpa.
after arguments were presented,the board made several determinations.first,the board found that american eagle failure to schedule the hearing constituted a breach of the cba,despite the language contained in section g,which states that failure to schedule a hearing may be considered tantamount to a denied grievance.second,the board found that balser seriously violated the cba.specifically,the board noted that substantial evidence supported american eagle contention that balser had harassed walckhoff and that such conduct was abhorrent,finding that the employer had not only a right,but a duty to rid the workplace of such conduct.the board also concluded that balser had violated american eagle security rules and california law by bringing his dirk on board his aircraft and into secure areas of the airport.the board found insufficient evidence to support a finding that balser had slept while his plane was airborne.the board,however,concluded that american eagle had not only a right,but a duty to rid itself of balser behavior.finally,the board concluded that because both balser and american eagle had seriously violated the agreement,both sides deserved a substantial penalty.accordingly,the board imposed a unpaid suspension on balser and ordered his reinstatement with back pay due for the remaining period in which balser was suspended.
american eagle appealed the board decision to the united states district court for the northern district of texas,pursuant to the railway labor act,arguing in its motion for summary judgment that the board decision i failed to conform to the terms of the cba,ii was beyond the jurisdiction of the board,and iii violated public policy.the district court determined that implicit within the board opinion was a finding that balser was fired for just cause.once such a determination was made,the district court reasoned,the board lacked further authority to fashion an alternate remedy based on american eagle alleged procedural shortcoming of not holding the hearing.accordingly,the district court vacated the board arbitration award,holding that the board should have upheld balser termination.the district court rejected alpa argument that the board had not found just cause for balser termination because american eagle did not meet the procedural requirements of the cba,stating that alpa introduced no authority for the proposition that such requirements could be considered in arriving at the just cause determination.the district court,however,did reject american eagle argument that the arbitration award violated public policy.shortly thereafter,alpa filed a timely notice of appeal and american eagle on the public policy issue.

judicial review of a decision by this court,or by the district court,is extremely limited.where the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority the fact that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn that decision.eastern associated coal united mine workers of america,d internal quotations omitted.thus,if there is ambiguity as to whether an arbitrator is acting within the scope of his authority,that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the arbitrator,as the mere inference of ultra vires action is an insufficient reason for refusing to enforce the award.united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel car,d.

the two predominant questions presented in this appeal are i whether the district court properly determined that the board found that balser conduct constituted just cause for his termination and ii whether the arbitrator exceeded its jurisdiction by improperly interpreting the terms of the cba,specifically whether the board erred in determining that american eagle failure to provide balser with a hearing constituted a serious violation of the agreement and warranted voiding balser termination.as the board determined that any violation of american eagle rules and policies committed by balser was mitigated by american eagle failure to grant him a hearing,the two issues are inextricably linked and it is therefore appropriate to discuss them together.
we begin our analysis by addressing whether american eagle failure to provide a hearing constituted a violation of the cba.in doing so,we consider the relevant language of the agreement.section c of the cba provides that a first step hearing will be held at the pilot domicile within fourteen days of the date written request is received by american eagle.it is undisputed that this hearing never took place.section g provides further that if american eagle fails to hold a required hearing,including,inter alia,a hearing,the pilot may consider the grievance denied.section of the cba then provides for establishing the board for the purpose of adjusting disputes or grievances arising under the agreement.the board determined that by failing to schedule the hearing,american eagle breached the cba.american eagle disagrees with this assessment,arguing that although it did not provide the hearing,it did not breach the cba because alpa chose to treat the failure to hold the hearing as a denied grievance when it submitted the matter to arbitration.
although we are not unmindful of the high degree of deference the federal courts generally afford arbitrators,see,eastern associated coal,at,an arbitrator may not ignore the plain language of a collective bargaining agreement.misco,at.and,the clear language of the cba precludes determining that american eagle failure to schedule a hearing is a procedural default if alpa chooses to treat such failure as a denied grievance and proceed to arbitration.put differently,although the agreement specifically provides for a hearing when a pilot files a grievance,section g establishes that the failure to conduct such a hearing should be treated no differently than a hearing at which the pilot plea for relief is unsuccessful,provided that the pilot chooses to treat the lack of the hearing as a denied grievance and proceed to arbitration.
here,alpa and balser did choose to treat american eagle failure to provide a hearing as a denied grievance and elected to proceed to arbitration when american eagle failed to provide the hearing,alpa did not insist that such a hearing be held.rather,alpa elected to arbitrate,thereby treating the lack of the hearing as a denied grievance.furthermore,while alpa argued before the arbitrator that the lack of the hearing denied balser due process,it was never asserted that the appropriate remedy for such an alleged violation would be to compel american eagle to conduct the hearing.alpa grieved the termination,not the hearing,the absence of which alpa treated as a denial allowing it to proceed to arbitration.by invoking arbitration,alpa implicitly considered the grievance denied and waived any other alternative it may have had concerning american eagle failure timely to conduct a hearing.this comports with the district court interpretation of the cba specifically,that if a hearing does not occur and alpa invokes arbitration,it has considered the grievance denied within the meaning of section g and has waived any claim it might have had based on american eagle putative procedural default.accordingly,american eagle has committed no default of the cba.
having determined that american eagle failure to schedule a hearing did not constitute a procedural default of the,even if it could have,that such a default was cured by waiver when alpa proceeded to invoke is now necessary to determine whether there was just cause to terminate balser.while the board never used the phrase just cause,it did hold that balser conduct was egregious and,therefore,must be removed from the workplace citing dupont,the district court held that the board implicitly found just cause for balser termination.at holding that just cause for termination may determined implicitly by an arbitrator.once just cause existed,the district court reasoned,there was no jurisdiction for the board to permit any outcome other than balser termination,even if a procedural default occurred.in support of this conclusion,the district court noted that the cba required only just cause for dismissal,rather than just cause plus scheduling a hearing.
not surprisingly,the parties maintain disparate views regarding the determination of the district court.american eagle agrees with the district court assessment that the board implicitly found just cause and then exceeded its jurisdiction by improperly considering the lack of the hearing so as to save balser job.on the other hand,alpa denies that the board ever found just cause for balser termination.furthermore,alpa asserts that the failure to schedule the hearing was a component used to determine whether just cause for termination existed at all.if a supposed procedural,the lack of the precludes a finding of just cause,alpa argues,there is no ground for balser termination.thus,while american eagle argues that the board did find just cause but did not uphold balser termination because of the supposed procedural default,alpa believes that the board never found just cause,in part because of the lack of the initial hearing.we now address these competing theories,analyzing them in light of our determination that american eagle failure to schedule the hearing did not constitute a procedural default of the cba.
at issue,then,is whether the board could properly consider any supposed procedural violation by american eagle in its just cause analysis and,alternatively,whether an alleged procedural failing could prevent termination of an employee who had already been discharged for just cause.first,as noted,supra,american eagle committed no procedural violation of the cba.this reason alone is sufficient to conclude that the board erred if it considered such conduct either in its just cause calculus or to mitigate a finding of just cause.
second,and alternatively,even if the failure to hold the hearing were a procedural default,it would be improper to consider this failure in the just cause analysis or to prevent the termination of an employee who had already been discharged for just cause.indeed,the procedural violation alleged by,failure to conduct a after balser committed the acts cited by american eagle and the district court as constituting grounds for termination,and after balser was terminated on those grounds.thus,this putative procedural default could not have been properly considered in determining whether balser actions constituted just cause for his termination.alpa,however,attempts to argue that there is authority for the proposition that contractual procedural requirements can be considered by arbitrators in determining whether cause for dismissal exists.while no circuit authority specifically permits a procedural default to affect the just cause calculus,alpa cites to chauffeurs,teamsters and helpers local union coca cola bottling,cir,in which the eighth circuit held that an arbitrator could consider a company failure to abide by a bargaining agreement procedural requirements in determining whether cause existed for dismissal.in chauffeurs,the employer alleged procedural default was that the employee was not afforded an opportunity to tell his side of the story prior to termination.at.importantly,chauffeurs and similar cases concern only a company procedural failings within the just cause determination.at issue here,however,is american eagle behavior,which is a different matter entirely,as this circuit and the supreme court have recognized.see misco,at.gulf coast,at.in misco,the supreme court held that l abor arbitrators have stated that the correctness of a discharge must stand or fall upon the reason given at the time of discharge.at.furthermore,in gulf coast,an employee was terminated for violating his employer substance abuse policy,but the arbitrator reinstated the employee with rehabilitation conditions based on his finding that the employee conduct indicated he was a prime rehabilitative candidate.at.we vacated the arbitration award,ruling that the arbitrator acted outside the authority of the relevant collective bargaining agreement when it considered the employee conduct.id.at a n arbitrator is to look only at the evidence before the employer at the time of the discharge.accordingly,it was inappropriate if the board considered american eagle conduct in determining whether balser was terminated for cause.thus,american eagle alleged procedural default can not be used in the just cause analysis.
furthermore,a procedural default may not be used to offset a finding of just cause for termination.assuming balser actions constituted just cause for his termination,the board had no jurisdiction not to terminate him,regardless of any alleged default committed by american eagle,given that section a of the cba notes that only just cause is necessary for termination.as the agreement does not require just cause plus the absence of any alleged procedural deficiencies by american eagle to support termination,the board can not impose this requirement,as the district court properly recognized.thus,the board erred when it considered the failure to hold the hearing in its just cause analysis or as a mitigating factor after determining that there was just cause for balser discharge,because the failure to hold the hearing i did not breach the cba and,in any event,ii can neither preclude nor mitigate just cause.
given that the board could not have considered any alleged procedural violation by american eagle in its determination of just cause and that such a determination turns solely on the pilot conduct,we turn now to the board opinion to determine whether the district court properly held that the board issued an implied finding of just cause.in this circuit,we have long recognized that where an arbitrator implicitly finds that just cause exists,it need not recite the operative phrase just cause.see dupont,at citing delta queen,at.indeed,the phrase just cause carries no talismanic significance in labor jurisprudence.delta queen,at.rather,i t is simply a term of art that defines the many unrelated,independent acts that serve as grounds for employee discipline under a collective bargaining agreement.id.in delta queen,for instance,we held that an explicit finding by the arbitrator of gross carelessness satisfied the collective bargaining agreement requirement that individuals may be disciplined only upon a showing of proper cause.id.at.thus,we have long held that implicit findings of just cause for termination warrant the same significance and carry the same force as explicit findings 
the district court did not err in determining that balser actions constituted just cause for his termination.indeed,the board determined that balser violation of american eagle policy provided american eagle with not only a right,but a duty to rid the workplace of balser conduct.the board also addressed the seriousness of balser bringing his dirk onboard the aircraft he flew,noting that doing so clearly violated american eagle rules.thus,the district court was correct to conclude that there was an implicit finding of just cause because the board opinion concludes that balser conduct clearly justified his firing.as the cba authorizes discharge only for just cause,the board,by necessary implication,determined that just cause existed for balser termination 
alpa argues that the rule of dupont and delta,that an arbitrator finding of just cause may be limited to the facts of those cases and should not be applied here.this argument fails for at least two reasons.first,there is simply nothing in the language of dupont or delta queen to suggest that these holdings were unique to their respective facts.on the contrary,our citing delta queen in the dupont opinion indicates our intention that just cause may be found implicitly.see dupont,at.
second,any reliance on our holding in weber aircraft general warehousemen and helpers union local,cir,for the proposition that dupont and delta queen are inapplicable to this case is misguided.in weber,we considered whether an arbitrator finding that a worker committed a violation of a certain offense category there,category that contemplated a variety of the conclusion that there was just cause for termination.at.the weber holding noted only that it was improper to infer a finding of just cause for termination based only upon the arbitrator determination that the employee in question had committed a violation of category,because category contemplated penalties short of discharge.id.at.because workers who ran afoul category could be punished in a variety of ways,a violation of category was not tantamount to termination.id.thus,our holding in weber did nothing to undercut the rule of dupont and delta queen that a finding of just cause may be implicit.in fact,it was noted that neither case was applicable to the precise issues presented in weber.id.the district court,therefore,did not err in holding that there had been an implicit finding of just cause,which is tantamount to an explicit finding of the same,in the board arbitration opinion.
having determined that the district court correctly held that the board implicitly found just cause for balser termination,the next question is whether the district court was correct to set aside the arbitration award,given that the board was without jurisdiction to fashion a remedy beyond what was contemplated in the cba,namely that an employee can be terminated only for just cause.the district court analysis is correct if the relevant bargaining agreement requires just cause for dismissal,an arbitrator acts beyond its jurisdiction by fashioning an alternate remedy once it has or an employee conduct constitutes just cause for dismissal,as the board did here.dupont,at delta queen,at.accordingly,the board was without jurisdiction to craft a remedy based upon american eagle supposed violation of the cba.furthermore,and alternatively,even if it were proper to allow an employer violation of a collective bargaining agreement in these circumstances to offset a termination,it could not be done here as the employer,american eagle,did not violate the cba 
accordingly,we the affirm the district court grant of summary judgment vacating the arbitration award.
our review of arbitration awards is under a highly deferential standard that requires us to enforce arbitration judgments that even arguably construe or apply a contract,even when we believe that construction reflects serious error.eastern associated coal united mine workers of america,d.bec
