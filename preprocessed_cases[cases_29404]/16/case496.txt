brian cochran sued his quondam employer,quest software,quest,claiming,inter alia,that quest wrongful termination of his employment caused him to lose the benefit of valuable but unvested stock options that,prior to his firing,quest unlawfully rescinded some stock options and that quest shortchanged him in calculating the amount of options that had vested before his employment ended.the district court wrote a thoughtful rescript and granted summary judgment in the defendant favor.cochran quest software,wl,dist.lexis.cochran appeals.we affirm.
background 
in accordance with the settled praxis for appellate review of summary judgments,see,suarez pueblo int l,cir,we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the summary judgment loser here,the plaintiff.
in early,the plaintiff learned that the defendant was expanding its sales force.he began to explore possible opportunities and,on february,the defendant offered him a position as a regional sales manager.the offer letter outlined the proposed duties,scope of responsibility,emoluments,and the like.the compensation package included a proposed grant of options for shares of quest stock with the standard vesting schedule.that phraseology permitted the plan administrator to impose a vesting schedule not more restrictive than twenty percent per year vesting,with initial vesting to occur not later than one year after the issuance date.
the plaintiff accepted the offer on march,and began his new job a week later.at that time,the plaintiff signed an acknowledgment indicating that he had received,and understood,the employee handbook.among other things,the acknowledgment form provided 
i understand and agree that employment with quest software is not for a specified term and is at the mutual consent of both quest software and me.either quest or i can terminate the employment relationship,with or without reason,at any time.
on november,the defendant stock split.this resulted in an increase in the plaintiff options from to shares,and a proportionate decrease in the exercise price.at around the same time,the defendant furnished the plaintiff with a vesting schedule and the plaintiff signed a document assenting to it.the schedule indicated that twenty percent of the options would vest on april,along,the parties have assumed this to be the anniversary date,and we indulge that an additional thirteen percent would vest every six months thereafter for the next two and years.the remainder of the options would vest on april.all vesting was contingent on the plaintiff continued employment.
the employment relationship did not go smoothly.in january of,the plaintiff met with his immediate superior,douglas garn,who expressed disappointment in his performance.garn told the plaintiff that the defendant might well recall some of his stock options.on march,this prediction became a reality the plan administrator sent the plaintiff a written notice that his unvested options had been reduced by shares.on march,the plaintiff signed a form acknowledging this change.it is important to note that the reduction occurred before any of the options had vested and left the plaintiff with options for shares.
on march,quest stock split.this split doubled the number of shares subject to the stock options and further reduced the exercise price.the next day,the plaintiff reached the first vesting milestone.twenty percent of his options,covering shares,vested at that time he continued to work for the defendant until july,when he was cashiered.he neither asked for nor received a specific reason for his termination.subsequently,he exercised the vested portion of his stock options,buying shares at a bargain price of per share and immediately reselling them for per share.his remaining stock options lapsed upon the cessation of his employment.
dissatisfied with his treatment,the plaintiff sued in a massachusetts state court seeking to enforce the remainder of his stock options or,in the alternative,to recover damages.citing diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,the defendant removed the action to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.see a.after the completion of pretrial discovery,the parties for summary judgment.
the district court granted the defendant motion and denied the plaintiff counterpart motion.the court determined that the plaintiff was an employee subject to termination at any time that the stock options vested periodically contingent on future employment and that the defendant had the right to cancel the unvested stock options upon the plaintiff discharge.cochran,wl at,dist.lexis,at.the court also upheld the partial rescission that had occurred in march of,concluding that the parties had entered into a mutually agreed modification of the employment agreement and that the plaintiff continued employment constituted valid consideration for this modification.id.wl at,at.thus,the plaintiff held vested options for only shares upon his ouster.id.wl at,at.
the plaintiff moved for reconsideration,asking the district court to reexamine its determination anent consideration and to recalculate the number of shares that had vested on april.the court summarily denied the motion.this appeal ensued.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo.see plumley container,cir suarez,at.we decide for ourselves whether the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a fact is material if its resolution might affect the outcome of the case under the controlling law.united states v.one parcel of real property new shoreham,cir.a genuine issue exists as to such a fact if there is evidence from which a reasonable trier could decide the fact either way.id.
in conducting this canvass of the record,we must take the evidence in the light most flattering to the party opposing summary judgment,indulging all reasonable inferences in that party favor.smith,cir.this does not mean,however,that we must swallow the predicate for the nonmovant opposition hook,line,and sinker among other things,we safely may ignore conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.reynolds tobacco,cir.this framework is not altered by the presence of for summary judgment.see blackie maine,cir explaining that the court must mull each motion separately,drawing inferences against each movant in turn.
iii.discussion 
we now turn to the merits of the plaintiff asseverational array.refined to bare essence,he makes three arguments.first,he charges that the defendant wrongfully terminated his employment.second,he alleges that,prior to his dismissal,the defendant illegally rescinded some of his stock options.finally,he challenges the district court computation of the number of options that had vested before he was handed his walking papers.we address each argument in turn.
as a threshold matter,though,we first must determine what law to apply.it is elementary that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must borrow the substantive law of the forum state.erie tompkins.the forum state tenets are part of its substantive law,klaxon stentor,and massachusetts courts generally apply the law of the state that has the most significant relationship to the litigation.see bushkin,raytheon.
in this instance,we need not undertake an archeological dig to locate the case center of gravity.it is settled in this circuit that when the parties have reached a plausible agreement about what law governs,a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction is free to forgo independent inquiry and accept that agreement.see borden paul revere life ins,cir.thus,we follow the parties lead and apply the substantive law of massachusetts.
wrongful termination.
the plaintiff wrongful termination claim rests initially on the premise that he was not an employee,but,rather,an employee for a term of years.in his view,a definite term of employment implied from the text of the offer letter.this is wishful thinking.
the plaintiff argument begins with a statement in the offer letter granting him options for shares of stock with the standard vesting schedule.building on this meager foundation,he argues that the defendant standard vesting schedule contemplated vesting over several years,and that,therefore,this language shows an intention to employ the plaintiff for a definite term of years,that is,throughout the vesting period.
this construct is unpersuasive.first and foremost,it disregards the express language of the offer letter,which included an explicit statement that,if the offer were accepted and the plaintiff became an employee,the defendant thereafter may terminate the plaintiff employment at any time with or without cause.it also disregards the fact that the offer letter described the defendant as an at will employer.the stock option agreement,executed ancillary to the plaintiff acceptance of the offer,made the same point in a more baroque fashion.it provided 
nothing in the plan shall confer upon an employee any right to continue in service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of quest to terminate such person service at any time for any reason,with or without cause.excess capitalization omitted.
if more were needed,the employee handbook contained numerous statements to the effect that all of quest employment relationships were.the plaintiff signed an acknowledgment indicating both that he received a copy of this handbook when he started with the defendant and that he understood its admonitions.this acknowledgment specifically noted the plaintiff understanding that employment with quest software is not for a specified term and is at the mutual consent of both quest software and the employee.
in massachusetts,as elsewhere,the terms of an employment agreement must be deduced,construed,and enforced as written.in the course of that endeavor,courts may not single out an isolated word or phrase at the expense of the language as a whole.here,the plaintiff contract contains not the slightest hint of ambiguity as to the duration of the employment the same is true of the stock option agreement.the employee handbook seals the deal.see jackson action for boston cmty,concluding that continuing employment after receiving an employee manual can suffice to incorporate the manual terms into the employment contract.so viewed,the interpretive task is uncomplicated the plaintiff was an employee,and the defendant had an unfettered right to discharge him.see id.at cort,fenton fed.trust.
the plaintiff has a fallback position on this issue.he contends that the termination of his employment was wrongful because the firing prevented the vesting of his remaining stock options.this contention requires us to consider a narrow exception that massachusetts courts have carved to the rule that an employer may jettison an employee any time and for any reason,without incurring liability for damages.
the exception applies to cases in which an ousted employee can show that the termination of his employment deprived him of compensation clearly connected to work already performed and,thus,unjustly enriched the employer.see,harrison netcentric,fortune cash register.the rationale behind this exception is that every contract contains a covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and an employer breaches that covenant when it dismisses an employee in order to deprive him of compensation fairly earned and legitimately expected for services already rendered.see mullowney data,cir applying law king driscoll.in short,this exception is designed to preclude an employer from taking an unfair financial advantage.mccone new engl.
here,the plaintiff effort to fit his case within this isthmian exception depends upon his assumption that unvested stock options should be treated as deferred compensation for services already performed.this assumption is incorrect.it has been squarely soundly the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc in harrison.there,the plaintiff alleged that his employer had terminated his employment in order to prevent the vesting of certain stock options.harrison,at.the sjc pointed out that the stock options vested over time only if the plaintiff continued in the defendant employ and ruled that the unvested shares are not earned compensation for past services,but compensation contingent on his continued employment.id.at.the case at bar is materially indistinguishable from harrison the plaintiff stock options vested over time,contingent on the continuation of the employment relationship.thus,the unvested portion which the plaintiff forfeited upon discharge did not constitute earned compensation for past services.see id.accordingly,the plaintiff attempted end run around the employment doctrine takes him into a dead end.
that concludes this aspect of the matter.the plaintiff was an employee who served at the defendant pleasure.since no cognizable exception to the general rule pertains,the district court appropriately rejected the plaintiff claim for damages arising out of termination of the employment relationship.see generally gram liberty mut.ins,holding that the absence of good cause in terminating an employee,without more,is insufficient to trigger liability for wrongful discharge.
partial rescission.
the plaintiff next posits that the defendant unlawfully canceled a portion of the unvested stock options.the facts are straightforward.on march,the defendant,disappointed with the plaintiff job performance,rescinded unvested stock options for shares of stock.the cancellation of these options was memorialized both in a written notice sent to the plaintiff and in a form signed by the plaintiff acknowledging the action.the acknowledgment form was executed on march,and the plaintiff continued to work for the defendant until his eventual ouster on july.
the plaintiff now claims that the defendant had no right to take unilateral action to alter the terms of his employment agreement and that,in any event,the modification is invalid due to lack of consideration.the defendant counters that it had an absolute right to tinker with the number of options before they vested.it adds that the plaintiff assented to the partial rescission and that his continued employment after receiving notice of the modification constituted valid consideration for the change in contractual terms.
as said,the offer letter and related documents established an relationship.see supra part iii a.while an employment agreement does not bind the parties for a particular length of time,its terms nonetheless define the parties rights and obligations during whatever period of time the employment relationship remains intact.see sargent tenaska,explaining that an agreement for employment may contain terms that are binding and effective during the life of the contract simons am.dry ginger ale,similar.it appears,therefore,that the defendant promise to grant stock options to the plaintiff constituted a term of the employment agreement subject,of course,to the provisions of the vesting schedule,the company stock plan,and the option agreement,and that the defendant did not have the unqualified right to alter that term.
assuming that the defendant lacked a unilateral right to cancel unvested stock options,the question reduces to whether the partial rescission of the options was a valid consensual modification of the employment arrangement.like the district court,cochran,wl at,dist.lexis,at,we answer that question affirmatively.
under massachusetts law,the parties to a contract must agree to a modification.new engl.mut.life ins.harvey.such an agreement may be express or implied.rogers rogers brother.in either event,however,the modification must be supported by consideration.sargent.at concrete constr.
in order to establish a valid modification here,the defendant had to show that the plaintiff not only consented to the partial rescission of the stock options but also received legally sufficient consideration in exchange for accepting this reduction in future benefits.the record demonstrates incontrovertibly that the plaintiff acquiesced in the partial resc
