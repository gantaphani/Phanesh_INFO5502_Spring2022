travel,appeals an adverse judgment on its claims against american airlines for reducing the profitability of a travel agent booking contract.the district court determined that the airline deregulation act ada,b,preempted all of claims as well as fraudulent inducement defense to a breach of contract counterclaim.on this major issue,we conclude that affirmative state law claims against american are preempted,but that defenses to its contract with american subsidiary are not.a partial remand is required.the magistrate judge rulings on procedural and sanctions issues are affirmed.
background 
factual background 
is a travel agency formerly authorized to sell airline tickets for american pursuant to the terms of an airline reporting commission reporting agreement the arc agreement.the arc agreement required american to pay commissions for booking flights in accordance with american published commission schedule.the arc agreement permitted american to modify its commission schedule at any time.
in,purchased a competing travel agency,travel.at the time of this purchase,travel was contractually obliged to use american computer reservation system the sabre crs.in order to reduce the booking obligations assumed in the purchase of travel,began negotiating a new crs agreement with american,through american sabre travel information network division stin.on december,and american executed a new crs lease agreement the sabre agreement.the sabre agreement provided for lease of four sabre crs terminals from stin the sabre agreement also released from travel prior crs obligations,but required to use the sabre crs terminals for at least transactions per month.
on february,american announced modifications to its domestic commission schedule that dramatically reduced the commissions paid to travel agencies.main contention in this lawsuit is that american knew,at the time it negotiated the sabre crs agreement,that it was about to reduce commissions and should have disclosed the impending changes.contends that the new commission schedule severely damaged business and prevented its fulfillment of the sabre agreement.had known of the impending reductions in commissions,it would not have entered into the sabre crs agreement.
on march,american sent an invoice for amounts due under the terms of the sabre crs agreement.refused to pay.american terminated the agreement with,demanded full payment,and disconnected the crs terminals leased by.allegedly lost several clients because it could no longer book american flights.
procedural background 
promptly filed suit against american seeking damages for tortious interference with business relationships,breach of contract,fraud,and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act.american counterclaimed for alleged breach of the sabre crs agreement.on march,and american consented to trial before magistrate judge boyle pursuant to.
american and filed a joint motion for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that claims were preempted by the ada.objected to appellees preemption argument on the ground that neither american nor sabre had pleaded preemption as an affirmative defense.in response,american requested,and the magistrate judge approved,an amendment to its answer that properly pled preemption.
the magistrate judge granted summary judgment on all of claims,finding insufficient evidence to support breach of contract claim and preemption of its remaining claims by the ada.in a later order,fraudulent inducement defense to sabre counterclaim was also dismissed on the basis of ada preemption.the only claim left for trial was sabre breach of contract counterclaim.
as the case went on,the court sanctioned and its counsel,stephen gardner,for violating protective orders relating to confidential documents produced during discovery.the court further penalized gardner pursuant to for unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying court proceedings.not surprisingly,moved to rescind its consent to proceeding before the magistrate judge.just as predictably,she refused relief.
the parties then settled sabre counterclaim.on september,the court entered an agreed final judgment subject to the court resolution of sabre motion for attorney fees.sabre requested more than in attorneys fees for prosecution of its breach of contract claim and its defense against the related claims raised by.the magistrate judge awarded sabre in attorneys fees plus contingent upon unsuccessful appeal.
now challenges the orders dismissing its claims and affirmative defense,the contempt and sanctions orders,the attorneys fees award,and the orders granting leave to amend and denying request to vacate its consent to trial before a magistrate.
ii.discussion 
ada preemption 
challenges the finding of ada preemption on procedural and substantive grounds.
leave to amend 
whether leave to amend should be granted is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court quintanilla texas television,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a requires the trial court to grant leave to amend freely,and the language of this rule evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend.chitimacha tribe of harry laws,cir.the district court must have a substantial reason to deny a request for leave to amend.jamieson shaw,cir.notwithstanding these authorities,contends that the trial court erred by granting the defendants leave to amend their pleadings because they did not establish good cause or any justification for filing amended pleadings long after the deadline for pleading amendments had expired.argument is unpersuasive.preemption is an issue of law whose relevant facts were undisputed in this case.was not deprived of discovery.consequently,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting leave to amend.quintanilla,at.
the ada is an economic deregulation statute intended to encourage maximum reliance on competitive market forces in the airline industry by freeing airlines from restrictive state regulation.hodges,at.the statute broadly prevents states from interfering with this goal 
except as provided in this subsection,a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.
the supreme court has twice addressed ada preemption.see morales trans world airlines,d american airlines,wolens,d.in morales,the court explained that the scope of ada preemption is a question of statutory intent.at.at.relying on its prior interpretation of similar preemptive language in the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a the court held that the phrase relating to rates,routes,or services in the ada was deliberately expansive and preempted any s tate enforcement action having a connection with or reference to airline rates,routes,or services.morales,at.at citations omitted.the court observed that some state actions may affect airline fares in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to have preemptive effect.id.at.at.however,the ada preempts any state action having a forbidden significant effect upon airline fares.id.at.at.
in wolens,the court expanded upon ada preemption as a device to protect the deregulation of the airline industry by preventing application of restrictive state laws.at.at.nevertheless,the ada preemption clause does not shelter airlines from suits alleging no violation of obligations,but seeking recovery solely for the airline alleged breach of its own,undertakings.id.the ada does not preempt court adjudication of routine claims so long as there is no enlargement or enhancement of the contract based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.id.at.at.
this court has also addressed the scope of ada preemption,holding that the ada does not preempt state tort actions alleging personal injury resulting from the operation of an aircraft.hodges,at other provisions of the ada require airlines to maintain personal injury and property damage insurance coverage for claims resulting from operation of the aircraft.consequently,ada preemption is concerned solely with economic deregulation,not with displacing state tort law.id.at 
unlike the personal injury claims in hodges,which were unrelated to economic deregulation,claims for affirmative relief have a significant relationship to the economic aspects of the airline industry.asserts that american intentionally interfered with its business relationships with four customers and an employee,luring the customers away with discounted fares and american acted fraudulently and deceptively while negotiating the sabre crs agreement with.the first claim involves american dealings with customers,while the second relates to enforceability of the contract.in other words,by its first claim,is seeking the application of texas common law in a way that would regulate american pricing policies,commission structure and reservation practices 
a very narrow reading of wolens might be said to support position,at least as it pertains to claims of fraud regarding the sabre contract negotiations.the interference with business relations claim is plainly preempted because it involves american prices and services to customers.wolens specifically preempted a consumer fraud statute,while rests its claim on state common law and,even more narrowly,on fraud related to the making of the contract and wolens concerned programs run by the airline directly with consumers,whereas the contract dispute here pits against a travel agency thus argues that american services were too peripherally affected by a travel agent controversy to be preempted.
although wolens might be interpreted to permit the litigation of common law business torts that do not directly involve airline passengers,we think the better reading of the decision requires preemption.the majority opinion repeatedly singles out common law contract actions as not being preempted,notwithstanding complaints by both dissenters that contract and claims often overlap.see wolens,at.at,stevens,and,separately dissenting.wolens also expresses the ada purpose to leave largely to airlines themselves,and not at all to states,the selection and design of market mechanisms appropriate to the furnishing of airline transportation services id.at.at emphasis added.while some airline business dealings undoubtedly do not relate to prices,routes and services,the carrier relations with travel agents,as intermediaries between carriers and passengers,plainly fall within the ada deregulatory concerns.claims are because they have a connection with american prices and services.
even before wolens,it was held that similar claims are preempted by the ada.in frontier airlines,united air lines,the court held that the ada preempted an action based on colorado law alleging that united airlines interfered with business relationships by requiring the use of a crs system to book flights.the court determined that the crs system was central to united services because united required use of the crs system to book flights.similarly,american requires use of the sabre crs system to book flights,and american policies relating to the crs system are connected with the economic aspects of its services.frontier.at.
the existence of federal regulations regarding airline crs services and the legislative history of the ada provide additional support for the conclusion that the ada preempts claims.the department of transportation,pursuant to regulatory authority under the ada,has promulgated regulations applicable to airline crs systems.see et f ederal efforts to regulate crs services and uses clearly demonstrate that the preemption statute should be applied to eliminate the risk that crs providers could be subject to varying state standards of unlawful competition.frontier.at.the ada legislative history also specifically discusses federal regulation of airline crs services,and this provides clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to preempt state law in the regulation of crs services id.at quoting,at,reprinted in 
finally,claims do not seek to enforce american contractual obligations.breach of contract claim was dismissed by the magistrate judge on other grounds,and has not appealed the ruling.because claims relate to american prices and services,the claims are preempted by the ada.
preemption of affirmative defense 
next contends that the trial court erred by dismissing,as preempted,its fraudulent inducement defense to the enforcement of the sabre crs agreement noting that wolens confined courts to the parties bargain,with no enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement,the court determined that fraudulent inducement defense would impermissibly enhance rights apart from the sabre crs agreement under state law.indeed,wolens cautioned,when it decided that enforcement of air carriers contracts is not preempted,some principles of contract law might well be preempted to the extent they seek to effectuate the state public policies,rather than the intent of the parties.wolens,at.at.we disagree,however,with the magistrate judge conclusion that fraudulent inducement defense attempts to enhance or enlarge the sabre crs agreement on the basis of state policies external to the agreement.
when pleaded as a defense to a contract,fraudulent inducement is related to the fundamental issue in contract actions is there an enforceable agreement a fraudulently induced party has not assented to an agreement because the fraudulent conduct precludes the requisite mutual assent.see restatement second of contracts.fraudulent inducement is an elementary concept in the law of contracts,and is intended to shield a party from liability in a contract action only when another party has procured the alleged contract wrongfully.united states texarkana trawlers,cir.the court reasoned in wolens that because contract law is,at its core,uniform and,there is little risk of inconsistent state adjudication of contractual obligations.at.at.fraudulent inducement is among those core concepts as it relates to the validity of mutual assent.the defense does not reflect a state policy seeking to expand or enlarge the parties agreement.therefore,fraudulent inducement defense is not preempted by the ada 
sanction orders 
sanctions for violations of court orders 
relying on the magistrate judge factual findings and recommendations,the district court sanctioned and stephen gardner,counsel,for violating three protective orders relating to confidential documents obtained during discovery.the magistrate judge found that stephen sedgewick,president of,had violated the protective orders by revealing the contents of sealed documents to the press.this finding was based on sedgewick own testimony the magistrate judge also recommended a finding of contempt against gardner for filing a complaint with the department of transportation dot that quoted portions of the sealed documents and thus expressly violated the court june,protective order.gardner acknowledged his inadvertent violation of this order.the magistrate judge recommended entry of a sanction of against and gardner,jointly and severally,which amount is the total of all the costs,attorneys fees and expenses incurred by defendants in attempting to obtain the compliance of plaintiff and its representatives with the terms of the protective orders following review of the magistrate judge findings and recommendations and a de novo hearing,the district court found and gardner in contempt and adopted the magistrate judge recommendations.
argues that the district court erred in characterizing the contempt orders as civil rather than criminal in nature.criminal contempt proceedings require heightened notice and proof,which contends were not satisfied in this case.even if the contempt proceeding is civil in nature,argues that the contempt order is not supported by sufficient evidence.finally,contends that it was error to find gardner jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the contempt award in light of his limited role in the contemptuous conduct.
a contempt order is reviewed for abuse of discretion,and underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.fdic legrand,cir.a contempt order is civil in nature if the purpose of the order is to coerce compliance with a court ord
