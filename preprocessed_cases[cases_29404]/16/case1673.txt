an excess carrier sued two primary insurance carriers to recover the excess carrier paid on behalf of the parties common insured to settle wrongful death and survival claims arising out of the care of a nursing home resident.we hold that the excess carrier was entitled to pursue a cause of action based on equitable subrogation,there was an occurrence within each of the primary policies definition of that term,the excess carrier policy period did not overlap with the first primary carrier,and the second,consecutive primary carrier was required to exhaust its limits.we affirm the summary judgment in favor of the first primary carrier,hartford underwriters insurance company,reverse the summary judgment in favor of the second primary carrier,caliber one indemnity company,and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.
pietra nieto treviño was years old when she was admitted on july,to turner geriatric center,a nursing home operated by methodist retirement communities.she was not ambulatory,was in fragile condition,and suffered from a number of illnesses and conditions including degenerative joint disease,parkinson disease,and dementia.she remained at the nursing home for almost three years,except for brief hospitalizations,until she was hospitalized on april.she died eleven days later,on april,from a stage iv pressure ulcer,overwhelming sepsis,and pneumonia.
treviño survivors brought a wrongful death and survival action in state court against mrc edgewater doing business as turner geriatric center and five nurses who attended treviño at turner.methodist retirement communities maintained primary and excess insurance coverage for general and professional liability that covered turner geriatric center and its employees.hartford underwriters insurance company provided primary coverage of up to for each medical incident under a professional liability policy or occurrence under a general liability policy from april,to april.that policy was renewed for april,through april,and the limit of liability for that period was also.caliber one indemnity company provided the same type of primary coverage for april,to july.royal insurance company of america provided excess coverage for april,through july.while reserving their respective rights to deny coverage,hartford and caliber one agreed to share the cost of defending methodist in the state court action brought by treviño survivors.
in the wrongful death and survival suit,treviño family offered to settle for,and methodist sent a stowers demand letter to hartford,caliber one,and royal requesting them to accept the offer.correspondence from methodist indicates that it thought it had only in primary coverage,although royal took the position that the policy limits of both the hartford and caliber one policies were available because there was more than one occurrence.after further negotiations,the treviño family suit was settled for.caliber one contributed,hartford contributed,and royal contributed under protest,asserting that it would attempt to recover that amount from the primary carriers.
royal then sued hartford and caliber one in state court to recoup the it had paid,and that suit was removed to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the parties consented to conduct all proceedings before a united states magistrate judge,including trial and entry of final judgment.they filed for summary judgment,and the magistrate granted judgment in favor of the primary carriers.the magistrate concluded that under texas law,which governs this action,an excess carrier has an equitable subrogation claim against a primary insurer only when it is predicated on the violation of a tort duty owed to the insured and that the only tort theory under which such an insured may proceed is negligence.the magistrate concluded that neither of the primary carriers had been negligent.the judge reasoned that because methodist had indicated that it had only in primary coverage when it demanded that its insurers settle,this was an admission by the insured that was binding on royal.the primary insurers had done all that methodist asked,the magistrate concluded.the magistrate further concluded that even if royal could assert an equitable subrogation claim based on breach of the contractual duties the primary carriers owed to methodist,there was only one occurrence or medical incident within the meaning of the primary insurance policies because treviño death stemmed from an ongoing course of care and treatment.under such circumstances,the magistrate concluded,texas law does not allow an insured to stack coverage.rather,the highest limits under any one policy apply,even if the negligence spanned multiple policy periods,and hartford and caliber one therefore had tendered the full limits.the magistrate also rejected royal contention that the general commercial liability policies applied.royal has pursued this appeal.
as an initial matter,we disagree with the magistrate characterization of texas law regarding the nature of an excess carrier causes of action against a primary carrier.more than years ago,the supreme court of texas recognized that a carrier had both a right of conventional subrogation,which arises from the express insurance contract,against another carrier,and that if there were no contractual rights authoriz ing recovery of a pro rata share of the sum paid,equitable subrogation does.in support of the proposition that there was a right of conventional subrogation,that court quoted the seventh circuit,which had held in a suit by an excess carrier against the primary insurer that t his is an action governed by contractual subrogation in favor of an excess insurer against the primary insurer.
the magistrate misconstrued statements in a subsequent texas supreme court decision,american centennial insurance canal insurance,in which the question was whether an excess carrier had causes of action against a primary carrier and trial counsel for mishandling a claim the supreme court of texas held that the excess carrier had a remedy against both based on equitable subrogation the issue was not whether an excess carrier had subrogation rights to recover amounts that a primary insurer should have paid under its policy terms and limits.the texas court had previously recognized such a right in employers casualty transport insurance,and canal cited employers casualty for the proposition that e quitable subrogation has already been recognized in texas.in canal,the only question was whether rights beyond such contractually based rights and beyond the duty recognized in stowers should be enforceable by excess carriers.the concurring opinion in canal,joined by five members of that court and therefore constituting binding precedent,made clear that the court was holding that when a primary carrier negligently investigat ed,prepar ed to defend,tr ied or settl ed the third party action and the amount of the judgment or cost to settle was thereby increased,an excess carrier could recover the extra amounts it had to pay an insured as a result.the texas court explained that in such an action for negligence,an excess carrier may recover only the difference between what it was required to pay and what it would have paid but for the primary carrier negligent handling of the action.the concurring opinion stated that i assume from its reliance on the stowers and ranger county cases,and would so hold,that the excess carriers only cause of action is for negligence.the context in which this statement appears should make clear that the court was emphasizing its conclusion that an excess carrier is not entitled to damages in its own right,or statutory or punitive damages,and that an excess carrier could not proceed on theories of breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing,violations of the texas deceptive trade protection act,or article of the texas insurance code,all of which provided remedies to insureds in saying that an excess carrier only cause of action is for negligence,the court was not saying that contractually based rights were foreclosed.the court was simply placing limits on the availability of tort and remedies.
it is by the supreme court of texas that when more than one policy covers an occurrence,all insurers whose policies are triggered must allocate funding of the indemnity limit among themselves according to their subrogation rights.a texas court of appeals had no difficulty concluding that when an excess carrier sued to recover a primary carrier policy limits after the excess carrier had paid an agreed judgment,the excess carrier had stated a cause of action for subrogation that court reasoned that s ubrogation may be contractual conventional or equitable and the doctrine of subrogation is given a liberal application and is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting voluntarily,has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.under the doctrine of equitable subrogation,an excess insurer,paying a loss under a policy,stands in the shoes of its insured with regard to any cause of action its insured may have against a primary insurer responsible for the loss.an insurer has a duty to indemnify an insured for losses covered by the insurance policy 
caliber one and hartford point to this circuit decision applying texas law in paul mercury insurance lexington insurance,in which two excess carriers asserted,among other claims,that two primary carriers were negligen t in the handling of the insured defense.this court made the unremarkable statement in this context that an equitable subrogation argument fails from the start if the excess carriers are unable to establish the insured would have a cause of action against the primary insurers for negligence.this court concluded that there was no evidence that the defense provided by the primary carriers gave rise to a negligence cause of action.admittedly,there is language in that decision suggesting that all equitable subrogation claims must be based on negligence in the insurance context nevertheless,this court actual holding was that,based on contractual provisions in the insurers respective policies,the excess carriers were entitled to recover the primary carriers full policy limits this court did not discuss the nature of the cause of action that led to this result or the fact that texas law has not recognized a direct cause of action by an excess carrier against a primary carrier,but instead,pins liability on subrogation 
this circuit had previously examined texas subrogation law in vesta insurance amoco production and concluded that what texas courts term conventional subrogation,subrogation that arises by contract as distinguished from legal subrogation subrogation that arises by operation of law is an equitable concept and thus is governed by the principles of equity.this court concluded that the distinction between the two is that texas courts generally allow a subrogee claiming against a third party under conventional subrogation to recover without regard to the relative equities of the parties.this court recognized that the right to subrogation based on contract rights is broader,not narrower,than equitable subrogation texas law further recognizes that an underwriter is entitled to the benefits of subrogation as a matter of law as distinguished from equity even if its insured right of recovery is contractual.
in its motion for summary judgment,royal characterized its claim against hartford and caliber one as one for equitable subrogation.royal has maintained throughout the district court proceedings and this appeal that the primary carriers were required to exhaust their policy limits before royal excess policy was triggered based on a provision in royal policy with methodist.royal made plain that it was seeking subrogation under texas law no allegation or proof of negligence was required.
the magistrate also erred in concluding that royal could not pursue a claim against the primary carriers because methodist indicated in a letter that its primary insurance coverage under the hartford and caliber one policies was limited to,and methodist never demanded that hartford or caliber one pay more than they did.the supreme court of texas recognized equitable subrogation as a remedy for excess carriers precisely because an insured who has excess insurance coverage may not have any incentive to press its primary carrier for the full limits of its policy.in canal,the texas court said 
and ranger imposed clear duties on the primary carrier to protect the interests of the insured.the primary carrier should not be relieved of these obligations simply because the insured has separately contracted for excess coverage.in this situation,where the insured has little incentive to enforce the primary carrier duties,the excess carrier should be permitted to do so through equitable subrogation.
an insured can not reduce its primary policy limits to the detriment of its excess carrier any more than it can expand those limits.to allow methodist to estop its excess carrier would give methodist the unilateral right to determine when primary policy limits were exhausted within the meaning of its excess policy.the limits of the primary policies are questions to be determined by the policies themselves,not the insured,just as the question of whether those limits have been exhausted is determined by the policies.
the remaining issue is whether the primary coverage available to methodist was,as hartford and caliber one contend,or or as royal contends.the hartford policy had a limit for each year it was in effect,as did the caliber one policy.the magistrate judge correctly concluded that under texas law,there may be coverage under more than one policy for a single claim involving indivisible injury,and in such circumstances,the texas supreme court has held that i f a single occurrence triggers more than one policy,covering different policy periods,the insured indemnity limit should be whatever limit applied at the single point in time during the coverage periods of the triggered policies when the insured limit was highest.this precludes stacking coverage under policies conversely,if there were more than one occurrence and the injury were divisible,then the limits for each occurrence would be 
whether there was one occurrence or more is determined by the policies respective terms.the magistrate held that the general commercial liability provisions in hartford and caliber one policies are not implicated by the treviño family allegations,and royal has failed to brief that issue in this court.accordingly,we consider only the professional liability provisions 
hartford policy,which was in effect from april,until april,stated in the coverages section 
coverage bodily injury and property damage liability 
insuring agreement.
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies 
b.this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if 
the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence and 
the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.
occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.
the professional liability form provided coverage for a medical incident,which is defined as 
any act or omission in the furnishing of professional health care services to any person,including 
a the furnishing of food,beverages,medications or appliances in connection with such services 
any such act or omission together with all related acts or omissions in the furnishing of such services shall be considered one medical incident.
caliber one policy was in effect from april,through july.in the general coverages section that applies to both the commercial general liability and the professional liability insurance,the policy provides,this insurance applies to bodily injury only if the bodily injury is caused by an occurrence and the bodily injury occurs during the policy period.occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the section of the policy dealing more specifically with professional liability provides 
coverage professional 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of any act,error or omission in the rendering or failure to render professional services by an insured or by any person for whose acts,errors or omissions an insured is legally responsible.
professional services means nursing home services.the declarations page reflects that the professional each claim limit is,and the section addressing policy limits says that the each claim limit is the most we will pay under coverage p professional liability for the sum of damages arising out of any one claim regardless of the number of insureds.
royal excess insurance policy was in effect from april,through july,and provides 
insuring agreement 
we will pay on behalf of the insured those sums in excess of the retained limit which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages to which this insurance applies because of 
a bodily injury which occurs during the policy period and is caused by an occurrence 
royal policy defines retained limit as the total of the applicable limits of the underlying insurance shown on the declaration page plus the applicable limits of any other insurance collectible by the insured.it defines occurrence as a n accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.another pertinent provision provides 
loss payments 
a we will have liability for any one occurrence only when the amount of the retained limit with respect to such occurrence has been paid by

ii us on behalf of the insured other than under this policy or

in the treviño family suit against methodist and the five nurses employed at the nursing home,the live pleading at the time the case was settled focused on the last several months of treviño life and the injuries and conditions leading to her death,all of which occurred during caliber one policy period however,considerable discovery was conducted in that case,and several experts presented reports.at least one expert opined that methodist employees were negligent at different times during the period the hartford policy was in effect and that this negligence caused discrete,although relatively minor,injuries to treviño.an expert concluded that the failure to clean treviño properly and to apply appropriate medication led to rashes.other breaches of the standard of care allegedly led to a urinary tract infection.the alleged failure to supervise treviño and properly secure her in her wheelchair caused bruises on her hands.treviño suffered severe stomach pain that was ignored and could have been avoided or relieved.nurses massaged damaged tissue,which was allegedly contrary to the standard of care,and caused treviño to suffer skin tearing and pain.these breaches of the standard of care and the resulting injuries are divisible from the alleged acts of negligence that occurred a year later that caused pneumonia,and a massive,infected stage iv pressure sore and resulting sepsis,leading to treviño death.if treviño injuries prior to those she sustained in the months preceding her death had been more severe,such as a broken arm on one occasion and a skull fracture a few months later,we would have no difficulty in concluding that these discrete injuries and their causes were divisible from the acts or omission that later caused the stage iv pressure sore and other ailments occurring more than a year later the fact that treviño instead suffered rashes,bruises,pain,and infections in the year before she developed a severe pressure sore and other conditions does not alter the analysis.
we note that the hartford policy does not treat the acts and omissions leading to discrete injuries to treviño that occurred when its policy was in effect as separate occurrences.hartford policy provides that any act or omission in the furnishing of professional health care services to any person together with all related acts or omissions in the furnishing of such services shall be considered one medical incident.
caliber one policy provisions differ from hartford.caliber one policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,and caliber one contends that the injuries treviño sustained during its policy period were the result of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions to which treviño was exposed during hartford policy period.in another context,which was employees sexual molestation of minors this circuit expressed its agreement with the seventh circuit conclusion that continuous or repeated exposure to conditions sounds like language designed to deal with asbestos fibers in the air,or paint on the walls,rather than with priests and choirboys.in the case before us,most if not all of the alleged negligence involved acts or omissions of caregivers,not the conditions of the nursing home facilities or the ambient air.the supreme court of texas contrasted the typical occurrence language that includes continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions with language tailored to fit circumstances health care providers face 
the apie policy language that defines the scope of each claim occurrence to include a series of acts or occurrences,is apparently intended to have a coverage effect similar to the continuous or repeated exposure unifying directive in commercial liability in a manner that is meaningful in the medical context.for example,medical malpractice frequently involves an operation or an extended course of treatment.a malpractice event may involve numerous independent grounds of negligence that can not be unified as repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions,but that nevertheless constitute a series of acts or occurrences that are related and form a single malpractice claim 
the numerous independent grounds of negligence that were alleged to have occurred throughout treviño stay at the nursing home can not be unified as repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions.the acts and omissions that caused treviño stage iv pressure sore,pneumonia,and other injuries that allegedly resulted in her death are divisible from the acts and omissions and treviño resulting injuries during hartford policy period.
within caliber one policy period,however,its policy limit is nevertheless for the various acts of negligence and the corresponding injuries because its insured,methodist,had only one claim for indemnity for the damages treviño family sought.the caliber one policy provided that regardless of the number of insureds the each claim limit is the most we will pay under coverage p professional liability for the sum of damages arising out of any one claim.the reference to any one claim is to a claim by the insured,not the number of the underlying claims against the insured.
the claims asserted in the treviño family lawsuit against methodist were not a single claim involving indivisible injury,and the rule set forth in the supreme court of texas decision in american physicians insurance exchange prohibiting stacking does not apply this does not mean,however,that royal is entitled to stack the limits in both primary policies before it is obligated to indemnify methodist.royal policy period did not overlap with hartford.coverage under the hartford policy applied only to occurrences from april,through april.hartford policy did not apply to the acts and omissions that occurred after april.royal excess policy covered occurrences from april,through july.royal policy provided that the retained limit that must be paid before royal excess coverage became available was the applicable limits of any other insurance collectible by the insured.as we have seen,hartford limits were not applicable to acts or omissions occurring after april.royal express policy provisions do not permit royal to look to hartford for payment.this court has held
