appellants wilmington shipping company wsc and peter brown ruffin,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment to new england life insurance company nel on ruffin claim for breach of fiduciary duty under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a west supp,and appellants claims under north carolina law for unfair and deceptive trade practices,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and constructive fraud.appellants allege,among other things,that nel grossly mismanaged the assets of wsc pension plan the plan,ultimately resulting in the plan insolvency and termination,and that nel consistently misinformed them about the plan financial health in an effort to conceal this mismanagement.the district court ruled that ruffin,a plan participant,does not have standing to sue under erisa a because the plan is now terminated and the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc has been appointed statutory trustee over the plan.the district court also ruled that erisa preempts appellants various claims because the claims relate to the plan.
we agree with the district court that erisa preempts appellants claims because they relate to the plan.we conclude,however,that ruffin has standing to sue under erisa a even though the plan is now terminated and the pbgc has been appointed trustee over the plan.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to nel on appellants claims and reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to nel on ruffin erisa claim.
this is a summary judgment case,so we construe the facts in the light most favorable to appellants,the parties,drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
wsc is a north carolina corporation that offers a number of services to the steamship industry,including vessel maintenance,repair,and warehousing.peter brown ruffin,is a shareholder and officer in wsc and a participant in the plan.ruffin father,peter brown ruffin,was one of wsc founders.nel is a massachusetts insurance company 
on january,wsc created the plan as a pension plan for its employees wsc employed nel to help create the plan.nel advised wsc concerning all aspects of the plan and drafted the plan documents.the plan named wsc as the plan administrator,and wsc administered the plan from its inception to its termination.as plan administrator,wsc did not have any authority over the investment of the assets of the plan.at.instead,the plan provided that wsc would enter into group annuity policies with an insurance company and that the insurance company would manage the plan investments.
wsc selected nel as the insurance company that would perform these functions in,nel issued a group investment account policy the gia policy to wsc.the gia policy consisted of a general investment account and other specialized investment accounts for equity securities,capital growth,bonds,mortgages,and real estate.under the terms of the policy,the plan administrator had no individual ownership of any investments or other assets of the investment accounts and nel had exclusive ownership and control of funds deposited by the plan.at.
in,nel issued another policy to wsc,the developmental properties account dpa policy.pursuant to the policy,wsc deposited plan funds into the dpa to be used by one of nel subsidiaries for investment in real estate.at.nel offering brochure for the dpa policy described nel as a statutory fiduciary under erisa.at.as with the gia policy,the dpa policy gave nel exclusive control and ownership of the funds invested by the plan.
for nearly a decade,the relationship between the parties was uneventful,but,in,it changed.in that year,ruffin and robert hutchens purchased wsc.at the time,the plan appeared on paper to be in excellent financial shape,having roughly million in the dpa valued at around liabilities of only million.in fact,the plan financial health seemed so assured that,upon purchasing wsc,ruffin and hutchens specified that the plan surplus would go to its participants in the event the plan was terminated.
following the change in ownership,wsc informed nel during a july meeting that it wanted to terminate the plan and instead fund a k plan.during the meeting,however,nel told wsc that the plan could not be terminated at the time because the dpa was not currently liquid due to all cash going into properties.at.wsc officials were upset by this news.they expressed their displeasure with nel investment management and questioned nel investment decisions with respect to both the gia and dpa policies.
wsc continued to express its strong desire to terminate the plan.in response,nel advised wsc to freeze future benefit accruals and wait until the dpa was liquid to terminate the plan.at.nel estimated that it would take roughly two years to terminate the plan,and nel actuary did not believe that wsc would have to make any more contributions to the plan,even under a worst case scenario.at.
so wsc waited.all the while the dpa value spiraled downward.the gia policy did not fare much better,producing returns in both and.the large number of participants entitled to plan benefits only compounded the plan financial problems.nevertheless,from to,wsc s a t tight,as nel advised,waiting for the dpa to become liquid so that the plan could be terminated.at.
in,nel informed wsc that it needed to contribute more than to the plan to completely fund it.at a meeting,hutchens and bill emerson,wsc ceo,again complained to nel about wsc inability to terminate the plan and diversify its assets.nel responded that wsc could move the plan funds into other investments,but only if the plan paid a penalty to nel amounting to more than.nel alternatively offered to allow wsc to transfer twenty percent of the gia policy assets each year for five years,but then only to other accounts 
wsc took nel up on its offer to transfer twenty percent of the gia policy funds per year.at the time,nel reaffirmed its commitment to monitoring the plan assets.but the dpa never recovered.it was ultimately liquidated and paid out from to.
in march,nel submitted a final termination study to wsc.although the study concluded that much ground ha d been made up in terms of the plan performance,the plan was still underfunded by between and,an amount that nel concluded wsc would need to contribute if it chose to terminate the plan immediately.at.
on march,appellants,along with ruffin,brought suit against nel under erisa a,alleging that nel had breached its fiduciary duties to the plan and caused the plan severe financial loss.nel answered on may,denying the and asserting a number of affirmative defenses,including that it was not a fiduciary under erisa.
nel denial of fiduciary status under erisa led appellants to move to amend their complaint to add claims against nel for unfair and deceptive trade practices,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and constructive fraud.nel opposed appellants motion,arguing that erisa preempted the proposed claims.on november,the district court granted appellants leave to amend their complaint to add the claims.
on july,nel moved for summary judgment on the grounds that appellants claims were barred by the statute of limitations and laches nel was not a fiduciary under erisa as a matter of law erisa preempted appellants claims and there was no factual basis for appellants claims.appellants opposed the motion 
in december,the pbgc,a federal corporation charged with administering erisa and its pension insurance program,determined that the plan lacked sufficient assets to continue paying benefits to participants.the pbgc concluded that termination of the plan would serve the best interests of the plan participants.
accordingly,on january,the pbgc and wsc executed an agreement terminating the plan,effective december,and appointing the pbgc as statutory trustee of the plan pursuant to b west supp.on march,the pbgc notified the district court of its appointment as trustee of the plan.
in february,the pbgc moved to dismiss wsc erisa claim because wsc was no longer a fiduciary of the plan.in the motion,the pbgc also informed the court that it had decided that it was not in the best interest of the terminated pension plan for the pbgc to join in this action.at.wsc did not oppose the motion because it had effectively ceased its administrative responsibilities with respect to the plan.at.wsc did,however,note its belief that the dismissal of its erisa claim did not affect peter ruffin standing to assert a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.at.the pbgc took no position on the question of ruffin standing under erisa.
on march,the district court dismissed wsc erisa claims and denied as moot nel pending summary judgment motion,but the court granted nel leave to file another summary judgment motion on ruffin erisa claim and appellants remaining claims.
nel filed another motion for summary judgment,and on august,the district court granted summary judgment to nel on appellants remaining claims.the court ruled that ruffin lacked standing as a plan participant to assert a claim under erisa once the pbgc terminated the plan and assumed the role of statutory trustee.the court reasoned as follows 
when a pension plan covered by title iv terminates,pbgc determines whether the plan has sufficient funds to pay the pension benefits earned by participants.c,a.if the plan is underfunded,pbgc typically becomes statutory trustee and assumes the obligations to pay the benefits earned by plan participants to the extent that they are guaranteed under title iv.in such cases,title iv insurance program is the exclusive means through which plan participants,such as,peter ruffin,may recover benefits under the plan.
at internal quotation marks omitted.with respect to appellants claims,the court ruled that erisa preempted those claims because they are based on facts,circumstances,and allegations that relate directly to the plan,its assets,and its administration.at.
appellants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to west.

because pbgc involvement in this case is central to the arguments on appeal,a description of its functions under erisa is in order.when pbgc is appointed as statutory trustee over a terminated plan,it wears two hats one as guarantor of erisa insurance program under title iv and one as trustee.these roles are different.
the pbgc as guarantor.
the pbgc is a corporation of the united states government that is modeled after the federal deposit insurance corporation.pension benefit guar.ltv,d.the pbgc board of directors consists of the secretaries of the treasury,labor,and commerce.d west supp.the corporation administers title iv of erisa,which includes a mandatory government insurance program that protects the pension benefits of american workers who participate in pension plans.ltv,at.west supp.the cost of the pbgc insurance is borne primarily by employers that maintain ongoing pension plans.ltv,at.erisa requires covered employers to pay annual premiums into the program.see,west supp.the program is also financed by statutory liability imposed on employers who terminate pension plans.ltv,at.in enacting title iv,congress sought to ensure that employees and their beneficiaries would not be completely deprived of anticipated retirement benefits by the termination of pension plans before sufficient funds have been accumulated in the plan.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
erisa authorizes the pbgc to institute termination proceedings against an plan whenever,inter alia,the plan has insufficient assets to satisfy its pension benefit obligations or the possible loss of the pbgc with respect to the plan will increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.a.once a plan is terminated,the pbgc is authorized to appoint a statutory trustee to administer the plan.b.the trustee must use the plan assets to cover what it can of the plan benefit obligations.west supp.if there is a shortfall,then t he pbgc then must add its own funds to ensure payment of most of the remaining nonforfeitable benefits,those benefits to which participants have earned entitlement under the plan terms as of the date of termination.ltv,at.erisa does place limits on the benefits the pbgc may guarantee upon plan termination,however,even if the participant was entitled to greater benefits under the terms of the plan.id.at.
the pbgc as statutory trustee.
as noted above,erisa grants the pbgc authority to appoint a statutory trustee over a terminated plan.the pbgc may either apply to the appropriate district court for the appointment of the trustee or may as happened here consult with the plan administrator and agree upon a trustee.b.although the pbgc may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case,id.b,and in fact does so in the lion share of cases,see ltv,at,the statute does not mandate that the pbgc be appointed as trustee.see also boivin airways,noting that,although erisa does not require the pbgc to be appointed as the successor trustee,i n practice,the pbgc has always applied to serve as successor trustee for plans pension benefit guar.beverley,cir although pbgc may request and often does request that it be appointed as statutory plan trustee,a third party may also be appointed as statutory plan trustee.
erisa grants the statutory trustee all the powers held by the plan administrator.d a i.in addition,the trustee has the power to commence,prosecute,or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan,d b iv collect amounts due the plan,id.d b ii pay benefits under the plan,id.d b i liquidate the plan assets,id.d b vi and limit payments of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment,id.d a iv.thus,for example,if the plan becomes fully funded at any point after plan termination,the statutory trustee may order that the plan continue to pay full benefits.if,after asset allocation,the plan is underfunded,the trustee may limit payments under the plan to basic benefits.in that case,and after the trustee has calculated the benefits due each participant,the pbgc calculates the amount of nonforfeitable benefits guaranteed by the pbgc and pays these guaranteed amounts to the trustee,who in turn pays them to each participant.
the distinction between the pbgc roles is particularly important with respect to the management of plan assets.as trustee,the pbgc must hold all plan assets,including assets recovered through litigation,in trust for the plan.see d a ii.although,as trustee,the pbgc may pool assets of terminated plans for the payment of benefits under any plan,see a,and is thus exempted from the fiduciary duty imposed on trustees not to pool assets,the pbgc must still hold the pooled assets in trust for the terminated plans thus,in its capacity as guarantor,the pbgc has no power over the assets of terminated plans.if a private trustee is appointed to administer a terminated plan,the private trustee,not the pbgc,holds and controls the plan assets.see d a iii and d b vi.
as noted above,if a plan becomes funded after termination,the statutory trustee be it the pbgc or a private party retains discretion to continue to pay full benefits under the plan.see d a iv.but this is not the only way in which a plan can continue to pay full benefits.just as the pbgc may terminate an insolvent plan,see a,it may undo the termination if it determines that the plan participants will be best served by plan restoration,see west.in such circumstances,the pbgc may order the statutory trustee to return all or part of the plan assets to the plan administrator so that the plan may resume normal functioning.id.
thus,erisa does not give the pbgc in its capacity as guarantor any powers of plan administration.rather,these powers are given to the trustee,which may or may not be the pbgc.as guarantor,then,the pbgc function with respect to a terminated plan is limited to calculating the amount necessary to guarantee each participant benefits and paying that amount to the trustee.
we review questions of standing de novo.white tail park,stroube,cir.because federal courts have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto,a plaintiff must possess both article iii and statutory standing,or the federal court to which the plaintiff has come has no power to decide his case.bender williamsport area sch,d.to this end,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,ruffin bears the burden of establishing his standing.daimlerchrysler cuno,d lujan defenders of wildlife,d.

we begin with the question of ruffin standing under article iii.the requisite elements of article iii standing are familiar a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright,d see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
injury in fact.
although nel suggests that the injury ruffin relies on is too speculative,we conclude that he has sufficiently alleged an injury in fact.under the terms of the plan,ruffin,as a plan participant,is entitled to receive a payment of benefits in lieu of other benefits payable to him over time.this right to a payment was lost once the plan was terminated.erisa specifically protects a participant right to receive a payment of benefits.see g b west supp forbidding plan amendments that decrease an optional form of benefit d defining the ability to receive pensions benefits in a lump sum as an optional form of benefit williams cordis,cir the payment of benefits in a lump sum is one example of a g b optional form of benefits.ruffin alleged injury thus satisfies article iii requirement for it is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.as things now stand,ruffin can not receive a payment of his benefits.
that ruffin is suing on behalf of the plan does not alter this conclusion,for a plan participant may not sue under erisa a unless he seeks recovery on behalf of the plan.see.mutual life ins.russell,d holding that a participant action filed pursuant to erisa a must seek remedies that provide a benefit to the plan as a whole horan kaiser steel ret.plan,cir an individual beneficiary may bring a fiduciary breach claim under erisa a,but must do so for the benefit of the plan.ruffin injury is no less concrete because the benefit to him from a favorable outcome in this litigation would derive from the restored financial health of the plan.
ruffin has sufficiently alleged that nel caused the injury he complains of in this case.ruffin blames nel for the plan untimely demise,and he claims that,as a result,he has been deprived of his right to receive a payment of his benefits.this easily satisfies article iii requirement that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of by the plaintiff.lujan,at.elk grove,at.the plaintiff must show that the conduct of which he complains has caused him to suffer an injury in fact.
redressability.
all that is left is article iii requirement that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that ruffin injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.here the parties completely diverge.
ruffin argument is simple enough.pursuant to his erisa claim,ruffin seeks to recover on behalf of the plan all losses to the plan resulting from nel breach of fiduciary duties and to compel nel to restore to the plan all profits including fees of nel which have been made through use of assets of the plan by nel.at.if ruffin prevails in his suit against nel,he contends that his loss of his right to receive a payment of his be redressed because funds will be awarded to the plan sufficient to pay all of its liabilities.in that case,the pbgc,acting as statutory trustee,could continue to pay full benefits under the plan and could take any action authorized under the plan,including paying ruffin his benefits in a lump sum.alternatively,the pbgc,acting pursuant to its administrative powers under erisa,could restore the plan pursuant to,in which case ruffin also would be able to receive his payment.either way,ruffin argues,he will get his payment.
nel responds that ruffin does not stand to benefit,either directly or derivatively,from even a full recovery in this case because the recovered funds would be merged into the coffers of the pbgc,while ruffin and the other plan participants will receive their guaranteed more,no matter what the outcome of this suit.appellee br.at emphasis in original.this is because,according to nel,the value of ruffin benefits under the plan does not exceed the value of the guaranteed benefits available to him moreover,nel argues that ruffin can not receive his benefits in a lump sum because the pbgc is generally barred by regulation from paying guaranteed benefits in form.see if a benefit that is guaranteed under this part is in a single installment under the terms of the plan,or an option elected under the plan by the participant,the benefit will not be guaranteed or paid as such.so,in a nutshell,nel argues that ruffin will get the full value of his benefits even if he can not get them in the form that he wants.this argument derives in part from nel belief that the pbgc in its capacity as statutory trustee is authorized to retain recovered plan assets that exceed the amount necessary to pay guaranteed benefits to plan participants under and direct those assets to erisa insurance coffers.
the errors in nel argument are manifold.nel mistakenly believes that the overarching governmental interest in the solvency of erisa insurance program exempts the pbgc from the otherwise absolute duty that erisa imposes on fiduciaries,including statutory trustees,to hold plan assets in trust for the benefit of plan participants.as trustee,the pbgc is not authorized to retain plan assets to the extent that they exceed the value of plan participants guaranteed benefits.rather,the pbgc,acting as trustee,must hold plan assets in trust for the benefit of plan participants and pay all plan benefits,if possible,in accordance with the statutory order of priorities.see d a ii.only after the pbgc as trustee has allocated plan assets and determined that the plan has insufficient funds to meet its obligations does the pbgc as guarantor chip in from erisa funds to cover the any unpaid guaranteed benefits.to be sure,erisa provides that its insurance funds may be credited with the value of a terminated plan assets administered under,but only to the extent that plan assets exceed plan liabilities not to the extent they exceed guaranteed benefits,and only after the statutory trustee has satisfied all plan liabilities.see b c west.
nel essentially argues that ruffin injury is not redressable because erisa insurance guarantees that he will receive the full value of his benefits,albeit in a form,but there would be no need to resort to erisa coffers if ruffin were to win a full recovery.in such case,there would be no need for the pbgc in its capacity as guarantor to pay guaranteed benefits to plan participants from erisa insurance funds,for it could,in its capacity as trustee,satisfy all plan benefit obligations out of the recovered assets of the plan and in the ways authorized by the plan.see d a i.this would include the power to pay ruffin his benefits in a lump sum 
nel objects that the pbgc would still be barred by regulation from paying ruffin benefits in a lump sum,even assuming a full recovery,but,again,this argument conflates the pbgc role as erisa guarantor with its role as statutory trustee.the regulation at issue,generally precludes the pbgc in its capacity as guarantor from paying guaranteed benefits from title iv insurance coffers in form.it says nothing of the pbgc powers as statutory trustee.erisa,however,does.the statute grants the trustee all the powers of the plan administrator to do any act authorized by the plan or erisa,see d a i,and the plan authorizes payment of benefits in a lump sum.see cooke lynn sand stone,cir determining the proper discount rate for trustees of a terminated plan to apply in calculating the amount of a payment to a participant,but never questioning the trustees authority to make such a payment.the regulatory restraint on the pbgc ability to pay benefits in form has absolutely no bearing on its ability as statutory trustee to do what erisa and the plan unequivocally grant it the power to do.
under nel view,it would be particularly disadvantageous to plan participants for the pbgc to be appointed statutory trustee over a terminated plan given the pbgc license to skirt the duties imposed on statutory trustees to hold plan assets in trust for the benefit of the plan participants.according to nel,the pbgc in its capacity as trustee may retain excess plan assets to satisfy its insurance obligations under erisa when a private trustee would be required to hold plan assets in trust for plan participants,and a plan participant who would otherwise be entitled to a payment of his benefits upon appointment of a private trustee would be precluded from receiving such a payment when the pbgc is appointed trustee.on the other hand,nel argues that the pbgc is not able to perform acts or functions expressly authorized by erisa and the plan for the statutory trustee to perform,including paying benefits in a lump sum.this is an odd,even inexplicable,result,and one that we are quite sure congress did not intend given that congress chose to permit others besides the pbgc to serve as statutory trustee over a terminated plan.the duties imposed on the statutory trustee do not fall by the wayside just because the pbgc,and not a private party,becomes the trustee.
in short,all of nel arguments challenging ruffin article iii standing are without merit.accordingly,we conclude that ruffin has article iii standing to sue under erisa a for breach of fiduciary duty.
we now turn to the question of ruffin standing under erisa.the district court held that,now that the plan is terminated and the pbgc has been appointed statutory trustee,ruffin no longer has standing under erisa because title iv insurance program is the exclusive means through which plan participants,such as ruffin,may recover benefits under the plan.at.
of course,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.hughes aircraft jacobson,d internal quotation marks omitted.the question of whether ruffin as a plan participant has standing under erisa a after plan termination is really a question of whether any participant has such standing after plan termination.
erisa a provides that a civil action may be the secretary of labor,or by a plan participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section of this title.a.nel concedes that ruffin is a plan participant under erisa at and ruffin erisa claim is for breach of fiduciary duty,which is squarely within the scope of erisa a.
it is perhaps a massive understatement to say that the plain language of erisa a favors ruffin.the statute grants plan participants the right to sue for breach of fiduciary duty without qualification.it does not say that a plan participant can sue for breach of fiduciary duty until plan termination or before plan termination,just that a participant can sue for breach of fiduciary duty.see firestone tire and rubber bruch,d erisa provides a panoply of remedial devices for participants and beneficiaries of benefit plans.glanton ex rel.alcoa prescription drug plan advancepcs,cir erisa authorizes plan participants to sue fiduciaries for losses the plan suffers from a breach of their duties.madonia blue cross blue shield of,cir erisa confers standing upon participants and beneficiaries of an erisa plan.
our review of erisa reveals,and nel concedes,that there is no provision in the statutory scheme that expressly revokes participants standing upon termination of the plan.see united states morton,d we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.this makes sense in light of erisa purpose,which is to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b west 
normally,where the statutory language provides a clear answer,our analysis begins and ends with that language.hughes aircraft,at.but nel argues that the statute is deceiving and that congress indeed has given participants standing with one hand and taken it away with the other.according to nel,this revelation flows from erisa a placement in title i of the statute,which concerns the establishment of employee benefit plans and the funding and governance of such plans while they are going concerns,and not in title iv,which concerns the termination of underfunded pension plans,establishes the pbgc,and provides for the payment of guaranteed benefits in the event of plan termination.appellee br.at.title iv provides the statutory trustee of a terminated plan with the power to collect for the plan any amounts due to the plan and to commence,prosecute,or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan.d b ii and iv.from this structure,nel concludes that congress chose to grant broad and exclusive power and authority to the pbgc to prosecute claims on a plan behalf.appellee br.at emphasis in original.
nel argues that congress has vested this exclusive power in the pbgc in order to free the pbgc as statutory trustee from the potential res judicata or collateral estoppel effects of other litigation on the plan behalf and to protect the government overriding interest in minimizing the drain on erisa insurance funds.according to nel,a participant could settle his erisa claim or otherwise obtain a recovery for the plan,while potentially circumscribing the pbgc authority to prosecute claims on behalf of the plan because of the preclusive effects of the litigation.in that case,the pbgc in its capacity as guarantor would be required to expend more of erisa insurance funds to pay guaranteed benefits to plan participants and beneficiaries,thereby resulting in a greater drain on the pbgc resources and ultimately leading to higher premiums for employers.
putting aside the plain language of erisa a for a moment,which undoubtedly favors ruffin and does not speak by mere implication,nel structural argument suffers from other intractable problems.title iv does not expressly grant the statutory trustee the exclusive right to prosecute claims on behalf of the plan.see d b iv.it only gives the statutory trustee the power to commence,prosecute,or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan.congress knows how to use the word exclusive or other similar words when it intends to impose the kind of limitation that nel believes precludes plan participants from suing after plan termination,and congress in fact has done so in another of erisa provisions.see f west this subsection shall be the exclusive means for bringing actions against the pbgc under this subchapter.emphasis added.we do not lightly assume that congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply,and our reluctance is even greater when congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to make such a requirement manifest.jama immigration and customs enforcement,d.insofar as the district court nel the statutory trustee,irrespective of who the trustee is,possesses exclusive authority to prosecute claims on behalf of a terminated plan,there is nothing in erisa text that supports such a conclusion.
to the extent that nel argues that the pbgc must possess exclusive authority to bring claims on behalf of the terminated plan when it is appointed as trustee because of the overriding interest in protecting erisa fisc,its argument conflates the pbgc guarantor and trustee roles.congress has not mandated that the pbgc serve as statutory trustee over every terminated plan.indeed,erisa provides that other persons or entities which presumably could include a plan participant may be appointed as statutory trustee for a terminated plan.see b.in such cases,the pbgc would not have control over the litigation decisions made by the trustee on behalf of the plan,even if the pbgc disagreed with the trustee litigation strategy.had congress intended the pbgc to make litigation decisions on behalf of all terminated plans as a means of protecting erisa fisc,it would have mandated that the pbgc be appointed as statutory trustee over all terminated plans.but congress did not so choose,and this dooms nel argument that the pbgc must possess exclusive authority to prosecute claims on behalf of terminated plans in order to protect its insurance coffers.
nel res judicata collateral estoppel argument fares no better.first,when the pbgc sues as trustee of a terminated plan,it seeks to vindicate the interests of the plan participants,not its own interests as guarantor of erisa insurance program.in this regard,the pbgc is no different from a private trustee of an active or terminated plan,who may undoubtedly be bound by the results of private litigation if the trustee interests were adequately represented in the previous litigation.moreover,the pbgc in its capacity as statutory trustee can always intervene in ongoing private litigation,if necessary,to protect the plan or its participants.see.indeed,the pbgc declined the opportunity to intervene in this case.
second,assuming that the pbgc would be bound by the results of private erisa litigation,the government hands would not be tied,for the secretary of labor,who sits on the pbgc board of directors and has as at least as vested an interest in minimizing the drain on erisa insurance funds as the pbgc does,would be able to sue under erisa a on behalf of the plan.consistent with this understanding,a number of our sister circuits have held that,in light of the overarching national interest in ensuring the financial stability of pension plans and the inability of private plaintiffs to adequately represent this interest,the secretary of labor is not bound by the results reached by private litigants in erisa suits.see,herman bank,cir holding that secretary of labor is not bound under doctrine of res judicata by the results of private erisa litigation because of the secretary overriding public interest that is separate and distinct from a private litigant interests sec.of labor fitzsimmons,cir en banc same donovan cunningham,cir same.
in sum,nel various arguments do not overcome the plain language of erisa a,which in no uncertain terms grants plan participants standing to sue for fiduciary breaches.nothing in the structure of erisa evidences congress intent to cut off this standing after plan termination and appointment of the statutory trustee,be it the pbgc or a third party.we thus conclude that ruffin has standing to sue under erisa a for breach of fiduciary duties even though the plan is terminated and the pbgc has been appointed statutory trustee.
appellants also challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to nel on their claims.the district court concluded erisa preempted the claims because they relate to the plan.we review questions of erisa preemption de novo.see,nationwide life ins,cir.
