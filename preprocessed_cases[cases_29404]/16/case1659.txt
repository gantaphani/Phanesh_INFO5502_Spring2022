in this diversity case,the appellant,paul graham graham,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment declaring that appellee,liberty mutual insurance company liberty,has no duty to defend or indemnify him under the omnibus clause of the insurance policy issued by liberty to graham employer,eagle contracting,eagle,covering eagle vehicles.
on appeal,graham argues that the district court improperly considered extrinsic evidence to defeat liberty duty to defend in violation of texas rule.because we agree,we reverse the district court judgment and render judgment that liberty has a duty to defend graham.we also conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding whether graham was using the company vehicle with the permission of eagle at the time of the accident.accordingly,we reverse the district court summary judgment declaring that liberty has no duty to indemnify graham and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
on the night of november,graham was driving a company vehicle belonging to his employer eagle when he collided with a motorcycle carrying mikel johnson and christy wright state court plaintiffs.at the time of the accident,graham was on his way home from a local restaurant where he had been celebrating his birthday with a friend.graham,who had consumed alcoholic beverages at the restaurant,fell asleep while driving his company truck and ran into the back of the state court plaintiffs motorcycle.
johnson and wright filed suit in state district court asserting that graham negligently operated the vehicle and eagle was negligent for entrusting the vehicle to graham the state court plaintiffs also asserted claims against eagle based on a respondeat superior theory.
at the time of the accident,liberty policy covering the eagle vehicle provided in part as follows 
we will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership maintenance or use of a covered auto.
we have the right and duty to defend any suit asking for these damages.however,we have no duty to defend suits for bodily injury or property damage not covered by this coverage form.we may investigate and settle any claim or suit as we consider appropriate.
the policy defined the word insured,as used in the policy,as follows 
who is an insured 
the following are insureds 
a.you for any covered auto.
anyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire or borrow 
the policy explains that the words you and your refer to eagle,the named insured.graham asserts coverage through the or omnibus clause in subpart b.
with regard to graham permission to use his company vehicle,the state court plaintiffs petition states in part 
at the time of the incident complained of,defendant graham was driving a truck registered to his employer 
such vehicle was entrusted to defendant graham by eagle as part of his job 
paul graham has a long history of permissive use of the vehicle notwithstanding any written or unwritten policies to the contrary 
eagle knew and condoned the use of a company vehicle by graham and other employees in violation of purported policies 
eagle has no effective or even attempted policy or practice to regulate personal use of vehicles other than giving employees a written vehicle policy 
paul graham had all of his gasoline and maintenance costs reimbursed by eagle 
eagle had receipts clearly indicative of the use of graham company vehicle for personal use 
the night of the incident was the fortieth birthday of defendant graham.eagle regularly allow s some of its employees,including defendant graham,to drive business vehicles in pursuit of personal activities.
graham asserts that the allegations at least support an inference that he had implied permission to use the eagle vehicle.
liberty brought this action for declaratory judgment in the district court against graham seeking a declaration that liberty is not obligated to defend or indemnify graham in the underlying tort suit.in its motion for summary judgment,liberty sought to establish the unauthorized nature of graham use of the vehicle by introducing eagle written vehicle usage policy vehicle policy as well as evidence of graham intoxication.the vehicle policy was given to graham when he received his company truck and states that usage of the company vehicle must be limited to company related business.
graham argued to the district court that liberty owed him a defense because under texas rule,a liability insurer duty to defend is to be determined solely from the terms of the insurance policy and the pleadings of the underlying plaintiff.graham contended that because the complaint alleges permission and the policy covers permissive drivers,the duty to defend was invoked.liberty argued that the complaint does not allege permissive use of the vehicle and that,even if it does,this case justifies an exception to the rule and considering extrinsic evidence is appropriate because such evidence relates solely to a coverage determination.
the district court,while acknowledging the general prohibition against extrinsic evidence in duty to defend disputes,concluded that extrinsic evidence was proper in this case for both of the reasons asserted by liberty.first,the district court found that the insurance policy and third party complaint did not permit a conclusive determination on coverage.the court explained that the state court plaintiffs reference to the use of the vehicle with permission at other times and places did not address permission on the night in question.second,the district court found that the extrinsic evidence related only to a coverage determination.
based on these conclusions,the district court considered extrinsic evidence and found that the evidence affirmatively established a lack of permissive use by graham at the time of the accident.the judge particularly relied upon evidence that the defendant had received and signed a copy of the vehicle policy.as a result,the district court found that the insurance company had neither a payment nor defense obligation and granted liberty motion for summary judgment.graham lodged a timely appeal.
the central issue in this case is whether the district court erred in concluding that graham was not entitled to a defense from liberty in the state court suit brought by the state court plaintiffs.the resolution of this question depends on whether the state court plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to demonstrate that graham was a permissive user of the eagle vehicle and an insured.
this court reviews whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured in an underlying suit as a de novo question of law similarly,this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as below the parties agree that texas law governs this diversity case.
as a general proposition,texas has followed the rule.under this rule,an insurer duty to defend is determined by the underlying plaintiff pleadings,considered in light of the policy provisions,without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations as the name of the rule suggests,only two documents are ordinarily relevant to the determination of the duty to defend the policy and the pleadings of the underlying claimant facts outside the pleadings,even those easily ascertained,are ordinarily not material to the determination and allegations against the insured are liberally construed in favor of coverage 
if the four corners of a petition allege facts stating a cause of action which potentially falls within the four corners of the policy scope of coverage,the insurer has a duty to defend if all the facts alleged in the underlying petition fall outside the scope of coverage,then there is no duty to defend,but we resolve all doubts regarding duty to defend in favor of the duty 
after the district court rendered its judgment,the texas supreme court issued its decision in guideone ins.fielder.baptist which we conclude controls this appeal in that case,guideone insurance company guideone issued a liability policy to fielder roa
