in this appeal we conclude that the text of a retention of liabilities provision in a stock purchase agreement requires assumption of cercla responsibilities by the seller,rather than simply indemnification.we also decide that prejudgment interest and the cost of an experimental treatment process are reasonable in a contribution suit under cercla section.
caldwell trucking company provided liquid waste disposal service at its premises in fairfield,new jersey.from to,the waste was deposited in several lagoons on the site,but,beginning in,it was stored in tanks and from there taken to ocean disposal facilities.
defendant rexon had plants in fairfield and wayne,new jersey where it manufactured electronic components and fuses for military applications.these activities involved the use of substances,which are classified as hazardous materials.beginning in,caldwell trucking provided rexon with waste disposal for all types of materials in the septic tanks on its properties.
the epa listed the caldwell property on the national priorities list of superfund sites in and issued records of decisions in and,calling for remediation of the contamination present there.caldwell trucking and nine other firms the caldwell group or group acceded to a consent decree in providing for remediation and reimbursement to federal and state governments for previously incurred expenses.the group,the plaintiff here,sought contribution from the many customers of the caldwell trucking company.most of the claims were settled,but because of a dispute over the interpretation of an agreement between defendants rexon and the pullman company,the claim involving them continued.
at various times,rexon stock had been owned by several parent companies relevant to the case at hand was the purchase by defendant pullman corporation in october of and the sale of all of the stock to a new parent corporation in april.the new parent corporation continued operations using the rexon name until rexon was dissolved on june.in the interest of clarity,we will use the name of rexon,despite its varying parentage,to designate the manufacturing entity found to have contributed to the pollution.
on april,the caldwell group filed this suit against pullman company,rexon and the other alleged responsible entities.rexon registered agents in new jersey and delaware were served with process on april,and may,respectively.
the district court entered summary judgment on liability in favor of the caldwell group against rexon and pullman.the critical dispute in that phase of the case was the interpretation of a provision in the stock purchase agreement assigning responsibility for environmental claims against pullman and rexon.the district court defined the issue as whether pullman was directly liable or whether it was merely limited to an exclusive indemnification of rexon.
particularly important to the district court ruling is paragraph,captioned seller retention of certain liabilities,in which pullman agrees to assume and become liable for,and pay,perform and discharge and to indemnify as the district court construed the agreement,the parties intended to attribute direct liability to pullman for a wide range of costs associated with violations of,or noncompliance with,environmental laws as of or prior to the closing date of the sale in.
the caldwell group claims and the judgment in its favor are not based on the relationship between pullman and rexon,but rather on pullman contractual assumption of responsibility.the district court pointed out that rexon had become responsible for its dumping from to at the caldwell site,even though the damage had not become manifest until,three years before the sale.the court ruled that the contractual provision made pullman directly liable to the caldwell group for rexon obligations.
following the entry of summary judgment on liability against rexon and pullman,the court conducted a bench trial to determine the amount of damages.in extensive findings of fact,the court considered such matters as the appropriate remediation,the proper costs,and the ingredients in the waste generated by rexon.these factors led to an allocation of expenses among the other waste generators and rexon.
the court directed that pullman should contribute an allocation share amounting to and entered judgment in favor of the caldwell group for that amount against pullman,rexon and mark iv industries jointly and severally,plus prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.
pullman,rexon and mark iv industries have appealed,alleging numerous errors in the district court proceedings.pullman contends that,under the stock purchase agreement,it did not indemnify rexon or assume its liabilities other than those existing at its own premises,that caldwell has no right to a direct action,and that the allocation was erroneous.moreover,it is asserted that the cost of one of the remedial means used should not have been permitted,that no prejudgment interest is appropriate,and that because it had been dissolved,rexon was not amenable to suit.
interpretation of the retention of liabilities language in the stock purchase agreement is a critical issue in this appeal because the district court ruled that pullman liability was based on a contractual obligation.although federal law underlies the cause of action,state law applies to interpreting a contract that affects cercla liability.see,united states usx,cir beazer,mead,cir.here,section of the stock purchase agreement provides that new jersey law applies.
paragraph of the agreement,captioned pullman retention of certain liabilities,reads in pertinent part 
anything contained herein or in any other document,instrument or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,pullman agrees to assume and become liable for,and to pay,perform and discharge and to indemnify rexon and to hold rexon harmless from and against any and all liabilities and obligations with respect to the following 
c any and all liabilities and obligations including without limitation,any liabilities or obligations to third parties for any consequential or punitive damages arising out of or relating to b any actual or alleged violation of or by rexon with any environmental laws as of or prior to the closing date including without limitation,superfund liabilities or similar liabilities for other sites.
pullman concedes that there has been no dispute that rexon disposal arrangements with caldwell trucking were of a nature or character as to give rise to an allegation of an actual or alleged violation of or by rexon.appellant brief at.
under section of cercla,c,rexon may not divest itself of liability for its pollution activity.see,horsehead,paramount commc ns,cir hatco grace,cir beazer,at.although it may not escape liability to the government,a participant in a contamination activity may secure contribution from other responsible parties or indemnification.see,section of cercla,f horsehead,at new jersey tpk.auth.ppg,cir hatco,at beazer,at.
although its argument is not clear,pullman appears to contend that the retention of liabilities clause would apply if rexon paid its share of remediation expenses incurred by the state or federal governments pursuant to section,but not if those costs had been incurred by polluters themselves.
paragraph does not support such a construction because its language is far more sweeping.subparagraph c refers to a ny and all liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to b any actual or alleged violation of or by rexon with any environmental laws as of or prior to the closing date including without limitation,superfund liabilities or similar liabilities for other sites.the text does not include a limitation applicable only to matters brought under section.
pullman concession that rexon was a perpetrator under the terms of section,a conclusion that is overwhelming here,establishes that there was a breach of the environmental laws.the record demonstrates that the violations occurred before,when the stock purchase agreement was signed.indeed,the epa had put the caldwell property on the national priorities list in,before pullman purchased rexon.
