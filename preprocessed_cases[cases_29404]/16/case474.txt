puerto rico highway and transportation authority the authority appeals the district court denial of its claim of eleventh amendment immunity as an arm of the state after careful review,we affirm.
background 
on december,redondo construction company redondo filed a complaint against the authority and other defendants in the district court,alleging numerous constitutional violations and breach of contract under state law.the factual background of this underlying lawsuit,which is but one action amongst an array of administrative proceedings and litigation in both commonwealth and federal courts,is irrelevant to the single issue of eleventh amendment immunity before us.
on october,the district court denied injunctive relief and dismissed all of redondo constitutional claims except those relating to interference with present contractual relations.regarding the authority sovereign immunity claim,the district court analyzed the factors outlined in metcalf eddy,puerto rico aqueduct sewer,cir and of rhode island chesterton,cir,and concluded that the authority was not entitled to immunity as an arm of the state.
the authority sought reconsideration of the district court opinion in a motion to amend judgment filed on november,which was denied by the district court on february.meanwhile,on january,the district court partially granted the authority request to stay the federal court proceedings in response to a november,decision of the puerto rico court of appeals confirming that the department of transportation and public works had primary jurisdiction in the administrative proceedings under way.
in the interim,the authority has filed this appeal to request review of the district court sovereign immunity decision under the collateral order doctrine.puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d state entity claiming to be arm of the state may take advantage of collateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of eleventh amendment immunity.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court denial of eleventh amendment immunity.arecibo cmty.health care,puerto rico,cir.
after the district court opinion was issued,this court reformulated its analysis for eleventh amendment immunity in response to intervening supreme court precedent.fresenius med.care cardiovascular resources,puerto rico the caribbean cardiovascular ctr,cir,cert.denied,d fresenius.fresenius applied the framework of hess port auth,d,to the question of whether a public corporation established by a state should enjoy eleventh amendment immunity.fresenius,at.under fresenius,a court must first determine whether the state has indicated an explicitly by statute or implicitly through the structure of the the entity share the state sovereign immunity.id.at.if no explicit indication exists,the court must consider the structural indicators of the state intention.if these point in different directions,the court must proceed to the second stage and consider whether the state treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.id.
this framework thus explicitly recognizes the eleventh amendment twin interests protection of the fisc and the dignity of the states.id.at citing hess,at.the supreme court has recently stressed that,distinct from financial concerns,the state also has a dignity interest as a sovereign in not being haled into federal court.id.at citing federal maritime comm state ports,d.similarly,the state has both dignitary and fiscal interests in identifying which state entities are not to share its immunity.id.it would be every bit as much an affront to the state dignity and fiscal interests were a federal court to find erroneously that an entity was an arm of the state.a state choice to establish an entity excluded from the protection of its sovereign immunity implicates important policy concerns 
not all entities created by states are meant to share state sovereignty.some entities may be part of an effort at privatization,representing an assessment by the state that the private sector may perform a function better than the state.some entities may be meant to be commercial enterprises,viable and competitive in the marketplace in which they operate.such enterprises may need incentives to encourage others to contract with them,such as the incentives of application of usual legal standards between private contracting parties.the dollar cap on recovery found in many state sovereign immunity statutes would be a powerful disincentive to a private party to contract with an entity,unless the private party first obtained a waiver of immunity from the entity.in puerto rico,a breach of contract action against the commonwealth is capped at.
in sum,states set up entities for many reasons.an erroneous decision may frustrate,not advance,a state dignity and its interests.
id.at internal citations omitted.the first stage of the analysis thus pays deference to the state dignitary interest in extending or withholding eleventh amendment immunity from an entity.id.at.
the authority argues that,inter alia,the extent of the commonwealth control over the authority and the authority involvement in the traditional governmental function of building public roads clearly indicate a legislative intention to structure the authority as an arm of the state,despite the authority ability to make expenditures,to charge tolls and fees,to own and dispose of property,to make contracts,to sue and be sued,and to issue bonds that create no obligation on the part of the commonwealth.the district court considered these,and other,indicators of the authority relationship to the commonwealth and concluded that the authority administrative and financial independence excluded it from eleventh amendment protection.
on appeal,redondo contends that the commonwealth intention to deny the authority the protection of state sovereign immunity has been clearly established by two decisions in which the supreme court of puerto rico held that the statutory structure of the authority indicates that it was designed to operate as a private enterprise,not as an instrumentality of the state.morales morales autoridad de carreteras,unión asociación de empleados profesionales y clericales de la autoridad de carreteras labor relations bd.of puerto rico,offic.trans.we agree.
the precise role of state court decisions in determining an entity entitlement to eleventh amendment immunity has not been defined.fresenius,at.while eleventh amendment immunity is without doubt a question of federal law,that federal question can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency character.regents of the of cal.doe,d.in a similar context,the supreme court has found the opinion of the state highest court highly persuasive but even if our own examination of the status of counties under california state law were not sufficient for present purposes,we have the clearest indication possible from california supreme court of the status of california counties.moor county of alameda,d holding that counties have sufficiently independent corporate character to be treated as citizens of california for diversity purposes.
this court has previously stated that w hile not dispositive,consistent decisions of a state highest court construing an agency or institution relationship with the central government are important guideposts in a reasoned attempt to locate the agency or institution place within the scheme of things.metcalf eddy,at.in the context of state waivers of eleventh amendment immunity,we have confirmed that legislative intent is a matter of state law,on which the highest court of a state speaks with finality.della grotta rhode island,cir citing mullaney wilbur,d.where the highest court of a state has construed a state statute as intending to waive the state immunity to suit in federal court,the state intent is just as clear as if the waiver were made explicit in the state statute.id.here,the supreme court of puerto rico has twice held that the statutory structure of the authority clearly indicates a legislative intent that the authority act as a private enterprise outside the protection of the commonwe
