interface partners international ipi filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against moshe hananel hananel,ipi former employee and manager of its office in israel.in its complaint,ipi accused hananel of breaching his contract with ipi in this case,which is similar to a prior case we decided,see adelson hananel,cir,ipi appeals the district court granting of hananel motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
the following facts are relevant to this appeal ipi is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in needham,massachusetts.ipi also has offices in nevada and israel.hananel is a citizen and resident of israel.sheldon adelson,ipi sole owner and only shareholder,established ipi for the purpose of making business investments in israel.
in,adelson and hananel,while in israel,got to the general terms of the understanding that hananel would work as ipi general manager in israel.according to adelson,on december,in ipi needham,massachusetts office,hananel and ipi executed an oral employment contract confirming that hananel would become ipi general manager at a salary of per year and would receive a percentage share in net profits arising from investment gains during his time with ipi 
during hananel tenure with ipi,he was based in israel and responsible for finding investments in israel.in april,ipi terminated hananel after about four and years of service.in,ipi sued hananel in israel claiming that hananel had misused ipi funds.this suit was litigated for nearly four years in israel.in july,ipi requested the israeli court to dismiss its case without prejudice so that it could in the united states.the israeli court granted ipi motion,but ordered ipi to pay hananel costs of litigation 
ipi subsequently filed the instant lawsuit in the superior court of massachusetts and hananel removed the case to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.in its complaint,ipi alleged that hananel had breached his employment contract and claimed that hananel wrongfully took and or destroyed corporate documents leading to many months of delay before ipi could determine the full range of hananel various wrongful breaches of his employment agreement.hananel moved to dismiss the action on grounds of forum non conveniens.
the district court granted hananel motion it concluded that ipi decision to move for dismissal of its israeli action was motivated by a desire to vex and to oppress hananel and,accordingly,that ipi is not entitled to the heavy presumption ordinarily accorded to a plaintiff choice of forum.the district court then applied the test for forum non conveniens cases first articulated by the supreme court in gulf oil gilbert.it found that the israeli forum was an adequate alternative forum and that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the claim in israel.ipi appeals.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens is generally committed to the district court discretion.adelson,at citing piper aircraft reyno,d.we will find an abuse of discretion if the district court failed to consider a material factor substantially relied on an improper factor or assessed the proper factors,but clearly erred in weighing them.id.citing iragorri int l elevator,cir.we are mindful of the fact that we must neither substitute our judgment for that of the district court nor strike the balance of relevant factors anew.iragorri,at.errors of law are reviewed de novo.adelson,at.
applicable law 
when a defendant moves for dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds,it bears the burden of showing both that an adequate alternative forum exists and that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the claim in the alternative forum.iragorri,at.the first condition is usually met if the defendant demonstrates that the alternative forum addresses the types of claims that the plaintiff has brought and that the defendant is amenable to service of process there.id.citing piper,at.
to determine whether the defendant satisfies the second condition,a more involved inquiry is required as the defendant must show that the compendium of factors relevant to the private and public interests implicated by the case strongly favors dismissal.id.citing gilbert,at.guided by the supreme court in gilbert,we have stated that 
c onsiderations relevant to the litigants private interests include the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witnesses the possibility of view of premises,if view would be appropriate to the action and the trial judge consideration of all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.
id.quoting gilbert,at.
with respect to the public interest factors,we have stated that the district court should consider such things as the administrative difficulties of docket congestion the general goal of having localized controversies decided at home,and concomitantly,ease of access to the proceedings on the part of interested citizens the trier relative familiarity with the appropriate rules of decision and the burdens of jury duty.id.quoting gilbert,at.
in addition,while certainly a plaintiff enjoys some degree of deference for his original choice of forum,adelson,at citing gilbert,at,we note some tension in our case law regarding whether a district court,before conducting the aforementioned forum non conveniens analysis,should accord a plaintiff choice of a home forum heightened deference.notably,in adelson,we cited to the supreme court holding that when the plaintiff has chosen his home forum,he should not be deprived of it absent a clear showing of either oppressiveness and vexation or evidence that the chosen forum is inappropriate.at quoting koster am.lumbermens mut.cas.yet,in iragorri,we remarked that t he koster court use of the term oppressiveness and vexation neither created an independent standard nor raised the bar for dismissal in forum non conveniens cases.at.instead,the iragorri court viewed the strongly favors standard as a distillation of the oppressiveness and vexation language.id.
what is clear amidst this uncertainty,however,is that even if a heightened deference standard were to apply to a plaintiff choice of a home forum,there is no automatic right to the presumption,and as explained below,the district court should deny the presumption to plaintiffs acting with a vexatious and oppressive motive.as the supreme court has instructed,a citizen forum choice should not be given dispositive weight and dismissal should not be automatically barred when a plaintiff has filed suit in his home forum.piper,at.
hananel burden for dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds 
presumption in favor of plaintiff choice of forum and heightened deference 
we need not reconcile our precedent today regarding whether a plaintiff choice of her home forum carries a presumption of heightened deference because,even if this presumption were to apply,the district court did not commit error here.we disagree with ipi contention that our case law would preclude a district court,if it found substantial support in the record for its conclusion,from considering a plaintiff vexatious or oppressive motive for bringing suit in an alternative forum 
thus,in the present case,we can not conclude that the district court erred in finding ipi choice of its home forum to be undeserving of heightened deference.the district court requested ipi to point to evidence in support of its purported explanation for requesting dismissal from the israeli court,and ipi could not do so save for citing to a claim it made during a hearing before the israeli court.the fact that ipi could not provide this evidence,taken together with the fact that,here,ipi engaged in nearly four years of discovery in an israeli forum it initially chose,and that ipi,according to the district court,subsequently moved to dismiss its suit on the verge of being ready for trial,adequately support the district court determination that ipi was operating with a vexatious and oppressive motive 
we conclude that even if a presumption of heightened deference were to apply to a plaintiff choice of a home forum,the district court did not err in denying the presumption to ipi.further,as we discuss infra,because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the public and private interest factors strongly favor the israeli forum,we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that a presumption in favor of any ordinary deference to a plaintiff choice of forum was overcome.see iragorri,at holding that presumption in favor of the plaintiff choice of forum is overcome where the trial court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable quoting piper,at.
adequate alternate forum 
the district court found that israel is an adequate alternative forum because its courts address the sort of breach of contract claim asserted in this case,and because hananel,an israeli citizen is amenable to service there.we agree and see no reason to disturb this finding as this matter has been litigated for nearly four years in the israeli forum,a forum in which ipi initially chose to pursue its claims.further,ipi does not contend either that the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all,piper,at,or that the israeli forum does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute,id.at.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in conditioning its dismissal on hananel agreement not to oppose reinstatement of the israeli proceeding.see ahmed boeing,cir upholding conditional dismissal in forum non conveniens case.
public and private interest factors 
we turn to the second requirement and analyze whether the district court abused its discretion in applying the private and public interest factors as set forth in gilbert,at,recognizing that the list of factors is illustrative rather than.iragorri,at.
private interest factors 
relative ease of access to sources of proof 
with respect to the ease of access to sources of proof,the district court stated that although the parties dispute whether the contract was formed in massachusetts,it is undisputed that hananel performance pursuant to the contract occurred in israel.the district court explained as follows 
hananel was in charge of the ipi office in israel.he searched for investment opportunities in israel on ipi behalf.he received his pay in israel.he spent ipi funds in israel.he was not summoned to the ipi headquarters in needham to report on his activities in israel indeed,he never returned to the needham office after the december,meeting,although he did return to the united states once or twice.
in addition,the district court noted that hananel was almost always in israel both when he was working for ipi and when he was speaking with adelson,who supervised him from both the united states and israel that hananel alleged breaches of the contract occurred in israel the affiants upon which ipi relied to develop its affidavits during the pretrial litigation phase in israel are all israeli witnesses testifying to events that occurred in israel the related documents which include credit card receipts and internal corporate documents and would need to be translated into english are located in israel and that hananel anticipates calling israeli witnesses.
given these factors,the district court concluded as follows 
on balance,the factor concerning access to sources of proof substantially favors the israeli forum.the locus of the alleged misconduct is in israel.the majority of the witnesses are in israel.the most significant testimony on behalf of each party comes from israel,the testimony of witnesses regarding hananel actions in israel.while ipi evidence suggests that the contract was formed in massachusetts,other evidence clearly establishes that many of the terms were negotiated in israel.in addition,the parties subsequent course of of which occurred in bear upon the terms of the parties relationship given the oral nature of the contract and the heated disputes over the terms of the contract.moreover,the presentation of evidence in the bilingual courts of israel is simpler for the parties than our court.
ipi disagrees with the district court conclusion that the availability of witnesses and documents strongly favor dismissal.ipi argues that there is little reason to believe that hananel would even benefit from the proffered testimony from the witnesses he intends to call.ipi maintains that the record simply does not show that the proposed israeli witnesses are even relevant,let alone so critical to hananel defense that proceeding in the united states would cause manifest injustice.with respect to the documents,ipi challenges the district court conclusion that many of the documents created and maintained in israel are in hebrew,pointing out that the district court did not identify any such documents.
ipi arguments are unavailing.consistent with our case law,the fact that the events relating to hananel alleged misconduct occurred in israel weighs heavily in favor of the foreign forum.see howe goldcorp,cir holding that the balance of conveniences favor with unusual strength the canadian defendants seeking a canadian forum because t he relevant events surrounding both plaintiff misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty claims took place in canada,not in the united states see also piper,at.holding that because a large proportion of the relevant evidence is located in great britain it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in scotland.
furthermore,we disagree with ipi claims that the district court abused its discretion with respect to its treatment of the relevance and identity of hananel witnesses.as a preliminary matter,we have noted,there is no blanket rule that a defendant affirmatively demonstrate,by affidavit,the unavailability of a foreign witness and the significance of the witness testimony.mercier sheraton int l,mercier ii,cir.regardless of the existence of such a rule,and contrary to ipi assertions otherwise,hananel has adequately identified the witnesses he intends to call in the proceedings below,and has indicated the relevance of at least ten israeli witnesses.the district court noted that the record contains affidavits from those ten israeli witnesses,each of whom would testify regarding adelson knowledge of hananel activities in israel or regarding various facts disputing the allegations of misconduct asserted by ipi.
in view of the discretion and flexibility we afford to the district court in conducting its forum non conveniens analysis,we will not its judgment where there is strong record support for its considered conclusion.as we have remarked,t he trial judge is in the best position to know the interstices of any particular case and to evaluate both the parties interests and the likely efficacy of the process.iragorri,at citing gilbert,at.consequently,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that testimony from hananel israeli witnesses was relevant and weighed in favor of the israeli forum 
compulsory process 
ipi does not challenge the district court conclusion that hananel would be unable to compel any of his witnesses to appear in the united states and that live testimony is preferable to video testimony or live videoconferencing testimony.we have stated that the ability to produce live testimony can weigh strongly in favor of a particular forum.see iragorri,at holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering private interest factors in case where neither witness could be compelled to attend trial in maine mercier ii,at noting that the opportunity to evaluate credibility on the basis of testimony could be crucial to a reliable resolution of these factual disputes and that
