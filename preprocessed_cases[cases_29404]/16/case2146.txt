plaintiffs collectively truckers appeal the district court order dismissing their claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.at issue is whether the truckers claims are essentially contractual and therefore must be heard in the court of federal claims under the contract disputes act.we hold that the claims are essentially contractual and affirm the district court dismissal.
background and procedural history 
plaintiff truckers are independent contractors who transport mail for the united states postal service usps.under their contracts,usps pays the truckers based in part upon their annual estimates of the cost and amount of fuel they will use.if fuel costs increase,their contracts entitle them to an adjustment in the contract price.
in,the usps introduced a new program.under the plan,usps uses its buying power to negotiate fuel prices on behalf of mail transporters such as the plaintiffs.the truckers then buy fuel directly from the fuel suppliers at the wholesale prices.usps implemented this plan by adding amendment to its new and renewal mail transportation contracts.that amendment requires that the truckers purchase fuel from suppliers,either at facilities or delivered to the truckers own fueling facilities.
in their first amended complaint below,the truckers claimed that,by requiring them to participate in the amendment fuel plan,usps breached its contracts with the truckers,breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violated the truckers constitutional liberty and property rights,and violated the separation of powers clauses of the united states constitution by engaging in arbitrary agency action without legal authority.
usps moved to dismiss the first amended complaint on grounds.the district court responded by deciding that the truckers failed to adequately plead their claims,but gave them thirty days to amend their complaint.the truckers second amended complaint dropped the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant claims.it alleged only that the plan violated the truckers fifth amendment liberty and property rights,violated postal regulations,and constituted arbitrary agency action without statutory authority.
the district court dismissed the case,holding that because the truckers constitutional and regulatory claims were essentially contractual,jurisdiction was properly in the court of federal claims,not the united states district court.
ii.analysis 
a.the jurisdictional test 
under the contract disputes act cda,the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction for judicial review over any dispute relating to a contract for goods and services between an executive agency of the united states government and an independent contractor.id.a.the cda bars district court jurisdiction if the court determines that a plaintiff claims against a government agency are essentially contractual in nature.rmi titanium westinghouse,cir.the classification of a particular action as one which is or is not essentially contractual depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claim,and upon the type of relief sought or appropriate.id.quoting megapulse,lewis.the plaintiff title or characterization of its claims is not controlling.a plaintiff may not avoid the jurisdictional bar of the cda merely by alleging violations of regulatory or statutory provisions.id.alteration in original quoting united states.
thus if,as usps argues,the truckers claims are essentially contractual,then the court of federal claims has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction.but if,as the truckers contend,their claims are genuinely based on constitutional and statutory rights,then the district court has subject matter jurisdiction.we agree with the district court that all of the claims are essentially contractual,and therefore affirm its dismissal of the case.
b.the fifth amendment claims 
the truckers argue that by interfering with their right to control their fuel supply,usps deprived them of their property without due process or just compensation.but whether the truckers have a right to control their fuel supply depends upon whether their contracts with usps afford such a particular,whether amendment validly requires the truckers to comply with the fuel plan.the truckers,in effect,seek specific performance of the contracts as they stood before any amendment.their objection to the contract amendments is the essence of their claims both the source of the rights upon which the plaintiffs base their claims contracts with usps to transport mail,and the type of relief appropriate reformation of the contracts to bar enforcement of amendment manifest the claims contractual nature.the district court appropriately determined that the truckers characterization of their claims as was an effort to obscure the claims true nature.
additionally,if the truckers contend correctly that the contracts do not validly restrict their right to control their fuel supply,and usps nevertheless abridged that right,then the proper recourse would be a claim,not a takings claim.see hughes communications galaxy,united states,t he concept of a taking as a compensable claim theory has limited application to the relative rights of party litigants when those rights have been voluntarily created by contract.in such instances,interference with such contractual rights generally gives rise to a breach claim not a taking claim.citations and internal punctuation omitted.
c.the regulatory claims 
the truckers further argue that usps lacked authority to develop the fuel plan because usps regulations prohibit usps from interfering with the operation of its contractors businesses,and that in the absence of regulatory authority,usps insistence that the truckers comply with the fuel plan violates their right to due process.specifically,the truckers cite two regulations that they contend render the fuel plan invalid usps purchasing manual stating that t he objective of any purchasing action is to meet contract objectives,not control the supplier business and its management instructions stating that p urchases of fuel may be made from any source at the option of the fuel contractor.
this argument,however,conflicts with the truckers position that the amendments to their contracts do not obligate them to purchase fuel from the designated suppliers the amendments can not be both contractually invalid as the truckers contend in advancing their fifth amendment claim,arguing that the amendments do not constitute consent to the fuel plan and contractually valid as the truckers contend when arguing that the amendments are inconsistent with usps regulations.if the amendments are contractually invalid and therefore do not compel the truckers to comply with the fuel plan,then the amendments can not also violate usps regulations by compelling the truckers to comply with the fuel plan.
this inconsistency,although perfectly acceptable as an strategy,nevertheless highlights the contractual nature of the truckers claims,because their contracts with usps are at the core of both sides of the truckers argument.regardless of whether the truckers argue that the new requirements violate the contracts,or that the contracts violate usps regulations,their claims are contractual.that the fuel plan might violate usps regulations does not transform a claim into one that is regulatory and not contractual.see,at the question presented by the complaint could be phrased as whether the contract forbids termination under these conditions.that the termination also arguably violates certain other regulations does not transform the action into one based solely on those regulations.otherwise,because every government agency is bound to follow some set of regulations,every government contractor could recast its contract claims as regulatory claims,thereby nullifying the cda.united states j e salvage,cir effective enforcement of the jurisdictional limits of the cda mandates that courts recognize contract actions that are dressed in tort clothing.melanson united air lines,cir nearly any contract claim can be restated as a tort claim.the rla grievance procedure would become obsolete if it could be circumscribed by artful pleading.
relief available from the court of federal claims 
finally,the truckers contend that the district court has jurisdiction because the court of federal claims can not grant the injunctive relief they seek.we initially note that the cda provides that a ll claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision,a emphasis added,and that the contractor may seek judicial review only in the court of federal claims.id.a.the cda does not condition that court jurisdiction upon the relief sought,but upon whether claims relate to a relief available in the court of federal claims is irrelevant.see,at holding that a claim for specific performance of a government contract must be resolved by the claims court,even though the claims court had no power to grant specific performance.
further,while the truckers correctly assert that the court of federal claims can not grant the relief they seek outright,that court can achieve the same from compliance with the fuel it finds such a result appropriate,by granting a contractual remedy such as reforming the truckers contracts with usps.see ho united states,fed.cl,reformation of a contract is an equitable remedy that may be invoked in this court when the contract contains provisions that are contrary to law.citing am.united states,mcclure constructors,dalton,dairyland power coop.united states.
iii.conclusion 
because all of the truckers claims relate to their contracts with usps,the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction over this case.therefore,we affirm the district court dismissal.
i concur in the majority opinion but write separately to clarify what i take to be the basis for today majority holding the fact that plaintiffs have effectively artfully pleaded what are essentially contractual claims,in an attempt to avoid the jurisdictional bar of the contracts dispute act cda.
the cda establishes exclusive court of federal claims jurisdiction over claims against the federal government that are essentially contractual in nature.see rmi titanium westinghouse,cir.such exclusive jurisdiction would be meaningless if every claim could be artfully pleaded in such a fashion as to avoid this jurisdictional bar.as the majority notes,nearly any contract claim can be restated as a tort claim.ante at.see also melanson united air lines,cir.similarly,nearly every contract claim against a federal agency could be restated as a claim that the agency at issue has violated some internal regulation,or that the agency has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.see,united states.as a result,along with the majority,i would examine the claims here to determine if they are actually contractual claims in other claims clothing.
courts have long applied this sort of artful pleading test in many jurisdictional contexts.see,harrow prudential ins,cir plaintiffs can not circumvent the exhaustion requirement by artfully pleading benefit claims as breach of fiduciary duty claims.shell sturge,cir we refuse to allow a party solemn promise to be defeated by artful pleading.lambert kysar,cir we can not accept the invitation to reward attempts to evade enforcement of forum selection agreements through artful pleading of tort claims in the context of a contract dispute.internal punctuation and citation omitted see also b b trucking usps,cir op.of cook,dissenting citing many of these and other such cases.but see,cir w e are skeptical of the applicability of the artful pleading doctrine outside of complete federal preemption of a state cause of action.i see no reason why the artful pleading doctrine ought not be applied here.
in the instant case,i agree with both the majority and the dissent that the proper question as to whether the cda prohibits district court jurisdiction under the rmi titanium megapulse test involves an examination of the rights and remedies set forth in the complaint.see rmi titanium,at quoting megapulse,lewis.however,i see the underlying rights presented by the plaintiffs here as contractual in nature,despite the fact that their complaint appears on its face to discuss only rights.
the truckers first complain that the usps is interfering with their fifth amendment rights.however,the types of interference that the truckers describe do not involve any actions other than instructions to comply with contract provisions.for example,the truckers claim that the usps is intruding upon their land,in violation of their fifth amendment rights,by requiring fuel suppliers to fill the fuel tanks at the truckers depots.but armed federal officers are not physically intruding onto the truckers land and pumping unwanted fuel into the truckers fuel tanks.rather,the usps has merely amended the contracts,in accordance with the terms of those contracts,and instructed the truckers to comply with the new terms.the truckers,of course,could refuse to comply,and risk losing their contracts or being in breach,but no actual trespass or taking is occurring outside of the bounds of the contract mechanism.thus these claims are essentially contractual,despite the truckers efforts to cloak them in fifth amendment garb any taking or interference with the truckers property that has occurred here has only occurred via contractual means,just as any rights with which the usps is interfering are those resulting from the contracts.and similar arguments can be made about the truckers remaining fifth amendment claims.accordingly,these claims are essentially contractual.
in reaching this conclusion,it is not important that the usps defense would be based on the contracts at issue.i agree with the dissent that the existence of a viable defense does not render district court jurisdiction inappropriate.see,post at op.of martin,dissenting commercial drapery contractors,united states,noting that the existence of relevant issues does not render a claim essentially contractual.for example,suppose the aforementioned armed federal agents had entered onto the truckers property without permission,asserting we are only pumping fuel here because the contracts say we can.in such a situation,i would have no difficulty finding district court jurisdiction over the truckers fifth amendment trespass claims,despite the fact that the government defense would rely exclusively on rights granted by contract.however,the appropriate inquiry in which i take the majority opinion to have engaged,and with which i agree does not take possible defenses into account.rather,it examines the claims to determine their underlying source and whether the claims are merely being artfully pleaded to avoid the cda jurisdictional bar.in the instant case such an inquiry results in a determination that the truckers complaint effectively asserts only contractual causes of action cloaked in language.i reach this conclusion without reference to the usps possible defenses.
further,i agree with the majority that the fact that the truckers have claimed that the usps actions in attempting to enforce its contracts were contrary to its regulations and were arbitrary and capricious does not automatically render such claims.the dissent evaluates these claims facially without examining the effect that its proposed holding would have on the cda enforcement scheme.it stretches the imagination to think of a contract dispute that could not be argued under a contrary to controlling regulations or arbitrary and capricious theory.see,int l eng g,div.of,richardson,i t is hard to conceive of a claim falling no matter how squarely within the cda which could not be urged to involve as well agency error subject to review under the apa.see also megapulse,at a plaintiff whose claims against the united states are essentially contractual should not be allowed to avoid the jurisdictional restrictions of the cda by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute and enlarged waivers of sovereign immunity,as under the apa.as a result,mere acceptance of a plaintiff assertion of district court jurisdiction over such due process style claims can not be proper.
in such a case,a court should determine whether the underlying claim is essentially contractual or not.failure to engage in this sort of artful pleading analysis would result in the effective evisceration of the jurisdictional bar of the state of affairs congress can not have intended.i thus agree with the majority that such an inquiry is required over these sorts of due process claims,and that the claims at issue in the instant case are essentially contractual for these purposes.
finally,regardless of how one characterizes the remedies requested by the truckers,the outcomes the truckers expect from their requested remedies could,as the majority notes,just as easily be gained from a reformation of the contracts at issue.this remedy is well within the power of the court of federal claims.see,beta,united states.as a result,and in contrast to the dissent,i would find that the fact that the specific remedies requested by the truckers are not within the court of federal claims power should not weigh against exclusive court of federal claims jurisdiction.
accordingly,i concur in affirming the judgment of the district court.
the sole issue presented in this case is whether the district court properly dismissed the truckers claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the contract disputes act.i am convinced that the district court erred,as has the majority,by misconstruing this circuit precedent.i therefore respectfully dissent.
given the review of the facts contained in the majority opinion,i see no need to restate them here.i do,however,take this opportunity to articulate briefly why i am compelled to dissent from the en banc court disposition of this case.i begin by discussing the existing legal framework in this context,and then consider how the claims presented by the truckers should be decided consistent with the principles within that framework.
the united states postal service is an agency of the united states and thus enjoys sovereign immunity,except to the extent that it is waived.in,congress generally waived the postal service immunity by enacting the postal reorganization act,which allows the postal service to sue and be sued in its official name.the act expressly gives the united states district courts original but not exclusive jurisdiction over all actions brought by or against the postal service.a see also providing an additional basis for federal district court jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to the postal service.
in,congress enacted the contract disputes act,which divests federal district courts of subject matter jurisdiction over some contractual disputes involving the federal government.see,campanella commerce exch.bank,cir holding that the contract disputes act divests the district court of subject matter jurisdiction presumably granted by a clause applicable to the small business administration.the contract disputes act provides that a ll claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.a emphasis added.the decision rendered by the contracting officer is then reviewable only by an agency board of contracting appeals,or by the court of federal claims,a.
consequently,if claims against the postal service relat e to a contract under the contract disputes act,then sovereign immunity has not been waived and the federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims.in such a case,the claims could only be brought before the court of federal claims.if,however,the claims do not relat e to a contract,sovereign immunity has been waived and the district court would presumably have jurisdiction.
fortunately,this court,along with our sister circuits,has given meaning to the vague relat e to a contract language contained in the contract disputes act.in rmi titanium westinghouse electric,cir,a panel of this court,relying on the district of columbia circuit decision in megapulse,lewis,established the test for whether claims relat e to a contract under the contract disputes act in this circuit.there,we held that for the contract disputes act to apply,it must first be determined that the claims asserted are essentially contractual in nature.rmi titanium,at quoting megapulse,at emphasis added.in so holding,we adopted the following standard first articulated by the district of columbia circuit in megapulse the classification of a particular action as one which is or is not at its essence a contract action depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claim,and upon the type of relief sought or appropriate.id.quoting megapulse,at.a number of our sister circuits have also adopted this rights and remedies test announced in megapulse.see,up state fed.credit union walker,cir united states j e salvage,cir star alaska united states,cir.
the majority purports to follow megapulse rights and remedies test in holding that the federal district court does not have jurisdiction over any of the truckers claims.in my view,this application of the rights and remedies test not only denies federal government contractors their right to bring claims in federal district court,but it also misconstrues and contradicts existing case law in this and other circuits,thus creating an unnecessary split in the circuits.
in order to determine whether a claim is essentially contractual,we are first required to consider the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claim,and,second,the type of relief sought or appropriate.rmi titanium,at quoting megapulse,at.a brief look at each allegation proves instructive in illustrating why all but one of the truckers claims are essentially.
the first prong of the rights and remedies test requires this court to consider the nature of the rights upon which the plaintiffs base their claim.this inquiry does not focus on whether a contractual relationship exists between the parties,or whether the claims,as a whole,in some way involve contractual issues.see,finley,united states,cir noting that it would be improper to classify all claims raising contract issues as contract actions quoting instrument,united states,cir.instead,the relevant question is whether,despite the presence of an underlying contract between the parties,the rights asserted that form the basis of the claims are founded on the contract or on another ground,such as the constitution or a federal statute.
moreover,despite the majority unsupported claims to the contrary,the relevant inquiry under this test does not consider the defendant grounds for opposing the plaintiff claim in determining whether the claim is essentially contractual.in fact,the language of the rights and remedies test makes clear that the inquiry is focused on the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claim.id.emphasis added.the majority points to no legal support for its proposition that a defendant rebuttal grounds are relevant to this inquiry,instead quoting language stating that a plaintiff title or characterization of its claims is not controlling,and that a plaintiff may not avoid the jurisdictional bar of the contract disputes act merely by alleging violations of regulatory or statutory provisions.b b trucking,united states postal,cir en banc opinion quoting rmi titanium,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the megapulse court stated in establishing the applicable rights and remedies test 
contract issues may arise in various types of cases where the action itself is not founded on a contract.a license,for example,may be raised as a defense in an action for trespass,or a purchase contract may be raised to counter an action for conversion.but the mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not,by triggering some mystical metamorphosis,automatically transform an action based on trespass or conversion into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have.
