opinion of the court 
john doe,an anonymous plaintiff,sued under,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from aspects of pennsylvania registration of sexual offenders act megan law.et.pennsylvania megan law requires all convicted sex offenders to register with state and local police,and subjects certain offenders to community notification.the suit involves the application of these requirements to a pennsylvania resident who was convicted of a sexual offense in new jersey,and sought to return to his home state to serve his parole.under the provisions of pennsylvania megan law,any sex offender who transfers his supervision to pennsylvania is subject to community notification.by contrast,an individual who was convicted of the same offense in pennsylvania would only be subject to community notification if,after a civil hearing,he had been designated a sexually violent predator due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.the district court concluded that the disparate treatment of offenders violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.the commonwealth of pennsylvania has appealed.we will affirm.
we have borrowed liberally from the factual background section,and the carefully reasoned opinion of judge pollak.see doe mcvey et,d.john doe,a pennsylvania resident,was arrested for molesting an girl in new jersey.he pleaded guilty to second degree sexual assault and was sentenced to five years probation and parole supervision for life.in the sentencing report,the new jersey judge found that d efendant sexual deviation is not compulsive nor repetitive and it appears was the result of an intoxicated condition on the evening of the offense and that doe was unlikely to commit another offense.
ordinarily under new jersey megan law,doe would then have a civil hearing to determine whether his likelihood of recidivism was sufficiently substantial as to warrant his being made a subject of community notification.however,because doe intended to return to pennsylvania to complete his sentence,new jersey did not hold a community notification hearing.at sentencing,doe requested that his supervision be transferred to pennsylvania in accordance with the interstate compact concerning parole and probation the compact.stat.ann,to which both new jersey and pennsylvania were signatories doe signed an application for compact services and agreement to return,consenting to some differences in probationary supervision in the two states doe was allowed to travel to pennsylvania pending acceptance of his application to transfer his probation.
upon receiving doe application,the pennsylvania board of probation and parole held an equivalency hearing in which it determined that,had doe been convicted in pennsylvania,he would have been guilty of indecent assault.a.where,as here,the victim is under age thirteen,indecent assault constitutes a misdemeanor in the first degree and is designated a sexually violent offense.see,a.
doe registered with the pennsylvania state police as a sex offender,but refused to consent to community notification without some assessment to determine whether he posed any danger to the community.as a result,the pennsylvania board of probation and parole denied doe application for transfer of probation and informed him that he had to leave the commonwealth.doe filed an administrative appeal of that decision,and without awaiting disposition of the administrative appeal,filed a section action doe alleged that,by treating him differently from offenders,the board,board chairman william ward,and state police commissioner paul evanko violated his constitutional right to equal protection and due process as well as his statutory rights under the interstate compact concerning parole the board has given doe permission to remain in pennsylvania pending resolution of his administrative appeal,and has stayed that appeal until his section action is final.
the commonwealth filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.the district court denied that motion without prejudice and ordered the parties to submit for summary judgment limited to the claim that community notification,as applied to doe,violated the interstate compact.doe.bd.of prob.parole,wl,dist.lexis.july.after the parties submitted those motions,the district court granted the commonwealth motion for summary judgment,and invited the parties to their motions for judgment on the pleadings on the constitutional claims in doe complaint.doe.bd.of prob.parole,dist.lexis.
the district court had federal question jurisdiction under.we exercise jurisdiction over this appeal under.our standard of review for judgment on the pleadings is plenary.sikirica nationwide ins,cir citing jablonski pan am.world airways,cir.
pennsylvania megan law has undergone three distinct enactments.the act was first passed in.the version of the law being challenged in this appeal was enacted in and is referred to as megan law ii.a final revision of the law took effect in january of,megan law iii and requires that all offenders both and be listed on the pennsylvania state police website as a component of community notification.pennsylvania megan law statute sets forth the purpose for registering sexual offenders 
it is hereby declared to be the intention of the general assembly to protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this commonwealth by providing for registration and community notification regarding sexually violent predators who are about to be released from custody and will live in or near their neighborhood.
ann.b emphasis added.to accomplish this goal,megan law ii creates two separate levels of notification registration with the local law enforcement agencies,and community notification.doe does not challenge the law registration provision and indeed,has registered with the appropriate authorities.this appeal challenges the manner is which the community notification provision is applied to offenders.
the community notification provisions apply to offenders who have been adjudicated as sexually violent predators and all offenders regardless of their offense and without adjudication who have transferred their probation to the commonwealth.ann.the community notification is carried out by the chief law enforcement officer in the particular jurisdiction by disseminating fliers that contain the offender photo,name,address and some indication that he is a sex offender.these fliers are given to neighbors,school superintendents,school principals,directors and college presidents,charging those individuals with the responsibility of informing individuals whose duties include supervision of or responsibility for students.ann.a and b.a municipality chief law enforcement officer is to make these fliers available to the general public upon request.ann.d.
before ordering community notification in the case of an offender,megan law ii provides a comprehensive assessment procedure to determine whether the offender is a sexually violent predator.first,the state sexual offenders board evaluates the offender.the board reviews the nature of the offense,the circumstances surrounding the offense and the offender character and history.the board submits a written report containing its assessment to the district attorney.if upon reviewing the board assessment,the district attorney believes community notification is warranted,he must file a praecipe with the court of common pleas,request a hearing,and serve the praecipe and the board report on defense counsel.an adversarial hearing,with full trial procedures,is held to determine whether the offender is a sexually violent predator.at this hearing,the commonwealth bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the offender is a sexually violent predator.the offender has a right to be heard,and to call and witnesses,including expert witnesses.he has a right to appointed counsel,if he can not afford a private attorney.
by contrast,all offenders who transfer parole to pennsylvania are subject to the community notification provisions,regardless of their offense of conviction or their potential danger to the community.the statute provides that any individual who is paroled to the commonwealth pursuant to the interstate compact or the supervision of parolees and probationers shall,in addition to the registration requirements,be subject to the requirements of section of the act.ann.e.the referenced provision provides that the parolee must submit to mandatory registration and public notification of all current addresses.stat.ann.d.
further.con.stat.ann.e mandates that fliers be for all offenders and given by the local police department to neighbors,centers,school superintendents and various other individuals near the sexual offender residence.ann.e.under megan law ii,these fliers are only published for individuals who are deemed to be sexually violent predators.ann.a.
under this statutory scheme,there is no procedure in which it is determined whether an offender poses a danger to the community,thereby triggering the community notification provisions.an offender is given the benefit of an extensive adjudicatory process to determine if he will be subject to community notification.doe,as an offender,was not given a hearing at all.instead,without judicial decision,or any other determination whatsoever that doe was a sexually violent predator,the commonwealth simply required doe to submit to community notification.
as a first inquiry,we must avoid deciding a constitutional question if the case may be disposed of on some other basis.spicer hilton,cir see also kelly railroad retirement,cir sloviter,concurring we are constrained to avoid passing upon a constitutional question if the case might be disposed of on statutory grounds and we should not reach to decide a constitutional issue,however intriguing.
thus,we begin by examining whether this issue may be resolved under the interstate compact for adult offender supervision.before doing so,however,we need to determine whether we have jurisdiction to undertake such an examination.put another way,we must decide whether the compact is a state or federal law.
the parole compact provides in pertinent part 
entered into by and among the contracting states,signatories hereto,with the consent of the congress of the united states of america granted by an act,entitled an act granting the consent of congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes.
the contracting states solemnly agree 
that it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact herein called the sending state to permit any person,convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole,to reside in any other state party to this compact herein called receiving state while on probation or parole,if 
a such person is in fact a resident of or has family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there.
a though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there,the receiving state consents to such person being there.
before granting such permission,opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.
a resident of the receiving state,within the meaning of this section,is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state,and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.
that each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of,and supervision over,probationers or parolees of any sending state,and,in the exercise of those duties,will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.
we have not,nor has the supreme court decided whether the interstate parole compact is federal or a state law.we must now do so because federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin state officials on the basis of state law.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.in doe ward,d,the district court held that the interstate compact on probation and parole is both a state and federal law,explaining 
a n interstate compact is transformed into federal law when it falls within the scope of the constitution compact clause,it has received congressional consent,and its subject matter is appropriate for congressional legislation.cuyler adams,d the interstate compact satisfies each of these conditions.
first the need to assert control of people subject to the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system,whether individuals with detainers or parolees,is a matter that falls within the scope of the constitution compact clause.second,the interstate parole compact has received congressional consent.in fact,the legislative source of the congressional consent is the same for both the iad interstate agreement on subject of cuyler and the interstate parole compact.lastly,the subject matter is appropriate for congressional legislation,as the need for interstate cooperation to monitor and control parolees is the same as it is for inmates with detainers.
id.at.adopting the reasoning of the district court in ward,supra,and applying the factors set forth in cuyler,supra,the district court herein held that the parole compact,as a interstate compact,is federal law as well as state law.we agree.
the first avenue by which we may divert our decision from constitutional issues,is to see whether a private cause of action and remedy exists within the interstate compact itself.see cannon of chicago,d t he fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.the district court opined that congress did not intend to create an enforceable federal right under for probationers and parolees through the compact.we agree.
in gonzaga doe,d,the supreme court took up the question of whether the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa,created an enforceable right under section.the court held that an act of congress must unambiguously confer individual rights upon a particular class of beneficiaries for a right of action under section to exist.gonzaga,at.
to determine whether a statute creates enforceable rights,we consider two indicia of legislative intent.first,we look to statutory text for rights creating language.alexander sandoval,d.such language has generally been the most accurate indicator of the propriety of implication of a cause of action.cannon,at.statutory language that is is explicit in conferring a right directly on a class of persons that includes the plaintiff in a particular case.see also gonzaga,at.the statute text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited.citations omitted.in contrast,general regulatory language or statutory language customarily found in criminal statutes and other laws enacted for the protection of the general public provide far less reason to infer a remedy in favor of individual persons.cannon,at.that is to say,statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.sandoval,at.citations omitted.
absent rights creating language,we look to whether the statutory structure evinces an internal enforcement scheme.the supreme court advises that,where a statute provides an administrative review process,but does not provide judicial sanctions,the express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.sandoval,at.see also karahalios fed of fed.employees,d i t is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a remedy,courts must be especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.quoting transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d.
because the compact does not manifest either expressly or indirectly an intent to create a federal right or remedy,we hold that the compact itself does not create an enforceable right.the language of the compact itself creates rights for the various states who are signatories to it.it does not create rights for probationers or parolees.notably,the title under which congress approved the compact an act granting the consent of congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes supports our inference that congress approved the compact as a means of aiding the states in crime prevention,not as a vehicle to provide procedural rights for probationers and parolees 
at the second point of inquiry,the probation compact regulates interactions among the states,delineating one state rights and responsibilities to another.regarding the strictures imposed by one state on probationers from another,the compact described such requirements as duties that will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.stat.ann.as was the case in sandoval,the compact here focuses upon the state entities regulated by the standards,rather than the individuals protected.sandoval,at.the compact,we conclude,creates no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.id.
lastly,the compact has no mechanism by which to enforce the alleged rights of probationers or parolees.the compact mentions neither court adjudication nor administrative proceedings.these omissions further lead us to conclude that congress did not intend to create an enforceable federal right for probationers or parolees under this compact.
we hold that doe does not have a private right of action under section to enforce the provisions of the interstate compact because one can not be inferred from its terms.
however,that does not end our contractual inquiry.interstate compacts are formal agreements between states,and hence,are contracts subject to the principles of contract law a compact is,after all,a contract.petty bridge comm n,d,frankfurter,dissenting.it remains a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms.texas new mexico,at.west virginia ex rel.dyer sims.interstate compacts may be considered contracts because of the manner in which they are enacted there is an offer the presentation of a reciprocal law to state legislatures,an acceptance the actual enactment of the law and consideration the settlement of a dispute or the creation of a regulatory scheme.see aveline.bd.prob.parole,
although a common law contract directly affects only the rights and obligations of the individual parties to it,an interstate compact may have a direct impact upon the larger population,the economy,and the physical environment in the whole of the compact area.therefore,although pennsylvania and new jersey are the obvious parties to the compact,we must decide whether doe has any rights under this contract as a beneficiary.this is an issue of first impression.
the supreme court has held that an interstate compact is like a contract to the extent that it is a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms,texas new mexico,d.because a compact is a contract,and must be enforced according to its terms,we do not have authority to provide relief that is inconsistent with its terms.texas new mexico,d.when interpreting an interstate compact,we must address disputes under the compact just as if we were addressing a federal statute or a federal contract.absent a federal statute making state statutory or common law applicable,federal law controls,and absent federal statutory guidance,the governing rule of decision must be fashioned by the federal court in the mode of the common law.oneida indian nation county of oneida,d.
in addition to the parties to a contract,beneficiaries of the contract can also enforce its terms.for either pennsylvania or federal law on beneficiaries we look to the restatement of contracts definition.see restatement second of contracts see owens haas,cir,cert.denied,d.under the restatement,a third party can claim rights under a contract,even if not stated expressly,if it is consonant with the intention of the contracting parties.section states as follows 
intended and incidental beneficiaries 
unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee,a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intentions of the parties and either 
a the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary or 
b the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.
an incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary.
restatement second of contracts.
thus,we have two tests for determining beneficiary status.the first one requires the parties to indicate in the agreement itself that the third party is a beneficiary.the second test does not require that the purported beneficiary be adverted to directly in the contract but,if not,status will be conferred only if circumstances compel us to recognize such a status in order to effectuate the intention of the parties.
the first test offers doe no relief.the interstate compact does not specifically indicate that doe,or for that matter any parolee,is a beneficiary under the second test he fares no better.here,the intentions of the parties must be discerned from the document itself.langer monarch life ins,cir citing hutchison sunbeam coal.
the parties to this compact have set forth their intentions quite clearly 
it is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder,through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protection of the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community to provide for the effective tracking,supervision,and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states and to equitably distribute the costs,benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
the compact speaks of cooperation between states,protection of the rights of victims,regulation and control of offenders across state borders and the tracking,supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders.in short,no explicit obligation appears in the compact and there is no compelling evidence that,by entering into the compact,pennsylvania and new jersey implicitly intended to give legally enforceable rights to doe.doe and similarly situated parolees are not beneficiaries of this compact they are merely the subjects of it.hence,we may now turn to doe constitutional arguments,specifically his assertion that the commonwealth disparate treatment of and offenders violated his rights to equal protection.
doe does not challenge the registration requirements of pennsylvania megan law.indeed,he has complied with them since returning to the commonwealth.he claims only that the law community notification provisions violate the equal protection clause as they relate to him and other offenders.in reviewing a claim that government action violates the equal protection clause,we must first determine the appropriate standard by which we are to review the claim.donatelli mitchell,cir.if state action does not burden a fundamental constitutional right or target a suspect class,the challenged classification must be upheld if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.id.quoting fcc beach communications,d.if the challenged state action involves a suspect classification based on race,alienage or national origin,or infringes on a fundamental constitutional right,we must apply the strict scrutiny standard.id.
the district court did not decide whether doe has a fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny,deciding instead that the commonwealth disparate treatment could not survive the lower threshold rational basis review.because we also conclude that the commonwealth restrictions would not survive the lower threshold of rational basis review,we likewise do not reach the issue.
if a statute neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class,it does not violate equal protection so long as it bears a rational relationship to some legitimate end.romer evans,d.a statute will be considered constitutional under rational basis review if there is any reasonably conceivable set of facts that could provide a rational basis for it.fcc beach communications,d.although this is a low threshold,the supreme court has nonetheless instructed that even in the ordinary equal protection case calling for the most deferential standards,we insist on knowing the relation between the classification adopted and the object to be obtained.id.at.
here,the commonwealth argues that its interest in public safety is a legitimate concern,and that its practice of treating and offenders differently is rationally related to its efforts at alleviating this concern.we readily agree that protecting its citizens from sex offenses committed by repeat offenders is a legitimate state interest.the question,however,is whether the commonwealth denial of equivalent process to both and state parolees is rationally related to its security concerns.we conclude it is not.
the commonwealth offers four rationales to explain how its disparate treatment is rationally related to its public safety goals.first,the commonwealth argues it is impossible to replicate the legal proceedings it provides offenders for offenders.second,the commonwealth argues that providing such proceedings to offenders would increase time and expense.the commonwealth next argues that the harshness of community notification differs for and offenders.finally,the commonwealth argues that the publicity given to a sex offender trial in pennsylvania rationalizes the disparate treatment of offenders whose trials are less likely to receive media attention in the commonwealth.
turning to its specific attempts to rationalize the disparate treatment,the commonwealth first argues that it would be impossible to replicate the process it affords offenders for offenders.the pennsylvania legislature,contrary to this argument,has outlined its responsibilities and obligations under the interstate compact,and indeed has statutorily promised to the other signatory states that it would provide doe,and others similarly situated,with the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.stat.ann.
by signing the interstate compact,pennsylvania has agreed that,when accepting probationers who transfer their parole and their residence to the commonwealth,it will approximate the same procedures and standards it applies to its own probationers.there is no evidence on this record that the commonwealth has even tried.
furthermore,the commonwealth assertion that in deciding whether an parolee transferee is a sexually violent predator,a pennsylvania judge would have more evidence about an offender does not hold water.we acknowledge,and doe concedes,that judges who have presided over an offender trial will most likely have more information about a particular defendant,his criminal history and other relevant circumstances.
nonetheless,other avenues of evidence are readily available to the parties.for example,any investigation recommendation conducted by the transferring state can be made available to the soas.certainly in this digital age court records,transcripts,hearing records and reports can be transmitted interstate electronically.there is no doubt that the commonwealth can accomplish its goal of ensuring the public safety of its citizens and yet assure probationers and parolees procedural rights equivalent to that which it offers offenders.
the commonwealth contention is that offenders may have benefited from rehabilitative sexual therapy,thereby placing offenders at a disadvantage,need not detain us long.under pennsylvania law,the goal of its community notification program is to identify the sexually violent predator and notify the community where the predator resides.whether a particular sexual predator has received therapy or treatment is not germane to his identity and location.indeed,there is no evidence that the fliers used for community notification purposes indicate whether the particular offender has received treatment.the commonwealth argument here does not justify the disparate treatment at issue and is not rationally related to its public safety goals.
interestingly,the difference in the harshness of the community notification between and offenders is also given by the commonwealth as a rational reason for its disparate treatment.this contention is not only irrational but illogical.the commonwealth argues that offenders who are determined to be sexually violent predators are subjected to community notification for life whereas offenders are subjected to such notification for the length of their supervision.first,new jersey has sentenced doe to lifetime supervision,so the comparison is wholly misplaced.additionally,as doe points out,the commonwealth is comparing the wrong group of offenders.we agree.a comparison of offenders not deemed sexually violent predators and offenders reveals that these offenders are excused from community notification whereas all offenders are subjected to such notification.given the opportunity,doe would argue that he does not meet the statutory definition of a sexually violent predator.he should have that opportunity.
next,the commonwealth argues that providing doe an opportunity to challenge his status as a sexually violent predator would increase costs and time devoted to such a task.that,while possibly true,is wholly irrelevant.the commonwealth promised to treat all parolees,and,the same under the compact.by agreeing to the dictates of the interstate compact,the commonwealth determined that the burden of additional costs is outweighed by the benefits provided by the compact.indeed,one of the stated purposes of the interstate compact is to equitably distribute the costs,benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.stat.ann.it can not now argue that concerns about increased costs and expenses are rationally related to its ultimate public safety the interstate compact seeks to reach through the equitable distribution of costs and expenses.
as a final rationalization for the disparate treatment,the commonwealth contends that pennsylvania communities are less likely to have information about a particular offense through media coverage and general public discourse if that offense had been committed outside the state.we conclude,as did the district court,that this geographic argument is and meritless.for certain,residents of local communities may have about an sexual offender.however,the same is likely to be true about offenders.this lack of general information is one of the principal reasons megan law was enacted in the first place.indeed,the crime that inspired the first megan law was committed by a,sexual predator,a fact unknown to his new neighbors.see paul farmer,cir citing verniero,cir.because any concerns over the public lack of information about sexual offenders applies equally to offenders,the commonwealth proffer simply does not rationalize pennsylvania disparate treatment of the two groups,nor does it correlate the illegitimate procedural disparity to its legitimate public safety goal.
the supreme court has cautioned that equal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.beach communications,at.we undertake no such exercise here.indeed,we care not.we are only requiring of it,the performance it agreed to.we do not the actions of the commonwealth in becoming a signatory to the interstate merely suggest that it must hold to its agreement.there are no exceptions in the compact to excuse,or partial performance.
we conclude,that the commonwealth approval and participation in the interstate compact invalidates any rational connection between the compact stated goals and the commonwealth disparate treatment of and offenders.as a signatory to the interstate compact,the commonwealth has agreed to abide by its terms,and it must.because the commonwealth has agreed to adhere to the dictates of the interstate compact,it can not now argue that its reasons for violating the compact are rational.
although the supreme court has acknowledged that an interstate compact is like a contract to the extent that it is a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms,texas new mexico,d,the court has also recognized the unique features and functions of such a compact.an interstate compact is one of two methods under our constitution of settling controversies between states,petty bridge comm n,d,and it performs high functions in our federalism,id.at.see also felix frankfurter james landis,the compact clause of the study in interstate adjustments,yale,discussing history of compact clause.put another way,an interstate compact represents a political compromise between constituent elements of the union,as opposed to a commercial transaction.hess port auth,d.such an agreement is made to address interests and problems that do not coincide nicely either with the national boundaries or with state that may be badly served or not served at all by the ordinary channels of national or state political action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,the interstate compact reflects the collective wisdom not only of the pennsylvania general assembly and the new jersey legislature,but also that of the other signatory states and the united states congress as to how best to deal with the interstate movements of adult offenders.it is the stated purpose of the interstate compact to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and to protect the rights of victims through control and regulation of the interstate movements of offenders in the community.stat.ann.
as we have previously indicated,the commonwealth requires every probationer convicted of a sex offense to submit to community notification under megan law ii.stat.ann.d.in pennsylvania,submission to community notification is a prerequisite to the acceptance of an probationer transfer under the compact.id.this prerequisite,however,changes the terms of the compact because it places additional conditions on the transfer of parolees and probationers who otherwise satisfy its other requirements.having entered into this compact,the commonwealth may not unilaterally change its terms.by becoming a signatory to the compact,pennsylvania is required to provide doe with the same process it affords offenders before subjecting him to community notification.
once new jersey granted permission for doe to return to pennsylvania,pennsylvania was required to assume supervision over doe and to treat him the same as offenders.the commonwealth has not done so and in treating doe and other parolees differently,it violates its own agreement failing to do precisely what it promised that offenders will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.stat.ann.
the commonwealth arguments are further undercut by subsequent legislation.while the district court decision was pending,the general assembly amended megan law,effective january,megan law iii.this version of the statute altered the statutory scheme governing when sex offenders are subjected to community notification fliers within the commonwealth by amending its registration requirements.megan law iii requires registration of individuals convicted of offenses specified in now includes individuals currently residing in this commonwealth who have been convicted of similar sexual offenses under the laws of another state.ann.because offenders are now specifically listed in,they are included in the assessment procedures outlined later in the statute.section of the statute provides that individuals who were convicted of an offense listed in as offenders now are,shall,upon court order,be assessed by the board to determine if they should be classified as a sexually violent predator.see.ann.a,b.ann.a,b.this assessment procedure makes no distinction between and offenders,contemplating only those individuals identified in.
under this provision,various enumerated factors are to be reviewed before a determination is made as to the offender sexually violent predator status.these factors include whether the offense involved multiple victims,the nature of the sexual contact with the victim,relationship of the individual to the victim,the age of the victim,the offender prior offenses and characteristics of the offender such as the offender age,use of illegal drugs,mental illness and any other mental disabilities or abnormalities.see.ann.b.someone convicted of an offense specified in,upon court order,be provided a hearing,notice,the right to call witnesses,the right to counsel and to the assistance of expert to be conducted before any determination of whether he,as an offender,could be classified as a sexually violent offender and be subjected to community notification by police flier.ann.e.
this essential difference is exactly what doe seeks.inexplicably,the commonwealth argues that what is rational for an offender today,can not be applied to an individual like doe whose crimes were committed before.
megan law iii is further support for doe argument that the reasons proffered by the commonwealth to support its disparate treatment of offenders are meritless and,hence,irrational.the commonwealth argues that it can not offer full due process for offenders.yet,since january,it has been affording offenders the opportunity to challenge their status as sexually violent offenders.it simply is not rational for the commonwealth to claim it can not provide equal treatment to offenders under megan law ii when it is practically doing so under megan law iii 
in summary,we note that pennsylvania interest in protecting its citizens from sexually violent predators is certainly compelling.however,subjecting state sex offenders to community notification without providing equivalent procedural safeguards as given to sex offenders is not rationally related to that goal.the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.
when the pennsylvania legislature passed megan law ii,it decided to require community notification for all sex offenders subject to registration who are paroled into the commonwealth,but to require community notification for sex offenders only if they were deemed to be sexually violent predator s following a hearing.because this legislative decision is reviewed under the rational basis test and because i believe it satisfies that easily met standard,i must respectfully dissent 
rational basis review applies 
the fourteenth amendment forbids the states to deny to any person within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,but does not prevent the states from making reasonable classifications among such persons.life ins.state bd.of equalization,d.as the supreme court has long recognized,u nless a classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race,religion,or alienage,our decisions presume the constitutionality of the statutory discriminations and require only that the classification challenged be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.city of new orleans dukes,d see also romer evans,d i f a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class,we will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.conversely,classifications that discriminate against a suspect class or violate an individual fundamental constitutional rights receive strict scrutiny.donatelli mitchell,cir.such fundamental rights include the right to marry,see,loving virginia,d,the right to custody of one children,see,santosky kramer,d,the right to vote,see,yick wo hopkins,and the right to interstate travel.see,united states guest,d.
our first task,therefore,is to ascertain the proper level of constitutional review id.doe asserts that the pennsylvania statute burdens his fundamental right to interstate travel and that the commonwealth classification therefore must satisfy strict scrutiny because doe status,first as a probationer and then as an individual subject to parole supervision for life,necessarily limits his constitutional right to travel,i conclude that the commonwealth alleged restrictions on that right are subject simply to rational basis review.
the supreme court most recent and comprehensive explanation of the right to interstate travel is found in saenz roe,d.the court concluded that this right consists of three components the right of a citizen of one state to enter and leave another state,the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state,and,for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents,the right to be treated like other citizens of that state.id.at.
doe argues that,because under megan law ii all sex offenders paroled into pennsylvania are subject to community notification but sex offenders are only subject to community notification if they are deemed sexually violent predator s following a hearing,his right to be treated equally in his new state of residence has been violated.id.at.the commonwealth concedes that megan law ii treats differently sex offenders who committed their offenses out of state and are then transferred to pennsylvania under the compact and sex offenders who were convicted in the commonwealth.it argues,however,that doe status as a convicted sex offender subject to parole supervision for life necessarily limits his right to interstate travel.i conclude this contention is correct.
in jones helms,d,the supreme court recognized that individuals who have committed crimes do not have an unqualified right to interstate travel despite the fundamental nature of this right to interstate travel,there nonetheless are situations in which a state may prevent a citizen from leaving.most obvious is the case in which a person has been convicted of a crime id.at.the court went on to hold that even if a person is not currently incarcerated for or even charged with a crime,that person criminal conduct necessarily qualified his right to interstate travel.id.at.similarly,the court has pointed out that probationers and parolees do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,but only conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special probation restrictions.griffin wisconsin,d quoting morrissey brewer,d see also united states knights,d just as other punishments for criminal convictions curtail an offender freedoms,a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by citizens.
our court likewise has recognized that conditions of probation include restrictions on a defendant right to travel.united states warren,cir.and the courts of appeals to address directly the right to interstate travel for those on probation or parole have all concluded that the right is either limited or.see williams wisconsin,cir like prisoners,parolees have no right to control where they live in the united states the right to travel is extinguished for the entire balance of their sentences.bagley harvey,cir a n individual constitutional right to travel,having been legally extinguished by a valid conviction followed by imprisonment,is not revived by the change in status from prisoner to parolee.berrigan sigler,holding that any rights parolees had to travel were necessarily limited because those rights of necessity are conditioned by the situation in which their convictions placed them.
when doe initially sought permission to move to pennsylvania,he was serving a probationary sentence.his sentence of probation ended in,but,pursuant to new jersey law,as a convicted sex offender doe sentence also included a special sentence of parole supervision for life.stat.ann.under the statute,p ersons serving a special sentence of parole supervision for life remain in the legal custody of the commissioner of corrections,shall be supervised by the division of parole of the state parole board,and shall be subject to conditions appropriate to protect the public id.
doe status as a probationer at the time he filed his suit,and as subject to lifelong supervised parole now,necessarily means that he was not,and is not now or ever,entitled to the full panoply of constitutional rights enjoyed by the average citizen.doe contends that the cases recognizing the limits on parolees and probationers right to interstate travel do not apply because they do not involve the third component of the right to travel recognized by right of those who elect to become permanent residents to be treated like other citizens.but doe offers no reasons why this distinction matters,and i know of none.his status as a convicted sex offender on parole necessarily places restrictions not only on his freedom of movement but also on other rights of citizenship because megan law ii applies the allegedly discriminatory requirement only to sex offenders whose rights to travel have been reduced by probation or parole it is less likely to be constitutionally suspect,obviating the need for strict scrutiny.
for this reason,although never directly addressed by the supreme court or our court,it appears uncontroversial that someone who has been convicted of a sexual offense and who continues to be subject to parole supervision has forfeited some portion of his constitutional right to interstate the right to be treated the same as the sexual offenders of the state in which he wishes to make his new home.because doe as a probationer or parolee is not entitled to an unqualified right to interstate travel,i conclude that restrictions on his exercise of that right should be subject to rational basis review.in other words,i would inquire whether the different treatment of him and similarly situated who are citizens of pennsylvania is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.
ii.the rational basis test is satisfied 
as our court has observed,the rational basis test is a very deferential standard.english bd.of educ.of boonton,cir.under rational basis review,a classification must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.united states walker,cir quoting heller doe,d.a statute is presumed constitutional,and t he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negate every conceivable basis which might support it.heller,at.quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d internal citations omitted.thus,equal protection principles are met so long as a plausible policy reason explains the classification and the relationship of the classification to its policy goal is not so weak as to suggest that the distinction is arbitrary or irrational.walker,at citing fitzgerald racing ass of cent.iowa,d.in this context,equal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.fcc beach commc ns,d see also dukes,at.t he judiciary may not sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.the threshold for upholding distinctions in a statute under rational basis review is extremely low,and it is not within the purview of the courts to conduct anything but a limited review of the reasons that legislation subject to review classifies among similarly situated persons.united states pollard,cir.e ven if the law seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular group,or if the rationale for it seems tenuous,romer,at,w here there are plausible reasons for the legislature action,our inquiry is at an end,beach commc ns,at.quoting ret.bd.fritz,d.
moreover,because we never require a legislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute,it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.id.at.in addition,a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.id.finally,courts are compelled under review to acc
