affiliated computer services,acs brought a declaratory judgment action against the bank of new york trust company bank of new york,later substituted by wilmington trust company wilmington trust,seeking a determination that acs was not in breach of an indenture agreement indenture entered into between acs and the bank of new york.wilmington trust filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that acs breached the indenture by failing timely to file a form with the securities and exchange commission sec,that acs breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and that acs violated a of the trust indenture act of tia.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted acs motion and entered judgment in favor of acs.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant facts are undisputed in this case.on june,acs entered into the indenture and supplemental indentures pursuant to which acs issued two sets of notes,one at and another at.the notes issued at,which are due on june,are the only notes relevant to this appeal.acs timely made interest payments on the notes.
the notes were publicly traded throughout the relevant time period,and thus,acs was required to file reports with the sec pursuant to sections and d of the securities exchange act of,d.acs form for was due to be filed with the sec on september.on september,acs filed a notification of late filing explaining that it was unable timely to file its because of an ongoing internal investigation into its historical stock option practices.acs eventually filed its with the sec on january,and two days later,it delivered a copy of the to wilmington trust.
the indenture contains the following event of default,among others acs fails to comply with any of its other covenants or agreements in,or provisions of,the securities of that series or this indenture indenture.in the event of default,the trustee may accelerate the notes by written notice and declare the principal and interest due and payable immediately.indenture.on september,cede,acting on behalf of beneficial owners,delivered a notice of default to acs and the bank of new york,the trustee at the time.on september,the bank of new york delivered a similar notice of default to acs,and on october,other holders of notes forwarded default notices to acs.the notices asserted that acs defaulted on the indenture by failing timely to file the form.cede delivered a demand to accelerate notes on september,and the bank of new york submitted a similar demand on october.both demands declared the principal and interest due and payable immediately.acs did not honor either acceleration notice.
acs responded to the notice of default by filing a declaratory judgment action on september,seeking a determination that it was not in default under the indenture.the bank of new york resigned as indenture trustee and wilmington trust succeeded as trustee and defendant in the declaratory judgment action.wilmington trust filed a counterclaim against acs,bringing claims for breach of contract based on and of the indenture,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and for violation of a of the tia.
section of the indenture provides in pertinent part as follows 
acs shall file with the trustee,within days after it files the same with the sec,copies of the annual reports and the information,documents and other reports or copies of those portions of any of the foregoing as the sec may by rules and regulations prescribe that acs is required to file with the sec pursuant to section or d of the exchange act.acs shall also comply with the provisions of tia a.
indenture a.section a of the tia similarly requires an issuer of bonds to 
file with the indenture trustee copies of the annual reports and of the information,documents,and other reports or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the commission may by rules and regulations prescribe which such obligor is required to file with the commission 
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court addressed the following issue whether the indenture requires acs to timely file with the trustee the reports that it files with the sec,even if the sec filings are themselves untimely.the court agreed with acs interpretation that the provisions merely require acs timely to file with the trustee the reports that acs has filed with the sec.the parties also briefed whether acceleration of the notes was proper.the district court did not address those arguments because the court found that acs was not in default.from the judgment in favor of acs,wilmington trust timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lemaire.dep t of transp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.legal questions of statutory construction and contract interpretation are also reviewed de novo.ex rel dickson hood,cir gonzalez denning,cir.the indenture provision specifies that it is to be governed and construed by new york law,while interpretation of the tia is a matter of federal law.see henderson stalder,cir.
iii.discussion 
wilmington trusts argues that acs failed timely to file its annual report with the sec and,after missing that filing,failed timely to file an annual report with the trustee.wilmington trust argues that this was a breach of the indenture and in violation of a of the tia,and it asserts three reasons why acs and the district court interpretations to the contrary are wrong.first,wilmington trust argues that a of the tia requires acs to provide the trustee with copies of reports that it is required to file with the sec,and it does not limit the requirement to only reports that are actually filed.second,wilmington trust contends that acs failure timely to file reports with the sec was the failure of a condition precedent to its obligation to the trustee,and it can not take advantage of its failure to fulfill a condition precedent to argue that it has not breached its obligation to provide the trustee with the required reports.finally,wilmington trust relies on the purpose of the indenture to argue that acs was required to file with the trustee even though it did not timely file with the sec.we will address each of these arguments.
section a of the tia 
section a of the tia requires an issuer of bonds to file with the trustee copies of the annual reports which it is required to file with the sec.see a.the indenture also requires compliance with a,and acs does not dispute that it was required to comply with the provision of the section.the dispute turns on the interpretation of a,which is a matter of first impression for this court.wilmington trust contends that a requires acs to provide copies of the reports it is required to file with the sec regardless of whether acs actually filed the reports.acs argues that a requires that it only file with the trustee the reports that it has in fact filed with the sec.the district court held that obligates acs to file with wilmington trust copies of the reports and documents that acs files with the sec,but a does not require that acs file anything with the sec.
after the district court entered its judgment,the eighth circuit addressed this same issue in unitedhealth group wilmington trust,cir.in unitedhealth,the court held that tia a requires only that debt issuers forward to their trustees copies of such reports as are actually filed with the sec.id.at.the court explained that the tia reference to and d of the exchange act merely identifies which reports must eventually be forwarded to the trustee.it does not independently impose any particular timetable for filing nor does it incorporate the sec regulatory deadlines.id.at.
wilmington trust argues that sec rule and circumstances surrounding it demonstrate that the sec has interpreted the tia to require timely filing of sec reports.in,the sec issued the act order permitting companies normally audited by arthur andersen ll
