under a master netting,setoff,and security agreement netting agreement,reliant energy services,res and reliant energy services canada,resc collectively,reliant or reliant parties sought from enron canada corporation enron canada.reliant filed a breach of contract claim in federal court against enron canada seeking a declaratory judgment that the terms of the netting agreement made enron canada jointly liable for and an injunction requiring enron canada to pay this amount into the registry of the court.enron canada moved to dismiss the claim asserting lack of personal jurisdiction and,in the alternative,that reliant violated a a bankruptcy stay.the district court found that personal jurisdiction was not lacking,but agreed that the bankruptcy stay extended to the enron corporation also extended to its subsidiary,enron canada under the unusual circumstances exception articulated in robins piccinin,cir.the district court also found that the terms of the netting agreement imposed no liability on enron canada for the debts of other enron entities and denied reliant request for a preliminary injunction.for the following reasons,we conclude that the terms of the netting agreement are ambiguous,and therefore we vacate the district court decision and remand for further consideration.
background 
the dispute arises from a history of trading between reliant and five subsidiaries of the enron corporation.reliant and enron north america ena,enron broadband services,eba,ena upstream company,llc enaupscom,enron canada,and enron power marketing,epmi collectively,enron or enron parties executed and performed various master sales agreements that set forth the terms and conditions under which they traded,purchased and sold natural gas,electricity,and broadband data capacity underlying master agreements.each agreement was between a single enron party and a single reliant party and laid out the terms of their dealings in a single commodity or product.
reliant and the various enron subsidiaries performed under these underlying master agreements without incident for several years.in october,however,news agencies began publishing reports that questioned the enron corporation accounting practices and the accuracy of their financial statements.at that time,the enron parties approached the reliant parties with the proposed netting agreement which effectively combined all of the existing underlying master agreements into one single integrated agreement governing payment,settlement,collateral,security interests,defaults and other terms on november,the reliant parties and the enron parties executed the netting agreement.
the netting agreement provides that if one of the parties to an underlying master agreement defaulted on its obligations,the party could declare all of the underlying master agreements in default,otherwise referred to as.after giving all the parties notice of the default to the other parties,under section b,the underlying master agreements provision of the netting agreement,the party has the right to take the following actions 
i accelerate,terminate,and liquidate,or otherwise all transactions under its underlying master agreements as of such designated date ii exercise rights of setoff,netting recoupment in accordance with the terms of its underlying master agreements iii retain any collateral iv with respect to each defaulting party,withhold payment and performance of each party obligations to each defaulting party to pay,secure,setoff against,net,recoup such defaulting party obligations to such party v convert any obligation from one currency into another currency as set forth in section and vi take any other action permitted by law or in equity or by its underlying master agreements or any transactions thereunder necessary or appropriate to protect,preserve,or enforce its rights or to reduce any risk of loss or delay.
the exercise of the section b right to the transactions under the underlying master agreements results in a settlement amount for each underlying master agreement.the term settlement amount is defined as the net amount that is due and payable by one party to the other party in respect of an underlying master agreement upon the exercise by the party of the rights set forth in section b.emphasis added.the netting agreement provides that party means ena,epmi,ebs,enaupscom,ecc enron canada,res,and resc as the context indicates,and parties means all of the foregoing.section of the netting agreement provides for a netting or offsetting of the settlement amounts derived from each underlying master agreement to arrive at a final settlement amount that is payable by the group from whom such payment is due.moreover,it sets forth the procedure by which the final settlement amount is to be remitted 
on november,reliant issued notice to the enron parties,pursuant to section of the netting agreement that epmi was in default on the master power purchase and sale agreement,an underlying master agreement and therefore,that all of the enron parties were in default under the netting agreement.on december,the enron parties,except for enron canada,filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.thereafter,these enron parties were protected from suit through the automatic stay provision of a.after netting the settlement amount as required by section,reliant determined that the final settlement amount payable by the enron group to be on february,reliant sent notice to epmi through ena stating that a final settlement amount was due,but that no funds were forthcoming.the very next day,reliant sent a letter stating that n othing contained in the february letter was intended to be,nor should be construed to have been a violation of a,the automatic stay provision of chapter bankruptcy protection.
on february,reliant filed suit against enron canada,the only enron party which had not filed for bankruptcy protection reliant claimed that enron canada breached the netting agreement,seeking inter alia,injunctive relief and a declaration that enron canada was jointly liable for the under the netting agreement.enron canada filed a motion to dismiss,arguing,among other things,that it was not subject to the court jurisdiction,that reliant suit was subject to the automatic stay in bankruptcy,and that enron canada was not liable for the debts of its affiliates under the netting agreement.the district court dismissed reliant suit,finding that it was subject to the automatic stay and that enron canada did not owe to reliant under the netting agreement.
discussion 
does the netting agreement impose joint liability upon the enron parties 
the district court determined that generally the netting agreement does not impose an affirmative obligation on one party to cover all the debts of another.thus,as part of its analysis of whether to extend the bankruptcy stay to enron canada,the district court determined that the netting agreement limits the forms of recovery to which reliant is entitled.in particular,the district court determined that the language of the netting agreement unambiguously includes the right to terminate,liquidate,net,setoff,and apply collateral and does not include the right to impose joint liability on enron canada.
we review the district court interpretation of the master netting agreement de novo.a determination of whether a contract is ambiguous and the interpretation of a contract are questions of law,which on appeal are reviewed de novo.stinnett colorado interstate gas,cir.as this litigation involves the free trade of commodities with canada,a free trade area country,federal jurisdiction is based on and therefore,federal law governs the interpretation of the netting agreement.see united states taylor,cir i t is clear that federal law will control contracts between private parties if there is sufficient federal interest.a contract is ambiguous only if its meaning is susceptible to multiple interpretations.the mere fact that the parties may disagree on the meaning of a contractual provision is not enough to constitute ambiguity.when a contract is expressed in unambiguous language,its terms will be given their plain meaning and will be enforced as written.certain underwriters at lloyd london turner constr,cir.when interpreting a contract,the question is what was the parties intent,because courts are compelled to give effect to the parties intentions.pennzoil ferc,cir.to determine intent,we look to the plain language of the contract,its commercial context,and its purposes.see also,transnat l learning cmty at galveston,united states office of pers,cir a contract should be interpreted as to give meaning to all of its that every provision was intended to accomplish some purpose and that none are deemed superfluous.
both reliant and enron canada argue that the netting agreement is unambiguous in their respective favors.reliant asserts that use of the term group in section of the netting agreement the final settlement amount shall be payable by the group from whom such payment is due imposes liability on enron canada because it is part of the enron group.reliant also makes several arguments that the netting agreement imposes joint liability on enron canada.enron canada asserts that section embodies only two functions,neither of which imply joint liability.first,it obligates payment from the original group from whom the money was due consistent with the applicable underlying master agreement.second,it creates a mechanism for calculating the final settlement amount against that particular party after setoff.the primary difference between the two interpretations is that enron canada contends that the netting agreement only entitles reliant to set off the amount they owe to enron against the amount owed to them in order to calculate the final settlement amount while,reliant believes that they are entitled to not only set off the amounts,but also to choose from whom they wish to collect.though both parties argue that the contract unambiguously compels a finding in their favor,we disagree and find that the contract is ambiguous as to whether it imposes joint liability on the various enron parties.
if a contract imposes joint liability on several parties then all joint obligors are bound for the whole performance of the contract.this is the consistent view of the various treatises on contract law and the restatement second of contracts which is the law of this circuit as well see restatement second of contracts see also deleon lloyd london,certain underwriters,cir citing pitman.as a general rule,an obligation entered into by more than one person is presumed to be joint.williston on contracts,at ed.
this presumption will not be overcome unless there are either express words to render the obligation several or joint and several often referred to as words of severance the terms of the promise considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances indicate an intention to be bound severally,or jointly and severally or there is a statute that declares that every contract,though joint in its terms,is to be considered several as well as joint.
id.at.the restatement second of contracts similarly provides 
promises of the same performance 
where two or more parties to a contract make a promise or promises to the same promisee,the manifested intention of the parties determines whether they promise that the same performance or separate performances shall be given.
unless a contrary intention is manifested,a promise by two or more promisors is a promise that the same performance shall be given.
restatement second of contracts.also under,if promisors have entered a contract jointly then they are each bound for the whole performance.however,determining what parties are obligated under a,agreement is much more complicated.indeed,as corbin on contracts instructs,i t must be borne in mind that two or more persons may,by a single instrument containing only one promissory expression,bind themselves to pay wholly separate sums of money or to render any other entirely distinct performances.corbin on contracts at interim ed.corbin goes on to explain that parties may subscribe separate amounts but that this may come down to merely how a contract is interpreted.id.at.
as no statute exists to displace the joint obligations,this court must determine whether the netting agreement imposes several or joint obligations upon the enron parties looking to the contract for express words which might render the obligations several or joint and several,or whether the terms of the promise considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances indicate an intention to be bound severally,or jointly and severally.the sentence of section which is underlined in footnote supra is of critical importance in this regard.this sentence is an express covenant for payment of the amount of the final settlement amount at a date certain by the group from whom such payment is due.this covenant of payment is separate and distinct from all of the other covenants between the parties and is in our view the ultimate purpose of the netting agreement.the netting agreement states that the term group means enron group or counterparty group,as applicable.the netting agreement defines enron group to mean all enron parties.moreover,the netting agreement defines enron party as meaning any of ena,epmi,ebs,enaupscom,and ecc enron canada.
if the term all enron parties is inserted in place of the word group in the critical sentence of section of the contract,it would read the final settlement amount shall be payable by all enron parties from whom such payment is due on the third business day after such statement.the words from whom such payment is due would modify all enron parties which would seem to indicate that the particular party that owes money is obligated to pay.under this reading,the plain language of the netting agreement would impose no liability on enron canada to pay the final settlement owed to reliant as a result of epmi default under the master power purchase and sale agreement.such a reading could indicate that the language of section is intended to sever the obligation of each party to pay debts accrued under all of the underlying master agreements.see alexander wheeler,explaining that under new york law,words of severance are necessary to overcome a presumption of joint obligations.the difficulty with this reading,however,is that it renders the determination of the final settlement amount meaningless,for that amount is itself clearly a sum resulting from all of the various amounts owed between the enron parties and counterparties reliant on the underlying master sales agreements.in other words,it makes little sense for the parties to calculate a final settlement amount if that amount can not be collected from any entity.furthermore,this reading would negate the purpose of the right,found in section b,and the rights,found in section and annex a,which the netting agreement clearly contemplates for the benefit of the party.
however,the terms of section may also be reasonably read another way.the phrase from whom such payment is due could be read as modifying the word group and the word group means enron group or counter party group,as applicable.the phrase from whom such payment is due,therefore,permits us to determine which of the two meanings of the word group is applicable.there is no dispute that the final settlement amount was properly determined in accordance with the language of the netting agreement and the net balance owed was from the enron group to the counter party group,reliant.consequently,once used for this purpose the phrase from whom such payment is due would be surplusage and the relevant sentence could be interpreted as reading the final settlement amount shall be payable by all enron parties on the third business day after the statement is provided.under this interpretation of the contract language,all enron parties would be jointly liable to pay the final settlement amount.this raises the question,however,that if this was the intended meaning,why did the parties not repeat using the term defaulting group instead of group in section and omit the phrase from whom such payment is due all together.a possible explanation is that until the final settlement amount is actually determined as of the point in time when the right to close out all of the underlying agreements has been exercised,there is no way to predict whether the defaulting party will owe money to the party,or vice versa.therefore,the parties used the phrase by the group from whom such payment is due to cover either eventuality.adding additional confusion to this issue is the fact that the netting agreement makes no mention anywhere else amongst its provisions that the obligations are being entered into jointly as to payment of the final settlement amount.
viewing the master netting agreement as a whole adds no further illumination on the subject.the netting agreement purports to incorporate all of the underlying agreements between the various parties,but the only underlying agreement in the record on appeal is the master power purchase sale agreement between reliant and epmi and that underlying agreement,creates no rights to collect amounts owed from anyone but the parties involved in that particular contract.though the parties agree that the netting agreement creates the right to amounts owed between the different enron and reliant parties,this does not necessarily mean that the final settlement amount can be collected from any party unless that party is otherwise jointly and severally liable.in short,nothing in the netting agreement expressly states the parties intentions as to whether the final settlement amount is or is not a joint obligation of the members of the group from whom such payment is due.as such,we find that the netting agreement is ambiguous as to this point and particularly with respect to section and the meaning of the term group.the district court did not make a finding as to the intentions of the parties as it apparently felt the contract was unambiguous in favor of enron canada and granted summary judgment in enron favor.we disagree and find that the netting agreement is ambiguous and therefore remand this case to the district court to make a factual determination as to the intentions of the parties and,in particular,to determine the parties intended meaning of the term group in section.
does the bankruptcy stay extend to enron canada 
the district court also granted enron canada motion to dismiss based on the bankruptcy stay in place for the other enron entities.the district court based this decision,in part on robins piccinin,cir,and found that the present case constituted the type of unusual circumstances that should extend a bankruptcy stay.reliant claims that this case was an inappropriate extension of the bankruptcy stay provisions and that the fifth circuit has never adopted the reasoning of robins.
this court reviews the scope of an automatic stay de novo.kosadnar metropolitan life ins,cir.the purposes of the bankruptcy stay under are to protect the debtor assets,provide temporary relief from creditors,and further equity of distribution among the creditors by forestalling a race to the courthouse.gatx aircraft courtney leigh,cir.by its terms the automatic stay applies only to the debtor,not to under chapter or chapter of the bankruptcy code nor to.id.this court has also noted that s ection is rarely,however,a valid basis on which to stay actions against.arnold garlock,cir.however,an exception to this general rule does exist,and a bankruptcy court may invoke to stay proceedings against nonbankrupt where there is such identity between the debtor and the defendant that the debtor may be said to be the real party defendant and that a judgment against the defendant will in effect be a judgment or finding against the debtor.robins,at.this court recognized the robins exception in arnold,but declined to extend it in that case because no claim of a formal tie or contractual indemnification had been made to create an identity of interests between the debtor and nondebtor.at.also,in edwards armstrong world industries,this court refused to extend the robins exception to a surety,holding that a supersedeas bond may be executed against the surety of a judgment debtor,cir,reversed on other grounds,d.
though the district court found that the exception should extend to enron canada in this case,its order was premised largely on its finding that enron canada was not obligated under the contract to pay for the debts of the other enron parties.the district court conclusion that the netting agreement does not impose joint liability upon the different enron parties was actually a part of its analysis as to whether or not the bankruptcy stay should extend to enron canada.as the district court premised its decision on its interpretation of the netting agreement,and as we have held that the netting agreement is ambiguous,we vacate the district court decision to extend the bankruptcy stay,and remand to the district court to reconsider this issue in light of its findings as to the meaning of the netting agreement.should the district court find that the netting agreement imposes no obligation upon enron canada to cover the debts of the other enron parties,then the bankruptcy stay issue will become moot.if,however,the district court finds that a joint obligation is imposed by the netting agreement,then it will have to this issue in light of that new finding.
conclusion 
as we find that the netting agreement between reliant and enron is ambiguous as to its language regarding whether the enron parties are jointly liable,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand the case to the district court.on remand,the district court is to determine the intentions of the parties as to liability under the contract,and,in particular,to determine the parties intended meaning of the term group in section.as the district court denial of reliant request for a preliminary injunction appears to have been based on its dismissal of the case on its merits,we reverse the district court decision on this issue as well so that,on remand,the district court may determine whether reliant has established the necessary elements to entitle it to a preliminary injunction as the district court relied upon its conclusion that the netting agreement imposes no joint obligations upon the various enron parties in its decision to extend the bankruptcy stay,and as we have remanded the case on that issue,we also vacate the district court decision in this regard and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we do not comment,therefore,on whether the a bankruptcy stay extends to enron canada.
vacated,in part,and reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent from the panel majority conclusion that the master netting,setoff,and security agreement netting agreement is ambiguous regarding joint liability for the following reasons.i agree with the majority statement of the facts and procedural history,so i will not recite them here.
the majority concludes that a contract that is absolutely devoid of any reference to joint liability and that painstakingly circumscribes the respective rights and obligations of the parties inter se upon an event of default on an underlying agreement,is ambiguous regarding whether it imposes an affirmative obligation on one party to cover all the debts of another.the majority further concludes that this ambiguity requires remanding this case to the district court,ostensibly for the purpose of adducing evidence of the parties intentions regarding their respective obligations.i disagree with both conclusions.
the thrust of the majority opinion is that the netting agreement is ambiguous because it is susceptible to two possible interpretations one which the majority concedes gives effect to the plain meaning of the contractual language,and a second interpretation which,by the majority own admission,renders other provisions of the contract surplusage and is at best unsupported by any other contractual term.
as the majority acknowledges,a contract is not ambiguous merely because it is susceptible to two or more interpretations.moreover,it is axiomatic that a contract is susceptible to two or more interpretations only if more than one of the alternative readings advanced is viable.to determin e the presence of ambiguity vel non,this court must both examine the provision in question and construe that provision in the context of the agreement as a whole.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund creative dev,cir.the particular provision targeted by the majority as the source of ambiguity in the parties netting agreement appears in section,which states in pertinent part 
upon group exercise of the underlying master agreements,the settlement amounts under the underlying master agreements shall be netted and reduced by the exercise of rights to apply collateral pursuant to all rights granted in this agreement as so netted and reduced,the final settlement amount.upon determination of the final settlement amount,group shall provide defaulting group with a statement showing the calculation of the final settlement amount.the final settlement amount shall be payable by the group from whom such payment is due on the third business day after the statement is provided.
it is undisputed that the functional purpose of this provision is to set forth the rights and duties of the parties following the exercise of the remedies afforded by sections b and in the event of a default on an underlying master agreement.what is in dispute is the scope of the remedies contemplated by section,specifically,whether that provision imposes joint liability on the parties to the netting agreement.reliant argues that because all of the enron parties are subject to the netting agreement,each individual party is jointly obligated under the contract.enron canada counters that the netting agreement functions to aggregate a series of underlying master agreements between and among various parties into one agreement for the limited purpose of triangular setting off and netting payments consistent with the underlying agreements.the majority,finding both of the conflicting interpretations staked out by the parties in favor of their respective positions problematic,concluded that section of the netting agreement is ambiguous.i disagree,for the following reasons.
in determining whether a contractual provision could have more than one sensible meaning and thus be ambiguous,this court has found it helpful to engage in the venerable deductive exercise known as the process of elimination.creative dev,at.applied here,this court must first identify all of the possible procedural and remedial functions of the provision at issue that the words themselves could conceivably refer to in the context of the entire a greement.id.we then examine each such possibility to see if it withstands legal analysis and remains a sensible reading of the agreement.if two or more of the possibilities remain viable,there is ambiguity but if only one is left standing,there is no ambiguity.id.
the parties and the majority have identified two possible interpretations of the impact of section phrase group from whom payment is due on the scope of the parties rights and obligations reliant position,that section imposes joint liability on enron canada for debts of all of its affiliates and enron canada position,that section merely obligates payment from the original group from whom money was due consistent with the applicable underlying master agreement and creates a mechanism for calculating the final settlement amount against that particular party after.
the majority finds reliant assertion that joint liability is evinced by the use of the word group in section sufficiently compelling to conclude that the parties agreement is ambiguous.under the majority proposed construction,the phrase from whom such payment is due modifies group,and merely permits a determination of which of the two meanings of group enron group or counter party group is applicable,with the result being that all enron parties would become jointly liable to pay the final settlement amount.i disagree because,as the majority acknowledges,this reading renders the phrase from whom such payment is due surplusage once the group is identified in context.when interpreting a contract,however,this court is obligated to give meaning to all of its that every provision was intended to accomplish some purpose,and that none are deemed superfluous.transitional cmty.at galveston,office of pers,cir transco exploration pacific employers,cir instructing that in contract interpretation we must,where possible,construe the words so as to harmonize all while rendering none superfluous.in the instant case,the contract provides that new york law governs,but the analysis is the same.under new york law an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless is not preferred and will be avoided if possible.galli metz,cir quoting garza marine transp.lines,cir.rather,an interpretation that gives a reasonable and effective meaning to all terms of a contract is generally preferred to one that leaves a part unreasonable or of no effect.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.thus,we can not leave out terms of a contract or render them surplusage and then declare that there is an ambiguity,itself a result of refusing to give effect to the contract express provisions.the effect of the approach taken by the majority is to create a gap where there was none,necessitating resort to putative suppletive rules of joint liability that otherwise appear to be precluded by the contract terms,purpose,and commercial context.
indeed,the majority acknowledges the incongruity of reliant construction with the contract as a whole the netting agreement purports to incorporate all of the underlying agreements between the various parties,but the only underlying master agreement in the record,the contract between reliant and epmi,creates no rights to collect amounts owed from anyone but the parties involved in that particular contract.the majority further concedes that the netting agreement conferral of the right to offset amounts owed between two different enron and reliant parties does not necessarily mean that a party can collect the final settlement amount from all of its counter parties jointly and severally.from this,the majority concludes the contract is ambiguous.
however,i find that the interpretation offered by reliant is neither persuasive nor is it even plausible alternative interpretation.contrary to the majority view,i find that the only viable interpretation,and the one that gives effect to the entirety of the parties agreement,is that espoused by enron canada,and thus no ambiguity exists.indeed,the majority concedes that the plain language of the netting agreement would impose no liability on enron canada to pay the final settlement owed to reliant as a result of epmi default under the master power purchase and sale agreement.as observed by the majority,the definitional language of the netting agreement compels this interpretation by inserting all enron parties in place of group,the disputed sentence in section would indicate that the particular party that owes money is obligated to pay,rather than the aggregate of all parties affiliated with the original defaulting party.
nonetheless,the majority endeavors to go beyond the plain meaning of the agreement terms to insert ambiguity where i see none.at the core of the majority analysis is its view,shared by reliant,that giving effect to the plain meaning of the contract would render the determination of the final settlement amount meaningless,and negate the purpose of the right in section b and the rights found in section and annex in other words,the majority concludes that enron canada interpretation of the netting agreement renders the other provisions superfluous.in so doing,the majority misapprehends the functions of these provisions.i will address each of these in turn.
first,in concluding that an interpretation of section in accordance with its plain meaning renders the determination of a final settlement amount meaningless,the majority mistakenly finds that this reading of section imposes no further duty upon the individual parties other than that in the provision in section of the netting agreement.i disagree because these two sections unambiguously impose different duties on the parties.section contains the terms and conditions by which the group may s
