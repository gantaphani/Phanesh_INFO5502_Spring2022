this dispute arises from a agreement under which the purchaser,smith international,smith,seeks indemnity from the defendant sellers for damages caused by allegedly false representations and warranties in the agreement.smith appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all its claims.although we conclude that smith breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims are,we hold that smith indemnity claim is not barred by res judicata or the statute of limitations under texas law.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
in april,the egle group,egle group and technologies,sold their respective interests in fishing services,to smith pursuant to a agreement agreement.the agreement listed the egle group and as the sole sellers sellers and smith as the sole purchaser.in the agreement,sellers made numerous representations and warranties,and under the agreement indemnity clause,sellers agreed to reimburse smith for damages arising from any false representations and warranties.the agreement was signed,on behalf of the sellers,by representatives of the egle group by of and by the general manager of,ray daugherty.in april and january,pursuant to the agreement,smith paid approximately million to the egle trusts,glenn dauterive,daugherty,and other individuals.
on march,smith felicity took a turn when rose dove egle,the of john egle,added smith as a defendant in an ongoing louisiana state court suit against her.rose egle alleged,inter alia,that in,although the egle trusts owned of the egle group,her and others in conspired and wrongfully conveyed a interest in the egle group to dauterive and a interest in the egle group to daugherty.according to rose egle,smith was liable,as successor to,for the wrongful conveyances.when smith purchased,it wrongfully disbursed a total of to dauterive and daugherty for their interest and interest,respectively,in the egle group,which smith should have distributed to the egle trusts.the question went to a louisiana jury,and it agreed.it found that committed fraud and misappropriated the to dauterive and daugherty and that smith was the successor to and was not a purchaser of.on june,the louisiana court entered judgment against smith in the full amount of plus interest and costs.smith appealed the judgment to the louisiana appellate court,where,as far as the record shows,it is now pending.
on october,smith filed this suit in federal district court in texas seeking compensation and indemnification for the louisiana judgment.smith alleged breach of contract,breach of indemnity,and negligent misrepresentation against the egle group,daniel rees as trustee of the egle trusts collectively,defendants,the egle trusts and don egle the parties moved for summary judgment,and on january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and don egle on the basis of res judicata because smith failed to raise its claims in the form of a reconventional demand in the louisiana suit.the district court concluded that all of smith claims existed at the time smith became a defendant in the louisiana suit and that all of those existing claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the louisiana suit.accordingly,the district court held that louisiana res judicata statute.ann.west,and reconventional demand rule,civ.proc.ann.art.west,barred smith claims for failure to raise them in the louisiana suit.
on march,the district court vacated the portion of its january order ruling in favor of the egle group on the basis of res judicata,apparently because the egle group was not a party to the louisiana suit.nevertheless,the district court affirmed its grant of summary judgment in favor of the egle group,holding that smith claims against the egle group were by the statute of limitations because smith claims accrued when smith became a defendant in the louisiana suit.smith filed this appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the issue before us is whether smith causes of action accrued on march,when smith was named as a defendant in the louisiana suit,or on june,after the louisiana court entered final judgment against smith.the accrual date is dispositive in this case for two reasons.
first,the accrual date of its causes of action determines whether smith was required,by principles of res judicata,to assert its claims in a reconventional demand in the louisiana suit.under louisiana res judicata law a final judgment in favor of a plaintiff extinguishes all causes of action existing at the time of final judgment arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation.ann.see civ.proc.ann.reconventional demand rule thus,if smith had a cause of action that arose out of the same transaction,and that had accrued at the time smith became a defendant in the louisiana suit,then smith failure to assert such claims barred them under res judicata principles.on the other hand,if smith causes of action did not accrue until after the louisiana court entered final judgment against it,then smith causes of action did not exist at the time of final judgment,see.ann,and smith could not have raised its causes of action in a reconventional demand,see civ.proc.ann.
second,and apart from res judicata considerations,the accrual date is dispositive because it determines when the statute of limitations began to run on smith causes of action,and consequently,whether the statute of limitations expired.under texas law,indemnity and breach of contract claims are subject to a statute of limitations,valero energy,citing.civ.prac.ann.a vernon negligent misrepresentation claims are subject to a statute of limitations.civ.prac.ann.a vernon coleman rotana,if smith indemnity and breach of contract claims accrued at the time smith became a defendant in the louisiana suit on march,the statute of limitations expired before smith filed this suit in federal district court on october,if,however,smith claims did not accrue until after the louisiana court entered final judgment against it on june,then smith claims are not barred by the statute of limitations.
the parties dispute when smith causes of action accrued,and accordingly,whether res judicata and the statute of limitations bar smith claims.
in determining the accrual date of smith claims,we first turn to consider the rationale of the district court in concluding that all of smith claims accrued when smith became a defendant in the louisiana suit.in its january,memorandum and order,the district court focused its attention on section of the agreement,in which the sellers represented that smith would acquire free and clear of any liens.because the agreement defines lien to include any claim the district court apparently inferred that this representation in section of the agreement was breached at the moment rose egle asserted a legal claim against smith in the louisiana suit.accordingly,the district court held that it was at this moment that all of smith causes of of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and.
we now turn to consider whether the district court erred in each of its holdings,respectively.we begin with smith breach of contract claim.in texas,t he essential elements of a breach of contract action are the existence of a valid contract performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff breach of the contract by the defendant and damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach.valero mktg.supply kalama int l.the accrual of a breach of contract claim is governed by the legal injury rule.see boulle boulle.under the legal injury rule,a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes some legal injury,even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later,and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred.legal injury is defined as an injury giving cause of action by reason of its bein
