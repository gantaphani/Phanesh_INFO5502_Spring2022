appellant mary burton burton alleges that her employer,teleflex teleflex terminated her employment in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.et,and title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et.burton also alleges various state law discrimination,contract,and tort claims against teleflex.teleflex claims that it did not terminate burton employment,but that she in fact resigned her position.the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania granted summary judgment in favor of teleflex on burton discrimination claims,finding that burton had resigned,and that even if she had not,she could not demonstrate that teleflex purported justification for sending her the letter accept ing her resignation was pretextual.the district court also granted summary judgment to teleflex on all of burton state law claims.because the record clearly demonstrates that a dispute of material fact exists as to whether burton resigned or was terminated,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on burton discrimination claims and breach of contract claim.we affirm the grant of summary judgment on burton claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,wrongful interference with contractual relations,and defamation.
background 
burton was the founder of two companies that manufactured and distributed medical device parts.she founded hdj during the and formed specialized medical devices smd in.burton served as the companies president,and her son edward burton edward was the general manager and vice president.by,the companies grew to employ approximately people and generated an annual revenue of million.in,burton sold hdj and smd to teleflex.after acquiring the companies,teleflex discontinued the hdj division and incorporated smd into the teleflex medical oem business.
as part of the transaction,burton and edward each entered into a separate long employment agreement with teleflex.burton employment agreement the employment agreement or agreement provided that she could terminate her employment with teleflex by providing written notice at least thirty days before her termination would become effective.this is the only provision regarding burton authority to terminate the agreement.on the other hand,teleflex could terminate burton in one of two ways.first,it could fire burton without cause by providing written notice at least thirty days before her termination would become effective.second,teleflex could fire burton for cause,upon written notice under the employment agreement,burton would be entitled to severance if teleflex terminated her without cause.
burton,age at the time of the sale,became vice president of new business development at smd.her duties included directing and supervising the sales department at smd,overseeing the customer service of existing accounts,developing new business,and preparing price quotations for customers.burton had performed these same duties at smd prior to the sale to teleflex.
from the fall of until the end of her employment with teleflex,burton was supervised by edward boarini boarini,senior vice president and general manager of teleflex medical oem.burton and boarini had a strained professional relationship,and communication between the two was infrequent as vice president of new business development,burton supervised the sales department for smd.however,in february or march,dave faris faris,a male in his forties,was transferred from another teleflex division to be the director of sales for sm d,and the sales team then began reporting to him instead of burton.boarini acknowledged that sales leadership was a duty of burton that was removed.app.boarini also told faris to work very closely with burton and to learn from her.app.see also app.
the problems between burton and boarini came to a head on june.that day,the two attended a medical device trade show in manhattan.boarini stated that he intended to discuss with burton her lack of communication and undefined performance objectives.at their depositions,both parties recounted their version of the conversation.
burton testified about the encounter 
a nd i came up to ed boarini and i said,i asked him when he wanted to get together because he had talked to me on the phone the previous friday and mentioned that he wanted to meet with me.
so when i got there i went to him and asked him when did he want to get together and he could really even look me in the face.he said,oh,well,he was going to be really busy,he had all these customers he had to see,he did have time that day,he did think he would have any time the next day,he was too busy,and then he talked about maybe i can give you ten minutes or so on thursday,and i said,you know,i made all my appointments to be later because i thought you were very specific about wanting to get together with me,and he was just kind of treating me like i was even there and he was treating me like a useless old woman and just like i was there,and he could come up with any answer.it was like what do you mean i want to see you.
i mean,he just was pretty much just trying to get rid of me.and i finally pressed it,i said,are you asking for me to resign do you want me to resign that what i said to him.do you want me to resign 
he said,oh,no,no,we want you here for a long time to come and he was like,oh,no,no,that not what i mean at all.we need you.we want you for a long time.
and i do know if too much more happened right at that moment,but i started to walk away and shortly thereafter he said to me,he said,i think you should think about that.
boarini testimony was fairly consistent with burton account 
i had gone there with every intention to try to have a dialogue with mary burton and determine what she wanted to do with the business because she had not had any progress on her performance objectives or any kind of dialogue.and within a few minutes of talking to her about setting up a time to have that conversation,she resigned 
she asked me if i wanted her to resign.i said,no.wait.let talk through this.let have a dialogue.let understand what we can do because we knew i felt the relationship with her was not working to the betterment of the business.
and twice she said,do you want me to resign and i said,no.the third time is when i said,maybe you should think about retiring.that when she decided to resign.
despite boarini testifying that burton resigned at the end of their conversation,he acknowledged that burton never explicitly said that she was resigning.as boarini recalled,the conversation ended when burton disengaged and walked away.however,two other teleflex employees at the trade show,faris and jack fulton fulton,claimed that burton informed them on june,that she had resigned when she returned to the teleflex booth after her conversation with boarini.these two employees then told boarini that burton had resigned.based on his conversation with burton,and the accounts of faris and fulton,boarini determined that burton had resigned.
the next day,wednesday,burton met with faris to discuss a matter.burton did not return to teleflex booth on wednesday or thursday,the latter of which she claimed was because she was upset about the conversation with boarini.on friday,burton left on a vacation that she had scheduled several weeks prior to the incident with boarini knowledge and approval.
it is unclear if burton had any contact with the office while she was away on vacation on the day that she was scheduled to return to work,june,burton received a letter from sean,vice president of global human relations for teleflex medical,stating that teleflex was formally accept ing her resignation.app.even though burton was not entitled to severance in the event that she resigned,the letter stated that burton would receive six months severance if she extended the and clauses in her employment agreement.the severance was also conditioned on her releasing teleflex from any liability relating to her employment.later testified that he determined that burton had resigned in reliance on boarini assessment and the statements from other employees that burton had told them she resigned.
on june,the same day as letter to burton,teleflex sent a letter to its customers stating that burton decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities.app.boarini emailed teleflex employees the next day,june,to tell them that burton had left the company to pursue other opportunities.app.
burton claims that she was in disbelief when she received the letter from,because she did not resign.burton reached out to her lawyer,but at no point did she ever personally contest the letter or her termination with anyone at teleflex.all of her communication with teleflex was conducted through her lawyer,michael jarman.additionally,burton never attempted to return to work.instead,through her attorney,burton tried to negotiate the terms of her separation from teleflex.negotiations broke down,however,and no agreement was reached.
burton employee file at teleflex reflects that she was removed from payroll on june.however,in the space on the form asking the reason for the change in status,in which quit without notice,retired,and resigned were all options,none of the corresponding boxes was checked.instead,the form was filled out to state that she l eft the co mpany to pursue other opportunities.app.teleflex does not dispute that burton never explicitly said to boarini that she was resigning,nor does it dispute that she never submitted a letter of resignation,despite the requirement in her employment agreement that she do so.
following the breakdown of the negotiations,burton filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging several claims against teleflex age discrimination under the adea gender discrimination under title vii age and gender discrimination under the pennsylvania human relations act phra.const.stat.et breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing wrongful interference with contractual relations and defamation teleflex moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of teleflex on all of burton claims,in an order without memorandum opinion.the district court issued its memorandum opinion on november.burton teleflex,cv,wl.
on october,burton filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court order granting teleflex motion for summary judgment.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and.we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard that the district court would apply.howley mellon fin,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party has established that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a a fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.scheidemantle slippery rock.state of higher,cir.
where the defendant is the moving party,the burden is on the defendant to show that the plaintiff has failed to establish one or more essential elements of her case.hugh butler cnty.family ymca,cir.the reviewing court should view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.scheidemantle,at.however,to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the party must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the.jakimas hoffmann la roche,cir alteration in original quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
iii.analysis 
burton argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to teleflex.she claims that the district court improperly made credibility determinations as to the evidence before it,did not consider all of burton evidence,and gave undue credit to teleflex version of the facts.the central issue on appeal is the factual question of whether burton resigned from teleflex or whether she was terminated.because we believe there is a genuine dispute as to this question and believe resolution of that dispute may be determinative of burton breach of contract and discrimination claims,we vacate the grant of summary judgment on those claims.
burton has not demonstrated disputes of material fact as to her remaining state law claims.as such,summary judgment was properly granted on her claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,wrongful interference with contract,and defamation.
age and gender discrimination claims 
legal standards for establishing employment discrimination 
the adea and title vii prohibit discrimination on the basis of age and sex,respectively because burton has not provided direct evidence of discrimination,our inquiry under both statutes is governed by the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see smith city of allentown,cir reaffirming the use of the mcdonnell douglas standard in adea cases involving indirect evidence scheidemantle,at applying mcdonnell douglas standard to title vii gender discrimination claim concerning indirect evidence.
under the first step in the mcdonnell douglas analysis,the plaintiff bears the burden of making out a prima facie case of discrimination.scheidemantle,at.to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the adea,burton must make a showing that she is forty years of age or older the defendant took an adverse employment action against her she was qualified for the position in question and she was ultimately replaced by another employee who was sufficiently younger to support an inference of discriminatory animus.smith,at.
to make a showing of a prima facie case of gender discrimination under title vii,burton must show that she was a member of a protected class she was qualified for the position she suffered an adverse employment action and members of the opposite sex were treated more favorably.hugh,at citing mcdonnell douglas,at.a plaintiff may also meet the last element by showing that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that could give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.makky chertoff,cir.
to establish a prima facie case at summary judgment,the evidence must be sufficient to convince a reasonable factfinder to find all of the elements of the prima facie case.duffy paper magic,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.if a plaintiff fails to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to any of the elements of the prima facie case,she has not met her initial burden,and summary judgment is properly granted for the defendant.see geraci moody tottrup,int l,cir.
once the plaintiff makes out her prima facie case,the burden of production then shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate justification for the adverse employment action.smith,at see also simpson kay jewelers,div.of sterling,cir.this burden is relatively light and is satisfied if the employer provides evidence,which,if true,would permit a conclusion that it took the adverse employment action for a reason.tomasso boeing,cir quoting fuentes perskie,cir see also lichtenstein of pittsburgh med,cir describing this step as a minimal burden.at this stage,the defendant need not prove that the articulated reason actually motivated its conduct.shellenberger summit bancorp,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the third step in the mcdonnell douglas analysis shifts the burden of production back to the plaintiff to provide evidence from which a factfinder could reasonably infer that the employer proffered justification is merely a pretext for discrimination.fuentes,at see also sarullo postal,cir.the plaintiff must make this showing of pretext to defeat a motion for summary judgment.doe prot.plus,cir explaining that,to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the plaintiff must show that the employer articulated reason was a pretext for intentional discrimination.to make a showing of pretext,the plaintiff must point to some evidence,direct or circumstantial,from which a factfinder could reasonably either disbelieve the employer articulated legitimate reasons or believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer action.fuentes,at.
the plaintiff evidence,if it relates to the credibility of the employer proffered justification,must demonstrate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.fuentes,at quoting ezold wolf,block,schorr solis cohen,cir.as we have explained,if a plaintiff has come forward with sufficient evidence to allow a finder of fact to discredit the employer proffered justification,she need not present additional evidence of discrimination beyond her prima facie case to survive summary judgment.see fuentes,at fasold justice,cir.this is because the factfinder may infer from the combination of the prima facie case,and its own rejection of the employer proffered reason,that the employer engaged in the adverse employment action for an invidious reason.fuentes,at see also reeves sanderson plumbing,d proof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,and it may be quite persuasive.the plaintiff is therefore not required to produce direct evidence of discriminatory intent to demonstrate pretext and survive a motion for summary judgment.
district court opinion on discrimination claims 
the district court first determined that,even in the light most favorable to burton,the evidence weighed in favor of a finding that she had resigned,and had not been terminated.burton,wl,at.because a plaintiff must suffer an adverse employment action to state a prima facie case of employment or gender discrimination,the district court could have based its grant of summary judgment on its conclusion that burton had suffered no adverse employment action.see duffy,at affirming the district court grant of summary judgment because the plaintiff did not produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find an adverse employment action,which is a prerequisite to a successful age discrimination claim.
however,the district court presumed,for purposes of summary judgment,that burton had stated a prima facie case,and proceeded to conduct the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.it determined that teleflex had proffered a legitimate reason for sending burton the resignation letter namely,that teleflex reasonably believed that burton had resigned.burton,wl,at.under this analysis,the burden then shifted to burton to demonstrate that teleflex justification for sending her the letter was pretextual.the district court determined that none of the evidence proffered by burton call ed into question boarini or belief that she had resigned,or created a triable issue that discriminatory animus existed and was a moving factor behind teleflex actions.id.at.the district court therefore granted summary judgment for teleflex on burton age and gender discrimination claims.
as explained below,the district court erred by finding that there was no dispute of fact as to whether burton resigned or was terminated.because the district court determination that burton resigned improperly impacted its pretext analysis,we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
dispute of material fact relating to burton separation from teleflex 
contrary to the district court determination,burton has proffered evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that teleflex terminated her.burton maintains that she did not resign from teleflex,and that she never told anyone that she had resigned.in fact,no teleflex employee ever confirmed with burton that she had actually resigned before teleflex accepted her resignation.app.see also app.instead of verifying whether burton intended to resign,the company mailed her a letter on june,when she returned from her vacation,notifying her that it was accepting her resignation.the author of the letter,sean,said that he determined that burton had resigned based on boarini assessment and the statements of other employees.
at his deposition,boarini admitted that burton never said that she was resigning.moreover,teleflex acknowledged that burton never submitted a resignation letter or formally notified the company in any way that she was resigning despite the fact that burton employment agreement provided that she must provide written notice to the company at least days before her resignation is to be effective.as we pointed out at oral argument,there is no evidence that burton ever said she was resigning to anyone above her in the chain of command.boarini also admitted that he did not contact burton after the incident on june,to confirm that she resigned or to ask her for a letter of resignation 
according to boarini,faris and fulton told him on june,that burton had told them that she resigned.the district court credited the testimony of these employees in deciding that burton had in fact resigned.however,the court did not credit the testimony of burton herself,who denied having told anyone that she resigned.nor did the district court consider the conflicting testimony of edward burton,who spoke to burton subsequent to her conversation with boarini.they discussed burton conversation with boarini,but edward claimed that burton said nothing about having resigned or having been fired.edward testified that burton continued to work after june,and that sometime before june,burton called the office to send in quotes and was told by the receptionist that her call could not be put through.by crediting the testimony of the teleflex employees and disregarding the burtons conflicting testimony,the district court improperly made credibility determinations,which it may not do at summary judgment.see doe luzerne,cir noting that at summary judgment t he court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations because these tasks are left for the fact finder internal quotation marks omitted.
several other pieces of evidence are relevant to the issue of whether burton resigned or was terminated.first,in burton personnel file,on a form indicating that she was no longer to be paid by teleflex,the boxes indicating that she either quit without notice,resigned,or retired were not checked.app.instead,the form was completed to say l eft co mpany to pursue other opportunities.app.at her deposition,teleflex human resources director margie heilig heilig conceded that she could not state from where she got that information because it involved a conversation with an attorney.boarini testified that he had no idea why the form was filled out in that particular way.
second,approximately one month prior to burton confrontation with boarini at the trade show,boarini and two other teleflex employees were emailing about the departure of edward burton from teleflex.at one point,the email chain shifts to discussing burton.an official at teleflex,tim kelleher kelleher,tells boarini and another employee in an email i also talked to edward about burton and the lack of communication and sharing of information and our concerns about her after he leaves.he has agreed to facilitate a three way conversation between edward,burton and me to get her to play ball.app.emphasis added.kelleher,the drafter of the email,testified that his reference to getting burton to play ball merely meant that he wanted edward to discuss with burton her lack of communication.while that is certainly a plausible explanation,it is equally plausible that a reasonable juror could perceive the comment as a reference to pushing burton out of the company.
third,the district court also cited plaintiff conduct after receipt of the june,letter as a reason for finding that burton had resigned.burton,wl,at.the district court claimed that plaintiff made no protest that the resignation had not occurred.id.at.boarini testified that he and others at teleflex were surprised that they received no directly from burton following her receipt of the june,letter.burton also testified that she did not initiate any contact with teleflex after receiving the letter,but that she did not do so because she considered herself to have been fired,and believed she no longer had any rights.app.upon receipt of the june,letter,burton contacted her attorney michael jarman,and from that point forward she only communicated with teleflex by and through her attorney jarman.app.she further testified that she would not have contacted teleflex on her own without first speaking to her attorney.the district court thus did not consider that burton communicated with teleflex through her attorney following the june,letter,which undercuts its conclusion that she did not contest the resignation letter.
burton also testified that,during a party that she held for her former employees shortly after her separation from teleflex,she denied having resigned and clarified that she believed she had been fired.furthermore,teleflex notified its customers of burton departure on june,the same day it sent her the letter purporting to accept her resignation.this fact undercuts the district court reliance on burton conduct after receiving the june,letter.once clients were notified of burton alleged resignation,she could reasonably have concluded that teleflex had fired her,leaving her no ability to contest her separation and return to her position.
fourth,the district court ignored evidence that burton continued to perform work for teleflex after her conversation with boarini on june.on june,burton met with faris at the trade show to train him on quoting prices to customers.faris acknowledged that he had a meeting with burton at the trade show after her purported resignation,and that during the meeting burton was talking about working together.burton also testified that she had a previously scheduled vacation from june to june,which could explain her absence from the office during this time period.other evidence also indicates that,while she was on her vacation,burton called in to the office to send in price quotes for customers,but that the receptionist would not put her through 
at this stage of the litigation,there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that burton was terminated.the district court ignored the fact that burton never tendered her resignation,burton never told anyone to whom she reported at teleflex that she was resigning,teleflex relied on hearsay statements to conclude that burton had resigned,and teleflex never once asked burton if she had resigned.while there is certainly evidence to suggest that burton did resign,this evidence is refuted by burton.the district court therefore erred when it determined that t he evidence weighs in favor of a finding that burton resigned,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to her.burton,wl,at.
mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis 
the district court granted summary judgment for teleflex because it held that burton could not show that teleflex justification for sending her the resignation letter was pretextual.burton,wl,at.because the district court pretext analysis was unduly influenced by its error regarding burton resignation,we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
to the extent the district court pretext analysis suggested that burton was required to show evidence of discriminatory animus to demonstrate pretext,that suggestion is unsupported by our precedent.see fuentes,at.a plaintiff may demonstrate pretext at summary judgment in two different ways.first,the plaintiff may point to evidence in the record that would cause a reasonable juror to disbelieve the employer articulated legitimate reason,thereby creating a genuine dispute of material fact as to the credibility of that reason.see id.at.if a plaintiff comes forward with evidence that would cause a reasonable factfinder to find the defendant proffered reason unworthy of credence,lichtenstein,at internal quotation marks omitted,she need not adduce any evidence of discrimination beyond her prima facie case to survive summary judgment,fuentes,at see also sheridan dupont de nemours,cir en banc a plaintiff may survive summary judgment if the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the employer proffered reasons were not its true reasons for the challenged employment action.second,the plaintiff may also defeat summary judgment by pointing to evidence that indicates that the employer acted with discriminatory animus.fuentes,at.
as discussed above,we find that burton evidence created a genuine dispute of fact regarding the credibility of teleflex proffered reason for her discharge,that a reasonable fact finder could find the claim that burton resigned to be unworthy of credence.id.at.in the face of such evidence,burton did not need to present evidence of discriminatory animus and she should not have been required to do so.
we therefore vacate the grant of summary judgment on burton adea and title vii claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
burton pennsylvania state law claims 
the district court also granted summary judgment to teleflex on all of burton state law claims.for the following reasons,we vacate the grant of summary judgment on burton breach of contract and state law discrimination claims.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment regarding burton remaining state law claims.
breach of contract 
the district court granted summary judgment to teleflex on burton breach of contract claim because it concluded that the evidence of record,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,is that she resigned her position.burton,wl,at.because a dispute of material fact exists as to whether burton resigned or was terminated,summary judgment was inappropriately granted on her breach of contract claim.
under pennsylvania law,a breach of contract action involves the existence of a contract a breach of a duty imposed by the contract and damages.braun wal mart stores.burton bases her breach of contract claim on teleflex alleged violation of her employment agreement.the agreement provides that burton could be terminated in one of two ways with cause,or without cause,after days notice.the employment agreement specifies that if burton were to be terminated without cause,she would be entitled to a set amount of severance pay.teleflex does not claim that burton was terminated for cause,and boarini admitted at his deposition that he never brought any performance issues to burton attention.the proposed separation agreement,sent to burton on june,offered her a severance,but with the additional condition that she extend the provisions in her original employment agreement by one year she never reached an agreement with teleflex on the terms of her separation and has not received any severance pay.
the central fact material to burton breach of contract claim is whether she resigned or was terminated.if a factfinder were to find that burton was terminated from teleflex,he or she could also find that teleflex breached the terms of the employment agreement.the grant of summary judgment is vacated.
pennsylvania human relations act 
burton also brings age and gender discrimination claims against teleflex under the phra,which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age or sex.we have stated that the phra is to be interpreted as identical to federal laws except where there is something specifically different in its language requiring that it be treated differently.slagle cnty.of clarion,cir quoting fasold,at.the phra provisions here present no such issue,and therefore should be interpreted coextensively with burton adea and title vii claims.see colwell rite aid,cir noting that it is proper to address adea and phra age discrimination claims collectively alteration and internal quotation marks omitted atkinson lafayette,cir claims under the phra are interpreted coextensively with title vii claims.because we vacate the grant of summary judgment on burton title vii and adea claims,we also vacate the grant of summary judgment on burton phra claims.
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the district court construed burton claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing as claiming that,but for her separation from teleflex in,she would have
