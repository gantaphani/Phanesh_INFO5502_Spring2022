opinion of the court 
this appeal involves the question of whether a federal district court,in the first instance,may hear disputes concerning the breach of an interconnection agreement formed and approved pursuant to the federal telecommunications act of,stat.telecommunications act or act.the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania held that the act prevents parties from taking such claims to federal court until they have been litigated before a state commission.core communications,core,argues that the district court erred by misapplying chevron deference to graft onto the act an exhaustion requirement for enforcement actions when congress did not provide for one.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing count iii of core complaint without prejudice,vacate the dismissal of the remaining counts,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the dispute in this case centers on the duties an incumbent provider of telecommunications services owes with respect to new entrants who wish to compete with the incumbent in a particular local market,and how those duties are enforced.such questions are governed by the telecommunications act of,which was enacted to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality service for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.preamble,telecommunications act of,stat.as the legislative history explains,the act creates a,national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.puerto rico.telecomms.regulatory,cir quoting conf,at,cong.
to achieve these goals,the act provides that various responsibilities are to be divided between the state and federal governments,making it an exercise in what has been termed cooperative federalism.id.at.that is,congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation under the prior regime.global naps.of telecomm.and energy,cir quoting peter huber et,federal telecommunications law ed internal quotation marks omitted.the intended effect of such a regime was to leav e state commissions free,where warranted,to reflect the policy choices made by their states.id.
there are two sections of the act that are at issue in this case and.section requires companies that traditionally provide local phone as incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to interconnect their networks with the networks of as competing local exchange carriers clecs.c.specifically,the act charges ilecs with 
the duty to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the local exchange carrier network 
a for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access 
b at any technically feasible point within the carrier network 
c that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary,affiliate,or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection and 
d on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section of this title.
id.c.it also requires ilecs to lease portions of their existing networks to their competitors and to permit the physical collocation of clec equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the ilec premises.id.c.without these requirements,new entrants could not afford to build the large and expensive communications grids that incumbents have developed through years in the market.
to implement these new duties,the act relies on a system of private negotiations,followed by arbitration,if necessary,both under the supervision of state commissions.all of these steps to attain an interconnection agreement may be followed by federal court review,if it is sought by the parties.the process commences when an ilec receives a request for interconnection from another telecommunications company.id.a.the act then requires the ilec to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section the particular terms and conditions of agreements to fulfill its substantive duties under the act.id.c.a requesting carrier may also choose to adopt all of the terms and conditions of an existing state agreement that the incumbent has with another carrier.id.i.
to deal with problems that may arise during the negotiation period,the act provides that,if the parties are unable to agree,either party may petition the state commission to arbitrate open issues.id.b.as a final procedural safeguard,all interconnection agreements must be submitted to the state commission for approval.id.e.the commission determinations with respect to the agreements are subject to review in federal court.id.e.
pursuant to the act,core entered into an interconnection agreement with verizon pennsylvania,verizon predecessor in interest on march.rather than negotiating from scratch,core opted into the existing agreement between verizon predecessor bell,and mcimetro access transmission services.
between the fall of and october,core requested interconnection to various markets in pennsylvania.core alleges that verizon deliberately and unjustifiably refused to interconnect with core at technically feasible points in a timely manner.rather than using existing facilities with spare capacity to interconnect,verizon cited its internal policy of requiring the construction of new,dedicated facilities to interconnect with core.no technical or business justification was given explaining the need for this requirement.core claims that verizon intentionally took these steps in order to maintain its competitive advantage in pennsylvania markets and to intimidate and financially harm core.
on september,core filed the complaint underlying this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.it alleged that verizon conduct violated the telecommunications act,as amended,including and count i,and count ii,constituted a material breach of the interconnection agreement count iii,and was tortious under pennsylvania common law for intentional and fraudulent concealment count iv.
on november,verizon filed a motion to dismiss,seeking the dismissal of counts i,ii,and iv for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under federal rule of civil procedure b,and count iii for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.on march,the district court dismissed core complaint in its entirety without prejudice.it reasoned that,although it had federal question and diversity jurisdiction over the action under and,chevron deference required that it adhere to the fcc ruling in in re starpower communications,llc.under that decision,the district court concluded that of the act imposed an intermediate step before getting to federal court,not unlike an exhaustion of remedies requirement,with respect to interconnection claims.see core commc ns,verizon,d.that is,it concluded that core must seek review by the pennsylvania public utility commission pa puc of its claim that the approved interconnection agreement had been breached before resorting to the federal courts.
on april,core filed a motion for reconsideration or amended judgment.following this motion,core and verizon entered into a tolling agreement that tolled the statute of limitations on core claims until days after the entry of an order resolving or otherwise disposing of an appeal to this court from the district court decision.in accordance with that agreement,core filed a praecipe to withdraw its motion for reconsideration or amended judgment on april.in the wake of this agreement,core filed a notice of appeal on april.on april,this court issued a stay pending the district court disposition of core motion for reconsideration,which was dismissed as moot on may.this appeal followed.
before moving to any of the claims raised by core,we must first determine whether or not we have jurisdiction to hear this case.verizon argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction under because a district court dismissal without prejudice is not ordinarily a final order unless the applicable statute of limitations would not permit the of the claims.core,on the other hand,contends that we do have appellate jurisdiction because the district court did not take an action equivalent to a stay,but rather dismissed this case from its docket.it also disputes verizon claim that there are no statute of limitations issues.
a party generally may not take an appeal under until there has been a decision by the district court that ends litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.richman.records,sprint comm ns,cir quoting van cauwenberghe biard,d.ordinarily,an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is not a final order unless the applicable statute of limitations would not permit the of the claims.ahmed dragovich,cir.
under this standard,verizon argues that because the applicable statute of limitations for each claim is tolled pursuant to an agreement of the parties,core retains the right to its claims,and thus the district court order is not final under.however,core argues that the agreement does not in fact cure prospective statute of limitations problems.verizon agreed only to toll the applicable statutes of limitations through this appeal.under the agreement,it appears that the statutory periods would resume running days after we enter a judgment.they would not continue to toll during the pa puc proceeding.in addition,verizon specifically reserved the right in the agreement to assert a limitations defense against core based on lapses occurring after this appeal 
thus,it is far from clear that core could simply its claims.to the contrary,it seems certain that at least some of the claims will be time barred if core is forced to litigate its claim for breach of the interconnection agreement before the pa puc.count i of the complaint,for example,contains a limitations period of two years that began to run in october,when verizon failed to interconnect in.see.core filed its original complaint on september.it would be essentially impossible for the time lapse from the end of this appeal to the of the complaint,including time for the pa puc to make its determination,to be less than one month.similarly,core claim advanced in count ii was based on verizon failure to interconnect in philadelphia in november and in pittsburgh in may.as such,there are eight months remaining in the applicable limitations period.see.in this case,since the plaintiff can not cure the deficiency,an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is a final and appealable order.ahmed,at citing newark branch,naacp harrison,cir.because the statutes of limitations controlling the claims that core was not instructed to present to the pa puc will certainly limit its ability to,we will treat that order as final for the purpose of this appeal.
moving to the merits,the essence of core argument is that it was not required to litigate its claim for breach of the interconnection agreement in front of the pa puc as an intermediate step before the district court could hear the case.the district court held,and verizon argues,that the statutory scheme under the telecommunications act requires that core first present this claim to the state commission before proceeding in a federal district court.it reached this conclusion by applying chevron deference to the fcc decision in in re starpower communications.we exercise plenary review over such claims,which implicate the district court conclusions of law.see,epstein family kmart,cir.
under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,federal courts must defer to an implementing agency interpretation of a statute within its jurisdiction if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue at hand,and the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.as the supreme court explained,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at.chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.the supreme court has emphasized that s uch deference is justified because t he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones,and because of the agency greater familiarity with the facts and circumstances surrounding the subjects regulated.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.internal citations omitted.
under this framework,the first question we must answer is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.in making this determination,the supreme court has instructed that a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.brown williamson tobacco,at.instead,we must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.id.quoting gustafson alloyd,d ftc mandel brothers,d.in addition,we must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency.id.
in this case,the precise question at issue involves the proper procedure for the interpretation and enforcement of previously approved interconnection agreements.specifically,we must determine whether a party may proceed directly to federal court to litigate such claims,or if it must first present them to the state commission that originally approved the agreement.we turn to the telecommunications act to determine whether or not congress has spoken on this question.
the p rocedures for negotiation,arbitration,and approval of interconnection agreements are discussed in of the act.subsection e,titled approval by state commission,explains the role of state commissions like the pa puc.it provides that a ny interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the state commission.a state commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.e.subsections e through e list the grounds for rejecting an interconnection agreement submitted to the commission,preserve state authority to establish or enforce requirements of state law in reviewing agreements,set a calendar for state commission decisions,and give the fcc authority to act if the state commission fails to carry out its responsibilities.finally,e describes the extent of judicial review relating to actions under 
in a case in which a state fails to act as described in paragraph,the proceeding by the commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the commission actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a state commission failure to act.in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
id.e.beyond this,there is no real indication of what role the state commissions are to play,and the act is simply silent as to the procedure for disputes.
core,however,argues that act provides a procedure for disputes in and.section is entitled carriers liability for damages and provides that 
i n case any common carrier shall do,or cause or permit to be done,any act,matter,or thing in this chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful,or shall omit to do any act,matter,or thing in this chapter required to be done,such common carrier shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this chapter,together with a reasonable counsel or attorney fee,to be fixed by the court in every case of recovery,which attorney fee shall be taxed and collected as part of the costs in the case.
emphasis added.section is the recovery of damages provision related to.it provides that 
a ny person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter may either make complaint to the commission as hereinafter provided for,or may bring suit for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this chapter,in any district court of the united states of competent jurisdiction but such person shall not have the right to pursue both such remedies.
id.emphasis added.core argues that these two provisions allow it to bring a suit for damages against verizon in federal court,notwithstanding any authority that may be vested with the state commissions.
the precise claim at issue in this appeal,however,is core claim for breach of the interconnection agreement,not its claims under,and of the act.divorced from any provision of the act,it appears that and,which make common carriers liable for damages under the provisions of this chapter,do not apply.although these sections might allow core to bring a claim for damages against verizon for violations of,and they do not set out an enforcement scheme for a pure claim for breach of an interconnection agreement.accordingly,given the lack of any guidance as to the proper interpretation and enforcement procedure in this case we conclude that congress has not spoken on the precise question at issue here.
faced with a gap in the relevant statutory scheme,we turn to step two of chevron,which instructs that if congress has not specifically addressed the question,a reviewing court must respect the agency construction of the statute so long as it is permissible.brown williamson tobacco,at.in this case,both the district court and verizon looked to the fcc decision in in re starpower communications that case involved a dispute between starpower communications and bell atlantic virginia and gte south about whether calls to internet service providers were local calls under an approved interconnection agreement.see at.starpower had asked the virginia state corporation commission,the relevant state commission in that case,to issue a declaratory ruling on this point and to order gte to pay reciprocal compensation,but the commission refused.id.starpower then asked the fcc to step in and hold that such determinations were ones that the state commission was required to make under e id.at.thus,the fcc explained that it must determine whether a dispute arising from interconnection agreements and seeking interpretation and enforcement of those agreements is within the states responsibility under section.id.at.after posing this question,the fcc provided the answer we conclude that it is.id.
arguing that the district court deference to the fcc determination in starpower was an error,core first contends that the decision is irrelevant to the current case.although the fcc decision is susceptible to both narrow and broad readings,under either view it is clearly relevant to the question we must answer here.under the narrowest interpretation,starpower stands for the proposition that state commissions have,at a minimum,the authority to hear disputes involving approved interconnection agreements,despite the act silence on the issue that is,because the case came to the fcc after starpower had voluntarily attempted to litigate its claim before the virginia commission,id.at,the fcc decision did not actually force a party to bring its dispute to a state commission before proceeding in federal court.
however,given the fcc behavior and the structure of the statutory scheme as a whole,we believe that more can be drawn from the fcc conclusion that dispute s arising from interconnection agreements and seeking interpretation and enforcement of those agreements are within the states responsibility under section.id.at.as an initial matter,the fcc interpretation and enforcement disputes part of the states responsibility under that there is not a shared role for the federal courts in the first instance.to be fair,the fcc was echoing the language in e,but in reaching its conclusion it did not rely at all on the fact that starpower had chosen to litigate before the state commission.rather,it concluded that such a delegation of responsibility best fit the statutory scheme created by congress.in addition,we can find no indication in other fcc decisions that the state commissions jurisdiction over disputes is shared with the federal courts.to the contrary,every indication is that the fcc plainly expects state commissions to decide intermediation and enforcement disputes that arise after the approval procedures are complete.sw.bell.pub.util.comm of,cir citing in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,vacated on other grounds in bell atl.fcc,noting that parties are bound by their interconnection agreements as interpreted and enforced by the state commissions,and discussing factors state commissions should consider when construing the parties agreements.
in following this broader reading of starpower,we are mindful of the supreme court admonition that we must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.brown williamson tobacco,at.quoting gustafson,at.mandel brothers,at.in the context of the telecommunications act,we believe that a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme is one where the bodies that considered formation problems also resolve interpretation difficulties.as with formation problems,federal court jurisdiction over state commission interpretation and enforcement decisions should be limited to appellate review.see e granting district courts authority to review determinations made by the state commissions under.as the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has emphasized,
a state commission authority to approve or reject an interconnection agreement would itself be undermined if it lacked authority to determine in the first instance the meaning of an agreement that it has approved.a court might ascribe to the agreement a meaning that differs from what the state commission believed it was,the agreement as interpreted by the court may be one the state commission would never have approved in the first place.to deprive the state commission of authority to interpret the agreement that it has approved would thus subvert the role that congress prescribed for state commissions.
bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir en banc.indeed,as the eleventh circuit recognized,to allow parties to circumvent the state commissions in disputes would undermine the act sense of cooperative federalism,under which the states were given primary responsibility over interconnection agreements.rather than placing the entire scope of regulatory authority in the federal government,congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation under the prior regime.global naps,at quoting peter huber et,federal telecommunications law ed.the fcc interpretation wisely recognizes this fact to fill the gap left by congress.
notwithstanding this analysis,core argues that starpower is not entitled to chevron deference because congress merely delegated authority to the fcc to preempt affirmative refusals by state commissions to carry out their responsibilities under of the act,not to mandate an interim step to federal district court review.this argument misses the point.chevron deference is premised on the idea that where congress has
