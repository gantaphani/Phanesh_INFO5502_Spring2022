opinion of the court 
factual and procedural history 
this matter comes on before this court on robert monaco appeal from an order entered by the district court on october,granting appellees motion for summary judgment.monaco brought this action against his former employer,its corporate parent,and certain of his former,alleging that they discriminated against him on the basis of his age when his employer laid him off as part of a reduction in force on june.in addition,he asserted breach of contract claims against the corporate defendants.
monaco was born on march.on june,he began working for united states life insurance company united states life as a sales representative for the new jersey area selling term life and medical insurance.united states life promoted him in to regional group manager in which position he was responsible for opening the new jersey regional office in chatham and oversaw the sales representatives and clerical staff in that office.in united states life promoted him again,this time to regional vice president in charge of the eastern region,a position in which he coordinated insurance sales in several states along the eastern seaboard.during his tenure as regional vice president his employer expanded his territory to include several additional states.
in,american general assurance company agac purchased united states life.after the agac acquisition,monaco remained the vice president in charge of the eastern region.prior to april,hugh bailey bailey,senior vice president of sales and marketing,then age,was monaco immediate supervisor,but in may,william leary leary,age,replaced bailey,who was retiring,in that capacity.in late,agac determined that its medical insurance line of business was incurring large losses,a circumstance which led it to decide to exit this product line.notwithstanding its unprofitably,inasmuch as sales of medical insurance constituted a significant portion of the sales volume in the eastern region,agac determined to cut expenses by consolidating its operations and reducing its workforce.
when agac laid off monaco on june,he was age.at that time agac had two regional vice presidents,monaco,who was vice president of the eastern region,and robert shaw shaw age,who was vice president of the western region.shaw and monaco had identical responsibilities in the two different regions.in june,agac had eight sales vice managers who reported directly to monaco edward mcdonald in danbury,connecticut,approximately age walter schroeder for the new england region,approximately age ted makuch in new york,in his richard gawlak in the philadelphia area,approximately age joseph ficorilli in the cincinnati area,approximately age paul bouchard in the florida area,in his early dale brockman in new jersey,approximately age and michael lombardi in charge of double override agencies,approximately age.
on june,when leary informed monaco that agac was laying him off effective june,he explained that it was doing so because it was eliminating his position of vice president for the eastern region as it was consolidating its eastern and western regions under shaw control.at the time of monaco layoff,agac also laid off several other employees as part of a reduction in force.following monaco layoff,shaw assumed the management of the eastern regional sales office but leary also provided oversight of the eastern region.
in april,agac hired tom mckellar,who was born on april,and is approximately two years younger than monaco,as national vice president of sales.mckellar worked out of the new jersey office and was responsible for national sales and other senior management duties in addition to overseeing the eastern regional sales offices.
on june,monaco brought this action in the superior court of new jersey against his former employer,agac,and its parent corporation,american general corporation,as well as his supervisor,leary,and two unnamed agac employees,john doe and richard roe,charging all defendants with age discrimination,directly or as aiders and abettors,under the new jersey law against discrimination,stat.ann.et.west njlad in addition,he asserted claims against the corporate defendants for breach of contract.defendants removed the case to the district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and subsequently moved for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted the defendants motion,concluding with respect to his age discrimination claim that while monaco could satisfy the first three elements of the mcdonnell douglas mcdonnell douglas green,d prima facie case test,he could not satisfy the fourth element.it also granted summary judgment to the corporate defendants on monaco breach of contract claim.monaco then brought this appeal.

b.the requirements of the new jersey law against discrimination compared to those of the age discrimination in employment act 
monaco asserts that the requirements to set forth a prima facie case under the njlad are less stringent than those required in similar cases under the age discrimination in employment act,et adea,a statute not involved directly in this case brought solely under new jersey law.in particular,he contends that he does not have to make a showing that agac retained a sufficiently younger employee for him to establish a prima facie case,though an action under the adea would have required that he make such a showing.appellees contend,however,that monaco has waived this argument because in his brief in opposition to their motion for summary judgment he stated that to determine if the fourth element of the prima facie case step of the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework had been satisfied the court should look to whether the plaintiff is discharged while the defendant retained similarly situated sufficiently younger persons in comparable job positions,at,seemingly relying on a mcdonnell douglas formulation of that element.appellees br.at.but it does not matter whether monaco waived his argument that he has a lesser burden under the njlad than he would have had under the adea with respect to the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas test as we conclude that the two statutes contain similar requirements for proving the fourth element of a plaintiff prima facie case thus,his argument is to no avail.
under the adea,it is unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a.the protection against age discrimination in the adea is limited to individuals who are at least years of age.id.a.when,as here,a plaintiff alleges that he has suffered age discrimination predicated on disparate treatment,liability under the adea depends on whether age actually motivated the employer decision.hazen paper biggins,d see also raytheon hernandez,d the njlad,though worded differently,similarly makes age discrimination unlawful but does not limit its protections to persons at least years of age.in cases brought under either the adea or the njlad,the plaintiff age actually must have played a role in the employer decisionmaking process and had a determinative influence on the outcome of that process.reeves sanderson plumbing,d bergen commercial bank sisler.
under both the adea and the njlad,a plaintiff may meet his or her burden by presenting direct evidence of discrimination that meets the requirements of justice concurring opinion in price waterhouse hopkins,d or presenting indirect evidence of discrimination that satisfies the familiar burden shifting framework identified in mcdonnell douglas.fakete,at sisler,at.inasmuch as monaco attempted to prove his case solely through the use of indirect evidence,our analysis will focus on the burden shifting framework of mcdonnell douglas as applied under the njlad.
the supreme court of new jersey has explained the burden shifting analysis as a starting point for analysis of claims under the njlad.sisler,at.under this analysis a plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case,the step at which monaco lost his case in the district court.if the plaintiff does so the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action.mogull cb commercial real estate group.then,if the defendant meets this rather light burden,the plaintiff must discredit the defendant proffered reason for its action or adduce evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.see potence hazleton area sch,wl,at cir,adea case.
in an ordinary employment termination case under the adea to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination at the first step of the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework a plaintiff must show that he or she was a member of the protected class,was over,was qualified for the position,suffered an adverse employment decision,and ultimately was replaced by a person sufficiently younger to permit an inference of age discrimination.duffy paper magic group,cir.in the context of a reduction in force,in order to satisfy the fourth element of a prima facie case under the adea,a plaintiff must show that the employer retained a sufficiently younger similarly situated employee.anderson consol.rail,cir.
as we have indicated,however,monaco maintains that the njlad does not require him to show that agac retained a sufficiently younger employee in order for him to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination in a case and thus it differs from the adea.his failure to make this showing led the district court to grant the appellees motion for a summary judgment.in support of this argument monaco cites sisler,at,petrusky maxfli dunlop sports,and reynolds palnut.
the njlad provides,in pertinent part,that a ll persons shall have the opportunity to obtain employment without discrimination because of age this opportunity is recognized as and declared to be a civil right.stat.ann.west.it further states,in relevant part that 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice,or,as the case may be,an unlawful discrimination 
for an employer,because of the age of any individual to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge or require to retire,unless justified by lawful considerations other than age,from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms,conditions or privileges of employment 
in general,to establish a prima facie case under the njlad for unlawful termination,and thus satisfy the first step of the burden shifting analysis,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she belongs to a protected class,was qualified for the position held,was terminated despite adequate qualifications,and after termination the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applications.see sisler,at citations omitted.of course,the njlad makes it unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee for numerous reasons in addition to age and thus is much more than an age discrimination statute.
in sisler,a bank vice president brought a claim of age discrimination under the njlad,alleging that his employer wrongfully discharged him because of his youth,an unusual action that conceptually was possible because,as we have indicated,in contrast to the adea,the njlad does not limit the individuals protected from age discrimination to persons over the age of.id.at.in sisler the supreme court of new jersey stated that under the njlad in an age discrimination case,the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case analysis 
properly focuses not on whether the replacement is a member of the protected class but on whether the plaintiff has established a logical reason to believe that the decision rests on a legally forbidden ground.thus,under the nj lad,which specifies no qualifying age,courts have modified the fourth element to require a showing that the plaintiff was replaced with a candidate sufficiently younger to permit an inference of age discrimination.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.obviously the reference to a younger replacement could not have been intended to apply when an employee is discharged on account of his or her youth because in that situation his or her burden to establish a prima facie case quite logically is to show that the replacement employee was sufficiently older to permit an inference of age discrimination.id.at.it is apparent that the court in sisler refined the fourth element of the requirements for a prima facie case in age discrimination situations that it had set forth for application in njlad cases in general.
we recognize,however,that the court focus in sisler was not on the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas framework,but on the first element,how to modify the requirement that an individual belong to a protected class when the claimant brings a charge of age discrimination on the basis of youth.id.at.the sisler court held that in order to satisfy the first element,claimants such as sisler must show background circumstances supporting the suspicion that the defendant is the unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.id.at nevertheless we are not at liberty to ignore sisler s language recognizing the necessity of a sufficient age differential between the terminated and replacement employees for the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination demonstrating the presence of its fourth element.
in petrusky,at,and reynolds,at,on which monaco relies,the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey,the intermediate state court of appeals,addressed the application of sisler to cases involving allegations of traditional age discrimination brought by older employees.in both cases the appellate division declined to adopt the formulation of the fourth element of the prima facie case in the language we have quoted from sisler regarding age discrimination cases,holding instead that the supreme court of new jersey analysis in that case was limited to cases involving allegations of reverse discrimination.petrusky,at reynolds,at.the court in reynolds held that in cases involving a traditional age discrimination claim a plaintiff 
need not show that he was replaced by someone sufficiently younger.rather,plaintiff must show that he was a member of a protected class,that he was performing the job at a satisfactory level that he was discharged,and that the employer sought others to perform the work after the complainant had been removed.
id.the court in petrusky adopted the reynolds court interpretation of sisler.see petrusky,at we adhere to that view and regard it as governing until the supreme court declares otherwise.
two cases in the district court have espoused divergent views on whether to follow the interpretation of sisler that reynolds and petrusky set forth.in wright communications,d,the court held that in order to satisfy the fourth element of a prima facie case of age discrimination under the njlad,a plaintiff must only show that his employer sought others to perform the same work after he was terminated from his position.on the other hand,earlier,in swider,d,the court held that under the njlad,in order to satisfy the fourth prong of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case,plaintiff must show that he was replaced by someone sufficiently younger to create an inference of unlawful age discrimination.we are impressed with the comprehensive analysis in swider which points out that the appellate division itself has not interpreted sisler consistently.in this regard,swider cites williams pemberton township pub,in which the court quoted sisler for the point that under the njlad the fourth element of a prima facie case requires a showing that the plaintiff was replaced with a candidate sufficiently younger to permit an inference of age discrimination.
of course,in light of the circumstance that we are applying state law we recognize that we are bound by the opinions of the state highest court,gares willingboro township,cir,though i n the absence of guidance from it,we are to consider decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts for assistance in predicting how the state highest court would rule.werwinski ford motor,cir quoting gares,at.thus,we have given careful consideration to petrusky and reynolds.nevertheless,after analyzing these appellate division cases,we conclude that the district court in swider was correct and agree with it that the reynolds court misconstrued the standard in sisler.swider,d at to us it is clear from sisler that when the supreme court of new jersey set out the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case framework in an age discrimination case it regarded that standard as applicable in both traditional and reverse age discrimination cases,the difference being that in a traditional case the replacement employee must be sufficiently younger than the replaced employee and in a sisler reverse discrimination situation the replacement employee must be sufficiently older than the replaced employee.
when the sisler court explained the fourth element it was following the analysis of prior cases as to what was required to establish a prima facie case in an age discrimination context.as set forth above,the supreme court of new jersey in sisler specifically stated that,under the nj lad,which specifies no qualifying age,courts have modified the fourth element to require a showing that the plaintiff was replaced with a candidate sufficiently younger to permit an inference of age discrimination.at citation omitted emphasis added nothing in sisler suggests that the principles underlying this modest modification are applicable only in cases involving reverse age discrimination and we see no reason to limit the holding of the supreme court of new jersey to those cases as it would not be logical to do so.see swider,d at stating that under sisler t he fourth prong remains unchanged in age discrimination cases,whether they be traditional or reverse.indeed,the modification,as literally stated,could not be applicable in a case in which the employer is terminating the employee by reason of youth as in such a case it would be inconsistent with the discriminatory act for an employer to hire an even younger replacement.thus,we are at a loss to understand how the appellate division limited sisler s articulation of the fourth element of a prima facie case to cases involving reverse age discrimination.
in declining to follow reynolds and petrusky we point out that they lead to an absurd result.if a plaintiff only need show,as these cases indicate,to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination that he or she was a member of the protected class,performed satisfactorily,but was discharged following which the employer sought a replacement employee then,in view of the circumstance that the njlad does not include a old age threshold,practically every terminated employee would be able to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination thus,reynolds and petrusky require that a court find that a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of age discrimination even though none of the four elements of his or her prima facie case in any way relates to the plaintiff age.
such a result would fly in the face of the requirement set forth in consolidated coin caterers,d citation omitted,that there must be a least a logical connection between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a legally mandatory,rebuttable presumption.moreover,the result would be at odds with the recognition in sisler that a prima facie case analysis focuses on whether the plaintiff has established a logical reason to believe that the decision rests on a legally forbidden ground.sisler,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,the presumed age discrimination would be generic because the plaintiff under sisler could be either too young or too old 
overall we are satisfied that we should apply the same standard for the fourth element of monaco prima facie case under the njlad as we would have applied under the adea if he had brought his case under that statute.thus,we look to the ages of the remaining similarly situated employees to compare them to monaco to see if he has established the existence of that element.see anderson,at sisler,at we are convinced that sisler compels this result.of course,as we explain below,we apply this element in a way to make it relevant in this situation.
similarly situated 
frequently courts apply the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis when an employer replaces an employee.but here we deal with that analysis in the different context of a reduction in force.in anderson,at,we explained that in the first step of the burden shifting analysis in a case brought under the adea,the plaintiff must show,as part of the fourth element,that the employer retained someone similarly situated to him who was sufficiently younger.we reasoned that unless the fourth element required the individual retained to be similarly situated to the one who was terminated we would be construing the adea as a bumping statute guaranteeing employment to a protected worker at the expense of a sufficiently younger employee.id.
in the absence of divergent language between the njlad and federal discrimination laws,the supreme court of new jersey has applied federal standards in njlad cases in the interest of achieving a degree of uniformity in the discrimination laws.sisler,at see lawrence westminster bank,cir a ge discrimination claims under the adea and nj lad are governed by the same standards and allocation of burdens of proof citations omitted.inasmuch as there is no applicable divergent statutory language in this case,and taking into consideration the references in sisler to the age of replacement employees,we believe that if faced with a case of age discrimination in the context of a reduction in force,the supreme court of new jersey would adopt the similarly situated requirement of anderson.
in anderson,at,we held that employees were not similarly situated to positions or other positions without providing any evidence of routine job shuffling.we affirmed the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendants as to certain plaintiffs because the employees retained were either not sufficiently younger or the evidence failed to show that the duties were comparable or that they were otherwise similarly situated.id.
in this case we are required to articulate further who is similarly situated for purposes of making out the fourth element of a prima facie case in a situation under the njlad in accord with anderson,we will not compare an individual such as monaco,a vice president in charge of the eastern region,with employees without evidence of routine job shuffling which does not exist.see id.however,an individual does not need to be situated identically to satisfy the fourth element of a plaintiff prima facie case under the njlad.in order to determine who might qualify as a similarly situated employee we must look to the job function,level of supervisory responsibility and salary,as well as other factors relevant to the particular workplace.this determination requires a court to undertake a inquiry on a basis rather than in a mechanistic and inflexible manner.see pivirotto innovative,cir.
thus,we must determine which employees at agac were similarly situated to monaco.agac maintains that shaw,the vice president for the western region,who was two years older than monaco,was the only individual it employed similarly situated to monaco.of course,there is no doubt but that monaco and shaw were similarly situated as they had the same job responsibilities,though for different regions,and monaco does not contend otherwise.he does counter agac argument,however,by contending that we should read the similarly situated requirement more broadly and also consider the eight sales vice managers whom he directly supervised to be similarly situated.the district
