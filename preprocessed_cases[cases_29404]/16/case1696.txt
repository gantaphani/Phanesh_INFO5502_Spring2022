this case,which involves an allegation of infringement of the icee trademark,was previously before us on an interlocutory appeal,icee distributors,snack foods,cir.we upheld an injunction,solely on grounds,against snack food and stores,prohibiting them from selling squeeze tubes within the territory covered by the exclusive license agreement between icee distributors,distributors and the icee,icee of america ioa.on remand,the district court denied distributors motion for reconsideration of its earlier summary judgment dismissing distributors claim and partially granted defendants motion to modify the judgment by narrowing the injunction so as to apply only to.
in this appeal,distributors challenges both the district court grant of summary judgment on the claim and the district court modification of the injunction.we affirm,in part,and reverse,in part,the grant of summary judgment and vacate the modification of the injunction.
our previous opinion lays out the background of this dispute 
in the,the john mitchell company mitchell company developed the icee,a beverage consisting of carbonated water and syrup mixed together that stands up when poured into a cup.through its subsidiary,iceequip,the mitchell company owned the trademark rights to the icee name on products such as the cups for holding the frozen carbonated beverage,the machines for making the beverage,and the beverage itself.iceequip entered into several trademark licensing agreements with icee distributors in different parts of the country.distributors,by virtue of its purchase of several regional distributorships that had each entered into these licensing agreements,is a party to these agreements for its various distribution territories,which include most of louisiana and arkansas,and parts of texas,missouri,alabama,and georgia.
in the,the mitchell company went out of business.in response,the regional licensees,including distributors and the icee company,a subsidiary of,formed icee of america ioa.upon execution of an assignment agreement,ioa acquired the ownership rights and interests in the trademarks previously held by iceequip.both distributors and the icee company own stock in ioa,with the icee company being the largest shareholder and distributors the second largest.
in,began manufacturing frozen tubes under the name icee on a nationwide basis.sold these tubes in its sam club stores.although requested permission from distributors to sell the tubes in its territory,distributors refused.sold the tubes in distributors territory nonetheless.distributors filed this suit in may against and for trademark infringement and dilution.
after the case was filed,attempted unsuccessfully to register with the patent and trademark office a trademark for the use of the icee name on the tubes.the pto rejected the application on the basis that the proposed trademark would likely be confused with ioa trademarks on the icee beverage,cups,and beverage machine.then assigned the trademark application to ioa,which successfully registered the trademark.ioa president,dan fachner,who was also the president of subsidiary the icee company,then granted a license dated february,to use the trademark in areas including distributors territory.
after execution of the licensing agreement between ioa and,distributors added ioa as a defendant,alleging that ioa,as the assignee of the trademarks previously held by iceequip,was bound to the licensing agreements with distributors,and had breached those contracts by entering into the squeeze tube agreement with.the district court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor on the trademark infringement claim,but held a trial on the trademark dilution and breach of contract claims,bifurcating the liability and damages stages.after the liability stage of the trial,the jury found and liable for willful trademark dilution and ioa liable for breach of contract.based on the jury verdict,the trial court subsequently entered a permanent injunction against and forbidding the sale of squeeze tubes within distributors territory.
and ioa immediately filed an interlocutory appeal seeking to set aside the injunction,which appeal led to the opinion quoted above.we affirmed the injunction,but solely on the basis of the claim.we held that distributors claim failed because distributors was not the owner of the icee trademark and thus did not have standing to sue under the federal trademark dilution act.id.at.because our review was limited to the propriety of the injunction,we remanded to allow further proceedings consistent with our interlocutory opinion.thus,once the case had been remanded,the district court had before it first,the damages issue on the claim against ioa,and,second,the grant of summary judgment it had earlier entered against distributors on the claim.
on remand,distributors moved the district court for reconsideration of summary judgment based on facts that came to light judgment during trial of the and claims.the district court denied the motion to reconsider,and distributors waived its right to a trial to quantify its damages against ioa on the claim.the district court entered final judgment keeping the original permanent injunction in force and denying all other relief.defendants then moved to vacate and modify the judgment and moved for a new trial on the claim.the district court denied the motion for new trial,but narrowed the permanent injunction so as to prohibit,but not,from selling the tubes in distributors territory.
distributors appeals the summary judgment denying the claim,the denial of the motion made on remand to reconsider the summary judgment,and the modification of the permanent injunction.defendants the denial of their motion for retrial.
we first address the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing distributors claim.a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,using the same standard applied by the district court.hall gillman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.

shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided 
we considered this provision in matrix essentials,emporium drug mart,of lafayette,cir,which the district court cited as controlling its analysis.in matrix essentials,a manufacturer matrix of specialty products sold only at salons licensed to carry the products sued a retail drug store emporium stocking matrix products on its shelves,claiming that emporium unauthorized sale of matrix products constituted trademark infringement.matrix relied on two theories.first,it claimed that emporium was not selling genuine matrix products because emporium sold the products without the professional consultation supposed to be available to a customer purchasing matrix products from a licensed salon.second,matrix contended that emporium deceived the public into believing that matrix had authorized emporium to sell its products.we rejected both theories on the ground that consumer confusion is the linchpin of trademark infringement analysis,and concluded that trademark law does not apply to the sale of genuine goods bearing a true mark,even if the sale is without the consent.id.at.consumer confusion could not be established in matrix essentials because the products bearing the mark were clearly authorized by the holder of the trademark in fact,the products were manufactured by matrix itself.thus,the mark on the product properly indicated that matrix was the ultimate source of the goods,controlling the quality of the product via its control of the mark,and no consumer confusion was possible.thus,the products were genuine goods bearing a true mark and their unauthorized sale could not constitute trademark infringement.
applying this rule,the district court,in granting summary judgment for defendants,held 
i t is undisputed that icee of america is the owner of the products are of the same origin and quality as icee distributors products.it is undisputed that the quality of the products sold by icee distributors under the trademark icee and the quality of the products sold by through under the trademark icee is controlled by the same trademark owner,icee of america it is undisputed that has the icee mark owner consent to produce and sell frozen flavored ice products bearing the icee mark.thus,there can be no consumer confusion.without consumer confusion,icee distributors has no claim for trademark infringement.
memorandum ruling,june,at.
distributors contends that ioa did not,in fact,properly authorize to use the icee mark on the squeeze tubes.distributors makes three primary arguments contesting the district court holding.first,distributors contends that the license agreement tube license that ioa granted in february was void at the outset as a matter of law because it purported to grant a the right to sell products in distributors ioa no longer had because of its exclusive license agreement with distributors.second,distributors argues that,even if ioa had the right to grant such a license,there are genuine issues of material fact bearing on whether ioa ever gave authorized consent to to use the icee mark on the tubes in other words,the grant of the tube license was invalid.third,distributors urges that,even if the tube license was valid when issued,it does not excuse sales made prior to the execution of the tube license.we address these arguments in turn.
distributors maintains that is liable for trademark infringement because the tube license was void at the outset as a matter of law due to the conflict between it and distributors exclusive territorial license,which had been previously granted by ioa.distributors relies on the tenth circuit opinion in san juan products,san juan pools of kansas,cir,for the proposition that a license granting rights already granted exclusively to an earlier licensee is void.
distributors reliance on san juan products is unpersuasive.the ruling in san juan products,although generally relevant,can not control the instant case because the tenth circuit did not have occasion to decide specifically the effect of the duplicative licensing on a claim of.san juan products,san juan,a maker of fiberglass swimming pools,had granted to sun n surf exclusive marketing rights in a broadly defined territory including the state of kansas.a few years later,san juan signed a license agreement purportedly making san juan pools of kansas,sjk the exclusive dealer in kansas.after sjk license expired,sjk began selling pools allegedly splashed copied from san juan models but marked with a different trade name.san juan sued sjk for trademark infringement based on sjk splashing of its pools.sjk defended,claiming a breach of the license.although the tenth circuit did hold,inter alia,that the license agreement between san juan and sjk was void at the outset or voidable at its instance because it purported to grant to sjk rights which had already been granted exclusively to sun n surf,the court did so only in the context of explaining the absence of a claim for breach of the license there was no breach because there was no license.the tenth circuit did not uphold a claim against sjk based on the invalidity of sjk license in fact,san juan claims were rejected because,according to the court,san juan had no trademark rights in kansas to begin with.
distributors argument,extrapolating from the holding of san juan products to find an infringement claim here,expands trademark law beyond its proper scope.trademark law is plainly not designed to protect licensees as such,but instead to protect the,confusion about a product source and,relatedly,to protect investment in the goodwill associated with their marks.see,two pesos taco cabana,d.because the rights of a licensee are derivative of the rights of the a claim of infringement by a licensee seems impossible to maintain where the could not bring such a claim.it is reasoning that a has no claim of trademark infringement against a manufacturer that produced approved marked goods pursuant to an agreement with the itself nor,then,can a claim of infringement be brought by the prior licensee,whose interest in its exclusive rights is properly protected by contract law.underlying this reasoning is the rule that we recognized in matrix essentials discussed above so long as the trademark indicates that the is the ultimate source of approval for the marked product,there can be no consumer confusion and,consequently,no infringement.put another way,the fact that a subsequent license breaches the earlier licensee contractual rights does not affect the fact that the is the ultimate source of the product.consequently,a n exclusive licensee does not have a claim for trademark infringement against a subsequent licensee.the claim arises instead under inducing breach against the subsequent licensee and for breach of contract against the licensor.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,see also ballet makers.mj partners restaurant.partnership zadikoff,d.here,the tube license,on its face,is an exercise of ioa control over the icee mark and the quality of goods bearing the icee mark.notwithstanding the fact that the tube license may constitute a breach of distributors license agreement with ioa,a claim of trademark infringement can not lie so long as the tube license establishes ioa control over the squeeze tubes produced by under the icee mark.
we therefore must turn to distributors arguments that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether ioa did in fact authorize to place the icee mark on squeeze tubes.
distributors contends that there exist genuine issues of material fact as to whether the tube license was properly approved by the ioa board,and thus whether it legally manifests the consent of ioa.distributors specifically contends that the trial of the and claims exhibited several fact issues supporting its contention that the tube license was not a valid exercise of directorial control.distributors argues,for example,that the tube license is of questionable validity because of potential dan fachner,who signed the tube license as president of ioa,is also the president of the icee company,a subsidiary of gerald shreiber,a member of the ioa board,signed the tube license as president edward steele,a member of the ioa board,was a former employee of the icee company.distributors also argues that proper corporate procedures for entering into a license agreement were not followed.a central issue at the trial was whether fachner executed the tube license with the consent of the ioa board and the tube license was not signed by ioa secretary,chris watkins,as allegedly required by ioa corporate.
these factual contentions,which we will only assume to be relevant in determining whether the squeeze tubes were properly authorized by ioa,were not presented by distributors to the district court when it considered defendants motion for summary judgment,which was granted before the first appeal and remand.review of a grant of summary judgment is generally limited to the record before the district court when it ruled on the motion.see abbott equity group,cir topalian ehrman,cir.distributors,however,moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment after we remanded the case in.
