geraldine nicholas appeals the district court denial of her motion to compel arbitration of her contract dispute with kbr,the successor corporation of her deceased husband former employer,kellogg.nicholas contends that the district court improperly ruled that she waived her right to arbitrate her dispute with kbr.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court did not err when it found that nicholas substantially invoked the judicial process to the prejudice of kbr.consequently,we affirm the district court judgment.
james nicholas was an employee of kellogg when he developed mesothelioma,a fatal form of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure.on december,kellogg executed a written severance agreement with nicholas the agreement.under the agreement,kellogg agreed to continue nicholas benefits and nicholas agreed to release kellogg from liability for any claims he had against it.the agreement also contained an arbitration clause.
nicholas took a medical leave of absence from his job in late and continued to receive health insurance benefits at active employee rates.he died in december.
nicholas wife,geraldine nicholas,filed this lawsuit in texas state court on january,alleging that kbr breached the agreement with her husband by failing to pay his life insurance benefits.although nicholas did not attach the agreement to her original petition,she described in her petition a severance agreement executed by kellogg and her husband in december of.she also alleged that the agreement she described contained kellogg guarantees of additional benefits,salary,and payments,and nicholas release of kellogg from any potential liability.nicholas petition,however,neither mentioned the agreement arbitration clause nor gave any other indication that she wanted to arbitrate her claims.
kbr removed the case to federal court on february.thereafter,nicholas filed a motion to remand,or,in the alternative,to amend the pleadings.on april,the district court denied nicholas motion to remand,but granted her motion for leave to amend.in denying the motion to remand,the district court found that section a b of erisa,a b,completely preempted nicholas state law claims because they sought to recover benefits allegedly due her deceased husband under kbr benefits plan.see metro.life ins.taylor,d.
nicholas filed her first amended complaint on may.the amended complaint reiterated nicholas allegations concerning kbr breach of the agreement.as she did in her original petition,nicholas did not mention the agreement arbitration clause or otherwise indicate that she wanted to arbitrate her claims.
on june,the parties filed their joint management plan.shortly thereafter,the district court issued a scheduling order.the order set a discovery cutoff of february,a pretrial motions deadline of february,and a docket call for april.
shortly after the district court issued its scheduling order,kbr served written discovery on nicholas.nicholas responded to that discovery without raising arbitration or otherwise objecting.nicholas also sat without objection for her deposition.
in her deposition,portions of which were included as an attachment to kbr response to the motion to compel,nicholas admitted that a copy of the agreement was in her possession in her late husband files she also admitted that she may have seen a copy of that document prior to finding the original in his files in the spring of she further admitted to having a discussion in january of with someone at kbr regarding whether her husband signed an agreement to arbitrate.
on november,than ten months after nicholas sued kbr in texas state filed the underlying motion to compel arbitration.in the motion,nicholas did not address the potential waiver of her right to arbitrate.
on december,nicholas noticed the deposition of a witness,jim wilhite,and proceeded to take his deposition on december.
on january,kbr filed a response to nicholas motion to compel arbitration and argued that nicholas waived her right to arbitration by substantially invoking the judicial process to the prejudice of kbr.in the motion,kbr specifically argued that nicholas was aware of the agreement arbitration clause when she filed her original petition in texas state court in january.nicholas did not respond to kbr argument that she waived arbitration.indeed,she filed no reply or evidence of any kind.
the district court denied nicholas motion to compel arbitration.the court found that nicholas decision to file suit indicated a disinclination to arbitrate her claims,and that her failure to assert her right to arbitration for over ten months prejudiced kbr.nicholas appeals that decision,arguing that the district court improperly ruled that she substantially invoked the judicial process to the prejudice of kbr.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction of this appeal even though the district court denial of nicholas motion to compel arbitration is an interlocutory ruling.see green tree fin.randolph,d a c.we review the legal question of whether nicholas conduct amounts to a waiver of arbitration de novo however,we review the factual findings underlying the district court waiver determination only for clear error.subway equip.leasing forte,cir.the district court factual findings are clearly erroneous only if,after reviewing the record,we are firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.baldwin stalder,cir.
the right to arbitrate a dispute,like all contract rights,is subject to waiver.miller brewing fort worth distrib,cir.although waiver of arbitration is a disfavored finding,w aiver will be found when the party seeking arbitration substantially invokes the judicial process to the detriment or prejudice of the other party.id.at.a party generally invokes the judicial process by initially pursuing litigation of claims then reversing course and attempting to arbitrate those claims.see gulf guar.life ins.life ins,cir.but waiver can also result from some overt act in court that evinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration.id.internal quotations omitted.one of the primary goals of arbitration is to avoid the expense of litigation.price drexel burnham lambert,cir.in reviewing the question of whether the district court properly found waiver,then,we must look at two questions did nicholas substantially invoke the judicial process,and if,so was kbr prejudiced thereby 
invocation of the judicial process 
in the vast majority of cases involving the question of waiver,it is the party being sued that belatedly seeks arbitration.here,in contrast,it is the plaintiff,who,despite filing suit and pursuing her claims in court for more than ten months,now seeks to compel arbitration.the district court concluded that nicholas substantially invoked the judicial process by filing suit and pursuing her claims for over ten months before invoking her right to arbitrate.we agree.
although this circuit has not expressly drawn a distinction between the waiver analysis when applied to a plaintiff and that applied to a defendant,we have recognized that the decision to file suit typically indicates a disinclination to arbitrate.joseph chris pers.servs.rossi,cir unpublished see also miller,at concluding that a party revealed a disinclination to resort to arbitration by,among other things,filing suit in state court without mentioning its desire to arbitrate.we have not,however,gone as far as the seventh circuit on this issue,and we do not do so here,as we continue to require a showing of prejudice,even if there is a substantial invocation of the process.see cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir holding that a party election to proceed before a nonarbitral tribunal for the resolution of a contractual dispute is a presumptive waiver of the right to arbitrate.
we conclude that the act of a plaintiff filing suit without asserting an arbitration clause constitutes substantial invocation of the judicial process,unless an exception applies.indeed,short of directly saying so in open court,it is difficult to see how a party could more clearly evince a desire to resolve a dispute through litigation rather than arbitration,gulf,at,than by fili
