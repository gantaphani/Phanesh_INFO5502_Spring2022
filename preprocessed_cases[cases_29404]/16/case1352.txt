the parties in this case were romantic partners who exchanged vows,lived together,and worked side by side in a business known as hair of the dog in asheville,north carolina.the defendant,michelle hirsch,and the plaintiff,tammy steelman,supported themselves from the business proceeds.they anticipated spending their lives together,but when the romantic relationship ended,the professional relationship collapsed as well.in this lawsuit,steelman seeks an ownership share in hair of the dog and compensation for work that she alleges was performed in reliance on hirsch promises of additional compensation,in addition to or in lieu of damages under the fair labor standards act flsa and the north carolina wage and hour act.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the sole federal cause of flsa dismissed the state law claims without prejudice after it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.we affirm,because the flsa covers only employees and can not be stretched to reach the particular arrangement at issue here.although the plaintiff may well have a basis for recovery in state law,the flsa can not be transformed into a blunt instrument to resolve all manner of financial disputes.
plaintiff tammy steelman and defendant michelle hirsch met and became romantically involved in the fall of.the relationship quickly became a serious one and steelman moved in with hirsch in december of that year.the couple initially agreed to split rent,utilities,and food costs.the next month,however,the couple revised their arrangement when steelman left her job at a local residential cleaning company to work at hair of the dog,a business that hirsch had founded as a sole proprietorship in june of.
steelman saw the job as a way to build on a committed domestic partnership.we discussed the fact that we planned on being together,steelman said in her deposition.my working for her was us working for our future.steelman also believed she would be better off financially,because her new position was a job.it was hirsch and i committed to a business,and we did everything we could to make it succeed.she added,there was never any question that we were going to be together forever and that we were going to work side by side in that business.at the time steelman started work,she and hirsch were the only people working at hair of the dog.
steelman worked at hair of the dog for the next four years,performing tasks such as bathing and grooming dogs and ordering,receiving,and selling merchandise.after hirsch instructed her in technique,steelman said,a nything she did,i did,and anything i did,she did.we worked.steelman said that when the company hired additional workers,she acted as supervisor and had the authority to hire and fire.
the couple did not sign a compensation agreement,but according to steelman,they had conversations in which hirsch communicated that w hat was mine was hers and what was hers was mine.they also agreed that instead of splitting the cost of their lives together as initially planned,they would pay their expenses from hair of the dog revenue.the couple took the company successes and failures into account when they made spending decisions,but throughout their relationship,they used business proceeds to pay their rent and their bills for electricity,water,cable service,and internet access.the funds also covered steelman cell phone,auto insurance,and doctor visits,as well as the cost of food,gas,and cigarettes.in addition,the couple took trips to places including charleston,las vegas,new orleans,phoenix,california,florida,and georgia using company funds.when steelman needed a car in,she purchased a jeep from hirsch father for.
steelman said she was uncomfortable with the amount of the company proceeds spent to maintain the couple lifestyle.she said hirsch spent all the money on extravagant gifts,and that the couple was continuously eating out.as she put it in her deposition,we were blowing every penny we made as fast as we could make it.had to have the best of everything.i did believe in that.i believed we should be saving money and saving for our future.
both steelman and hirsch were issued american express cards whose bills were paid from hair of the dog proceeds,and both used the cards for personal expenses like gas and cigarettes.the couple also had a joint checking account and atm cards.before making large expenditures,however,steelman would generally have to ask hirsch to transfer money from hair of the dog to the couple personal account,because the personal account usually contained little cash and steelman herself could not make withdrawals from the business account.steelman kept a separate savings account of her own,to which she would make occasional deposits,but not withdrawals for expenses.she received health insurance through hair of the dog for most of her time at the company,and received sporadic paychecks to substantiate the company claim that she was on its payroll for insurance eligibility purposes.
hirsch said in an affidavit that during the couple relationship,the parties spent substantially more than the business earned.hirsch borrowed from her parents to pay costs such as expenses and taxes,and after this lawsuit was filed hirsch said in an affidavit that she owed more than to her parents for these debts,most of which she said were incurred while steelman worked at the company.
the parties bitterly dispute whether their private agreements included guarantees of further compensation for steelman.steelman alleges that on several occasions,beginning in early,the couple agreed that she would have a percent stake in hair of the dog.hirsch said that she discussed making steelman a partner in the business,but had serious reservations and never promised her a stake.in denying that she treated steelman as a partner in the business,hirsch said that she considered steelman an employee and operated the business as a sole proprietorship.
steelman said that hirsch promised other compensation as well.she said hirsch agreed to give her money to deposit in a savings account,promised that if she left the business she would be taken care of financially,and offered severance payments,either in lieu of or in addition to the ownership stake.she said that when hair of the dog stopped issuing sporadic salary checks,hirsch told her the business would institute profit sharing.finally,steelman said the couple discussed paying her commissions,but that while she received one or two such checks,they did not become commonplace.steelman said that she tried to get promises of an ownership stake and of severance payments reduced to writing between and,but that these efforts were unsuccessful.
although steelman said that the parties at one point exchanged vows and considered themselves married,they drifted apart.they went into couples counseling,and considered living together but not working together and working together but not living together.during her last six months at the business,steelman said that hirsch began to accuse her of taking more from the business than she was giving.
their conflict came to a head in january of.hirsch asked steelman to return her american express card.steelman said she did not know what prompted the action,but acknowledged that hirsch mother had been saying month after month that the couple was spending too much money.steelman quit and moved out of the home the couple shared.she and hirsch agreed to continue couples counseling,steelman said,because we still loved each other and were wanting to try to work things out and being together was the problem.
steelman said she asked for severance that month,but that hirsch told her she was not entitled to severance because she quit without notice.the couple nevertheless remained friendly until late february or early march,when hirsch became romantically involved with someone else.steelman said she was devastated,and felt unwelcome for the first time in the home that the couple had shared.she started a competing business,and filed this lawsuit.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the flsa claims.the court wrote that the plaintiff could only recover under the flsa if she had been an employee.it held that the plaintiff testimony undercut any claim under the flsa,because the plaintiff claimed to be a partner in hair of the dog and partnership would be inconsistent with employee status.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims,which were all based in state law.it therefore dismissed without prejudice the claim under the north carolina wage and hour act,as well as the claims for fraud and breach of contract or,in the alternative,recovery quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.plaintiff steelman now appeals.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and drawing all permissible inferences in the light most favorable to her.see,walton greenbrier ford,cir a fisherman best,recreational fishing alliance,cir.
we must determine here whether federal law prohibited the longterm couple in this case from arranging their finances as they did,and permits the plaintiff to avoid or supplement the personal and professional bargain she made with the defendant on the grounds that the flsa required a different arrangement.the flsa imposes minimum wage,overtime,and requirements,but the requirements apply only to employees.see a minimum wage id.overtime id.c see also tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor,d.
the plaintiff claimed a partnership stake in hair of the dog and does not dispute that such an interest would preclude her being an employee under the flsa,but she notes that her flsa count was one of several claims made in the alternative.while some evidence in the record supported her claim to an ownership stake,a court might nevertheless find that she was not a.if a court so found,the plaintiff argues,she should be permitted to recover back wages as an employee under the flsa.
we agree that a party may make claims of ownership and employee status in the alternative.but federal law does not divide the world exclusively into owners and employees,and we reject the plaintiff contentions because the relationship that she describes does not make her an employee regardless of her ownership status under state law.
a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that she is an employee under the flsa.benshoff city of virginia beach,cir.the act itself provides little guidance on the term meaning.it defines an employee as any individual employed by an employer,e,subject to enumerated exceptions,but this is completely circular and explains nothing,nationwide mut.ins.darden,d discussing same language in.the flsa does not add much when it defines employ to include to suffer or permit to work.g.consequently,there is in the fair labor standards act no definition that solves problems as to the limits of the relationship under the act.rutherford food mccomb.
the case law provides more direction.the supreme court has said that the term employee is to be broadly construed,but it does have its limits,tony susan alamo,at,and those limits must be defined in accordance with economic reality,id.at.quoting goldberg whitaker house,d internal quotations omitted.the cases make clear that the economic reality standard calls for pragmatic construction of a may have seemed at once too commonplace and too nuanced to define.thus,courts have been exhorted to examine the circumstances of the whole activity,rather than isolated factors,rutherford,at,or technical concepts,goldberg,at.internal quotations omitted,and they have noted that in the absence of a statutory definition,it is permissible to draw upon common linguistic intuitions,vanskike peters,cir.in short,w e can not assume that congress here was referring to work or employment other than as those words are commonly used when it enacted the language of the flsa.coal,iron muscoda local.
prior decisions make use of this contextual,approach.the supreme court has applied the flsa without regard to deviations from traditional employment paradigms that are largely technical.see,goldberg,at.holding formal differences between cooperative members and traditional employees to be irrelevant tony susan alamo,at.holding workers who received benefits to be employees in part because benefits were wages in another form united states rosenwasser.holding workers to be covered even if their employer chose to pay them by rather than hourly wage.
however,when relationships have deviated from the traditional understanding of employment in fundamental ways,the supreme court has refused to shoehorn them into the act.for example,the court has written that the flsa would not apply to volunteers who without promise or expectation of compensation,but solely for their personal purpose or pleasure,worked in activities carried on by other persons either for their pleasure or profit.walling portland terminal.and it has written that the flsa does not cover independent contractors who without any express or implied compensation agreement,might work for their own advantage on the premises of another.id.we have joined other circuits in using this approach to conclude that prisoners in an inmate labor program should not be treated as employees under the flsa,because their work differs substantially from the traditional employment paradigm covered by the act and is not the arms length bargain for labor that occurs in a true relationship.harker state use,cir.
the plaintiff does not quarrel with the tenth circuit application of these principles to hold that general partners in a business are not covered by the flsa.see wheeler hurdman,cir.the tenth circuit wrote that t he word employee,however broadly defined,is still employee,and circumscribed by meanings reasonably related to that word.id.at.it concluded,pertinently for this case,that attributes of partnership such as exposure to risk,managerial control,and the ability to share in profits,id.at,introduce complexities and economic realities which are not consonant with employee status,id.at see also clackamas gastroenterology assocs.wells,d declining to hold that shareholders and directors of professional corporation must be employees under americans with disabilities act definition of individual employed by an employer.
taking the evidence in this case in the light most favorable to her,the plaintiff can not be adjudged an employee for purposes of the flsa under these precedents,or under any analysis based in economic reality.the intended lifetime partnership she described was not the exchange of labor for mutual economic gain that occurs in a true relationship.harker,at internal quotations omitted.according to the plaintiff,the couple saw their work together as a way to improve an economic future that they intended to share in perpetuity,rather than as a transfer of one individual assets to another in exchange for labor.the plaintiff did not obtain a portion of her supposed employer took from those assets for her own purposes with a discretion that is fundamentally alien to relationships.
to be sure,the plaintiff would consult with the defendant prior to significant expenditures,and she did not withdraw funds directly from the company coffers.but her financial control was substantial even if it was indirect she funded her expenditures using an american express card whose bills were paid by the business and by withdrawals from a joint checking account containing funds transferred from hair of the dog.far from alleging that she had the benefit of only a meager share of company resources as a result of her indirect control,the plaintiff said she would have preferred that the couple spent less of the business money,took fewer trips,and ate out at restaurants less regularly.
such extensive access to company funds is not the kind of privilege that employees enjoy with respect to their employers revenue.indeed,the plaintiff ability to draw compensation from the company exceeded the financial control typical in the partnerships that the plaintiff does not dispute fall outside the flsa.when the plaintiff lived comfortably and exclusively off the proceeds of the business and exerted authority in disposing of its funds,we find it hard to see the bargain exchanging labor for c
