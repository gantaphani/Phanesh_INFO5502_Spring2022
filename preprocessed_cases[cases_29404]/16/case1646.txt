fleetwood motor homes of indiana fleetwood appeals the district court judgment in favor of randy and karen alston the alstons in a redhibitory action involving a recreational vehicle rv with a leaky roof.
the alstons,who reside in southwest louisiana,purchased a new rv from fleetwood.a month later,the alstons drove the rv to a fleetwood service center in houston,texas,for repairs.karen alston testified that she told the service center about roof leaks at this time,although the work order for this visit does not mention any roof leaks.the service center addressed eighteen other complaints,including problems with a burning smell and the rv backup camera and televisions.the following month,the alstons,experiencing more difficulties,took the rv back to the same service center.on this visit,the work order reflects nine customer complaints,including ceiling leaks.
a few days after the service center completed the second set of repairs,the alstons attorney sent a demand letter to fleetwood,complaining that the rv roof continued to leak.in response,a fleetwood representative traveled to louisiana,picked up the rv,and transported it to the main fleetwood facility in indiana.there,fleetwood installed a new roof on the rv.
four months after receiving the repaired rv back from fleetwood,the alstons took the rv to the fleetwood service center in houston for additional repairs.the work order for this visit reflects ten customer complaints,including a leaky air conditioning unit.after determining that the leaky air conditioner had been caused by a drill bit left under a gasket while the rv was at the indiana facility,the service center conducted repairs and returned the rv to the alstons.
approximately eight months later,the alstons initiated the instant action,complaining that the rv continued to leak despite fleetwood efforts to fix it.they alleged that the rv defects were redhibitory and sought a full refund of the purchase price.during the bench trial,expert witnesses disagreed on the cause of the roof leaks the alstons expert testified that the leaky roof was a manufacturer defect,while fleetwood expert opined that the leaks were caused by the alstons failure to properly maintain and replace the sealants as explained in the owner manual.
applying louisiana law in diversity jurisdiction,the district court found that a redhibitory defect existed at the time the alstons purchased the rv and awarded the alstons as the return of the purchase price,interest,in auto insurance premiums the alstons had paid for the vehicle,for mental anguish,in attorney fees,and in expert fees.the district court also denied fleetwood a credit for the alstons personal use of the the time they owned the vehicle.fleetwood appeals the district court judgement and damages.
fleetwood first contends that the district court erred in finding the leaky roof to be a redhibitory defect.we review the district court finding for clear error.see.a anderson city of bessemer city,d see also green benson and gold chevrolet,so d.cir explaining that the existence of a redhibitory defect is finding of fact.if the district court findings are plausible in light of the record,viewed as a whole,we can not reverse even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson,at.
redhibition is the avoidance of a sale on account of some vice or defect in the thing sold which renders it either absolutely useless,or its use so inconvenient and imperfect,that it must be supposed that the buyer would not have purchased it had he known of the vice.ann.in a suit for redhibition,the plaintiff must prove the thing sold is absolutely useless for its intended purposes or that its use is so inconvenient that it must be supposed that he would not have bought it had he known of the defect that the defect existed at the time he purchased the thing,but was neither known or apparent to him that the seller was given the opportunity to repair the defect.dalme blockers mfd.homes,so d.cir see.ann.
fleetwood argues that the alstons did not meet their burden of proof on the second the defect existed at the time of purchase.in support of this argument,fleetwood claims that the alstons expert testimony was identical to and fully corroborated their own expert testimony as to the cause of the leaks,namely that leakage resulted from faulty sealants around vents and skylights fleetwood further contends that,because the experts agreed that bad sealants caused the leaks,the evidence does not support the existence of a manufacturer defect rather it was the alstons failure to properly maintain the sealants that caused the roof to leak 
in making this argument,however,fleetwood neglects the real difference between the opinion of their own expert and that of the alstons expert.while both testified that the leaks resulted from problems with sealants,their testimonies diverge on the cause of the problems with the sealants.fleetwood expert testified that the leaks were the alstons fault because they did not properly maintain the sealants as required by the owner manual.the alstons expert,however,testified that he did not think the leaks were a customer care issue but rather a manufacturer defect he also opined that fleetwood should take the home back.the district court,in finding a manufacturer defect,did not err in crediting one expert over another.see orduna grain,cir.moreover,other evidence indicates that the leaky sealants were not likely a customer care issue,as fleetwood never any of the numerous service the alstons that they were improperly maintaining their rv sealants.
fleetwood also argues that the alleged defect was a series of leaks independent of each other and that no continuous leak existed since the time of purchase.each time a leak appeared,fleetwood claims to have fixed that leak,but then a different leak would show up in another area.
on a close review of the record,we find that the evidence supports the district court conclusion that the leaks were continuous since the time of purchase.the alstons expert explained why the roof continued to leak in different places over time due to the fact that w ater has a tendency to travel,especially in a motor home with it moving miles an hour you could have a leak up at the front and it would show up at the rear of the home.in light of this evidence,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding the leaky roof to be a redhibitory defect existing since the time of purchase.
fleetwood next argues that the district court erred in ordering rescission of the sale instead of a reduction in the original purchase price.as the decision to rescind the sale is a factual determination,see boudreaux riley buick,so d.cir,we review for clear error.see.a anderson,at.
once the district court found the leaky roof to be a redhibitory defect,rescission of the sale was appropriate.see.ann.morrison allstar dodge,so d.cir.however,the district court had discretion instead to limit the remedy of the buyer to a reduction of the price.ann.
citing cases where a court reduced the purchase price of the item instead of rescinding the sale,fleetwood argues that the district court was obliged to exercise its discretion to limit the remedy to the cost of fixing the leaky roof.see,baham cmty.motors,so d.cir boudreaux,so d at.relying on the alstons expert testimony on where he said that he would have charged to repair the leaky roof,fleetwood maintains that a rescission of the the alleged cost of repairing the unjustified.
fleetwood,however,relies on cases where the vehicle in question was fixable and,indeed,had already been repaired.baham,so d at reversing rescission with an engine had been repaired and was in good working order at the time of trial boudreaux,so d at affirming reduction in purchase price when all evidence confirmed that engine could be fully repaired.a reduction in purchase price is warranted only when the vehicle is able to be restored to its use.see ark la tex builders realty,hoge,so d.cir alexander burroughs,so d,noting the object of the provisions governing redhibitory vices is to restore the purchaser,as much as possible,to the condition he enjoyed prior to the sale.wh
