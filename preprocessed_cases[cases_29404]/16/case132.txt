this federal case seeks confirmation of an arbitration award made at the first,stage of arbitration as to a contract,and was filed approximately one month after the arbitral opponents had filed a petition in the puerto rico court of first instance to vacate the same award.
we have to answer two questions.the first is whether the federal district court had jurisdiction,despite its conclusion that it did not.the second is whether the federal court should stay its hand where the court of first instance confirmed the award on july,and that decision has been pending on appeal in the court of appeals since august.we answer both questions affirmatively.
as to jurisdiction,the court concluded that an absent party,bacardí corporation bc,was an indispensable party whose joinder would destroy complete diversity.on this question,we address whether bc,a party to an arbitration,which became a successor party to the disputed contract,but which is absent from this federal case brought to confirm the arbitration panel limited award that certain contract damages provisions are valid and binding,is a required party under.on the facts presented,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion it engaged in an incomplete rule a analysis,and its conclusions under rule were wrong.as a result,the proceeding should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under.b.
given the existence of a parallel case now on appeal in the local puerto rico courts involving the same issues,which includes bc and all of the parties to the arbitration,we direct the district court to stay these proceedings while the proceedings in the commonwealth courts are resolved.
factual background 
the underlying arbitration resulted from the of a agreement between suárez,vsc and bacardí caribbean corporation bcc.we review the events leading to the agreement,and explain the various corporate entities involved and their relationships to each other.
the petitioner,bacardí international limited bil,is a bermuda corporation engaged in the sale,promotion,and distribution of bacardí rum products and other alcoholic beverages.bil holds the sole and exclusive rights and authority to exploit and use commercially the trademarks and related intellectual property of the bacardí brands.its subsidiary,bacardí company limited baco,a liechtenstein corporation,is the registered owner and holds legal title to the trademarks and intellectual property.
on november,bil entered into a distribution agreement with bcc which granted bcc the exclusive right,privilege,and responsibility to sell and promote the sale of the products covered by the agreement in puerto rico.even though bacardí was the top selling brand of rum in puerto rico in,the distribution arrangement had become unprofitable for bcc.around the year,bcc stopped distributing certain other brands of alcohol,which left it with too high a cost structure.if the costs of delivery could be shed,bcc would improve its profitability,and so it contemplated alternative arrangements whereby profits could be shared with a that would absorb certain costs of distribution.eventually,in august,bcc executed an agreement with vsc,a puerto rico corporation with revenues of more than million in.vsc is one of puerto rico major corporations,which,at the time of the agreement,distributed over brands of products,had an inventory of over stock keeping units,and was known to use its leverage in contract negotiations.for vsc,adding bacardí rum to its line of products would make it the leading distributor of distilled products in puerto rico.
the agreement between vsc and bcc provided for vsc to have the exclusive right to sell and the covered products in puerto rico.bil consented to the agreement,as did bc,an entity we discuss later.the agreement included grounds to permit termination for just cause,limitations on damages,and provisions for dispute resolution requiring arbitration.
of particular relevance are the damages provisions contained in sections and of the contract.in section,vsc agreed that u pon expiration or termination of the agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof,it shall have no rights or claims to compensation of any kind whatsoever from any bacardí entity,including compensation for expenditures for advertising,marketing,sales,or promotion activities,certain capital investments,or for any goodwill vsc might establish.vsc also agreed,in section,that any damages it could recover against bcc of which bc became the successor would be offset by roughly million on a basis because the distribution rights had a value and vsc had not paid for that value.
about two years after the agreement was executed between bcc and vsc,on april,bcc consummated a merger with castleton holdings,the surviving corporation,which then merged with bc,the surviving entity of that merger.bc is both a delaware and a puerto rico corporation and is the producer of bacardí rum and other alcoholic products in puerto rico.bc and bil are both members of the bacardí family of companies,as both are subsidiaries of bacardí limited.
the dispute resulting in arbitration began on may,when the president and ceo of bc notified vsc by letter that bc as successor to bcc did not intend to renew the agreement.the letter stated that bc intended to use the alternative dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement to resolve any disputes arising out of or related to the of the agreement 
on october,bil,bc,and bcc filed a demand for arbitration against vsc.the bacardí entities made two claims in the demand a declaration that the million offset provision was valid and binding and in the alternative,that the bacardí entities had just cause to terminate or refuse to renew the agreement.if the pertinent damages provision were declared valid,vsc would not be entitled to any monetary recovery because vsc net profit from the prior fiscal year did not exceed the offset amount,or so bc alleged.
on november,vsc,accepting arbitration,filed a response to the demand and its own counterclaim.vsc asserted that certain damages provisions in the agreement,including the offset provision and other provisions that barred compensation for certain expenses and investments,were null and void because they violated law,law ann.tit,et.vsc also denied that bc had just cause not to renew or to terminate the contract and asserted that it was entitled to receive damages in excess of million under law 
the arbitration panel consisted of three neutral attorneys admitted to practice law in puerto rico.rather than deal with all the issues before it in one proceeding,the arbitration panel bifurcated the proceedings to decide first whether the contested provisions of the contract were valid and binding.as a result,the panel would not pass on the just cause defense,vsc claims for damages,or the bacardí entities other defenses until a later time,and then only if necessary.in other words,at the first stage,liability was not at issue,only the validity of certain clauses.it is the first portion of the bifurcated proceedings that has led to the federal case now before us.the parties inform us that there has been no second stage of the bifurcated proceedings to date.
the panel issued a final partial award the award on the bifurcated issue on july.in a page opinion,the panel found the contested provisions,including the offset and the limitations on compensation for certain expenses and investments,to be valid and enforceable the majority wrote 
the parties thus agreed on an amicable,method to handle a scenario in case vsc decided to apply law against a supplier for the first time in its history as a distributor.they settled not on a waiver of law damages,but on a on a sic way to calculate them with the statute specifically in mind.theirs was an agreement between sophisticated parties,free not forced to do what was in their best business interest and fully aware not misled as to the advantages and consequences of what they were doing in pursuit of those business interests.all within an integrated agreement that allowed vsc to distribute products it did not distribute before and gain the benefit of the prior distributor development of the market for years or so without any cost to vsc.
the panel did not decide if the validity of those provisions meant that vsc could not recover any monetary damages as the bacardí entities alleged,nor did it decide any other issues on liability.
since then,the arbitration has not continued while the parties have been waging pitched battles over the first stage of the arbitration in both federal and commonwealth courts.
procedural history 
dissatisfied with the award,vsc,on august,initiated a special proceeding against bc,bcc,and bil before the court of first instance in puerto rico seeking to vacate the award.vsc argued that the award should be vacated because the award was untimely under puerto rico law the award was contrary to law and public policy and the arbitrators were biased vsc memorandum made no explicit federal claims.
on september,bil,bc,and bcc filed a notice of removal in the federal district court in puerto rico.the bacardí entities asserted that diversity jurisdiction existed under a,on the grounds that bil was the only real since the award validates certain contractual provisions recognizing bil exclusive ownership rights of the distribution value and goodwill generated from the sale of bil brands in puerto rico.
the next day,bil filed a separate action,this case,in federal court,in its name only,moving to confirm the award under the federal arbitration act faa,et.the removed matter and bil faa confirmation proceeding were consolidated on september.
on september,vsc sought to remand the removed action.vsc also sought to dismiss bil federal action under.b.the heart of vsc argument was that bc,a puerto rico corporation,was a required and indispensable party under,and since it was with vsc,diversity jurisdiction was lacking in both matters 
on december,the district court issued an opinion and order addressing the removal of vsc case and the jurisdictional questions raised by bil case.the district court remanded the removed vsc case the court held that vsc inclusion of bc in the case removed from state court was proper because bc interest in the litigation was real.bc was not just a nominal party named to destroy jurisdiction.the court had to consider bc citizenship in the jurisdictional analysis and that divested the federal court of jurisdiction because bc and vsc are both citizens of puerto rico 
the court dismissed bil federal case.the district court found that bc was an indispensable party under.b,that bc presence would destroy diversity,and that vsc rule b motion should be granted 
on december,bil filed a timely appeal from the court order of dismissal.before arguments were heard in ths matter,the commonwealth court of first instance decided the remanded case on july.the court of first instance denied vsc request to vacate the award and confirmed the award.it ruled that the faa,not puerto rico law,provided the proper standards of judicial review the arbitration panel acted with integrity and impartiality manifest disregard of the law and violation of public policy are not proper grounds for vacatur under the faa and that even if they were valid grounds,the award was still valid and in accord with law.
on this appeal of the district court dismissal of bil federal case,bil makes sweeping arguments that rule is because it is preempted by the faa,and also argues that,in any event,the district court erred in its rule analysis.
we agree with bil narrower argument that the district court erred in its rule analysis.as a result,we do not reach bil arguments about whether the faa preempts rule,nor need we discuss the relationship between diversity jurisdiction and rule.see picciotto cont l cas,cir stating rule inquiry is equitable,but conclusion that party is indispensable destroys diversity.
we review a district court conclusion regarding the lack of jurisdiction de novo,and its findings of fact for clear error.valentin hosp.bella vista,cir.the court rule determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion.picciotto,at.an error of law is an abuse of discretion.aronov napolitano,cir en banc.an abuse also occurs when a court,in making a discretionary decision,relies upon an improper factor,neglects a factor entitled to substantial weight,or considers the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in weighing them.matamoros starbucks,cir.
rule addresses situations where a lawsuit is proceeding without a party whose interests are central to the suit.picciotto,at.the rule provides for joinder of required parties when feasible.a,and for dismissal of suits when joinder of a required party is not feasible and that party is indispensable.b.the rule calls for courts to make pragmatic,practical judgments that are heavily influenced by the facts of each case.see picciotto,at travelers indem.dingwell,cir see also wright miller,federal practice procedure by its very nature rule a calls for determinations that are heavily influenced by the facts and circumstances of individual cases.
we start with the problem that the district court failed to do a required party analysis,and if it did so without labeling its analysis as such,it failed to articulate why bc is a required party to this particular proceeding.if the court was wrong on its assumption that bc is a required party,then it was wrong to make an indispensability determination under rule b.picciotto,at pujol.express,cir.
it was an abuse of discretion for the court not to provide reasoned analysis on this required party point.further,to the extent reasoning was provided,it is incomplete and inadequate.that alone would warrant reversal.see,bakia los angeles,cir vacating and remanding where district court offered insufficient reasoning on rule analysis for appeals court to review.
we see no point in remanding this issue.the undisputed record before us is adequate to decide it,and the policies of the faa encourage speedy and efficient resolution of judicial review of arbitral awards.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d faa calls for speedy disposition of motions to enforce arbitration clauses metals,llc dempsey pipe supply,cir grounds for vacatur strictly limited to provide parties with efficient dispute resolution positive software solutions,new century mortg,cir faa narrowly restricts judicial review t o assure that arbitration serves as an efficient and alternative to litigation.
it is clear to us that bc is not a required party under rule a in the petition to confirm the arbitral award.we stress that this is not a question of whether bc would have been a required party if the contract dispute were being adjudicated in the district court and not in arbitration,nor is it an issue of the parties who were proper in the arbitration.vsc confuses the issues.ours is the different issue of whether bc is a required party in the petition to confirm given the limited nature of the arbitration award in the bifurcated arbitration and the very limited nature of judicial review.
questions under rule a are and driven by the nature of the issues before the court.we reject any notion that the analysis required by rule a may be displaced by a flat rule that whoever is a party to an arbitration,no matter how limited the award,is automatically a required party in a petition to confirm an award.
in a rule analysis,a court must first determine if an absent party is a required party under rule a.picciotto,at.rule a provides the standard,stating in relevant part 
required party.a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction must be joined as a party if 
a in that person absence,the court can not accord complete relief among existing parties or 
b that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person absence may 
i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect the interest or 
ii leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.
rule a a whether in bc absence,complete relief can not be afforded among existing parties 
complete relief can be afforded among those already parties in bc absence under rule a a.the district court can easily confirm or vacate the award with respect to bil and vsc without bc being a party to this petition.see,mastercard int l visa int l serv.ass n,cir explaining that existing parties can resolve their dispute and obtain complete relief as to each other without absent party presence although a dispute with absent party may be left unresolved northrop mcdonnell douglas,cir mcdonnell does not directly contend that the government absence would preclude the district court from being able to fashion meaningful relief as between the parties,and we discern no reason for so concluding.emphasis added.vsc argues that any relief would only be partial because it would not apply to bc and a different result could be reached in a local puerto rico court.but,we view those concerns as more relevant to the issues of prejudice and risk of inconsistent obligations,which,as we detail later,are not practical concerns on these facts.
vsc,then,must turn to the provisions of rule a b and its two subparts.
rule a b i bc ability to protect its interests is not impaired 
this subsection is concerned with protecting the interests of the absent party.in the first place,bc does not claim it has an interest which will be impaired.rather,it is bc opponent,vsc,which makes the claim.resolution of this petition in bc absence will not impair or impede bc ability to protect its interest.b b i.
in this confirmation proceeding,bil and bc have virtually identical interests the confirmation of the bifurcated award in pujol.express,breyer held that a subsidiary was not a required party under rule a because the parent and subsidiary had virtually identical interests because they would each wish to show the same thing.id.at.here,bil will argue that the award should not be vacated because there is no bias,manifest disregard of the law,or violation of puerto rico public policy.that is exactly what bc would wish to show if it were present.
we do not read shearson,as the district court did,as standing for the proposition that the absent party has to be a subsidiary of a present party for there to be virtually identical interests in order to avoid the impairment of an absent party interests.moreover,shearson makes clear that an absent party interests can not be harmed or impaired if they are identical to those of a present party.id.w e fail to see how proceeding without the absent party would as a practical matter impair or impede the absent party interests,interests that the present party counsel can adequately protect.quoting.a b i.we do not suggest that the test requires virtually identical interests,only that such is the situation here.there is no divergence in interests between bc and bil at this stage of the arbitration.
as an example,the facts in this case differ sharply from those in picciotto where an attorney casher was sued by former clients for malpractice in state court,at,and those same clients also sued insurance companies,including casher malpractice insurer,for tortious interference with contractual relations in federal court,id.at.casher state settlement position could have been impaired by an adverse judgment in the federal case,and such an outcome also could have deprived casher of insurance coverage in the state case against her.id.at.plainly,neither the plaintiffs nor the insurance company defendants,in defending themselves against the tortious interference claims,represented casher interests.the shared interests of bil and bc more closely resemble the situation in shearson.
vsc argues that there is no virtual identity of interests as bil only has,at best,a fleeting interest in the confirmation proceeding because bc is the successor to bcc and bcc negotiated the contract.
it is not true that bil has no interest in the confirmation proceeding.section d of the contract,which was one of the contested damages provisions,both affects bil rights,and provides more than a fleeting interest.the section states vsc shall have no rights or claims to compensation of any kind whatsoever from any of the bcc parties,and bcc parties is defined in the contract as bcc and any of its affiliates,their respective directors,officers,employees,agents,or other representatives.bil and bc are subsidiaries of the same entity,and are affiliates.black law dictionary ed defining affiliate as a corporation related to another corporation by shareholdings or other means of control a subsidiary,parent,or sibling corporation emphasis added.hence,bil has an interest in the validity of that provision.
in addition,bil actions throughout the confirmation proceedings evidence a vigorous representation of bil interest in confirmation of the award,which it holds in common with bc.in the district court bil provided substantial briefing in an effort to refute vsc arguments for vacatur.similarly on appeal,bil has extensively briefed the merits of the confirmation request,seeking complete confirmation of the award where an existing party has vigorously addressed the interests of absent parties,we have no need to protect a possible required party from a threat of serious injury.see ass of chain stores new eng.carpenters health benefits fund,cir.
further,bc has not taken any action to indicate that bil can not adequately represent its interests at this stage.in picciotto,our circuit held an absent party was a required party where the absent party opposed litigation of a federal case without her.at.the absent party filed an affidavit with the district court in that case.id.bc could similarly have filed an affidavit with the district court or provided some notice that its interests would be impaired,but did not do so.
nevertheless,vsc argues that bc has to be a party to the confirmation proceeding because bc predecessor selected vsc as the,drafted the letter of intent,negotiated the contract,executed the contract,and terminated the contract.that argument is unavailing.to the extent vsc is arguing bc,through its predecessor,must be a party because it somehow acted improperly,this court rejected that notion in shearson.there,the court stated,t he mere fact,however,that party a,in a suit against party b,intends to introduce evidence that will indicate that a,c,behaved improperly does not,by itself,make c a necessary party.at.
vsc falls back to rule a b ii,arguing that it is at risk of facing inconsistent obligations unless bc is joined.
rule a b ii risk of inconsistent obligations 
disposition of this petition in bc absence will not leave bil or vsc subject to a substantial risk of double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of bc absence.a b ii.
misinterpreting inconsistent obligations,vsc argues that it faces a substantial risk of incurring conflicting judgments because of the petition in commonwealth court.vsc ignores the distinction this circuit has drawn in the rule context between inconsistent obligations and inconsistent adjudications or results.in delgado plaza las americas,cir per curiam,this court explained that i nconsistent obligations are not the same as inconsistent adjudications or results,because i nconsistent obligations occur when a party is unable to comply with one court order without breaching another court order concerning the same incident.id.at.in contrast,inconsistent adjudications or results occur when a party wins on a claim in one forum and loses on another claim from the same incident in another forum.see am.ins.jude,d.the risk of inconsistent adjudications results from the fact that there are two proceedings,not from bc not being a party in the federal case.
even if the federal proceeding and the commonwealth proceeding produced different results,vsc would not be subject to different obligations because of bc absence from this case.the confirmation of an arbitration award finalizes the award and makes the award a judgment of the court.bourdeau mayer,arbitration see irving boody win holdings int l,d,the confirmation of an arbitration award converts the final arbitration award into the judgment of the court.
even so,the risk that there would be inconsistent results is low because of the deferential manner in which the faa requires arbitral awards to be reviewed r eview of the arbitration award itself is extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential.bangor gas,llc energy servs,cir quoting bull hn info,hutson,cir.
the rule inquiry may require some preliminary assessment of the merits of certain claims.republic of philippines pimentel,d see picciotto,at stating rule requires the trial court to make pragmatic judgments and to decide whether considerations of efficiency and fairness,growing out of the particular circumstances of the case,require that a particular person be joined as a party footnote omitted quoting shearson,at wright miller,federal practice procedure c ourts must look to the practical likelihood of prejudice.taking into account that consideration,the risk of inconsistency may be theoretically possible,but is not a practical concern.
vsc real argument is that at the second stage of the arbitration bc will be needed to give vsc monetary relief,if any is ordered.that may or may not be,but that argument is premature.there is and has been no second stage to the arbitration,nor any petition to review such a second stage.review of this stage of the arbitration does not require that bc be a party.there is diversity jurisdiction.
having found dismissal for want of jurisdiction to be in error,we would ordinarily reverse the district court dismissal and remand for further proceedings.however,in this unusual case,we remand and order the court to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the commonwealth court proceedings.considerations,including those of wise and sound judicial administration and comity,persuade us that a stay is warranted until the parallel case in the commonwealth courts is concluded.see cruz melecio,cir.although neither party raised the possibility of deferring the exercise of federal jurisdiction,we may do so sua sponte.rivera feliciano acevedo vilá,cir see jiménez rodríguez pagán,cir cruz,at.
parallel litigation is not uncommon in our federal system and i t has long been established that the presence of parallel litigation in state court will not in and of itself merit a stay in federal court.jiménez,at citing mcclellan carland.however,federal courts appropriately consider a complex of considerations designed to soften the tensions inherent in a system that contemplates parallel judicial processes.pennzoil texaco,d.in some circumstances,the doctrine of comity,which is designed to avoid unseemly conflict between two sovereignties,warrants a stay.cruz,at quoting glen oaks,city of houston,cir internal quotation marks omitted see quackenbush allstate ins,d kennedy,concurring stating that obligations of comity are an important part of the justification and authority to defer the exercise of federal jurisdiction.in other circumstances,considerations of wise judicial administration may warrant a stay as well.cruz,at quoting.river water conservation dist.united states,d.here there is more than simple parallel litigation.rather,the two considerations of comity and wise judicial administration together counsel a stay.the commonwealth proceeding involves the same legal issues as the federal one,includes all parties to the arbitration,has already been decided by the initial reviewing court,and is now on appeal.in addition,the commonwealth proceeding was filed first,this federal proceeding was filed about a month later,and we have some concern that bil has engaged in.
whether or not this case fits within the formal strictures of colorado river or other formal categories of staying the exercise of federal jurisdiction a stay is appropriate.see cruz,at stay appropriate even where case arguably does not fit into any of the established doctrinal boxes see also pennzoil,at explaining that doctrines of withholding the exercise of federal jurisdiction are not rigid pigeonholes into which federal courts must try to fit cases.a line of cases in our circuit involving parallel state and federal actions,which includes currie group insurance commission,cir,rivera feliciano acevedo vilá,and jiménez rodríguez pagán,support the result we reach.
in jiménez,this court recognized that when parties are absent from the federal litigation,but are part of the advanced state litigation,as bc is in this case,the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation favors staying the federal proceeding.at see also rivera feliciano,at better to avoid piecemeal litigation and allow puerto rico courts to decide controlling issues of puerto rico law.there,we stated that t his disparity in inclusiveness thus creates a greater practical risk of piecemeal litigation than the baseline inefficiencies of the average exercise of concurrent jurisdiction,because the state court action could comprehensively adjudicate the claims.jiménez,at.in this matter,the claims before both courts are the same and arise from the exact same arbitration.in the puerto rico matter,bc is a party and in the federal case it is not.as in jiménez,the state court proceeding can completely dispose of the matter.in jiménez,we favored a stay where the federal case foundered on jurisdictional questions and the commonwealth action was already well into the discovery stage.id.at.
here the doctrine of sound judicial administration that underlies decisions to defer to state courts has even more force because the state proceeding is already on appeal on a fully developed record.currie,at in re president fellows of harvard,cir holding stay improper absent a state court judgment,but suggesting that an opposite decision would result if a state court judgment had been rendered and was pending on appeal in the state system.indeed,the seventh circuit has also held that in some instances it is appropriate to stay a federal proceeding pending the outcome of the appeal in a parallel state court proceeding.see hearne bd.of,cir finding a stay appropriate where fired teacher appealed an administrative decision to terminate the teacher to a state appeals court and also filed a federal action rogers desiderio,cir.in a case involving claim splitting,the seventh circuit decided that when plaintiffs state court action was already on appeal,i t is sensible to stay federal proceedings until the state case has reached a conclusion on appeal,and that under these circumstances a federal judge need not barge ahead on the of beating the state court to a conclusion.rogers,at accord glen oaks,at reasoning that doctrine of comity required a stay and stating that s ince an appeal was pending from the state court judgment it was proper that the proceedings in the federal court be stayed until the final termination of the proceedings in the state court,and that it would have been error if the district court had not stayed its hand.
another consideration,discouragement of,also favors a stay.in cruz melecio,we stated that we could consider the discomforting specter of in the decisional calculus to enter a stay order.id.at.for obvious reasons,that is a concern here.
at oral argument bil argued that a stay should not be granted because the puerto rico courts are not adequate they are slow and bil may not receive a prompt decision in vsc appeal from the order entered in bil favor.bil also asserted that there is a risk that the puerto rico courts will incorrectly apply puerto rico law,rather than the faa,in reviewing the award,which,according to bil,offers less deferential review than the faa.
in other contexts this circuit has rejected the notion that puerto rico courts offer an inadequate forum.see coors brewing méndez torres,cir see generally pleasures of san patricio,méndez torres,cir.
as to the risk that the puerto rico courts would apply what bil argues is the incorrect substantive law,the court of first instance in fact found the faa to govern,which is bil position,so we do not see what the prejudice is.further,if puerto rico supreme court were to find the faa inapplicable,bil could seek further review in the supreme court.see coors brewing,at.additionally,concern that a party will lose its case does not demonstrate the inadequacy of a forum.id.at party could not demonst
