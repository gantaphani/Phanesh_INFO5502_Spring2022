at stake in this appeal is whether a collective bargaining agreement cba grants retirees lifetime benefits upon retirement.consistent with our precedents in this area,we hold that it does so.that conclusion,however,does not resolve the scope of those benefits.because the cba and related documents do not say anything about subsequent modifications to these benefits and because the application of the relevant cba provisions suggests that the parties contemplated reasonable modifications,we remand the case to the district court to determine what types of changes are permitted.
the parties.cnh america llc,formerly known as case corporation,makes construction and agricultural equipment in racine,wisconsin.it was once a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco,yolton el paso.pipeline,d,but as part of a corporate restructuring,tenneco sold its interest in the company in a public offering in june.id.at.
the plaintiffs represent a class of retired case employees and their spouses who retired from july,through november,and cnh employees and their spouses who retired from november,through november.each employee retired after the tenneco reorganization in july but before november.
the cba.in,case entered into a cba with the united automobile,aerospace and agricultural workers of america uaw,in which case agreed to provide insurance to its retired employees and their spouses who were receiving a j i case pension or a spouse pension.ja.from through,each cba in three or terms renewed this commitment in substantially unchanged form,ja,and each cba provided that employees did not have to pay premiums in order to receive coverage.
case and the uaw entered into the cba that prompted this lawsuit in,and it lasted until may.under the cba,case agreed that 
employees who retire under the case corporation pension plan for hourly paid employees after,or their surviving spouses eligible to receive a spouse pension under the provisions of that plan,shall be eligible for the group benefits as described in the following paragraphs.
ja see also ja noting that t he group insurance plan agreed to between the parties is hereby made a part of this agreement.the next paragraphs listed medical and prescription drug benefits available to all classes of covered retirees regardless of the duration of their service before retirement.ja.the cba does not spell out what medical benefits are included it just says that e ligibility for specific coverage will be based on each plan eligibility requirements.ja.no contributions,the cba adds,are required for the health care plans ja.
a letter of understanding concerning the c ost of h ealthcare c overage supplemented the cba.ja.o ver the term of the labor agreement,it said,employees and retirees who are enrolled in a company offered hmo,ppo or other plan will not have to pay any additional employee contributions above those which may be required for enrollment in the case network plan if any.id.the letter added that case was responsible for the retention of hmos,ppos and other health care delivery mechanisms during the cba term,and that case could terminate a provider giving inadequate coverage and adopt a replacement plan that will provide comparable benefits and access to the type of plan it replaces,provided that the new plan satisfied the uaw standards regarding access and quality.id.
the wisconsin case.on february,cnh filed a declaratory judgment action against the uaw in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.it sought a declaration that the retirees were not entitled to lifetime benefits under the cba and that it could modify or terminate the retirees benefits at its discretion at the end of the cba.ja.the district court dismissed the action in august because erisa does not give a plan fiduciary the right to seek an order clarifying its plan obligations and because the relations act,et,does not create a cause of action in the absence of a claim that a cba has been violated.
the reese case.on february,a group of former employees,who retired from the company between and,as well as spouses of such employees,filed the present case in the eastern district of michigan,seeking a declaration that they were entitled to lifetime benefits,an injunction requiring cnh to maintain the level of retiree health care benefits currently in effect and damages for injuries the retirees might sustain if the benefits were terminated.ja.in february,the district court denied cnh motion to transfer the case to the eastern district of wisconsin.
in august,the district court granted the retirees motion for summary judgment,concluding that the cba unambiguously granted lifetime benefits to the retirees.in a separate opinion filed the same day,the district court granted cnh motion to strike the retirees demand for a jury trial,concluding that there is no seventh amendment right to a jury trial for erisa or lmra claims.the district court also awarded million in attorney fees to the retirees.see g reese cnh global,wl,at.june.
the yolton case.one more layer of complication exists there is a parallel lawsuit involving the same types of claims under different cbas against two successors in interest to america and el paso tennessee pipeline.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.in december,a group of former employees of tenneco and case,all of whom had retired before july,filed a class action against cnh america and el paso.yolton,d at.in december,the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan issued a preliminary injunction,reasoning that the retirees were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the cba gave them a right to lifetime benefits.id.at.the court thus ordered the employer to continue to provide the benefits during the litigation.id.at.in,the sixth circuit upheld the preliminary injunction,yolton,at,and the case is currently pending in front of judge duggan,the same judge who is handling the present dispute.
cnh first challenges the district court refusal to transfer the case to the eastern district of wisconsin.for the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.a.as the permissive language of the transfer statute suggests,district courts have broad discretion to determine when party convenience or the interest of justice make a transfer appropriate.only when the district court clearly abuse s its discretion in balancing these considerations will we reverse.phelps mcclellan,cir.
in resolving the motion,the court considered six factors the convenience of the parties and witnesses,the accessibility of evidence,the availability of process to make reluctant witnesses testify,the costs of obtaining willing witnesses,the practical problems of trying the case most expeditiously and inexpensively and the interests of justice.ja see stewart,ricoh,d moses bus.card express,cir.and it kept in mind that,unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.dowling,cir ja.
the key question is whether the district court properly applied those factors.on one side of the ledger,several considerations favored a transfer cnh is headquartered in wisconsin,the cba negotiations took place there,cnh administers the plans there,most of the class members live in wisconsin and few class members live in michigan,all of which suggests that wisconsin is the most convenient forum for the parties and witnesses.on top of that,cnh stores its documents in wisconsin,which means that a wisconsin forum would make it easier to obtain access to the evidence.
on the other side of the ledger the case was assigned to the same michigan trial judge who had handled the yolton case and was still handling the case,giving him a leg up on the legal and factual issues presented,and suggesting that the objectives of trying the case expeditiously and inexpensively would benefit from a michigan forum.there also is much to be said from an perspective for applying the same law to both cases rather than sixth circuit law to one case and seventh circuit law to the other.
the answer to this question,as an original matter,is not.the locus of the dispute,the key parties and the location of most of the evidence favor wisconsin.but at the same time,it makes sense to resolve the health benefits of both sets of of whom worked in the same plant for the same effective the same circuit law and in front of the same district court judge.in the end,the issue turns on the standard of review.compelling considerations favor both parties positions,making it difficult to say that the district court would have abused its discretion had he picked either location as the more appropriate forum.the court,in short,had authority to keep the case.
turning to the merits,we face two questions did case in the cba agree to provide benefits to retirees and their spouses for life and,if so,does the scope of this promise permit cnh to alter these benefits in the future 
in answering these questions,we have several ground rules.first,we give fresh review to the district court summary judgment the plain language of the contract conveyed an intent to grant lifetime retiree health insurance coverage to retirees,ja we draw all factual inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment cnh.see cline bwxt,llc,cir.
second,we assess promises to pay retirement benefits differently depending on the type of obligation involved.erisa makes a promise to pay a covered pension binding at retirement,a,but it exempts employee welfare benefit plans from this requirement,see id.thus,while erisa heavily regulates promises to provide pension benefits,health benefits are purely a matter of a company to guarantee health benefits for life or to make them changeable,or even terminable,at the will of the company.see noe polyone,cir sprague motors,cir.
third,we assess promises differently depending on whether the contract stemmed from a cba or not.when the health plan was not collectively bargained,we require a clear statement before we will infer that an employer meant to promise health benefits for life.because vesting of welfare plan benefits is not required by law,an employer commitment to vest such benefits is not to be inferred lightly the intent to vest must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language.sprague,at internal quotation marks omitted.
when the health plan stems from a cba,by contrast,we apply ordinary principles of contract interpretation to determine whether benefits have vested,see yolton,at,and to the extent we put a thumb on the scales in this setting,it favors vesting.although we do not apply a legal presumption that benefits vest and although we require plaintiffs to bear the burden of proving that vesting has occurred,we apply an inference that it is unlikely that welfare benefits would be left to the contingencies of future negotiations,so long as we can find either explicit contractual language or extrinsic evidence indicating an intent to vest benefits.yolton,at quoting uaw,cir.the precise weight of the inference,we appreciate,is elusive.s tanding alone,on the one hand,this factor is insufficient to find an intent to create interminable benefits,at see yolton,at maurer joy,cir.but,on the other,it must mean something or else there would be no point in having it.in the end,it may come to nothing more than this a nudge in favor of vesting in close cases.see yolton,at.
in applying these principles here,we face one question that is relatively straightforward under our case law did the benefits vest and one that is not what does vesting mean in this context.
did the employees right to lifetime benefits vest upon retirement past is prologue in answering this question,because one of our from a nearly identical cba.the yolton cba said that e mployees who retire under the case corporation pension plan for hourly paid employees,or their surviving spouses eligible to receive a spouse pension under the provisions of that plan,shall be eligible to receive benefits,ja,and added that the company shall pay the full premium cost of the above coverages,ja.the cba in today case provided that e mployees who retire under the case corporation pension plan for hourly paid employees after,or their surviving spouses eligible to receive a spouse pension under the provisions of that plan,shall be eligible for benefits,ja,and added that n o contributions are required for the health care plans,ja.
promise for promise,the two sets of commitments are effectively identical.that is not surprising the yolton cba involved retirees who worked at the same plant as today retirees and concerned an employer that was different in former parent company,in few other meaningful ways.we start,then,by considering how yolton dealt with a similar plan.
at issue in yolton was whether this court should affirm a preliminary injunction preventing the employer from terminating or significantly modifying benefits for previously retired employees.the employees all took retirement before and were covered by the cba with tenneco.when el paso tenneco new parent company threatened to terminate or significantly modify the health benefits of the retirees,they sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the change.
in gauging the parties prospects on the merits,the court construed the language of the cba as likely creating a right to lifetime benefits upon retirement.see yolton,at.it first relied on the fact that the company benefits plans tied eligibility for pension benefits to eligibility for benefits.noting that this tying consideration had played a key role in a determination in an earlier case,the court reasoned that it demonstrate s an intent to provide lifetime benefits.at,see golden,cir affirming a preliminary injunction based in part on a district court conclusion that cba provisions which tie retiree and surviving spouse eligibility for health insurance coverage to eligibility for vested pension benefits demonstrate an intent to vest health benefits see also noe,at mccoy meridian auto,cir.
other aspects of the cba,yolton determined,also suggested an intent to create lifetime benefits.for example,some benefits were subject to express durational limitations while retiree health benefits were not,prompting the court to conclude that the inclusion of specific durational limitations in other provisions suggests that retiree benefits,not so specifically limited,were intended to survive.yolton,at quoting,at.and the yolton court also pointed to language in the summary plan descriptions saying that continued coverages will be the same as those that were in effect on the day preceding your retirement.id.at.
yolton supports the district court conclusion that the agreement granted retirees a right to lifetime health benefits.like yolton this case involves a cba it involves a benefits plan with identical language concerning entitlement to benefits upon retirement it ties eligibility for health benefits to eligibility for a pension it does not contain a specific durational clause while other benefits provisions in the cba contain such clauses,see ja and above all it concerns employees who worked in virtually identical circumstances apparently making the same products in the same plant to the yolton employees before each group retired.
yes,yolton was a preliminary injunction decision,and,yes,that means only the retirees likelihood of success on the merits was at issue,not their actual success on the merits as in the case of a decision granting summary judgment in their favor.but in view of the common language between the plans and the centrality of the tying rationale in yolton merits determination and in cases before and since,it seems appropriate to treat these two groups of employees in like ways.
in arguing that the two cases should be treated differently,cnh relies on a summary plan description spd of the health plan,which warned that a n amendment or termination of the benefit plans may affect the coverage of retirees.ja emphasis added.a spd was to the same effect.as cnh sees it,even if the cba created a right to lifetime benefits,the retirees are estopped from seeking any such relief by their acceptance of the and spds,which described the benefits as terminable at cnh will.there is some case law in support of this notion.if an employer includes unqualified language in an spd to the effect that the employer has a unilateral right to terminate coverage,and if a union fails to grieve or object to such language,then such language prevent s retiree benefits from vesting even if the spd was distributed after the effective date of the cba.prater ohio educ.ass n,cir see maurer,at.but there is an exception.no divesting occurs when the spd contains language reminding readers that the contracts represent the full commitments between the parties because a union can not fairly be expected to protest when the spd makes it clear that the cba,not the spd,controls a conflict.see prater,at.
the exception applies.the spd reminded readers that,i f there is any variance between the contents of this handbook and the official plan documents and labor agreements,those documents or agreements will govern.ja.and the spd contains a similar warning our responsibilities to you,warned the company,as well as the conditions of your coverage with us,are defined in the documents that make up your contract.ja.this qualifying language precludes cnh from maintaining that it had the unilateral right to terminate benefits.
cnh next focuses on an historical feature of this case that,as best as we and the parties can tell,has no parallel in yolton.the cba purported to cover future retirees as well as retirees who had previously left the company during the and cbas,and it made material alterations to the health benefits of these prior retirees.why should we treat the cba as creating vested rights,cnh points out,if the company had the right to alter the health benefits of employees who had retired under the similarly worded and cbas and if indeed the made material alterations to their benefits this is a good question.but it does not go to least as our cases,including yolton,have used the term.it instead goes to a related,more difficult does vesting mean in this setting a question to which we now turn.
what does vesting mean in this context much of our case law in this area draws heavily on an analogy between pension and benefits.it is a useful analogy in one sense because both settings deal with retirement benefits,both benefits often are for life and retirees legitimately depend heavily on both benefits in view of the reality that many employees,upon retirement,will not be able to supplement their retirement income in meaningful ways and will not be able to obtain other health benefits.
but it is not a perfect analogy.the value of a pension benefit,whether defined or undefined,is clear matter of concrete dollars and cents,fairly measurable as a matter of principal or income stream before retirement,at retirement or after retirement.vested benefits are another matter.employers do not send their active or retired employees a monthly account itemizing the value of their benefits.and with good reason what would it say what could it say 
the language of provisions,as the cba illustrates,generally does not contain the kind of precision that characterizes a pension plan.employees,it says,who retire under the case corporation pension plan for hourly paid employees after,or their surviving spouses eligible to receive a spouse pension under the provisions of that plan,shall be eligible for benefits.ja.it is one thing to say that this kind of language,when tied to eligibility for a pension plan,prevents an employer from terminating the we have held here.it is quite another to say that an employer may not alter the benefits in any way,particularly when the parties have a history of doing just that and when common experience suggests that plans invariably change over time,if not from year to year.see diehl twin disc,cir distinguishing a promise to provide lifetime insurance benefits from decid ing precisely what those benefits are.
which takes us to the nub of this case whatever these words mean,the parties actions and a common understanding of welfare benefits confirm that the company healthcare benefits are not akin to pension benefits that can not be diminished by one cent once they have vested.as cnh points out,no party to this union,the employer,the the benefits in this way.the cba not only set the rules for employees who retired during the next six years of that cba it also reset the rules for employees who retired after july,which is inconsistent with the notion that the and cbas using the same language as the cba,compare ja,with ja created unalterable,irreducible health benefits.the retirees were not asked to consent to this change,and they did not consent to it.and as makes clear and as later cases confirm,a union does not represent retired employees when it bargains a new contract for its employees.uaw motors,cir see,at.notably,yolton did not deal with any of these issues when it determined that the retirees had a likelihood of success on their claimed entitlement to lifetime health benefits.see at.
no doubt,the resetting of benefits for previously retired employees might not concern anyone if each change upgraded the existing package of benefits.that sort of change would not break any promises to provide irreducible benefits for life.but that is not what happened here.the cba,among other changes,created a managed health care network plan for past and future retirees.in other words,it imposed managed care on all of them,which represented a reduction in the effective choices of coverage available for all retirees and the coverage actually provided to many,if not most,of them.managed care plans were not popular when they were introduced because they often restricted the availability of discretionary or elective services.see robert rich christopher erb,the two faces of managed care regulation policymaking,stan.pol y.such plans usually control costs by covering only a limited network of providers,id.at,a type of limitation against which covered insureds often rebel,see id.at describing the broad adoption of state legislative reforms designed to curb restrictions on provider access,and against which the uaw had rebelled when negotiating earlier cbas,see,ja.
preferred provider organization ppo as the ones made applicable to retirees under the cba,see ja insureds to use providers,but they provide lowered coverage for such care.see amy monahan,the promise and peril of ownership society health care policy,tul.retirees thus saw their coverage downgraded in at least one respect unlike the prior plan,under which they could choose any doctor without suffering a financial penalty,see anne maltz,health insurance fundamentals,pli litig,they generally had to pay more for choosing an doctor.it may be possible,to be sure,that this reduction in the end benefitted some retirees in view of other improvements to the plan.see ja describing improvements sought by the union that were included in the new plans,including full coverage after modest for listed services such as mri and cat scans and h ospice care in approved facility.but no evidence shows that the change favored all retirees.
other clues support this interpretation.consistent with the parties practices,nothing in the text of the cba said that coverage would be fixed and irreducible into perpetuity for all employees who retired under it.at best,under our cases,it established a right to lifetime benefits,but not benefits that could not change from cba to cba.a letter of understanding,signed by the contracting parties,points in the same direction.addressing the cost of healthcare coverage,it said that,over the term of the labor agreement,retirees who enrolled in a company offered hmo,ppo or other plan would not be required to pay any additional employee contributions above those which may be required for enrollment in the case network plan.ja emphasis added.why ensure that no additional contributions would be required if the retirees benefits were locked in by the cba or an earlier cba and why limit the promise to the term of the labor agreement if the parties intended to create fully paid lifetime retiree health care benefits that could never be reduce d ja.
