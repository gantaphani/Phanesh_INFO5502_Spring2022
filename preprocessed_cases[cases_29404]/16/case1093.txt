opinion of the court 
this is a classic case of jumping the gun.the dispute centers on a covenant not to compete between an employer and former employee.all parties admit that the employee is violating the covenant the question is whether it is unreasonable,and thus not appropriately enforced through an injunction.because reasonableness is a inquiry,we hold that it should not have been determined on the pleadings.after resolving that we have jurisdiction over the interlocutory dismissal of claims related to the covenant because it effectively denied a request for a preliminary injunction,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
victaulic company manufactures valves,couplings,sprinkler heads,and other mechanical devices for use in a variety of industries,one of which is fire protection.joseph tieman worked as a sales representative for victaulic from april until december.he primarily worked in ohio,west virginia,and western pennsylvania,but,according to victaulic,he had relationships with victaulic customers throughout the united states.he also trained new sales representatives in various states,thus becoming familiar with the company customers outside his focus area.
as a condition of his employment,tieman signed a covenant not to compete with victaulic.in relevant part,he agreed that upon leaving victaulic he would not sell or distribute the types of items regularly sold or contemplated for sale by victaulic for months within a restricted victaulic sales region,or in any area in which victaulic products are sold on behalf of nine named competitors of which tyco is one.he further agreed not to solicit any past or present victaulic customer on behalf of any business in competition with it 
upon leaving victaulic,tieman immediately began working as a sales representative for tyco,selling the same kinds of products he sold for victaulic.tieman alleges and victaulic appears to admit that he does not sell tyco products in his former focus area,but he does sell within the restricted victaulic sales region.
tieman and tyco filed a declaratory judgment action against victaulic in december in the southern district of ohio seeking a declaration that the covenant not to compete was invalid under pennsylvania law.victaulic counterclaimed against both for breach of contract,misappropriation of trade secrets,tortious interference with contractual relations,and unfair competition.it also filed its own substantially identical suit in the eastern district of pennsylvania.the ohio district court transferred its case to pennsylvania eastern district,and the two cases were consolidated.
at the time of consolidation,two motions were pending victaulic request for a preliminary injunction,and tyco and tieman motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the breach of contract,tortious interference,and unfair competition claims.in so doing,it ruled that the covenant not to compete was invalid because it was unreasonable as a matter of law.because the dismissed claims were premised on the agreement validity,none could survive this ruling.the court reserved judgment on the trade secrets claim,asking the parties for supplemental briefing.because the court stayed its actions when victaulic appealed,the motion to dismiss that count is still pending.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
victaulic argues that we have jurisdiction under a,which provides for appellate review of interlocutory orders refusing injunctions.here,the district court did not explicitly deny an injunction,but victaulic argues that the dismissal of four counts of the complaint effectively denied victaulic requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions related to those claims.
an order that has the practical effect of refusing an injunction can be appealable under a.carson am.brands,d.but the mere fact that injunctive relief is requested and is therefore encompassed within the ruling made by the court on other grounds does not transform the ruling into one denying an injunction.shirey bensalem,cir.rather,a covers situations in which the requested injunction was the predominant relief sought.id.at.by moving for a preliminary injunction,victaulic demonstrated that one of its chief goals was to end tieman admitted violation of the covenant not to compete.thus,the dismissal had the practical effect of refusing an injunction.
even so,an interlocutory appeal only lies if the district court order has serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence s,and the order can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.carson,at.quoting baltimore contractors,bodinger.we have interpreted carson as establishing a test for determining whether an order such as this is appealable it must have serious consequences,and immediate appeal must be the only means of effective challenge.see ross zavarella,cir.
our opinions in this area have not been careful to distinguish carson serious consequences and effective challenge prongs.nevertheless,it appears that urgency is the touchstone of the former.when the appellee actions are not causing any continuing harm,we generally have held that this prong is not met when they are,we have held the opposite.compare united states rmi,cir disclaiming jurisdiction when no continuing harm,with rolo dev,gdv,cir exercising jurisdiction when appellee was allegedly liquidating assets to render itself.we have written that whether the appellant moved for a preliminary injunction is evidence of the case urgency.see united states wade,cir shirey,at see also samayoa chicago bd.of,cir.in addition,we have denied one request for appellate review on the ground that while the appellant was suffering continuing harm,it was too minimal to meet the serious consequences prong.ross,at disclaiming jurisdiction when appellant,a judge challenging her transfer to a different division,suffered no diminution in status or pay merely the inconvenience of a different docket during the pendency of the litigation.
in our case,tieman continues to work for tyco in a position substantially similar to the one he held at victaulic selling the same kinds of equipment.victaulic alleges that his employment is harming it,and we must accept that allegation as true at this stage of the litigation.adding to the urgency is that seven months have elapsed since tieman began working for tyco,utterly frustrating the purpose of the covenant to keep tieman from competing with victaulic for one year.moreover,this is an appeal from the implicit denial of the preliminary injunction,which,we have held,is the primary purpose of a.shirey,at.the efficacy of any remedy is likely declining as time passes,so we have little trouble concluding that tieman conduct is causing victaulic a serious injury 
the effective challenge prong deals with whether the appellant can get substantially similar relief without an immediate appeal.here,the relief requested was a preliminary injunction enforcing the covenant not to compete.tyco and tieman argue that victaulic asked for a preliminary injunction on the basis of all of its claims,including the trade secrets claim that has not been dismissed.thus,they argue,victaulic may yet receive similar relief if that request is granted.
we disagree.the language of victaulic motion is telling.it asked that tieman be enjoined 
for a period of twelve months following the date of termination of his employment with victaulic,from engag ing in the sale or distribution of the type of items or products regularly sold by victaulic within any restricted victaulic sales region or any geographic region in which victaulic products are sold,as an employee of tyco 
for a period of twelve months following the date of termination of his employment from victaulic,from contact ing or solicit ing any past or present customer of victaulic on behalf of tyco 
app.at.this language is all but lifted from the covenant not to compete,see id.at,which supports victaulic claim that enforcement of the covenant and not preliminary relief on the trade secrets claim was its only aim in seeking preliminary injunctive relief.in addition,in its briefing before the district court on likelihood of success,victaulic argued that its covenant was enforceable.id.at.in so doing,it set out the key elements of the the covenant was incident to an employment relationship,protected legitimate interests,and was reasonable in explained how it intended to prove each one.id.it did not set out the elements of a trade secrets claim or any other.we acknowledge that its briefing did reference trade secrets,but it did so as one of three legitimate interests that the covenant allegedly protected.id.at.thus we conclude that victaulic did not request a preliminary injunction on its trade secrets claim,so the district court dismissal of the covenant claims left it with no means of receiving preliminary relief.
even if we believed that victaulic requested a preliminary injunction on its trade secrets claim,we would find jurisdiction here.as noted,tyco and tieman argue that we should not because an injunction based on the trade secrets claim could provide the same relief as one of the covenant claims.in effect,they maintain that because similar relief is hypothetically possible,the effective challenge prong is not met.again,we disagree.we acknowledge that we have held that orders are not appealable when the district court ruling does not effectively narrow the scope of the requested injunction.plantamura cipolla,cir.plantamura was a claim against a new jersey police department and various officials for sex discrimination in hiring.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of all defendants but the police department because those defendants were not named in the plaintiff equal employment opportunity commission complaint.we dismissed the appeal because obtaining an injunction against the police department was the heart of plantamura claim.id.we reasoned that an injunction against it alone would provide the full relief sought.id.
we expressly distinguished plantamura from build of buffalo,sedita,cir,in which the second circuit court of appeals held that it had jurisdiction because the district court dismissal of a key defendant effectively narrowed the scope of injunctive relief available.in that case,the plaintiffs alleged that the buffalo police department was systematically discriminating against them and violating various constitutional rights the district court dismissed a number of defendants,including the police commissioner,leaving only a handful of individual officers as proper defendants.the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal,arguing that because they sought to enjoin the police department from engaging in a pattern of abuse,injunctions against a few individual officers would do them little good.the court agreed e ven if injunctive relief were eventually awarded against each of the named individual police defendants,it would not at all satisfy plaintiffs claim for relief from systematic misbehavior at levels of authority higher than that of a patrolman on the beat.id.therefore,the court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
we agree that something like victaulic requested relief preventing tieman from selling similar products for tyco for a year could fit a trade secrets claim,as it is possible for a court to enjoin an employee working in the relevant industry or soliciting customers for some period of time.air prods,johnson.but such a injunction is atypical rather,the usual injunction merely prevents the employee from disclosing specified trade secrets.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.d an injunction ordinarily prohibits only use or disclosure of the trade secret and information substantially derived from the trade secret.under pennsylvania law,a broader injunction only lies when it is virtually impossible for the employee to perform his duties for his new employer without in effect giving it the benefit of his confidential information.air,at quoting emery indus.cottier.
because victaulic has not alleged or argued inevitable disclosure,the real result of the district court dismissal of the covenant claims is to limit the scope of injunctive relief available under the facts pled.thus,this case is similar to build of buffalo,at,insofar as the district court has effectively denied the relief that is at the heart of victaulic claims.as in that case,appellate jurisdiction exists here.
iii.merits 
we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.to survive a motion to dismiss,a civil plaintiff must allege facts that raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.bell atlantic twombly,d internal citations omitted.
here,victaulic has alleged that it and tieman entered into a covenant not to compete,which tieman is now breaching at tyco behest by working for it in a substantially similar position.tyco and tieman do not deny this rather,they argue that the breach is permissible because the covenant is too unreasonable to be enforced.unreasonableness is an affirmative defense on which tyco and tieman bear the burden of proof.wellspan health bayliss.
generally speaking,we will not rely on an affirmative defense to trigger dismissal of a complaint under rule b.a complaint may be dismissed under rule b where an unanswered affirmative defense appears on its face,however.in re tower air,cir internal citations omitted.in trying to show that unreasonableness is clear from the face of the complaint,tyco and tieman bear a particularly heavy burden,as the determination of reasonableness is a factual one,requiring consideration of all the facts and circumstances.wellspan,at.
under pennsylvania law,mandating compliance with a covenant not to compete is disfavored it is,however,appropriate where the covenant is incident to an employment relationship between the parties the restrictions imposed by the covenant are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer and the restrictions imposed are reasonably limited in duration and geographic extent.hess gebhard,
to be reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer,a covenant must be tailored to protect legitimate interests.generally,interests that can be protected through covenants include trade secrets,confidential information,good will,and unique or extraordinary skills.id.at.similarly,not allowing competitors to profit from an employee specialized training and skills is a legitimate use of a covenant.morgan home equip.martucci.here,victaulic claims that the covenant protects its interests in the specialized skills and training it invested in tieman over a period of eight years,its trade secrets though it gives little indication of their nature,and its goodwill.
tyco and tieman respond,however,that the covenant is broader than necessary to protect these interests.in particular,they claim that its prohibitions on selling the types of products regularly sold,offered for sale,or contemplated for sale by victaulic,and on contact ing or solicit ing any past or present customer on behalf of any competitor,are overbroad.in addition,they argue that it is not reasonably limited in geographic scope.we deal with each of their objections in turn.
restriction 
sections b and c of the covenant prevent tieman from selling the types of items or products regularly sold,offered for sale,or contemplated for sale by victaulic.app.at.tyco and tieman allege that tieman was only familiar with one of victaulic product lines,namely,products designed for the fire protection industry.victaulic,according to tyco and tieman,manufactures a wide variety of other product lines for use in other industries.preventing tieman from selling similar products in those other industries is unreasonable,they argue,because he learned nothing about those products or industries from victaulic.
the district judge agreed,ruling that victaulic fail ed to explain,and i do not see,why it is reasonable to prohibit tieman from working in industries unrelated to fire protection.app.at.this statement has two problems.first,it appears to misplace the burden of proof.it is tyco and tieman responsibility to prove unreasonableness,not victaulic to prove reasonableness.wellsp
