truck drivers local union appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of allied waste systems,allied,which vacated an arbitrator award ordering reinstatement of grievant keith miller miller.on appeal,the union argues that the district court erred in vacating the arbitrator award.at oral argument,both parties agreed that this case is directly impacted by our recent en banc decision in michigan family resources,service employees international union,cir,which held that courts are without authority to overturn an arbitrator award so long as the arbitrator was arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.id.after carefully reviewing the arbitrator decision and the parties arguments,we find that the arbitrator was faithfully attempting to construe and apply the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,that the arbitrator was acting within the scope of his authority,and that the district court lacked legal authority upon which to vacate the arbitrator award.we accordingly reverse the district court decision and remand with instructions to reinstate the arbitrator award and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion in regard to the union demand for additional back pay.
allied is engaged in the business of collecting and disposing of nonhazardous solid waste,and the union represents allied employees at its adrian,michigan,location.allied acquired its adrian,michigan,facilities from laidlaw waste services in,and for a few years after this acquisition,allied and the union operated under the predecessor collective bargaining agreement negotiated between laidlaw and the union.in may,the union and allied entered into a new agreement,which borrowed in large part from the language of the predecessor agreement.
several provisions of the may agreement are relevant to our review of the arbitrator award.article of that agreement reserves management rights to allied,stating 
except as expressly and specifically limited or restricted by a provision of this agreement,the company has and shall retain the full right of management and direction of the company and its operations.such rights and responsibilities of management include,but are not limited to,the right to discharge and otherwise discipline employees for just cause.
article governs the employer right to discharge or suspend employees.section states that t he right to discharge and the maintenance of discipline shall be the exclusive right and responsibility of the company except that the company shall not discharge or otherwise discipline an employee without just cause.section prescribes the allowable discipline for a violation of the company mandatory safety and work rules distinguishing between a violation of section of those rules,which permits allied to discharge the employee immediately,and a violation of section of those rules,which requires allied to give the employee at least one warning notice prior to discharge.
article governs the arbitration and grievance procedures.section outlines the process and procedures by which arbitration is to be conducted,and sections d,f,and g define the scope of the arbitrator power.section d states 
t he arbitrator shall have no power or authority to amend,alter,or modify this agreement,but shall be limited to deciding whether or not a violation of its expressed terms has been committed.
the arbitrator shall have no power to substitute his discretion for that of the company in cases where the company has retained discretion or the right to act under this agreement.
section f provides 
the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties when rendered upon a matter within the authority of the arbitrator and within the scope of the matters subject to arbitration provided in this agreement,and shall be void insofar as the decision exceeds the authority of the arbitrator or passes upon matters not expressly made subject to arbitration under the terms of this agreement.
and most relevant to this dispute,section g,states it is understood and agreed that the degree of discipline up to and including discharge imposed for just cause shall be in the sole discretion of management and shall not be subject to modification by an arbitrator.the agreement also contains a zipper clause,which states that the terms of the enacted agreement shall supersede and render ineffective any past practices,addendum,letters of understanding,oral or written agreement as may now exist or as may have existed.
on april,allied employee and union member,keith miller,drove a garbage collection route normally assigned to another driver.while backing his truck down the left lane of a residential street,miller hooked a overhead wire,pulling it from a nearby house.miller immediately informed dispatch of this incident allied supervisors arrived on the scene and completed a notice form summarizing the accident.the supervisors observed that miller was backing down the wrong side of the street,that miller violated allied zero tolerance safety guidelines,and that miller violated allied employee safe driving and safe practices.
on the same day as the accident,allied suspended miller without pay pending further investigation.on the following day,allied terminated miller because,according to allied,he violated a rule in section of the company mandatory safety and work rules,which permitted immediate discharge under section of the collective bargaining agreement.two days later,miller filed a grievance,contending that he did not violate a section rule and,consequently,that allied should reinstate him with back pay.within a week,the company denied miller grievance,and the parties proceeded to arbitration.
at arbitration,the parties vehemently disputed which set of rules comprised the company mandatory safety and work rules referenced in section of the agreement.the parties conceded that during negotiation of the current agreement,neither side brought up section,which was the primary cause of this contractual ambiguity.allied argued that it had been using two sets of employee safe driving and safe practices handbook and the zero tolerance safety guidelines and that these rules were the ones referenced in section of the agreement.the union contended that the applicable rules were those that were actually entitled mandatory safety and work rules and were attached to the predecessor agreement.the arbitrator sided with the union,reasoning that allied proposed rules had a different nomenclature than in section of the agreement and they ha d a different,no section or section.after determining that the union proposed rules applied,the arbitrator concluded that miller conduct violated section of those section as alleged by that the collective bargaining agreement required allied to give miller at least one warning notice prior to discharge.
the arbitrator then analyzed miller termination assuming that allied proposed rules applied.the arbitrator reasoned that even those rules contemplate degrees of discipline and do not automatically mandate discharge.for example,the employee safe driving and safe practices handbook permits disciplinary action up to and including immediate discharge,and the zero tolerance safety guidelines state that allied generally will conduct progressive discipline but that an employee will be immediately discharged if his improper conduct causes an accident.after acknowledging these degrees of discipline,the arbitrator determined that even though miller violated some of allied proposed rules,his termination was inappropriate because this incident involved an accident only in an obviously hypertechnical sense the telephone lines had drooped far below standards,and allied incurred no loss as a result of the incident.the arbitrator,in short,determined that miller discharge was unwarranted under either the union or allied proposed rules.
allied cautioned the arbitrator that the collective bargaining agreement severely circumscribed his authority to review or modify the reasonableness of miller discipline,emphasizing section g admonition that the degree of discipline imposed for just cause shall be in the sole discretion of management and shall not be subject to modification by an arbitrator.the arbitrator,however,perceived an internal tension between section g,which,according to allied,limited the arbitrator authority to review or modify the degree of discipline imposed by management,and section,which prohibited allied from disciplining an employee without just cause.the arbitrator attempted to reconcile this tension,reasoning 
the term just cause entails a inquiry.first,did the grievant violate an employer rule or policy which warrants discipline if the answer to the first is in the affirmative,it is then necessary to consider whether the discipline imposed is reasonable under the circumstances of the matter before the arbitrator.the severity of the discipline is an integral part of the inquiry.
the arbitrator concluded that because the inquiry required him to consider the reasonableness of a grievant discipline,the agreement implicitly authorized him to evaluate the severity of miller discipline.
the arbitrator then proceeded to his resolution of the grievance,reiterating that miller had violated section of the union proffered rules as well as various provisions of allied proffered employee safe driving and safe work practices handbook.the arbitrator made two distinct findings regarding just cause.first,he held that allied lacked just cause to terminate miller because termination was not reasonable and it exceeded the penalty allowed in section of the agreement.second,he found that allied had just cause to issue a written warning to miller because section of the agreement permitted a warning notice for a violation of section of the mandatory safety and work rules.the arbitrator award stated the grievant termination is set aside and,in lieu thereof,a written warning may be issued.the grievant is to be reinstated to his former position with back pay and benefits 
approximately two weeks later,the union filed suit in district court,seeking to compel allied to comply with the arbitrator decision,and asking for additional back pay for the period following the arbitrator award.allied filed its answer and counterclaim,asking the court to vacate the arbitrator award.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court denied the union motion,granted allied motion,and vacated the arbitrator decision.the court rejected the arbitrator conclusion that the rules referenced in section were the mandatory safety and work rules proposed by the union,rather than the two sets of rules presented by allied.the court reasoned that because the union proffered rules were part of the prior collective bargaining agreement,the zipper clause,which stated that the new agreement would supersede any past practices or agreements,voided the application of those rules.the court then,apparently relying on section g of the agreement,held i n altering the discipline that was given to miller,the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority,and,in doing so,he violated the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement.the union filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to.e,which was denied by the district court,and the union filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.
although we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,gage prods.henkel,cir,our review of the underlying decision is very limited.family,at quotations and citations omitted see.valley auth.valley trades and labor council,cir o ur review of an arbitration award is one of the narrowest standards of judicial review in all of american jurisprudence.quotations omitted.this circuit recently refined the scope of judicial review over awards,holding that we will consider only the questions of procedural aberration outlined by the supreme court in united paperworkers international union misco,d,and major league baseball players association garvey,d.see.family,at.the three questions of procedural aberration ask did the arbitrator act outside his authority by resolving a dispute not committed to arbitration did the arbitrator commit fraud,have a conflict of interest,or otherwise act dishonestly in issuing the award and i n resolving any legal or factual disputes in the case,was the arbitrator arguably construing or applying the contract id.so long as the arbitrator does not offend any of these requirements,the request for judicial intervention should be resisted even though the arbitrator made serious,improvident,or silly errors in resolving the merits of the dispute.id.quotations omitted.
at the outset,we note that the district court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in michigan family resources.the parties,however,did,but their briefs do not discuss the case,although they both acknowledged at oral argument that it directly impacts the issues before this court.the parties have therefore failed to raise their arguments in terms of the three questions of procedural aberration.moreover,the union curiously framed most of its arguments as a challenge to the district court reasoning,rather than focusing on the analysis in the arbitrator decision.in a situation such as this,where we are reviewing de novo the district court decision to vacate an arbitrator award,the focus is on the arbitrator analysis,not that of the district court.we will recast the parties arguments,placing the proper focus on the arbitrator decision and the analytical approach outlined in michigan family resources.
under even the most generous reading of allied brief,it does not allege that the arbitrator engaged in fraud,labored under a conflict of interest,or otherwise acted dishonestly thus we need not consider this sort of procedural aberration.but allied arguments impact the remaining two the arbitrator exceeded his authority and whether the arbitrator was arguably construing or applying the we will consider both of these issues.
we begin with the question of whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in issuing his decision.allied argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by modifying miller discipline from a termination to a written warning because the collective bargaining agreement prohibited the arbitrator from modifying the severity of the discipline imposed.this argument certainly implies that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority under the agreement,but in michigan family resources we severely curtailed the scope of authority concept.in that case,we stated an arbitrator does not exceed his authority every time he makes an interpretive error he exceeds that authority only when the collective bargaining agreement does not commit the dispute to arbitration.family,at emphasis added.therefore,even though allied argument implies that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority,this it does not challenge whether the agreement commit ted the dispute to arbitration is better characterized as a challenge to the arbitrator interpretation.allied does not argue that this,a grievance challenging a member not properly before the arbitrator allied could not in good faith assert such an argument because it is clear that the agreement commits this sort of dispute to arbitration.section prohibits allied from discharg ing or otherwise disciplin ing an employee without just cause,and section d authorizes the arbitrator to decid e whether or not a violation of the expressed terms of the agreement has been committed.in light of this express,unambiguous contractual language,we find that the arbitrator was not operating outside the scope of his authority as prescribed in the agreement,and his decision can not be overturned on that basis.
we next consider whether the arbitrator was arguably construing and applying the agreement,or whether he ignored the terms of the agreement and dispense d his own brand of industrial justice.see united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.we must resist the temptation to overturn an arbitration decision merely because,in our opinion,the arbitrator made serious,improvident,or silly legal or factual errors.family,at.i n most cases,it will suffice to enforce the award that the arbitrator appeared to be engaged in interpretation,and if there is doubt we will presume that the arbitrator was doing just that.id.it will only be in the most egregious cases where we find that the arbitrator was not arguably construing or applying the contract his interpretation must be so untethered to the terms of the agreement that it casts doubt on whether he in fact was engaged in interpretation.id.
at arbitration,the parties disputed which work rules were referenced in section of the collective bargaining agreement.the arbitrator reasoned that the union rules must apply because section refers to a set of rules divided into two sections and only the union rules were divided in that manner.the district court objected to the arbitrator adoption of the union rules,concluding that the union rules,which were originally attached to the predecessor collective bargaining agreement,were superseded under the zipper clause in the current agreement.even if we were to agree with the district court and conclude that the arbitrator incorrectly determined that the union rules were those referenced in section we find this to be a classic instance of interpretation.it is the arbitrator construction which was bargained for and so far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.enter.wheel car,at.the arbitrator was indisputably construing the contract he acknowledged that section discussed a set of rules divided into two sections and reasonably concluded that the union rules fit that description better than the two sets of rules proffered by allied.because it is clear that the arbitrator was construing the correctly or arbitrator adoption and application of the union rules does not provide a legally sufficient basis for vacating his award.see misco,at.
the major issue in this,the primary basis upon which the district court vacated the arbitrator whether the arbitrator award violated section g of the agreement.section g states that the degree of discipline imposed for just cause shall be in the sole discretion of management and shall not be subject to modification by an arbitrator.allied implored the arbitrator to recognized that section g prohibited him from even to mention level of discipline imposed against miller.the arbitrator,however,determined that section g could not be read so broadly because such an expansive reading conflicted with other contractual provisions that expressly and unambiguously prohibited allied from discharg ing or otherwise disciplin ing an employee without just cause.the arbitrator reasoned that the inquiry required him first to evaluate whether the grievant violated a work rule and then to consider whether the discipline imposed was reasonable under the circumstances.he thus concluded that,notwithstanding allied expansive reading of section g,the collective bargaining agreement authorized him to consider the degree of discipline imposed by allied.
following arbitration,allied thought that the arbitrator had violated section g in another way,namely,by modifying the degree of discipline imposed after he expressly found just cause to discipline miller,issue a written warning.the district court agreed,finding that the arbitrator violated the express terms of the c ollective b argaining a greement by altering the discipline that was given to miller.allied contends that section g clearly prohibits the arbitrator from modifying the degree of discipline whenever he finds that any degree of discipline,written warning,suspension,termination would be supported by just cause.thus,according to allied,the arbitrator violated section g because once he found just cause to issue a written warning,he was without authority to modify the degree of discipline selected by allied,termination.
the union argues that allied broad interpretation of section g conflicts with section of the agreement.section prescribes the allowable discipline for an employee violation of the mandatory safety and work between a violation of section of those rules,which permits allied to discharge the employee immediately,and a violation of section of those rules,which requires allied to give the employee at least one warning notice prior to discharge.the union contends that allied construction of section g effectively negates section distinction in the level of allowable discipline for different violations by stripping the arbitrator of authority to enforce that distinction.for example,an arbitrator who found,as the arbitrator here did,that the grievant violated a section rule,rather than a section rule,would be prohibited from reducing the grievant discipline to a written warning,even though section of the agreement expressly states that allied is permitted to impose only a written warning against a offender of those rules.the union argues that section g can not be interpreted in a manner that effectively nullifies section.in essence,then,the union believes that g,as properly understood,restricts the arbitrator authority to modify the degree of discipline only where he finds that the particular degree of discipline actually imposed by the employer was supported by just cause.under this interpretation,the arbitrator here did not violate section g because he found no just cause to support miller termination,the particular degree of discipline actually imposed by the employer and therefore was not limited by section g purported restriction on his authority.
we find that section g is clear on its face and that it can reasonably be interpreted as urged by either allied or the union more importantly,the arbitrator,when construing the limitations on his authority in section g although he did so in response to a slightly different argument,was indisputably construing and applying the contract.he refer red to,quote d from,and analyze d the pertinent provisions of the agreement,and at no point did he say anything indicating that he was doing anything other than trying to reach a interpretation of the contract.see.family,at.based on his reasonable interpretation of the agreement,the arbitrator believed that he had authority to review the severity of miller discipline,declare miller termination to be without just cause,and reduce miller discipline to a written warning.regardless of whether we agree with the arbitrator precise interpretation,we lack authority to overturn his decision because it is clear that he was arguably construing and applying an unclear contractual provision.see misco,at.we therefore find no basis upon which to vacate the arbitrator award 
we acknowledge that,by including section g in the agreement,allied attempted to limit the arbitrator authority to fashion a remedy by careful drafting of the collective bargaining agreement.see kar nut prods.int l of teamsters,wl,at cir.august.eberhard foods,handy,cir there is nothing in the collective bargaining agreement or work rules which expressly limits or removes from the arbitrator the authority to review the remedy in this case.despite this attempt to restrict the arbitrator authority,allied did not draft section g with sufficient precision,leaving it unclear and in tension with other provisions in the agreement.therefore,while it is true that parties to a collective bargaining agreement can limit an arbitrator authority,they will succeed in doing so only to the extent that they produce a clearly crafted,internally consistent agreement.allied has failed to do so here.
the union requests that we award miller back pay from the date of the arbitrator award until the date of miller eventual reinstatement,which,at least as of the date of oral argument in this matter,had not yet to occurred.see lynchburg foundry united steelworkers of,local,cir stating that the employee is entitled to reinstatement and compensation for the period following the arbitrator award.allied argues that the first sentence in section g of the collective bargaining portion of that section we have yet to our making any such award.that sentence provides 
should it be determined that an employee,other than probationary employee was disciplined or discharged without just cause,he shall be restor
