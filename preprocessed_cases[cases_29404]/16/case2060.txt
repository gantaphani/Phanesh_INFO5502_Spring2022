plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in state court,and defendants removed it to federal court on diversity grounds.contending that the claims did not satisfy the requirement,plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court.the district court denied the remand motion.
after the court rejected plaintiffs claims on the merits,plaintiffs appealed,insisting that the district court never had jurisdiction over the case.we agree.each individual claim falls below the requirement.and dobson cellular may not overcome this defect by aggregating plaintiffs disgorgement claims because they do not have a common and undivided interest in them or by aggregating their claims because they do not have a common and undivided interest in them either.and even if dobson cellular may consider the total cost to it of complying with the injunction claim,a point we need not decide,it has not shown that this amount would satisfy the requirement.
on november,four plaintiffs from ohio and everett,lutricia bradley,john lunsford and gregory this class action against their respective cellular telephone service providers in the erie county ohio court of common pleas.none of the cellular systems,verizon wireless,vodafone airtouch,airtouch communications,or new based in,or maintains its principal place of business in,either of the two states.
the gist of plaintiffs claims is that the providers falsely represented to them that they would not charge for unanswered phone calls or those that generated a busy signal.alleging breach of contract,unjust enrichment and deceptive sales practices,plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages,injunctive relief,restitution,disgorgement and s uch other and further relief as may be appropriate.ja.
on december,invoking the statute,defendants removed the case to the northern district of ohio.plaintiffs moved to remand,arguing that the amount in controversy did not exceed.the district court denied the motion,holding that the size of the disgorgement claim met this threshold.
litigation on the merits of the claims proceeded in spurts.the district court dismissed several of the plaintiffs claims under michigan law,then stayed the case pending resolution of a similar class action in california that potentially overlapped with the class claims in this case.after the california case settled,plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice their claims against all of the defendants save dobson cellular systems.
on march,the district court granted dobson cellular motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims.as two of the named plaintiffs were customers only of the voluntarily dismissed providers john lunsford and gregory baker and as one of the named plaintiffs filed a petition for bankruptcy lutricia bradley,only one plaintiff and purported class representative thomas everett remains.on appeal,everett challenges the district court resolution of the remand motion,though not its resolution of the merits.
the district courts of the united states are courts of limited jurisdiction.they possess only that power authorized by constitution and statute.exxon mobil allapattah,d internal quotation marks omitted.while plaintiffs originally filed this case in state court,the removal statute,authorizes defendants to remove civil actions from state court to federal court when the action initiated in state court is one that could have been brought,originally,in a federal district court.lincoln prop.roche,d.
in addition to giving federal district courts original jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law,see,congress has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different states,between citizens and foreign citizens,or by foreign states against citizens,to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases,exxon mobil.at see.to ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes,a requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount,currently.exxon mobil.at.
to satisfy the requirement at least one plaintiff claim must independently meet the specification.see id.at.while a single plaintiff may aggregate the value of her claims against a defendant to meet the requirement,even when those claims share nothing in common besides the identity of the parties,see snyder harris,d,the same is not true with respect to multiple plaintiffs.f rom the beginning,the courts have refused to permit the separate and distinct claims of two or more plaintiffs to be aggregated in order to satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement.id.only when two or more plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest may federal courts rely on the aggregate amount of these claims to satisfy this requirement.see also zahn int l paper,d,superseded on other grounds by statute,judicial improvements act of,stat,as recognized in exxon mobil.at clark paul gray,superseded on other grounds by statute,judicial improvements act of,stat,as recognized in exxon mobil.at troy bank whitehead.
a defendant wishing to remove a case bears the burden of satisfying the requirement.gafford,cir.normally,the sum claimed by the plaintiff s controls,id.at,but where plaintiffs seek to recover some unspecified amount that is not greater or less than the federal requirement,the defendant satisfies its burden when it proves that the amount in controversy more likely than not exceeds,id.at.in gauging the amount in controversy,courts view the claims from the vantage point of the time of removal.claims present when a suit is removed but subsequently dismissed from the case thus enter into the calculation.see paul mercury indem.red cab.
no one argues that any individual plaintiff claims in this case exceed,which is not surprising given the improbability of individual phone users running up large bills for unanswered or calls.and in debating this jurisdictional question,no one invokes the class action fairness act,which congress enacted after plaintiffs filed this lawsuit and which amended to provide jurisdiction in class actions in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interests and cost.class action fairness act,stat,codified at d see exxon mobil.at the act amendments to are not retroactive.
in contending that the federal courts never had jurisdiction over this dispute,everett argues that the district court erred in aggregating plaintiffs disgorgement claims.as a remedy for their unjust enrichment claim,plaintiffs asked the court to require the defendants to disgorge all amounts received as a result of charging for calls that were not answered or were busy.ja.in assuming jurisdiction over the case,the district court concluded that the value of each of these claims could be aggregated because they derive d from a common and undivided interest.op.at.

the supreme court has matched congress commitment to this jurisdictional limitation by consistently interpreting it to prevent multiple plaintiffs from combining their damages claims to meet that requirement save when they share a common and undivided interest in them.in oliver alexander,pet,the wage claims of several seamen did not satisfy the amount in controversy when considered singly but did satisfy the requirement when considered collectively.the court refused to premise jurisdiction on the aggregated claims because necessarily a several and distinct contract existed with each seaman,for the voyage,at his own rate of wages and though all may sign the same shipping paper,no one is understood to contract jointly with,or to incur responsibility for any of the others.id.at.observing that every seaman has a right to sue severally for his own wages in the courts of common law,the court reasoned that i f the cause of action is several,the suit must be several also.id.at.f rom the beginning to the end of the suit,the court concluded,the lawsuit was in reality a mere joinder of distinct causes of action by distinct parties,growing out of the same contract,and accordingly their claims could not be aggregated.id.at.
oliver alexander is representative of the unbroken line of decisions of th e court holding that plaintiffs with separate and distinct claims could not aggregate their respective matters in dispute to establish federal jurisdiction.zahn,at.that line of decisions continued even after amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure led to the creation of the modern class action.in snyder harris,d,which involved a class action,the court held that multiple plaintiffs may aggregate their claims only where they unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest.id.at.see also zahn,at.sellers,cir the general rule is that while separate and distinct claims may not be aggregated,aggregation is permissible when two or more plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest.internal quotation marks omitted sturgeon great lakes steel,cir hilliker grand lodge,cir.
dobson cellular does not dispute that it must show plaintiffs have unite d to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest in order to aggregate their claims,snyder,at,but contends that it has satisfied that requirement here.presumably recognizing that the similar nature of the plaintiffs contract claims for compensatory damages would not permit aggregation,see oliver alexander,at,the company relies on plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim.to vindicate that claim,it points out,plaintiffs asked the court to require that the providers disgorge their gains and impose a constructive trust on that amount,thereby creating a common fund in which all plaintiffs share an interest.but even if plaintiffs were to share a common interest in the contents of such a constructive trust,that would not make their interest would not establish in other words that their disgorgement claims stem from a single title or right.aggregation is permitted where there is not only a common fund from which the plaintiffs seek relief,but where the plaintiffs also have a joint interest in that fund,such that if plaintiffs rights are not affected by the rights of then there can be no aggregation.in other words,the obligation to the plaintiffs must be a joint one.eagle star ins.maltes,cir emphasis added and citations omitted see also morrison allstate indem,cir noting that the presence of a common and undivided interest is rather uncommon,existing only when the defendant owes an obligation to the group of plaintiffs as a group and not to the individuals severally emphasis added gilman bhc,cir eagle am,cir t he character of the interest asserted depends on the source of plaintiffs claims.if the claims are derived from rights that they hold in group status,then the claims are common and undivided.if not,the claims are separate and distinct.emphasis added.
a common interest in a litigation recovery thus represents a necessary,but by itself insufficient,ground to qualify claims for aggregation.see sturgeon,at appellants are undertaking to marshal a common fund in which each of them and those on whose behalf they sue are interested,but this fact,standing alone,does not give the court jurisdiction because t he rights of the employees are not derived from the same or common title,but the interest of each in the dividend fund is based upon a separate and distinct contract each has with the insurer and the.the point of the common fund exception is not to permit plaintiffs to aggregate their claims whenever they share a proprietary interest in the proceeds of litigation it is to permit them to aggregate their claims when they jointly own,or have an undivided interest in,property at issue in the litigation.plaintiffs suing to enforce a single title or right must share their common and undivided interest in vindicating that right before the litigation,not as a result of it.see gilman,at.the paradigm common fund cases thus involve claims to a piece of land,a trust fund,an estate,an insurance policy,a lien,or an item of collateral,which they claim as common owners or in which they share a common interest arising under a single title or right.id.at emphasis added.where putative class members have no joint interest other than a shared appetite for a money judgment payable by a single defendant,they do not share the type of common and undivided interest that warrants an exception to the rule against aggregating claims.see also pac.ry.gentry.allowing claim aggregation in a action asserted under a statute that contemplate d but one action for the sole and exclusive benefit of all of the surviving beneficiaries troy bank,at.allowing claim aggregation to enforce a single vendor lien eagle am,cir allowing claim aggregation when minority shareholders sued a majority shareholder because the source of the shareholders claim for the wrongful depletion of corporate assets is the common and undivided interest each shareholder has in a corporation assets and a right to share in dividends.
while each plaintiff in this instance asserts a similar claim against his or her telephone the carrier impermissibly charged for unanswered or about the similarity of these claims shows that the plaintiffs hold a joint interest in enforcing a single title or right.like the seamen claims for wages in oliver,each putative class member claim for overcharges may stem from a similarly worded contract but they nonetheless remain legally distinct rights.each customer had the option,had he or she wished,to sue the provider individually for the amount the provider wrongly legal reality that precludes jurisdiction today no less than it did years ago.see gibson shufeldt.see also sturgeon,at.
nor does it make a difference that dobson cellular seeks to aggregate equitable unjust enrichment claims,as opposed to legal contract claims.the fact that the breach of contract claim is alternatively characterized as one for unjust enrichment does not change the result of the aggregation analysis.morrison,at.for amount in controversy purposes,it is the nature of the right asserted,not that of the relief requested,that determines whether the claims of multiple plaintiffs may be aggregated.id.where plaintiffs assert rights arising from their individual insurance policies or individual cell phone contracts,and where,if successful,they will recover the amount of excessive premiums or cell phone charges that each paid under his own policy or contract,t he fact that this recovery may be obtained under an equitable theory of unjust enrichment does not convert separate and distinct claims for damages into a fund in which the class members have a common and undivided interest.id.
attempting to alter this conclusion,dobson cellular maintains that there is a collective action exception to the principle.dobson cellular br.at.t he class as a whole obtains an undivided interest in the potential disgorgement claim,the company submits,because the class members brought this claim in addition to their compensatory damages claims.id.whatever exceptions there may be to the principle,it is hard to understand why there should be a collective action exception in view of the principle steadfast application to class actions.see snyder,at.at any rate,this contention suffers from at least three other flaws.
first,to the extent the company means to argue that plaintiffs sought relief under their unjust enrichment claims in addition to the relief available under their contractual claims,no such relief is available under ohio law.see,all occasion limousine hmp events,wl,at ohio,the doctrine of unjust enrichment does not apply when a contract actually exists it is an equitable remedy applicable only when the court finds there is no contract.citing rice wheeling dollar sav.trust,ohio.
