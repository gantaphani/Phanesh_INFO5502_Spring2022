these appeals arise out of a dispute between du pont de nemours and company dupont and former dupont employees who allege that dupont fraudulently induced them to terminate their employment and accept employment with a subsidiary that was later sold.in anticipation of a lawsuit from one of the employees,dupont sought a declaratory judgment under the employee retirement income security act erisa.the district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,concluding that the employee potential claims could not be read as stating a claim under erisa.dupont filed notice of appeal.
a group of the former employees then sued dupont,asserting fraud and fraudulent inducement claims.dupont filed two motions to dismiss,arguing that the employees claims were preempted by the national labor relations act nlra under the garmon doctrine or,in the alternative,by erisa.the district court denied both motions but certified an interlocutory appeal,which we accepted and consolidated with dupont appeal from the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the employees claims are not preempted by the nlra or erisa,and that dupont declaratory judgment action was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.affirmed.
in early,dupont decided to separate a portion of its operations into a subsidiary,to be known as dupont textiles and interiors,dti.among the operations to be transferred to dti was dupont terathane products unit,which was housed at the dupont manufacturing facility in la porte,texas,along with a variety of other units that were not slated to become part of dti.the employees at the la porte plant were represented by local of the international chemical workers union council,and covered by a single collective bargaining agreement the la porte cba.
in september and october,dupont and the union engaged in collective bargaining over the effects of the planned dti separation on the la porte plant.the most obvious consequence was that the number of dupont job positions at the la porte plant would be reduced when the terathane products unit was transferred to dti.since the la porte cba seniority system gave employees with higher seniority the right to move to different units within the plant,there was the possibility that higher seniority terathane products employees might exercise this right in order to remain with dupont when the terathane products unit was transferred to dti.this would require dupont to lay off lower seniority employees throughout the plant.
on october,dupont and the union reached an agreement regarding the la porte dti separation.this agreement called for the formation of an independent collective bargaining unit for dti employees at the la porte plant.dti employees would be covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement,which would start out as a mirror image of the la porte cba.dupont stated that dti would operate under dupont compensation and benefits plans and policies.dupont and the union also agreed on a plan whereby dupont employees assigned to the terathane products unit would be given the opportunity to voluntarily transfer to dti.for employees who chose to transfer,there would be a seamless transition with regard to all compensation and benefits programs,meaning that credit for things like service time and accrued vacation time would carry over to dti.the voluntary transfer period was to begin on november,and run through december.during this time,terathane products employees could sign a form stating their desire to transfer from the dupont la porte bargaining unit to dti and become members of the independent dti bargaining unit.once the transfer period ended,dupont and the union anticipated conducting another round of bargaining to determine how to deal with the situation created by terathane products employees who chose to stay at dupont.
ultimately,a high percentage of terathane products employees elected to transfer to dti,and there was no need for a second round of bargaining.on january,dti and the union signed the collective bargaining agreement the dti cba for the separate dti bargaining unit.in accordance with the earlier agreement of october,between dupont and the union,the dti cba was a mirror image of the la porte cba,except for minor cosmetic changes reflecting that dti,not dupont,was the employer.as dupont had promised,the compensation and benefits plans and policies for the new dti employees were the same as they had been at dupont.
shortly thereafter,however,dupont sold dti to a subsidiary of koch industries,koch.once the dti employees were transferred to koch,the terms of their employment became less favorable they experienced losses with regard to wages,overtime,and retirement age,did not receive certain bonuses and stock options,and their benefits were reduced.one of the terathane products employees who had elected to transfer to dti and wound up working for koch was gary sawyer.seeking to investigate the possibility of a lawsuit against dupont based on its role in encouraging him to transfer to dti,sawyer filed a petition in texas state court to conduct a deposition in anticipation of suit 
dupont responded to the petition for a deposition by filing a declaratory judgment action in federal court against sawyer.in the southern district of texas,dupont sought a judgment that dupont did not violate any fiduciary duties owed to sawyer as the administrator of an erisa plan sawyer therefore has no right to individual relief under erisa any of sawyer potential claims are preempted by erisa to the extent that they relate to an employee benefits plan and to the extent that sawyer may allege claims,dupont violated no contractual,legal,or common law duty to sawyer.the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.it reasoned that sawyer potential claims against dupont did not involve the interpretation of an erisa policy,but rather focused on alleged misrepresentations by dupont that induced sawyer to leave dupont for dti,and therefore could not be read as stating a claim under erisa.
sawyer and a group of terathane products employees then sued dupont in the southern district of texas,asserting fraud and fraudulent inducement.the employees most recent complaint alleges that during the period of time in which they were employed by dupont and contemplating the offer to transfer to dti,after the october,agreement between dupont and the union creating the voluntary transfer plan but before the transfer period closed on december,dupont repeatedly assured them that dti would not be sold to another entity,even though dupont knew at the time that the sale of dti was a possibility.according to the employees,they were assured that dti would remain a part of the dupont family.one dupont manager responded to the employees questions about the possible sale of dti by explaining that we the whale,and fish do eat whales.the employees complaint further alleges that had the more senior employees chosen not to transfer to dti,dupont would have had to retrain them for new positions,the terathane products unit operations would have been severely interrupted presumably making dti less attractive to koch,and dupont would have had to hire and train new employees for the terathane products positions.
dupont filed two motions to dismiss.first,in a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,dupont argued that the employees claims were based on communications that occurred in the context of collective bargaining,and are therefore preempted under the garmon doctrine and lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national labor relations board nlrb.next,in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,dupont argued that the employees claims allege conduct in violation of certain provisions of erisa and,consequently,are preempted by that statute.the district court denied both motions to dismiss but certified the case for interlocutory appeal.we accepted the case and consolidated it with dupont appeal from the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action.
we have jurisdiction under b to review the interlocutory order of the district court denying dupont motions to dismiss the employees complaint.the dismissal of dupont declaratory judgment action is a final judgment that we have jurisdiction to review pursuant to.

dupont first argues that the employees fraud and fraudulent inducement claims are preempted under san diego building trades council garmon,d.in garmon,the supreme court held that w hen an activity is arguably subject to or of the national labor relations act,the states as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the national labor relations board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.id.at.s tate regulations and causes of action are presumptively preempted if they concern conduct that is actually or arguably either prohibited or protected by the act.belknap,hale,d citation omitted.
thus,to determine whether the employees claims are preempted under the garmon doctrine,we must ask whether the conduct at issue was arguably protected or prohibited by the nlra.int l longshoremen ass davis,d.the critical inquiry here is whether the controversy presented under state law to the courts is identical to or different from that which could have been,but was not,presented to the national labor relations board.sheet metal workers local union etie sheet metal,cir citing sears,roebuck san diego county district council of carpenters,d.that inquiry requires not only looking to the factual bases of each controversy,but also examining the interests protected by each claim and the relief requested.id.at citations omitted.the party claiming preemption,in this case dupont,bears the burden of showing that the challenged conduct is arguably prohibited or protected by the nlra.see davis,at.
dupont contends that the employees claims could have been presented to the nlrb because the conduct at alleged misrepresentations by dupont concerning its intentions to sell arguably prohibited by section of the nlra.section makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees over certain mandatory subjects of bargaining,namely,wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment.a,d see nlrb katz,d.an employer decision to sell its business is not a mandatory subject of bargaining.nlrb new england newspapers,cir citing first maint.nlrb,d.however,the effects of that sale are considered conditions of employment within the meaning of section d of the act,and thus are a mandatory subject id.citing first,at.internal brackets and emphasis omitted.an employer therefore must engage in effects bargaining concerning the consequences of a sale.see id.at citing first,at.effects bargaining is bargaining related to the consequences of an employer closing or selling its place.relying on riedel international willamette tug barge,dupont argues that the employees complaint implicates this duty to engage in effects bargaining.
in willamette,the union complained that the employer violated its effects bargaining obligations by only notifying the union of its decision to sell a division of its business on the day that the assets of the business were to be transferred to the buyer.id.at.the nlrb found that the employer had violated section effects bargaining requirement by failing to notify the union of the decision to sell the division until the day of the implementation of the decision,when it was virtually a fait accompli.id.at.according to the nlrb,the union was entitled to as much notice as was needed for meaningful bargaining at a meaningful time.id.at.the notice given by the employer was clearly insufficient.id.
willamette illustrates that there is an adequate notice component to the employer section duty to engage in effects bargaining.see also first,at.b argaining over the effects of a decision must be conducted in a meaningful manner and at a meaningful time.accordingly,we have no doubt that whether dupont provided the union with sufficient notice of its decision to sell dti so as to allow for meaningful effects bargaining is a question for the nlrb.but for preemption purposes,the critical inquiry is whether the controversy presented by the employees claims is identical to this or any other matter that could have been presented to the nlrb.sheet metal workers,at citing sears,at.we conclude that it is not.
a section claim arising out of dupont duty to give adequate notice of the dti sale for effects bargaining purposes would be concerned with two key questions when dupont first notified the union of its decision to sell dti and whether that notice allowed for meaningful effects bargaining at a meaningful time.the focus would be on dupont communications to and bargaining with the union.strong federal labor interests relating to the relationship and the integrity of the collective bargaining process would be at stake in such a claim.
in contrast,the gravamen of the employees complaint here is that dupont fraudulently induced them to terminate their employment with dupont and accept employment with dti.the key questions are whether dupont made affirmative misrepresentations to the employees concerning its intentions to sell dti and whether the employees relied on those misrepresentations to their detriment in transferring to dti.unlike a section claim,which would focus on the relationship between dupont and the union,the claims focus on the relationship between dupont and individual employees.in particular,they focus on the direct communications made by dupont to employees during the period of time when they were considering whether to transfer to dti.since this was an individual decision that each employee had to make on his own,independently of union decisionmaking or the collective bargaining process,the strong federal labor interests implicated by a section claim are not present.rather,it is the state substantial interest in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations that have caused them grievous harm that is at stake.belknap,at.
furthermore,the employees complain of dupont conduct during the period of time when the employees were considering whether to transfer to dti.the sale of dti to koch did not occur until several weeks,if not months,later even if we were to ignore the fact that the employees complain of affirmative misrepresentations made to them directly by dupont,and not merely of a failure on the part of dupont to notify the union of the decision to sell dti,dupont has not shown that failing to notify the union during this time period constitutes conduct that is arguably prohibited by the nlra.compare willamette,at violation where notification was given on the day of the sale,with chippewa motor freight,union,no violation where notification was given two days in advance of the closing of a freight terminal.
dupont attempt to bring the employees claims within the scope of the nlra by arguing that the alleged misrepresentations occurred in the overall course and context of collective bargaining is unavailing.we recognize that dupont and the union engaged in collective bargaining over the dti separation plan,and that this bargaining led to the creation of the process by which the employees had the opportunity to voluntarily transfer to dti.however,the employees make no allegations of misrepresentations on the part of dupont that might have tainted or interfered with this bargaining rather,they complain of communications from dupont that occurred after the negotiations creating the voluntary transfer process were completed.at that point,each employee had a decision to make stay with dupont or transfer to dti.it was toward this individual choice,and not any aspect of union decisionmaking or the collective bargaining process,that the alleged misrepresentations by dupont were directed 
the cases cited by the parties demonstrate the importance of this distinction and lend further support to our conclusion that the employees claims are not preempted.dupont relies upon several cases in which fraud claims were held to be preempted.however,these cases all involve misrepresentations that directly impacted the collective bargaining process.in kolentus avco,cir,for example,where the seventh circuit held that the conduct charged constituted an unfair labor practice under section a,the employees complaint was that the employer committed fraud at the time of negotiating and entering into the collective bargaining agreements.here,though,the alleged misrepresentations occurred after the completion of the collective bargaining that established the voluntary transfer process.
parker connors steel,cir,is of no help to dupont,either.in parker,the employees alleged that their employer fraudulently obtained concession agreements by representing that it would keep a plant open if the concessions were granted.id.at.dupont suggests that even though the agreements in parker had already been negotiated by the union,subsequent misrepresentations that were made to the employees were still treated as having occurred during the collective bargaining process.this may be the case,but it does not follow that the misrepresentations made by dupont also must be considered to have occurred during collective bargaining.the crucial distinction is that the employees in parker were voting as union members to ratify concession agreements that would affect all union employees.see id.at.they were not making individual decisions binding upon themselves only,as the dupont employees were.thus,though the misrepresentations in parker may have been made directly to the employees,they nonetheless impacted the collective bargaining process because they were aimed at distorting the outcome of the ratification vote the same is true of serrano jones laughlin steel,cir.
more relevant to the case before us is the third circuit decision in voilas general motors,cir.there,the employees alleged that gm falsely represented that a plant would close in order to induce them to take an early retirement package.id.at.like the voluntary transfer plan offered to the dupont employees,the early retirement package in voilas was the product of collective bargaining between the employer and the union.id.however,the misrepresentations were alleged to have occurred during the period when the early retirement option was available to is,after collective bargaining had been completed,when the employees were individually considering whether to take early retirement id.at.the third circuit held that the employees fraud claim was not preempted,reasoning that the alleged fraud was not committed in connection with any part of the collective bargaining process nor does it touch and concern a mandatory duty on the part of the employer.id.at.the court concluded where the claim is that the employer committed fraud in a direct communication to the employees on the subject of a plant closure,there is no nlra preemption.id.the same can be said with respect to dupont direct communications to its employees on the subject of the possible sale of dti.
our decision in wells general motors,cir,is also instructive.in wells,the employees alleged that gm made false inducements and representations to persuade them to accept an early retirement package.id.at.we rejected gm argument that the employees claims could be construed as alleging conduct prohibited by section good faith bargaining requirement,explaining that the alleged fraudulent inducement did not implicate national labor policy 
t he challenged conduct was not an attempt on the part of gm to interfere with the collective bargaining process or to diminish the union representative role instead,it was a effort to induce individual employees to accept the early retirement package.while not dispositive,it is relevant that the parties had completed collective bargaining over the early retirement package gm alleged inducements had no direct bearing upon the collective bargaining process in that they were not offered in order to obtain ratification of an agreement.
id.at footnotes omitted.again,the same can be said here,as the conduct the employees complain of consists of efforts on the part of dupont to induce them to voluntarily transfer to dti,and had no direct bearing on the collective bargaining process.
finally,we recognize that in establishing standards for when an employer must inform the union of the sale of its business for effects bargaining purposes,the nlrb has attempted to balance practical concerns relating to the employer need for secrecy in its sale negotiations with the union right to engage in meaningful effects bargaining.but we can not accept dupont contention that allowing the employees claims to proceed will create conflicting standards on this issue and upset the balance struck by the nlrb.the employees do not complain that dupont failed to disclose its plans for dti to the union at the appropriate time.rather,they complain of affirmative misrepresentations made to them individually when they were deciding whether to transfer to dti.the fact that the nlra allowed dupont to remain silent about its plans to sell dti until such time as necessary to allow for meaningful bargaining can not be taken as providing a license for dupont to make affirmative misrepresentations to its employees who were,in effect,also prospective employees of dti up until that time had arrived.these are simply two different issues 
in sum,the controversy presented by the employees claims is hardly identical to one which could have been brought before the nlrb.dupont has not shown that the conduct that the employees complain of is arguably prohibited or protected by the nlra.the employees claims are not preempted under garmon.
dupont next argues that the allegations made in support of the employees claims are sufficient to state a claim under erisa and are therefore preempted by that statute.there are two types of erisa preemption.first,erisa express preemption clause states that with certain exceptions,erisa shall supercede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan a.
second,erisa civil enforcement provision,a,set s forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that would be completely undermined if participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa.aetna health davila,d quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.accordingly,any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants the erisa civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive and is therefore.id.at.citing pilot life,at.mcclendon,d.dupont argues for preemption under this theory when it contends that the employees claims could have been brought under erisa.
specifically,dupont points out that it had two roles with respect to the employees it was both their employer and the administrator of their employee benefits plan,which was protected by erisa.the employees,in turn,were not only employees but also the beneficiaries of an erisa plan.and since the supreme court has held,in varity howe,d,that erisa civil enforcement provision authorizes beneficiaries of an erisa plan to bring a lawsuit seeking individual relief against the plan administrator for breach of fiduciary duty,dupont argues that the employees should have brought such a suit.
in varity,a group of beneficiaries of a firm erisa plan sued the plan administrator,who was also their employer,claiming that the administrator,through trickery,led them to withdraw from the plan and to forfeit their benefits.at.the plaintiffs in varity were employees of,a subsidiary of varity corporation,and participants in erisa benefits plan.id.at.varity devised a plan to transfer some of divisions to a new subsidiary,with the expectation that the subsidiary would fail
