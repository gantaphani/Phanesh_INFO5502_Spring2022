there are no role models in the tale that we chronicle here.the story line pits a sophisticated developer against a sophisticated tenant.the parties had done business for many years and at least in the developer view had established a template for future transactions.their current dispute arose when the tenant forwarded to the developer a commercial lease containing a material term that deviated from the parties previous leases,without specifically drawing the developer attention to the change.the developer says that it did not read the proffered lease line by line,but nevertheless signed it.when the developer,years later,discovered the new term,it protested.outrage soon morphed into litigation.the district court,without passing upon the merits of the dispute,entered summary judgment against the developer on the ground that the action was.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the summary judgment loser,consistent with record support.
stephen dubord is both a developer and an attorney.his principal development entity is rared company.rared manchester nh,llc is an entity created by dubord for the single purpose of leasing the store involved in this litigation.for ease in exposition,we refer to rared company and rared manchester nh,llc collectively as rared or the lessor.
rite aid corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary,rite aid of new hampshire,collectively,rite aid or the lessee operate a large number of drug stores,several of which are leased from rared.by early,rite aid had executed leases for five stores built by rared 
throughout this course of dealing,dubord who is also the sole member of each entity represented the lessor and attorney alan garubba represented the lessee.dubord testified at his deposition that he thought it was the general understanding that these early leases would serve as a template for the parties future lease transactions.according to rared statement of material facts,see me.c,only terms were to be changed and the parties,in their subsequent course of dealings,always discussed substantive changes.
on april,the parties entered into their sixth lease,which was for a store in manchester,new hampshire.under article of the lease,the base rent for the premises was set at per year,payable in twelve equal monthly installments.the lease further contained a percentage rent clause calling for rite aid to report the store annual adjusted gross revenue,which was to be calculated by subtracting certain contractually defined categories of sales,the proceeds of sales of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages from gross revenue.if of adjusted gross revenue exceeded the base rent amount in any lease year,rite aid was obligated to pay the difference to rared as additional rent.the net effect was that rite aid would owe as yearly rent either the base figure or of adjusted gross revenue,whichever was greater.
in these respects,the lease was nearly identical to the five previous leases executed by and between the parties.the manchester lease differed,however,in that article g exempted from the calculation of adjusted gross revenue sales of prescription drugs reimbursed by third party payors.this exclusion was significant because prescription drug sales account for over half of gross sales at a typical rite aid store and,given this mix of business,the exclusion made it unlikely that the percentage rent clause would ever be triggered at the manchester premises.
negotiations for the manchester lease began in february of,when garubba mailed dubord an initial draft of a proposed lease containing the prescription exclusion on march,dubord responded in a letter that requested certain substantive changes but did not mention the percentage rent clause.at the end of this letter,he stated that he ha d not read the lease line by line yet,but based on the assumption that it wa s identical to rared other leases in all material respects,he was ready to sign a revised draft.rite aid accommodated the changes requested in the letter but did not reply in any way to the sentence mentioning dubord assumption.instead,garubba sent execution copies of a proposed final draft to dubord,who signed and returned them.the lease that dubord signed contained the undiscussed prescription exclusion.
in,an unrelated incident at the manchester store attracted dubord attention.he learned from a manager that the store,and in particular its pharmacy,had been exceedingly busy.dubord investigated further and noticed the prescription exclusion in the lease.he then worked the numbers and realized that,but for the prescription exclusion,rite aid would have owed amounts in excess of the base rent starting in.
dubord protested to rite aid and the parties attempted to reach an amicable resolution of the lessor claim that the prescription exclusion had no place in the lease.to that end,the parties executed a series of tolling agreements beginning on august.when they failed to reach common ground,rared invoked diversity jurisdiction,see a,and sued rite aid in maine federal district court on may.
pertinently,the complaint contained counts for breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation essentially,a claim that the lessor had been fraudulently induced into entering the lease by the lessee failure to respond to dubord mistaken assumption following discovery,rite aid moved for summary judgment on the ground that maine statute of limitations for tort actions,see.ann.tit,foreclosed the suit.rared opposed the motion.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,see b b.b,who recommended that the court grant the motion.see rared manchester nh,llc rite aid of,cv,wl,at.on de novo review,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation wholesale and entered judgment accordingly.see rared manchester nh,llc rite aid of,cv,wl.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo,taking the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving party.certain interested underwriters at lloyd,london stolberg,cir.we will affirm only if the record reveals that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.avery hughes,cir quoting.a.this standard of review permits us to embrace or reject the rationale employed by the lower court and still uphold its order for summary judgment.in other words,we may affirm such an order on any ground revealed by the record.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.
the parties agree that maine law provides the substantive rules of decision.see erie tompkins.the lease was executed in maine,and we are free to accept this plausible agreement.see,katz pershing,llc,cir borden paul revere life ins,cir.
rared has cast its remaining claims as tort claims.maine has a statute of limitations for tort actions.ann.tit.the manchester lease was executed on april.if the lessor cause of action accrued on that date,then the time for filing suit expired in april of.inasmuch as the parties did not execute the first tolling agreement until,rared suit would be late by more than eight years.
the lessor contests the accrual date.its principal argument is that its cause of action did not accrue until the first lease year for which rite aid,under the original formula,would have owed percentage rent.but the notion upon which this argument rests that the lessor suffered no injury until the first year for which percentage rent would have been due confuses the injury for which the lessor sues with the damages that the lessor seeks.
to be sure,t here is generally no cause of action in tort until a plaintiff has suffered an identifiable,compensable injury.bernier raymark,me.injury,however,is not always synonymous with money damages.under maine law,a party is injured when its legal rights have been violated,even if nominal damages or equitable remedies are the only forms of recourse available to it at that time.see bozzuto ouellette,me.it follows that a cause of action sounding in tort accrues when the plaintiff sustains harm to a protected interest.chiapetta
