thomas tessier and his brother michael tessier allegedly bilked brothers frederick and thaddeus jakobiec and the estate of their mother,beatrice jakobiec,out of millions of dollars this lawsuit is about only one facet of the tessiers overall scheme,their theft of almost in life insurance proceeds due to a trust benefitting thaddeus.thaddeus,along with various persons affiliated with the trust and beatrice estate,brought this lawsuit not against those who actually stole the money,but against the company that issued the life insurance policy,merrill lynch life insurance merrill lynch.the plaintiffs claim that merrill lynch made out the insurance proceeds check to the wrong trust entity,breaching the insurance contract and thereby allowing the tessiers to steal the money.
the district court jettisoned the lawsuit on summary judgment.it concluded that even if merrill lynch did breach the contract,merrill lynch did not cause the plaintiffs losses because the tessiers would have stolen the money even if the check had been made out correctly.we agree with the district court.
background 
the life insurance policy 
we start our story by adding another family member to the mix,beatrice sister lillian smillie.in,smillie executed a will.in it,she bequeathed her entire estate,except for furniture and funeral and administrative costs,to a trust which later received taxpayer identification number benefitting her nephew thaddeus the smillie trust thaddeus,who has been blind since birth,depended on his family for support.the will named thaddeus brother,frederick,as trustee of the smillie trust.smillie passed away in.
in,beatrice applied for the subject life insurance policy with merrill lynch.obviously aware of her sister trust,beatrice indicated on the policy application that the policy beneficiaries would be frederick and the smillie trust,with fifty percent going to each.the exact language was frederick jakobiec,son,and frederick jakobiec,trustee for thaddeus jakobiec irs id.the policy then issued at some point,though we do not have a copy of it in the record.beatrice passed away some years later on may.
misplaced trust 
at beatrice wake,her son frederick asked thomas to administer beatrice estate.thomas probably seemed like a natural choice for the task because not only was he a second cousin to the jakobiec brothers but he was a licensed attorney that had represented beatrice in various matters since,including acting as the attorney for the smillie trust.but thomas proved to be a wolf in sheep clothing,and frederick decision to enlist his cousin turned out to be a gigantic blunder.you see,thomas was going through a bit of a rough patch.his law practice was struggling,and he had developed a drinking problem that was getting progressively worse.for thomas,who admitted that he was nearing the tail end of his career but had failed to build a nest egg for his retirement,the jakobiecs became the geese that laid the golden egg.
and so,with the help of his brother michael,a retired police captain,thomas engaged in a campaign of forgery and subterfuge to raid the bank accounts of frederick and thaddeus and the estate of beatrice,allegedly stealing over million of course,most pertinent for our purposes,is the tessiers theft of the life insurance proceeds that had been slated to benefit thaddeus and so we focus in on this.
wheels of theft set in motion 
the groundwork for this particular theft was laid when thomas was rummaging through beatrice papers after her death.to add some context,frederick,according to thomas,was supposed to contact him after the wake to further discuss thomas administering the estate however,frederick never did.in fact,thomas says that despite diligent efforts on his part to contact frederick,he never spoke to him again after the wake.nonetheless,thomas decided to go forward with administering the estate and he headed over to beatrice to start going through her papers,including correspondence,bank statements,and the like.and thomas ultimately used these financial records to institute probate proceedings for beatrice estate in new hampshire probate court.
most pertinent for our purposes is the fact that thomas came across some type of documentation that alerted him to the existence of the merrill lynch life insurance policy,though it is unclear exactly what he found once he learned of the policy existence,thomas and michael launched a attack.
first,they wrestled away control of the smillie trust from frederick and this is how they did it.on june,they filed an petition meaning that frederick did not participate with the probate court to remove frederick as trustee and install michael as successor trustee of the smillie trust,alleging that frederick had been neglecting his brother thaddeus and failing to pay his bills.the probate court granted the petition and installed michael as trustee of the smillie trust.second,a few weeks later,thomas fraudulently created a second trust for thaddeus,called the thaddeus jakobiec irrevocable inter vivos trust,later assigned taxpayer identification number the fraudulent trust.michael was named as both trustee and death beneficiary of this second trust.thaddeus,whose signature on the document was forged by michael was unaware of the fraudulent trust existence.to summarize,by the end of june,there were two trusts for the benefit of thaddeus the smillie trust,which had been lawfully created in lillian smillie will and which was the rightful beneficiary of the merrill lynch policy,and the fraudulent trust,which had been unlawfully created by the tessiers.
the tessiers complete their plan 
on or around july,over a year after beatrice had died,thomas notified merrill lynch of beatrice death.thomas claimed to be representing thaddeus,whom he assumed was a beneficiary of the life insurance policy.this call led to a series of letters between thomas and john greenwood,a claims consultant at merrill lynch on july,greenwood sent thomas a letter asking him to fill out certain forms,including a claimant statement.
thomas responded on july.he explained that he was enclosing the claimant statement and trust documentation for a testimentary sic trust under the estate of lillian smillie for the benefit of thaddeus jakobiec,and apparently,according to the letter,he enclosed documentation indicating that michael was trustee for the smillie trust,including his probate court certificate of appointment.however,for some unknown reason the tax documentation that thomas enclosed pertained to,and the claimant statement also referred to,not the smillie trust but rather the fraudulent trust 
this documentation referring to the fraudulent trust which of course was created in,many years after the life insurance was purchased confused greenwood.he sent thomas a letter on august seeking to clear things up.he noted that the life insurance policy named frederick as a trustee for thaddeus and that the trust referenced in the policy was established sometime before and had a different taxpayer identification number than the one thomas included documentation for.greenwood asked could there possibly be more than one trust similarly styled.
thomas responded on september.yes,he explained,there were two trusts.the smillie trust was created in with number.the trust with number the fraudulent trust,which thomas had included documentation for in his july letter,was a totally separate trust created in.thomas went on to ask that the insurance proceeds go to the smillie trust.he requested that the amount be made payable to michael tessier,successor trustee of the lillian smillie trust for the benefit of thaddeus jakobiec and that the identification number as indicated should be.
this letter answered some of greenwood questions but it raised a new one,which greenwood brought up in a september letter to thomas who is lillian smillie and how does she relate to our insured,or our insured trust.in an october response,thomas sought to unravel the mystery.he explained who smillie was,described the creation of the smillie trust,and expounded on how michael came to replace frederick as trustee.thomas indicated that he made a mistake when he listed the fraudu
