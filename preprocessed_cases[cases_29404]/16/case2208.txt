the plaintiff,employed by the defendants as a high school principal until he was reassigned to a teaching position,claims that his principalship was taken away from him in violation of free speech and due process rights protected by the united states constitution.finding no violation of these rights,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.for the reasons that follow,we shall affirm the judgment.
the plaintiff,jerry sharp,was principal of gibbs high school in knox county,tennessee,for years.he had previously worked for years as a teacher in the knox county school system,and he retained his status as a tenured teacher after his promotion.
the chain of events that led to this lawsuit began in may of,when the knox county board of education undertook consideration of a student dress code.the board ultimately decided that for the time being,at least,it would leave responsibility for the content of dress codes with the individual schools.
gibbs high school created a committee to consider revising the school existing dress code for the academic year.the committee,which worked under the direction of assistant principal alvin taylor,consisted of four teachers,four parents,and three students.at the conclusion of its deliberations the committee recommended adoption of a code that would have been much stricter than the old one.principal sharp submitted a slightly amended version of the proposed code to acting superintendent roy mullins,and mullins apparently signed off on it.
defendant charles lindsey took over as superintendent of the knox county schools on july.the revised gibbs high school dress code soon attracted his attention,the code having become the subject of several newspaper articles and numerous complaints from parents.
concerned about the legality of the revised code,lindsey asked the knox county law department to review it.the law department concluded that even with changes suggested by lindsey,the code probably would not withstand a legal challenge.lindsey therefore decided to table the revised code,allowing the dress code from gibbs student handbook to remain in effect for the school year.
on july,lindsey sent a memorandum to all of the principals and assistant principals in the school system explaining his decision.the next day he sent a letter to the members of the gibbs dress code committee apprising them of the decision and thanking them for their efforts.on july,he had a telephone conference call with principal sharp and other administrators at gibbs high school,at which time the dress code was a topic of further discussion.
effective the same day,july,lindsey and sharp entered into a principal employment contract pursuant to ann.the was subject to unilateral termination by the superintendent for inadequate performance,among other that the term of sharp employment as principal would begin on july,and end on june,or upon the earlier termination of the superintendent own employment contract with the board of education.
on august,without prior notice to the superintendent,principal sharp sent the members of the gibbs dress code committee a letter the body of which read as follows 
i want to express my appreciation for your efforts in revising the gibbs high dress code.i hope that you do not feel that your efforts were in vain.after i met with your group,i made a couple of minor changes in wording,and added a statement from our current code concerning words and pictures of poor taste.this code was submitted to interim superintendent,roy mullins,in.at that time,i asked mullins to let me know if this policy could be supported by the school board and administration.
we began to receive calls immediately.i defended the policy every time,calling it legal,reasonable,and enforceable.if you followed the articles in the knoxville news sentinel written by david keim,you will understand that we received no support from the district school board member or the new superintendent.the school board hunley was quoted on three occasions as saying that the policy was unreasonable.lindsey called it illegal.the july has an article which disputes both claims.
taylor was directed to revise the revised code and submit it to the superintendent.his initial revision was rejected and his final revision was changed.
i have always accepted the decision of a diverse committee when charged with such a responsibility.i still support your decision.
i do regret the negative publicity for the school and community.
one who reads this letter closely might be pardoned for wondering whether the principal objective was to make sharp look good at the expense of lindsey and hunley.lindsey was decidedly unhappy about the letter,in any event,and he sent sharp a memorandum accusing him of several inaccuracies and stating that a meeting would be scheduled to discuss the matter further.at no time prior to the meeting,which was held on august,was sharp advised that lindsey proposed to take any adverse action against him.
sometime after the july conference call,sharp presented a monologue the parties call it a skit at a gathering of teachers held on their first day of service in the new school year.after inviting the audience to look ahead to the year,the skit said,among other things,that the only superintendent the school board had been able to elect,charles lindsey,had been swept out of office in the year due to a controversy over a dress code that roy mullins had once again agreed to serve as interim superintendent that aged assistant principal alvin taylor addressed the board for the consecutive time concerning a dress code for gibbs that taylor was nearly in tears as school board chairman hunley called this current attempt to satisfy the board unreasonable and that gibbs personnel could see that once again the school would be floundering with no dress code and no direction.
not surprisingly,perhaps,lindsey found the skit offensive.as he testified at his deposition,he thought that sharp had exhibited extremely poor judgment in presenting it.
prior to the august meeting,according to the deposition testimony,lindsey had not decided what to do with sharp.lindsey said that he only wanted to talk to sharp about the august letter and understand why the principal had sent it.he felt that sharp was misrepresenting him,particularly in stating that lindsey had offered no support for the new dress code.lindsey took it ill,moreover,that sharp had circulated the letter without even attempting to discuss his grievances with the superintendent first.lindsey said he considered sharp behavior problematic because of the close working relationship and cooperation required between superintendent and principal.
at the end of the august meeting,lindsey placed sharp on administrative leave with pay.after taking counsel from the county law department about his options,lindsey ultimately decided to remove sharp as principal of gibbs high school and reassign him to a position as math tutor at the same rate of pay.sharp was informed of this decision at a meeting on august.
on september,sharp was instructed to report for teaching duty at halls high school.instead of doing so,he took a year medical leave of absence.sharp is a paraplegic and diabetic,and his physician believed that a classroom environment would be difficult for him.
a week after the reassignment to halls high,sharp brought suit against lindsey and the knox county board of education under.the complaint,which was filed in federal court,alleged violations of sharp free speech and due process rights.the defendants eventually moved for summary judgment,and their motions were granted.sharp has taken a timely appeal.
standard of review 
summary judgments are reviewed in this court de novo.see united nat.ins.sst fitness,cir.the federal rules of civil procedure provide that a motion for summary judgment shall be granted when the papers show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when deciding if summary judgment is proper,a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.
free speech claim 
matter of public concern 
sharp contends that the defendants retaliated against him for exercising his right of free speech.for a plaintiff to succeed on such a claim,it must be established that the plaintiff engaged in constitutionally protected speech the plaintiff was subjected to an adverse action or was deprived of some benefit,and the protected speech was a substantial or a motivating factor in the adverse action.brandenburg housing authority of irvine,cir citing healthy school dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.only the first of these elements is seriously contested here.
a public employee who seeks to prove that he has engaged in constitutionally protected speech must demonstrate that his speech touched on matters of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick myers,d.the defendants argue that the plaintiff skit and his august letter to the members of the dress code committee merely vented an employee grievance and did not address a matter of public concern.as the supreme court explained in connick,
when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern,but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest,absent the most unusual circumstances,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee behavior.id.at.
in the case at bar the district court concluded,quoting garvie jackson,cir,that sharp speech more closely resembled an employee complaints regarding his superior actions and his own responsibilities than a citizen speaking out on a matter of public decisionmaking.as far as the august letter was concerned,the district court offered the following observations,among others 
the august letter was addressed only to the members of the dress code committee.sharp used school stationery and wrote the letter in his capacity as principal.the letter criticized his direct supervisor,and characterized lindsey and the school board actions with potentially misleading generality.as for the content,sharp letter did not seek to bring to light wrongdoing or a breach of the public trust.sharp has admitted his primary purpose in writing the letter was to thank the dress code committee for their services and dismiss them.the letter does not comment on the dress code debate so much as it comments upon sharp relationship with the board members and his superior.when viewed in context,the letter resembles an employee complaints about his superiors actions and sharp own responsibilities more than a citizen attempts to add to the public debate over the dress code controversy.
as to the skit,the court had this to say 
t he skit was meant for performance at a closed faculty meeting.the skit,like the letter,was not addressed to the public,and focused on relationships that were mainly a matter of personal or personnel,as opposed to public,concern.to presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of public concern would mean that virtually every certainly every criticism directed at a public plant the seed of a constitutional case.connick,at.the letter and the skit if released to the public,would convey no information at all other than the fact that a single employee is upset with the status quo.id.at.
sharp argues,in response,that the dress code was a matter of intense public concern,as was evidenced by the parental complaints and press commentary it generated that whether lindsey backed up the principal and the gibbs dress code committee was itself a matter of public interest and that sharp criticism of the way the matter had been handled did not relate primarily to a private personnel issue or grievance.
in practice,as this debate illustrates,application of the connick test can be difficult.in the case before us,happily,the nettle is one we need not grasp.pretermitting this particular issue,we shall assume for purposes of analysis,without so deciding,that sharp was speaking more as a citizen on matters of public concern than as an employee on matters of personal interest.the section that follows explains why our indulgence in this assumption does not necessarily mean that sharp carries the day on his first amendment claim.
pickering balancing 
once we get past the connick issue,we must engage in a balancing exercise mandated by pickering bd.of,d.pickering directs us to weigh the interest of the public employee in commenting as a citizen upon matters of public concern against the government interest in the efficient provision of public services.id.at.
in striking the balance,we must consider whether an employee comments meaningfully interfere with the performance of his duties,undermine a legitimate goal or mission of the employer,create disharmony among,impair discipline by superiors,or destroy the relationship of loyalty and trust required of confidential employees.williams kentucky,cir.and we must recognize that although the government bears the burden of justifying the adverse employment action,see rankin mcpherson,d,the government is entitled to greater deference when regulating speech as an employer than when it attempts to regulate the speech of the public at large.see waters churchill,d 
the government interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.the government can not restrict the speech of the public at large just in the name of efficiency.but where the government is employing someone for the very purpose of effectively achieving its goals,such restrictions may well be appropriate.id.at.
sharp interest in casting aspersions on his superiors strikes us as relatively attenuated.according to his own testimony,sharp wrote his august letter primarily to apprise the dress code committee of the situation and to thank them for their efforts in revising the code.the slaps at lindsey and the school board were thus secondary had the ad hominem material been omitted,the ostensible purpose of the letter would still have been served.
on the other side of the balance,we must consider the defendants argument that sharp speech disrupted the close working relationship between superintendent and relationship on which the effective functioning of the school system depends.as superintendent,lindsey was entitled under tennessee law to expect the cooperation and support of the principal.see fleming wade.the relationship is a highly personal personal,indeed,that the superintendent employs principals in his own name under an employment contract that may not exceed the contract term of the superintendent himself.see ann.a nd the superintendent must necessarily be accorded considerable discretion in the employment and retention of such personnel.fleming,at.connick,at.when close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities,a wide degree of deference to the employer judgment is appropriate.
the fostering of a good working relationship between the principal and his boss was hardly helped,as lindsey pointed out in his deposition,by sharp failure to speak with him privately before trying to put the superintendent in a bad light before the dress code committee and the teaching staff.a different superintendent might not have considered sharp conduct insubordinate,but lindsey obviously we can not say that he abused his discretion in concluding that the interest of a smoothly functioning administrative team would best be served by the reassignment of sharp.in our judgment,the interests of a relationship outweighed sharp interest in trying to make himself look good at the expense of lindsey and the board.see brandenburg,at cir.
due process claim 
protected property interest 
sharp contends that he had a protected property interest in his position as principal and that he was deprived of this property without the process due him under the constitution.the defendants respond that under tennessee law the plaintiff had no protected property interest in his principal post.even if he had such an interest,they go on t
