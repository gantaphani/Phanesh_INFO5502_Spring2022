latin american energy development,delasa delasa,a louisiana corporation,alleged claims against winston strawn,llc,a law firm,for fraud,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duty the suit arises out of an attempt by delasa and others to acquire a contract to build a power plant in el salvador,with allegedly providing legal representation for the joint venturers,including delasa.delasa claims that was supposed to be representing its interests,but in fact enabled another of its clients,tenneco gas,to obtain the project and extinguish delasa rights in it.in response to motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the district court held a hearing and granted the motion,dismissing delasa case.we reverse and remand because delasa established a prima facie case for specific personal jurisdiction,and the district court evidentiary hearing was inadequate to require more.
factual background 
in january,and partners delasa,la casa castro,united thermal development corporation utdc,and independent energy corporation iec submitted a successful bid for the right to develop and operate a power plant in el salvador.winning the bid gave the partners the exclusive right to negotiate and execute a power purchase agreement with el salvador national power utility.
utdc main role was to provide project funding.it had a interest in the project,while delasa interest was.utdc agreed to pay the project development expenses,including the retention of legal counsel.jim abromitis,of utdc,retained paul abramson,a new partner with.abramson agreed to draft documents related to the project,including the power purchase agreement and a agreement among the.john wheelock,delasa then president,maintains in his affidavit that abromitis said that would represent all four parties,including delasa,in negotiations with third parties.when trigen energy corporation subsequently acquired utdc,it continued to retain and abramson in conjunction with the project.
in february,abromitis advised the other partners that trigen was no longer interested in participating in the project.but he stated that trigen would honor and fulfill all of its obligations with respect to the bid and negotiations,and that trigen would help the other partners find a replacement investor for the project.abromitis says that he contacted several developers,including tenneco,as potential replacements.at that time,and abramson represented tenneco with respect to unrelated projects in latin america.abramson had also been helping tenneco develop a profile of projects for investment in latin america.abramson introduced a tenneco executive to abromitis because he knew that abromitis was interested in finding another investor to take over all or part of trigen interests in the project.
on march,floyd lewis,a former attorney and a consultant to delasa on the project,faxed a message to abramson entitled,agreement among joint venture participants.the first paragraph of the fax states we trust that with respect to the subject document,which you have said will be delivered in new orleans your intent is to function as counsel to all of the parties and not just as lawyer for utc trigen and iec against the others.if we are in error in this assumption,please make it clear to us so that appropriate legal counsel can be engaged to look after our interests.the new orleans reference is to a conference where there was a meeting involving the joint venturers,tenneco,and abramson,which is discussed below.abramson responded via fax the next day 
as for your comments on the agreement among the parties,as you know there may be legal conflicts among the positions of the four parties,and winston strawn will represent utc trigen insofar as there are any such conflicts.
naturally,winston strawn believes it has been engaged to represent all four parties in their negotiations with others.we trust that one of the principals will advise us if this is in error.
emphasis added.wheelock concluded that this fax confirmed that was representing the joint venturers in the negotiations with third parties,including those parties who would be recruited to assume trigen role in funding the project.
on march,the joint venturers traveled to new orleans to attend the annual cogeneration and development power conference.in connection with the events in new orleans,abramson said he would deliver the joint venture agreement to the partners.the project partners and abramson were also to meet with potential investors to find a party to replace trigen or to assist trigen in funding the project.delasa was aware that several potential investors would be present at the conference.wheelock and lewis state that the parties and understood that the joint venturers would have to disclose proprietary and confidential information about the project,including the financial performer models,to potential investors.for this reason,they say that abramson was instructed to draft and deliver a confidentiality agreement to tenneco prior to the meeting in new orleans,which he never did.
delasa met with tenneco at the conference to discuss its potential involvement in the project.according to wheelock,prior to the conference abramson stated that all four parties should meet with tenneco in new orleans and indicated that tenneco had an interest in taking all or part of trigen interest in the project.delasa representatives met with tenneco during a golf tournament and lunch hosted by.based on the march fax,which confirmed representation of the project partners third parties,wheelock and lewis say that delasa felt comfortable divulging sensitive and propriety information concerning the project to one of contacts,tenneco.but while delasa representatives knew that had represented tenneco in the past,they say that they did not know that abramson was then representing tenneco in its efforts to develop a profile of projects in latin america.
after the new orleans meeting with tenneco,there was correspondence and a series of meetings between the joint venturers and tenneco,where they discussed the possibility of tenneco replacing trigen.eventually,tenneco and the joint venturers agreed that tenneco would be brought into the deal.
delasa worked with from its base in louisiana during the negotiations with tenneco.in fact,during the course of alleged representation of the parties,there were over a hundred contacts between delasa and in the form of telephone calls,correspondence,and faxes.these contacts generated over pages of documents,many of which were sent from offices to delasa in louisiana.
in april,the partners signed the agreement,which was now known as the three party agreement because only delasa,trigen,and la casa castro remained involved,with iec dropping out of the project.the agreement had a provision for the intended transfer of trigen interest to tenneco.was heavily involved in the writing of the document and corresponded frequently with all the parties,including delasa in louisiana,during the drafting process.
on may,the parties flew to el salvador to execute the power purchase agreement.all parties understood that trigen would be the only joint venturer to sign the agreement.but just prior to executing it,trigen informed the parties that it wanted to withdraw completely from the project.this was on the last day of the time period for executing the agreement.as a solution,trigen transferred its interest to tenneco.delasa and la casa castro then were asked to sign a release with trigen in which delasa and la casa castro released trigen from any and all obligations to each of them whatsoever in exchange for trigen signing the agreement.
wheelock says that when all this was occurring he asked abramson if signing the release would affect delasa interest in the project,and abramson assured him that it would not and advised him to sign the release.according to wheelock and abromitis,all those present,including abramson,told wheelock that the release would not affect delasa ownership interest in the project.
but tenneco relied on the release to claim ownership of the project and to deny delasa interest in it.after tenneco acquired trigen interests in the project,assumed the representation of tenneco in the project and provided legal services to tenneco in connection with tenneco sale of its rights in the power purchase agreement to coastal power and production company.delasa contends that abramson counseled tenneco in its efforts to claim ownership of the plant.
ii.procedural history 
litigation related to the el salvador project was commenced in louisiana state court against delasa and others.delasa added to the suit by demand,claiming that abramson enabled tenneco to obtain the project for itself and to unfairly extinguish delasa interest in it through a series of misrepresentations and failures to disclose material information.removed the suit and moved for dismissal based on lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficiency of process.delasa moved for jurisdictional discovery on the issues of specific and general jurisdiction and said that depending on responses to interrogatories and admissions,it might need to depose abramson and other parties essential to its jurisdictional case.the district court granted the motion only as to a document request for correspondence in possession that was directed from to delasa in louisiana.the court denied discovery on general jurisdiction.later,delasa moved for oral argument and live testimony in connection with the evidentiary hearing,which the district court denied.
the district court eventually held that was not subject to the jurisdiction of a louisiana court.the district court did not state the legal standard it was applying to motion,only saying that b ecause the court is now deciding the personal jurisdiction issue following an evidentiary hearing,delasa is no longer entitled to rely upon a prima facie showing of jurisdiction grounded on unsupported allegations.delasa suit was dismissed.
delasa appeals.its contention that discovery should have been allowed on general jurisdiction is rejected because the denial was within the court discretion.we reverse the court judgment denying specific jurisdiction.
iii.discussion 
standard applicable to motion to dismiss 
we review de novo the district court conclusion that is not subject to the jurisdiction of a louisiana court the first step in our review is to determine the legal standard the district court should have applied to motion to dismiss despite an initial holding that delasa made out a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction.
when the defendant disputes the factual bases for jurisdiction,as does here,the court may receive interrogatories,depositions,or any combination of the recognized methods of discovery to help it resolve the jurisdictional issue the court has discretion as to the type and amount of discovery to allow.but even if the court receives discovery materials,unless there is a full and fair hearing,it should not act as a fact finder and must construe all disputed facts in the plaintiff favor and consider them along with the undisputed facts moreover,at this stage the plaintiff is required to present only a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction the ninth circuit has explained why 
if the court determines that it will receive only affidavits or affidavits plus discovery materials,these very limitations dictate that a plaintiff must make only a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts through the submitted materials in order to avoid a defendant motion to dismiss.any greater burden such as proof by a preponderance of the evidence would permit a defendant to obtain a dismissal simply by controverting the facts established by a plaintiff through his own affidavit and supporting materials 
ultimately,the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that jurisdiction is proper often,the determination of whether this standard is met is resolved at trial along with the merits.this is especially likely when the jurisdictional issue is intertwined with the merits and therefore can be determined based on jury fact findings in this situation,it is often preferable that the jurisdictional determination be made at trial,where a plaintiff may present his case in a coherent,orderly fashion and without the risk of prejudicing his case on the merits.but this court has said that after a pretrial evidentiary hearing confined to the jurisdictional issue,where both sides have the opportunity to present their cases fully,the district court can decide whether the plaintiff has established jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence the district court relied on these cases and required delasa to establish more than a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction because,in its estimation,it was deciding the jurisdictional issue following an evidentiary hearing.this was error.
the hearing in this case was inadequate to justify raising delasa burden above the prima facie level.a pretrial evidentiary hearing is intended to serve as a substitute for the resolution of factual and legal disputes relevant to jurisdiction at trial.as such,both parties must be allowed to submit affidavits and to employ all forms of discovery,subject to the district court discretion and as long as the discovery pertains to the issue.furthermore,if requested by the parties,the district court often should convene a hearing where it entertains live testimony.in data disc the ninth circuit held that at a hearing where a court requires more than a prima facie case it should allow the plaintiff to go beyond the written materials.
the district court only partially granted delasa motion for jurisdictional discovery.delasa asked for written discovery in the form of interrogatories,requests for production,and requests for admissions from,but the district court granted delasa discovery only as to a document request for correspondence in possession that was directed to delasa in louisiana.by substantially curtailing the amount of discovery that could be obtained,the court erred in requiring more than a prima facie showing of jurisdiction from delasa.significantly,the district court did not allow delasa to take any depositions of parties essential to its jurisdictional case,including abramson.argues that this was not required because abramson was deposed in related litigation.but in that litigation personal jurisdiction over in louisiana was not at issue.the deposition of abramson in the related litigation was not a substitute for a deposition in this case as to personal jurisdiction.the court also denied delasa request for live testimony.without live testimony in this examination of abramson and other relevant witnesses,such as wheelock and lewis,would help resolve factual disputes dispositive of the jurisdictional court could not require more than a prima facie case from delasa.because the district court did not conduct a evidentiary hearing,it should have required delasa to establish only a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction.therefore,our review is restricted to determining whether delasa met this burden.
specific jurisdiction 
delasa has established a prima facie case for specific personal jurisdiction.a federal district court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the same extent as a state court in the state in which the district court is this case,louisiana the louisiana supreme court has held that the limits of the louisiana statute are coextensive with constitutional due process limits therefore,we must determine whether jurisdiction over comports with federal constitutional guarantees.exercising personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is compatible with due process when th e defendant has purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protections of the forum state by establishing minimum contacts with the forum state,and exercise of jurisdiction over that defendant does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.specific jurisdiction applies when a nonresident defendant has purposefully directed its activities at the forum state and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.
purposeful contacts with louisiana,in combination with the foreseeable harmful effects in louisiana of its allegedly illegal activity,makes speci
