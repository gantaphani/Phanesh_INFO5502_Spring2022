appellants darcy and sally guidry seek a reversal of the district court dismissal of their claims against appellee american public life insurance company apl pursuant to apl motion for judgment on the pleadings.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand.
background 
on march,darcy guidry applied for an cancer and specified disease policy the policy,which apl issued to him thereafter this policy is a cash benefit policy that provides supplemental coverage to assist in offsetting costs arising out of the treatment of diagnosed cancer and other specified diseases.the policy contractually obligates apl to pay a set percentage ranging between and of the actual charges incurred for various treatments the term actual charges is not defined in the policy.
until august,apl paid actual charges benefits based on the billed amount,the amount originally printed on the medical bill.in august,unbeknownst to its insureds,apl changed its payment practices and paid insureds based on one of two methods paying actual charges benefits based on the actual expenses incurred by the is,the reduced amount of the medical bill after any contractual or statutory reductions the discounted bill or paying the contractually established percentage of of the billed amount.
according to apl,it changed its payment practices i n response to the reality of negotiated discounts by medical providers to the insurers and other responsible third parties.over the course of many years,a substantial gap developed between the billed amount and the actual prices that providers have agreed in advance to accept as payment in full for their medical services,resulting in few patients paying anything close to the billed amount.according to america health insurance plans,amicus brief,this phenomenon is due to a combination of two factors the dramatic increase in the billed amount of hospitals and other healthcare providers,and the fact that many insurance carriers have contracts with hospitals which allow their insured to pay a price that is significantly below the billed amount.consequently,apl realized that it was overpaying claims by paying benefits based on the billed amount,which no longer reflected the expenses incurred by their insureds,and changed its payment practices as described above.
beginning in,the guidrys submitted claims to apl for cancer treatment benefits under the policy.apl payments to the guidrys were based on apl payment practices.on november,the guidrys filed a class action petition against apl,asserting a claim for breach of contract and seeking injunctive relief and damages.the guidrys asserted that apl failed to pay the contractually established percentage of the actual charges incurred for medical treatment.apl filed its answer on january.on march,apl filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,contending that it performed its contractual duty under the policy because actual charges unambiguously means the amount of the discounted bill.the district court agreed with apl and granted its motion on june.on july,the guidrys filed a motion to reconsider,which was denied on january.the guidrys now appeal.

iii.discussion 
appellants allege that the district court erred in dismissing their claims because the language actual charges means the billed amount or,at the very least,is ambiguous.apl contends,and the district court agreed,that actual charges unambiguously means the amount that the insured ultimately owes,the discounted bill.
as this is a diversity action regarding the interpretation of insurance policies issued in louisiana,louisiana substantive law controls.am.int l specialty lines ins.canal indem,cir.under louisiana law,an insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed by using the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the louisiana civil code.cadwallader allstate ins,so d.according to the louisiana civil code,i nterpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.ann,and an insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions.ann.

we find that the language actual charges as used in the policy is ambiguous.on the one hand,actual charges could reasonably mean the amount the patient was originally billed for medical services.this is the amount that the patient was actually charged,even if the medical services provider intended to accept less from the patient insurance carrier.on the other hand,actual charges could reasonably mean the amount for which the insured is actually liable based on the discounted bill.under this interpretation,the amount originally billed for medical services is the amount charged,and the amount of the discounted bill is the amount actually charged.
appellants interpretation is buttressed by its argument that when apl intended to limit the insured recovery to the expenses the insured was ultimately liable for,they did so clearly in the policy.for example,under the heading blood,plasma and platelets benefit,the policy states we will pay of the actual charges for blood,plasma and platelets,the administration,procurement,transfusion,typing and processing of,from date of diagnosis,which was paid by you,not to exceed per twelve month period.emphasis added.furthermore,according to the policy schedule for definitive cancer treatment benefits,the payment calculation for some benefits is based on actual charges and others are based on actual expenses.for example,the radiation therapy and chemotherapy benefit at issue here is based on actual charges,whereas the alopecia benefit is based on actual expenses.if we ascribe the term actual charges to mean actual expenses as urged by a reading would render the policy language which wa
