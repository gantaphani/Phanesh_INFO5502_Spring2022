plaintiffs are retired workers from defendant caterpillar.they argue that caterpillar breached its promise to provide lifetime retiree medical benefits at no cost when it began charging them for a portion of their medical care.most of their claims turn on whether a collective labor agreement provided workers with a right to retiree medical benefits that vested as soon as the worker became eligible for retirement or a pension.we hold that it did not.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the international union,united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents caterpillar workers and negotiates labor contracts on their behalf.these contracts include central labor agreements and related benefits agreements.the workers here retired between the time that the central labor agreement expired in and when caterpillar and the uaw agreed to a successor agreement in.the workers want the lifetime retiree medical benefits offered under the central labor agreement.
the central labor agreement itself did not describe retiree medical benefits.rather,a separate document,benefits plans under the collective bargaining agreement,contained an insurance plan agreement and appended group insurance plan describing the terms of retiree medical benefits and caterpillar also issued a summary plan description but none of the documents discussed explicitly when the right to retiree medical benefits vested.
the collective labor agreement was set to expire on october,but the parties agreed to extend it while they continued negotiations.the extension ended on november,when uaw workers began striking at some caterpillar facilities.on march,caterpillar told the uaw that effective april,it would implement portions of its final contract health care network to active and retired employees.in response,the uaw filed an unfair labor practices charge with the national labor relations board,which investigated and determined that caterpillar was entitled to declare and implement the proposed changes.on november,following more unsuccessful negotiations,caterpillar advised the uaw that,effective december,it would unilaterally and retroactively implement caps on the amount caterpillar would pay for retiree health coverage for employees who retired after january.the uaw did not challenge the second announced implementation as it had the one announced march.
caterpillar and the uaw did not reach a comprehensive successor collective labor agreement until.it became effective on march.the group insurance plan included health care network provisions.the parties disagree on whether the collective labor agreement and insurance plan agreements ratified the retiree health cost caps caterpillar had unilaterally instituted in.caterpillar issued a summary plan description in that provided for caps on benefits.
caterpillar also agreed to contribute million to a voluntary employee benefits association designed to pay expenses incurred by,retirees and their dependents above the caps unilaterally implemented in.in,and,caterpillar mailed letters to retirees advising them that once the voluntary employee benefits association funds were depleted,those retirees would be required to pay their health care coverage costs exceeding the cap.
in,caterpillar and the uaw agreed on a successor insurance plan agreement which provided that,on a going forward basis,caterpillar would share in the above the cap costs on a basis.in,caterpillar announced its intention to begin charging health care premiums for the class members.but in caterpillar announced it would waive premiums for any existing surviving spouses.at the time of the district court decision,caterpillar was not actually charging surviving spouses premiums.
plaintiffs filed this suit under section a of the relations act and sections e and f of the employee retirement income security act asking for injunctive relief and an order declaring that they are entitled to the retiree medical benefits described under the labor agreements.the district court later certified a main class and three subclasses.this interlocutory appeal concerns only the claims of workers who began working for caterpillar before the collective labor agreement expired and were pension and retirement eligible prior to january,and who retired on or after january,but before march.these workers retired during the period when there was no collective labor agreement in force.
caterpillar argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs lmra and erisa claims because the collective bargaining agreement was expired by the time plaintiffs retired.it maintained that the court could not determine rights under an expired contract,and there was thus not a contract or plan which caterpillar could have violated with respect to workers who retired after its expiration.the district court rejected this challenge,and concluded that the right to the retiree medical benefits vested when the employees attained retirement or pension eligibility,even for those who continued working after becoming.winnett caterpillar,d.
caterpillar then asked the district court to certify for interlocutory appeal w hether the court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs lmra section and erisa claims.the district court granted the motion,observing that the jurisdictional question turns on purely the legal issue of whether the plaintiffs rights to retirement medical benefits could vest under the labor contracts while they were active,employees,and finding substantial ground for difference of opinion on whether retirement benefits vest upon eligibility for retirement or upon actual retirement,and whether the inference that parties likely intended retiree benefits to continue as long as the beneficiary remains a retiree applies to active,employees.
the parties initially square off over whether rule b or rule b governs caterpillar motion to resolve this case on the pleadings.generally speaking,rule b permits a defendant to seek relief on the ground that a cause of action fails as a matter of law,regardless of whether the plaintiff factual allegations are true or not,while rule b permits a defendant to seek relief on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction over the dispute.that distinction is usually relatively easy to administer.not so,however,in section claims in a series of cases,we have held that a failure to state a claim under section of the labor management relations act,a,creates a jurisdictional defect.see bauer rbx,cir adcox teledyne,cir heussner gypsum,cir.because the supreme court has recently clarified that this kind of shortcoming affects only the merits of the claim,not the district court jurisdiction over it,arbaugh y h,d,we take this opportunity to clarify our case law on the issue.
in arbaugh,the supreme court considered whether congress,by permitting title vii discrimination suits only against employers with more than fifteen employees,a,had intended to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts or merely to list one element of a title vii cause of action.at.noting that jurisdiction and the essential ingredients of a federal claim are sometimes confused or conflated,id.internal quotation marks omitted,the court faulted the many jurisdictional rulings that label the elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional without attention either to indicia of congressional intent or to the consequences of such a ruling.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.attempting to clarify this area of the law,arbaugh announced a readily administrable bright line for determining when a statutory requirement is jurisdictional 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.
id.at.internal quotation marks,citation and footnote omitted.
prior to arbaugh,we held that section a plaintiffs must show that a union contract was breached to establish federal jurisdiction over their claims.see bauer,at adcox,at heussner,at.but these holdings do not survive arbaugh effort to bring clarity to this area.all three cases appear to be classic jurisdictional rulings,arbaugh,at.internal quotation marks omitted heussner attached the label of jurisdiction to the requirement without examining the consequences that follow from such a designation and without considering whether that is what congress had in mind.see heussner,at.bauer and adcox merely followed heussner lead,bauer,at adcox,at,with the former even noting that t here is some ambiguity over whether the expiration or supersession of a labor contract is better viewed as raising a jurisdictional problem or,instead,a problem.at.most importantly,none of these cases addresses the question that arbaugh now tells us to ask did congress clearly state,at,that the existence of a union contract is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a section a claim 
consistent with arbaugh,we now ask and answer that question.nothing in section a indicates that congress meant to attach jurisdiction consequences to the failure to state a cognizable section claim,and still less does anything in the statute do so clearly.here is what section a says 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter,or between any such labor organizations,may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
labor management relations act a,a.the only direct mention of jurisdiction in the statute refers to personal jurisdiction,not jurisdiction.and even then,the point of the reference is to ease access to the federal courts,not to impose new barriers.the same is true of later references that implicitly do address jurisdiction the statute relaxes jurisdiction by permitting federal courts to handle such cases without regard to the amount in controversy or the existence of diversity jurisdiction.yet nothing,clearly or otherwise,says that congress meant litigants and courts to endure the unfairness and waste of judicial resources that can flow from giving a jurisdiction label to an element of a cause of action.see arbaugh,at.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
the structure of the provision offers another clue that the contract requirement is.all of the elements of a plaintiff prima facie claim for the breach of a union contract appear in the same subsection.a.yet nothing in the statute offers any foothold for the notion that some of these elements of a section claim,but not others,have consequences.if the existence of a union contract limits our jurisdiction over a case,that would mean every other prima facie element of a section a the plaintiff be a labor organization,that the defendant be a labor organization or an employer,that both the plaintiff and the defendant be parties to the contract and that the suit be for violation of that contract,a would have similar consequences as well.even in the absence of arbaugh clearly states requirement,we should be reluctant to conclude that congress intended to create a cause of action that has no elements.
arbaugh also tells us not just to look at labels but also pragmatically to consider the consequences of giving a jurisdictional label to an element of a cause of action.there are several considerations at play here if we treat the existence of a valid collective bargaining agreement as a jurisdictional prerequisite to entry to the federal courts.first,while jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited,arbaugh,at,we usually require timely and reasoned presentation of issues to avoid forfeiture.see,leary livingston county,cir conclusory arguments are waived armstrong city of melvindale,cir failure to present an argument to a district court generally forfeits the right to present it on appeal united states moore,cir failure to raise arguments in opening memorandum or brief leads to forfeiture.these waiver and forfeiture rules ensure fair and evenhanded litigation by requiring parties to disclose legal theories early enough in the case to give an opposing party time not only to respond but also to develop an adequate factual record supporting their side of the dispute.see barner pilkington,cir.they also further judicial efficiency and lower litigation costs by encouraging parties to consolidate the issues they present to the courts for review and by avoiding unnecessary appeals of issues that could have been adequately resolved below.see da silva kinsho int l,cir.
second,when a court lacks jurisdiction over a claim,it must immediately dismiss not just that claim but any pendent claims as matter how late in the case the district or appellate court identifies the jurisdictional defect.see arbaugh,at.that approach contrasts sharply with the federal courts normal practices.under c of title,the federal courts have discretion to retain supplemental jurisdiction over claims even after all claims within the court original jurisdiction have been dismissed.this discretion permits the courts to conserv e judicial energy and to avoid the multiplicity of litigation that would arise if pendent claims had to be abandoned,regardless of the amount of effort expended in the federal litigation.rosado wyman,d.we should not lightly infer that congress means to impose such wasteful inefficiencies on the parties or the courts.
third,while it would seem to be the rare party that would let a jurisdictional defect lie until it lost the initial round of litigation,there can be little doubt that a loss in a case tends to sharpen the tactical focus of the losing party.yet once the courts label an element of a cause of action jurisdictional,they have no option but to entertain lately raised arguments,whether the delay flows from initial negligence or an unsavory litigation strategy.in arbaugh itself,the defendant first admitted that jurisdiction was proper,then,after losing a trial on the merits of both the title vii and the pendent state law claims,sought to have the jury verdict vacated on the ground that jurisdiction was lacking.at.see also bauer,at noting that the plaintiffs,who had originally invoked the federal jurisdiction,began to dispute it only after the court granted summary judgment to the defendants.before we entertain such arguments,arbaugh tells us to ask whether congress clearly meant for us to consider them.
here,congress gave no such indication,and accordingly we hold that,consistent with arbaugh,the existence of a union contract is an element of plaintiffs merits claim,not a limit on federal jurisdiction.to the extent our earlier cases held to the contrary,they are overruled.consequently,the proper vehicle to challenge the existence of a union contract is a rule b motion.
caterpillar,laboring under our pre arbaugh decisions,raised its challenge to the existence of a contract under rule b.so technically only jurisdiction,and not the merits of plaintiffs claim,is before us on this interlocutory appeal.but in this case,we may reach the merits without causing prejudice to plaintiffs by deciding the vesting issue on the pleadings.see rogers stratton,cir reviewing an issue raised under rule b as if plaintiff had filed a rule b.this is because,even construing plaintiffs allegations in a light most favorable to them,a claim based on retiree medical benefits vesting before workers retired fails as a matter of law.plaintiffs maintain that additional discovery would reveal extrinsic evidence in support of their interpretation of the document language.but,as discussed below,the controlling documents can not reasonably be interpreted to vest retiree benefits while workers are still active and represented by their union.because no amount of additional discovery would render the controlling documents ambiguous on this point,plaintiffs are not prejudiced by our reaching the merits now.and as the district court observed,our decision on the vesting question has the potential to save the parties and the judicial system significant resources because i f the sixth circuit reverses the court finding as to vesting the vast majority of the claims would be resolved.winnett caterpillar,wl.thus,we consider caterpillar arguments as if they had been raised in a rule b motion.
plaintiffs allege that caterpillar violated the terms of the central labor agreement when it unilaterally made changes to the retiree medical benefits.according to plaintiffs,their right to retiree medical benefits is the benefits can not be changed without plaintiffs consent.but plaintiffs retired after the central labor agreement expired.so we must decide whether the controlling document language demonstrates the parties intent for retiree medical benefits to vest before workers retired.if not,caterpillar could not have breached the central labor agreement with respect to workers who retired after its expiration.
the enforcement and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements under section is governed by substantive federal law,textile workers union lincoln mills,d,but courts should apply traditional rules for contractual interpretation so long as their application is consistent with federal labor policies,uaw,cir.the point at which certain retirement medical benefits vest under a collective labor agreement depends upon the parties intent.id.to determine this,we first look first to explicit contractual language,but resort to extrinsic evidence if the language of the labor agreements is ambiguous.uaw bvr liquidating,cir.ambiguous language is subject to two reasonable interpretations,wulf quantum chem,cir.e xtrinsic evidence,however,can not be considered when contract language is unambiguous.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.
we interpret each provision in question as part of the integrated whole and consistently with the relative positions and purposes of the parties.id.at.retiree medical benefits are welfare benefits,which do not vest automatically under either erisa or labor contract principles.bauer,at.we do not infer an intent to vest benefits in the absence of explicit contractual language or,in the case of ambiguous contract language,extrinsic evidence indicating such an intent.id.at.if a welfare benefit has not vested,after a collective labor agreement expires,an employer generally is free to modify or terminate any retiree medical benefits that the employer provided pursuant to the collective labor agreement.id.at.but once benefits vest,an employer unilateral modification or reduction of benefits constitutes a section violation maurer,at.
we thus begin with the explicit contractual language.none of the controlling documents refers to vesting of retiree medical benefits for active employees.the group insurance plan provides the following information about retiree medical benefits retired employees who satisfy the requirements hereinafter set forth shall be entitled to the same benefits provided in this section v as if they were employees.section v states that medical benefits are be provided without cost to the employee.
with respect to eligibility,the group insurance plan states 
coverage shall be provided without cost to any such retired employee and will be provided after his retirement from active service for a retired employee if he has at least years of credited service under the pension plan at his retirement and is eligible for the immediate commencement of a monthly pension under the pension plan or would be eligible for such immediate commencement but for his election to defer commencement of his pension.coverage shall take effect on his retirement date.
likewise,the summary plan description advised workers 
if you retire and are eligible for the immediate receipt of a pension with at least years of credited service under the pension plan,you will be eligible for the retired medical benefit plan,continued at not cost to you if an active employee dies when eligible to retire or if a retired employee dies,the surviving spouse will have coverage for his or her lifetime at no cost to the survivor.
this language can not be reasonably interpreted to explicitly state that benefits vested as soon as a worker became eligible for a pension or to retire.the phrase shall be provided in the group insurance plan refers to retired employees,not to current employees who might retire in the future.eligibility for retiree medical benefits is assessed at the worker retirement,and coverage takes effect on his retirement date.and though the group insurance plan does not explicitly link the end of the offer of the retirement plan to the end of the cba,winnett,d at,the benefits for retirees are the same benefits provided in the group insurance plan as if they were employees.the only plausible interpretation is that the benefits offered to a worker who retired at a particular date were the same as those in place for active workers on that date.moreover,the summary plan description promises that a worker will be eligible for the retired medical benefit plan,if the worker retire s,not if he becomes eligible to retire.
true,the insurance plan agreement remains effective until amended,and its termination shall not have the effect of automatically terminating the plan.but just because benefits offered by the group insurance plan may have continued until it was properly amended,does not mean that the benefits became unalterable as soon as plaintiffs became eligible to retire.the provision contemplating an extension of the group insurance plan has nothing to say about when retiree medical benefits vest,and certainly does not support an interpretation that the right to retiree benefits vests before an employee retires.and as plaintiffs concede,federal labor law permits an employer to unilaterally implement its last best offer once it has reached impasse in bargaining.
moreover,the summary plan description provides subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreements,the company reserves the right to terminate the employee benefit plans.although language may be ineffective as to workers who have already retired under the plan,as to future retirees,it alerts them that the company may discontinue the retirement benefits of employees who have yet to retire when the agreement ends.mccoy meridian auto,cir.
the district court found persuasive the contract language linking retiree medical benefits to pension eligibility,which we have held to be evidence of vesting.yolton,at mccoy,at cir golden,cir.but in each of those cases,we found the link between pension and welfare benefits to support the conclusion that retiree medical benefits vested upon actual retirement,not when a worker attains.
in the context of collective bargaining,there is a fundamental difference between future retirees and actual retirees that flows from the fact that active employees are represented by a union,while retired workers are usually not.as the supreme court recognized 
f uture retirement benefits of active workers are part and parcel of their overall compensation and hence a statutory subject of bargaining active employees are free to decide,for example,that current income is preferable to greater certainty in their own retirement benefits or,indeed,to their retirement benefits altogether.
allied chem.alkali workers of,local union.pittsburgh plate glass,chem,d.the difference in status between a worker eligible to retire and a retired worker is a matter of the worker choice about how long to work.when a particular collective bargaining agreement is about to expire,eligible workers are free to decide,id.at,whether to continue to earn income or to accept the retirement benefits offered to them under the particular agreement.
the district court was concerned that if caterpillar could induce workers to provide years of faithful service to the company,with the promise of lifetime free medical benefits,and then unilaterally decide not to provide them,even after the worker had performed the requisite service and attained pension or retirement eligibility status that promise would be illusory.but we are not troubled by a collective bargaining process that enables workers to balance the certainty of particular retirement benefits against the potential t
