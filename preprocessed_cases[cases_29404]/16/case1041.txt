in this appeal,a policyholder seeks to recover expenses incurred in defending against claims for which the insurance company denied coverage.wending through a thicket of inclusions and exclusions leads to the conclusion that the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the insurer.accordingly,we will affirm.
alleged liability of the foundation to lorillard the underlying suit 
american legacy foundation,a delaware corporation,was formed by the terms of the master settlement agreement msa between states attorneys general and the country largest tobacco companies.among these was lorillard tobacco company,whose dispute with the foundation is at the root of the case now before us.the foundation mission,as initially set forth in the msa and incorporated into its own bylaws,was to educate the public about the dangers of tobacco products in order to reduce their use among america youth.
the msa provided that the tobacco companies would fund advertising campaigns,developed by the foundation,that demonstrated the negative impact of tobacco product usage.the ads were to be concerned only with the addictiveness,health effects,and social costs related to the use of tobacco products.ads that amounted to a personal attack on,or vilification of,tobacco companies or their employees were prohibited.
the foundation created a series of television and radio ads branded the truth.these ads were brash,edgy,impertinent,and disrespectful,to appeal to those teens and young adults who were believed to be more likely to use tobacco products.the ads portrayed lorillard and other tobacco firms in a mocking and unfavorable light 
in,lorillard sent a letter to the foundation,threatening to file suit over one of those ads.a draft complaint included with the letter alleged various torts,including slander per se and per quod,libel per se and per quod,secondary libel,and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.lorillard letter also suggested that it might also pursue breach of contract claims.
in a letter of january,lorillard followed up with a notice of intent to initiate enforcement proceeding under msa.there,lorillard asserted that the foundation had improperly used the funding designated by the msa for public education and failed to meet its obligations under that agreement.
the foundation peremptorily filed a declaratory judgment action against lorillard in delaware chancery court on february.six days later,lorillard brought suit against the foundation in north carolina state court.that complaint included no tort claims but alleged breach of the msa and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
lorillard counterclaimed against the foundation in the delaware chancery court in september,asserting breach of the msa breach of the duty and covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the msa violations of the foundation bylaws and certificate of incorporation a declaratory judgment that the foundation was not eligible for public funding under the msa and trespass to chattel.the north carolina suit was stayed and remained pending while the parties litigated the delaware matter.
in january,the delaware court of chancery held that the foundation,though not a signatory to the msa,could be held liable for violations of that agreement.granting summary judgment to lorillard on this issue,the chancery court found that the foundation had adopted the msa,both expressly and implicitly by accepting its benefits with knowledge of its terms.am.legacy found.lorillard tobacco.therefore,the court concluded that the foundation was bound by the msa provisions.id.at.
after lengthy discovery and motions practice,including for summary judgment,the chancery court found that the ads in question did not breach the msa.specifically,the ads did not violate the clause because they did not incorporate scurrilous or vitriolic attacks,nor did they amount to cruel slander public ridicule,traduction,or calumny.am.legacy found.lorillard tobacco.in addition,the ads did not contain personal attacks because none of the ads specifically identif ied a target of an alleged attack.id.at.accordingly,summary judgment was granted in favor of the foundation in august.id.at.
on appeal,the delaware supreme court affirmed the holdings of the chancery court on both the standing and liability issues.lorillard tobacco am.legacy.having carefully scrutinized four of the ads that lorillard had asserted were contrary to the msa,the court found that t he advertisements are not invidious,disparaging,offensive,belligerent,nor fiercely or severely critical.nor are they denouncements that are both unfounded and abusive or slanderous they do not qualify as personal attacks or vilifications.id.at 
moreover,because delaware law provided that a corporation was bound by its preincorporation agreement if it expressly adopts th at agreement or implicitly adopts it by accepting its benefits with knowledge of its terms,the delaware supreme court found the foundation to be without merit.id.at.
b.the foundation national union the current litigation 
during the time it was publishing the ads at issue in the lorillard suits,the foundation had in effect a number and variety of insurance policies.of the four comprehensive general liability cgl policies,three had been written by travelers indemnity company of america and another by scottsdale insurance company.in addition,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,had issued an individual and organization i o policy as well as umbrella insurance to the foundation.
after receiving lorillard november,letter,outside legal counsel for the foundation instructed its broker to immediately put on notice and demand defense and indemnity from all insurers primary,umbrella and excess general liability,d o,that issued potentially applicable policies.the broker responded by sending a notice of occurrence form to national union and travelers on december.
in april,travelers denied coverage for the north carolina claim but did not address the delaware litigation.in a letter of december,two months after lorillard filed its counterclaims,national union similarly advised that the claims presented in the north carolina suit were not insured under the i o policy because suits arising out of breach of contract were excluded.in addition,that insurer evidently unaware of lorillard counterclaims,filed two months earlier wrote that no costs from the delaware action would be covered because affirmative prosecution of a lawsuit is not a claim under the policy.
nearly three months later,on february,the foundation advised its broker that the delaware suit was moving forward on lorillard counterclaims and requested that the broker immediately contact all insurers and demand any defense and indemnity as may be owed.
in april,national union told the foundation that its umbrella policies would not insure liability from the lawsuits under either of the two coverage options,a or on august,that insurer further advised that it did not believe coverage was applicable under the i o policy.notwithstanding its denials of coverage,national union requested,and the foundation provided,six litigation status reports between december and march.
in february,scottsdale insurance company reviewed the suit papers from the lorillard lawsuits,which it apparently had not received until that time.in its acknowledgment,scottsdale informed the foundation that it had no knowledge of lorillard counterclaims until one year after they had been adjudicated and,because of late notice,would provide no insurance.
in may,after all of the potentially applicable insurers had denied coverage,the foundation filed this action in the united states district court for the district of delaware,to recover the approximately million it claims to have spent defending against lorillard suit.after an extensive review of the various policies provisions,the court concluded that no insurance was applicable and entered judgment in favor of national union.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction over this diversity action under.appellate review is authorized by.we review de novo the grant of summary judgment.the district court interpretation of the insurance policies at issue is likewise a determination of law subject to plenary review.see alexander fire ins.of hartford,cir universal underwriters ins.travelers ins.the parties agree that no conflict of laws issue is present because controlling law in the district of columbia,where the foundation has it offices,and delaware,the state in which national union is incorporated,are similar.
as with all contracts,insurance policies are interpreted to give effect to their plain language 
clear and unambiguous language in an insurance policy should be given its ordinary and usual meaning w hen the language of an insurance contract is clear and unequivocal,a party will be bound by its plain meaning to the extent that ambiguity does exist,the doctrine of contra proferentum requires that the language of an insurance contract be construed most strongly against the insurance company that drafted it.

in addition,t he duty to defend may be broader than the duty to ultimately indemnify.am.ins.grp.risk enter.to determine whether an obligation to defend exists under the usual liability policy,the court typically looks to the allegations of the complaint to decide whether the third party action against the insured states a claim covered by the policy.id.at.so long as one count or claim is covered under the policy,the duty to defend is triggered.any doubt or ambiguity as to the pleadings or the policy terms should be resolved in favor of the insured.see cont l cas.alexis dupont sch.
in the interests of clarity,we will discuss the pertinent provisions of each insurance agreement at issue,and analyze the coverage available under it,separately.
a.the i o policy 
in its i o policy,national union agreed to 
pay on behalf of the foundation loss arising from a claim against the foundation for any actual or alleged wrongful act defined in relevant part as any breach of duty,neglect,error,misstatement,misleading statement,omission or act by or on behalf of the foundation as well as libel,slander,defamation or publication or utterance in violation of an individual right of privacy.
unlike typical liability insurance,the i o policy explicitly stated that national union d id not assume any duty to defend unless defense of the case was tendered in writing by the policyholder.the foundation does not contend that national union was asked or required to assume the defense of the lorillard litigation 
rather,the foundation coverage claim is based on another provision of the i o policy,which obligated national union to 
advance at the written request of the foundation,defense costs prior to the final disposition of a claim.such advanced payments by national union shall be repaid to national union by the foundation in the event and to the extent that the foundation shall not be entitled under the terms and conditions of this policy to payment of such loss.
national union undertaking to advance costs was not,however.the policy further stipulated that the foundation 
shall not incur any defense costs without the prior written consent of national union.only those defense costs which have been consented to by national union shall be recoverable as loss under the terms of this policy.
another limitation was detailed in the i o policy exclusion k,which denied coverage for claims 
alleging,arising out of,based upon or attributable to any actual or alleged contractual liability of the foundation under any express contract or agreement.
nevertheless,this exclusion would not apply,and coverage would be provided,if liability would have attached in the absence of such express contract.
the district court concurred with the chancery court conclusion that the foundation had an explicit relationship to the msa.am.legacy found.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,d.alternatively,the district court observed,the msa can be held to be an implied in fact contract as it relate d to the foundation,which implied in fact contract ha d the legal equivalency of an express contract.id.finding that lorillard claims in the underlying suit were based upon breach of that express contract,the district court held that exclusion k of the i o policy precluded coverage.id.at.
furthermore,the district court decided that because lorillard had not alleged libel or slander in the underlying cases,exclusion k escape clause,restoring insurance for those contractual claims that would have attached in the absence of an express contract,did not apply.id.at.no basis therefore existed to invoke national union duty to defend.id.at.
the foundation request for relief in the case before us is not based on a refusal to assume the defense but rather the failure to advance the costs of the defense.these are discrete concepts.when an insurance company assumes a defense,it retains and remunerates counsel ordinarily no reimbursement of legal fees is required,even if the underlying claim proves false,fraudulent,or unfounded.in contrast,if an insurer agrees to advance the costs of a defense,as stated earlier,the insured must request in writing the insurer consent before incurring defense costs and may be required to repay the insurer for advanced payments.
the starting point of the coverage analysis is whether the duty to advance costs was activated,and if so,when.national union policy does not state when the advance payments were due other than prior to the final disposition of a claim.the record reveals no explicit requests for national union prior approval of particular,designated defense expenses,nor any demands by the foundation for payment of accrued defense costs,at any time before final resolution of the lorillard suit.nor did the foundation challenge national union denial of coverage,based on exclusion k,until the filing of this suit.both parties,in short,seemed content to await the ultimate disposition of the lorillard claims before turning to the insurance coverage issues.
policyholders in other cases were more forceful in asserting their positions.in little mgic indemnity,cir applying pennsylvania law,it was undisputed that the policyholder ha d obtained from the insurer whatever consent was required as to the defense costs incurred.id.at.the dispute there involved when the advance payments were to be made.in a declaratory judgment action filed before resolution of the underlying suit,this court held that the insurer had the duty to advance costs as they came due rather than wait for termination of the underlying claim.id.at 
brown american international group,d,was likewise a declaratory judgment action.there,the court concluded that the duty to advance costs was in effect so long as the underlying complaint suggested a reasonable potential for coverage id.at.the court also held that an exclusion cited by the insurance company to deny all coverage did not control.accordingly,the duty to advance costs remained viable.id.like little,brown was filed after the underlying litigation began but before any determination on liability had been made there.and,as with little,brown did not result in a monetary judgment.id.at.
the foundation argues that the duty to advance payment of defense costs was triggered by lorillard allegations in the counterclaims,the same criterion for determining when the obligation to defend arises in most liability policies.although that argument may have some weight when an i o policyholder seeks an interim determination of coverage,it does not win the day here.at no point before suit was filed in the district court did the foundation seek a declaratory judgment contesting the application of exclusion k,nor did it demand payment of expenses as they came due.a obligation must be tied to something of substance to be enforceable,in this case,a demand for specific sums of defense costs.nor was a written request for national union consent sought by the foundation at any time before it brought this suit.
instead,the foundation complaint in the district court sought a monetary judgment of at least this legal action did not commence until after the delaware supreme court had resolved the underlying dispute,holding that the foundation had not committed any wrongful act against lorillard.at that point,final determination of the issues arising under the i o policy as to the lorillard claim had been reached.speculation at an earlier stage in the delaware suit as to what might have been the outcome of that litigation should not now be the basis for a monetary judgment.
the case before us is akin to american insurance group risk enterprise management,supra.there,a personal injury proceeding had settled after many months of discovery.at that point,the insurer denied a putative additional insured request for reimbursement of the cost of defending the tort action along with the amounts paid in settlement.id.at.the delaware supreme court,commenting on the purported insured delay in demanding a defense,observed that the determination of whether a duty to defend existed is being made after the underlying litigation has already been settled.for th is reason,the urgency that often exists at the outset of litigation is not present.id.at.accordingly,the court ruled that determination of coverage must be based on the whole record,including the evidence developed through discovery.id.at.
the same rationale is pertinent under the i o policy dispute here.the legal and factual basis for resolution of the lorillard suit had been finally adjudicated before the foundation filed this action to recover defense expenditures.whatever might have been an obligation to advance moneys during early stages of the lorillard litigation we need not decide.reality,not conjecture,establishes that the foundation is not now entitled to recovery of unadvanced costs of defense under the i o policy.
even if this were not the case,we agree with the district court that coverage under the i o policy for the lorillard claims was barred by exclusion k,which provided that national union would not be liable to make 
any payment for loss alleging,arising out of,based upon or attributable to any actual or alleged contractual liability of an insured under any express contract or agreement provided,however,that this exclusion shall not apply to liability which would have attached in the absence of such express contract or agreement.
according to the foundation,lorillard north carolina complaint and delaware counterclaims alleged violations of an implied contract as well as an express one.the foundation argues that the chancery court found that it had adopted the msa implicitly as well as expressly and,therefore,exclusion k was not operative.
we reject that argument.the discussion in the chancery court opinion upon which the foundation relies involved the question of standing specifically,whether the foundation had adopted the msa and could be held liable for breach of that agreement.that court held,and the delaware supreme court affirmed,that the foundation had adopted the msa and was bound to its terms and conditions.
lorillard alleged breaches of the msa,not of any implied obligation to adopt or adhere to that agreement.as the chancery court summarized the litigation,b oth parties agree that the matter presented is a straightforward contractual issue that turns on the legal interpretation of the words of the msa.at 
additionally,the foundation asserts that lorillard allegations that the foundation ads breaching the msa proscriptions against vilification of and personal attacks against the tobacco companies were,in effect,tort claims and therefore not affected by exclusion k.
we disagree.the opinions of the delaware courts make clear that the rulings against lorillard were not founded on torts of libel,slander,or disparagement.see,barry ostrager thomas newman,handbook on ins.coverage disputes,h ed.where same or similar exclusion was present,coverage for claims was excluded,whether such claims sounded in tort or contract,so long as they were undeniably linked to contractual claims.
we are persuaded that exclusion k remained in effect and,for this additional reason,the i o policy did not provide insurance for any part of the lorillard claims.
national union umbrella policy coverage a 
the national union umbrella policy provided two differing coverages,a and 
coverage a was excess that is,it adhered to the terms,definitions,conditions and exclusions of scheduled underlying insurance.this additional protection was in force only if the underlying policies were in effect and their limits had been exhausted.the district court considered the cgl policy written by travelers as being scheduled underlying insurance to the national union umbrella.the foundation initially named travelers as a in the suit before us,but dismissed after a settlement and no longer has any claim against that company.
another potentially underlying policy,though not characterized as such,had been issued by the scottsdale insurance company.that insurer did not receive any notice of the lorillard suit until february,many years after it was filed,and denied coverage for lack of notice.the foundation does not assert any claim that national union obligation dropped down to fill the gap caused by scottsdale rejection.
at oral argument,the foundation reiterated that it was making no claims under coverage we proceed then to coverage 
national union umbrella policy coverage b 
coverage b provided umbrella insurance that would 
pay on behalf of the insured those sums that the insured bec a me legally obligated to pay as damages by reason of liability imposed by law because of property damage,personal injury or advertising injury not covered by scheduled underlying insurance.
the underlying policy written by travelers excluded personal injury coverage arising out of the insured business if such business was advertising,broadcasting or telecasting done by or for the insured.therefore,the foundation argues,because travelers did not cover such personal injury,the umbrella came into effect.national union umbrella policy insured against personal injury,defined in relevant part as 
oral,written or electronic publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization,or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services.
we agree that,if the alleged personal injury came within the scope of coverage b and applicability was not otherwise excluded,national union would have a duty to defend.because the umbrella policy did not contain an obligation to advance costs,but provided only for the duty to defend,the customary test for assumption of defense is utilized that is,we examine the allegations in the complaint,rather than proceeding to the ultimate result of the underlying suit.in this respect,the umbrella differs from the defense cost advancement provisions of the i o policy.
the district court held that,because lorillard claims sounded in contract rather than tort,coverage b was not available for protection against allegations of personal injury,and,accordingly,national union had had no duty to defend d at.
the foundation here asserts that lorillard charged that the ads amounted to disparagement,libel or slander and so fell within the definition of personal injury under coverage accordingly,national union had a duty to defend.
that argument fails.lorillard complaint and counterclaims did not allege that the ads were slanderous,libelous,or disparaging.no challenge to the truthfulness of the ads contents was before the state courts.the fact of falsity is a predicate for libel,slander or commercial disparagement,and in its absence no cause of action for these torts was claimed,much less established.see,neurotron med.serv.ass of,cir see also gannett kanaga,plaintiff in libel case had to demonstrate actual injury,absent a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.therefore,the counterclaims failed to set out a tort cause of action.
moreover,lorillard was specific in its claims for relief.nowhere in its meticulously drafted counterclaims,numbering paragraphs,did lorillard seek damages for libel,slander or disparagement of product.the requests for relief were founded on alleged breaches of contract the ad damnum clauses,specifically directed to each counterclaim,requested declaratory judgments e
