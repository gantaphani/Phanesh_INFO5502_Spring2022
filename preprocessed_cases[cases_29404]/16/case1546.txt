hurricane katrina wreaked havoc on the new orleans area,destroying homes and businesses.one such casualty was a large vacation house located on the southeastern shore of lake pontchartrain.this appeal considers whether the insurer of the property must cover that damage.
factual and procedural background 
xavier grilletta grilletta and randy lauman lauman collectively,the plaintiffs owned a huge vacation home on the shores of lake pontchartrain.the house was approximately square feet and included nine bedrooms,seven and a half bathrooms,three kitchens,two dens,a large main room measuring by feet,and an elevator.water surrounded the house on three sides.the elevation of the lowest floor of the house was feet navd with the lowest horizontal member at feet navd.the property also included a large boathouse.
the plaintiffs obtained homeowners insurance from lexington insurance company lexington.the insurance policy covers most damage from excludes coverage of water damage,defined as damage caused by flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,whether or not driven by wind.in essence,therefore,if wind destroyed the house,then lexington insurance policy covers the damage if water destroyed the house,then lexington is not liable based on the exclusion.the policy limits are on the dwelling,on other structures,and on contents in the house.
on august,hurricane katrina completely destroyed the house.two days after the hurricane,the plaintiffs reported the loss to lexington.lexington hired an outside adjuster,wayne wagner wagner,to work on the claim.wagner met with the plaintiffs at the property on september.after that meeting,wagner requested additional information from the plaintiffs,which they provided at another meeting on october.on november,grilletta faxed a lost contents list to wagner.on november,wagner submitted a final report to his superiors,who then forwarded the report to lexington on november.wagner concluded,t he damage appears to be wind related and t he home was destroyed from wind and not flood.he recommended that lexington pay the plaintiffs for the dwelling the policy limit and an additional for the loss of contents,minus a deductible of,for a total payment of.
lexington took no action until january,when it requested a damage causation analysis from halliwell engineering associates,halliwell engineering.the engineering firm retained meteorologist andy johnson johnson to examine the cause of the damage.johnson determined that the maximum winds sustained at the property were between and miles per hour,with wind gusts possibly as high as miles per hour.he concluded that this wind might have damaged the roof,doors,and windows,but was unlikely to have totally destroyed the property.he also found that the storm surge was between fifteen to sixteen feet,with waves superimposed on top.johnson therefore concluded that a storm surge was the proximate cause of the destruction.his report stated,however,that wind damage to the roof might have occurred prior to any flood or storm surge.halliwell engineering submitted johnson report to lexington on april.
lexington told wagner,the claims adjuster,to the claim based on the halliwell engineering report,and specifically to assume that wind damaged the roof,which in turn could have led to interior damage.wagner then submitted a report detailing the damage to the roof,siding,interior drywall ceilings and walls,insulation,flooring,cabinets,and contents.on june,lexington paid the plaintiffs,consisting of for the house and for contents.
on june,grilletta wrote to lexington to dispute its conclusion that the proximate cause of the destruction was anything other than wind,question lexington failure to pay for the destruction of the boathouse,and state that he and lauman reserved the right to submit a supplemental claim for lost contents.lexington responded with a form denial letter.thereafter,on august,the plaintiffs brought suit.
in june,the plaintiffs included a supplemental claim for contents in a proposed trial exhibit.lexington did not respond to this supplemental contents claim.the district court conducted a bench trial on august.at trial,the plaintiffs sought payments for total destruction of the house,total destruction of the boathouse,supplemental contents coverage,and statutory penalties.
regarding the destruction of the house,the plaintiffs offered the testimony of engineer leonard quick quick.quick stated that t he property was destroyed by high wind forces,more probably than not,a tornado by way of the forensic physical evidence well in advance of the maximum height of flood water associated with a storm surge on the back end of the storm.quick came to this conclusion by examining the forensic evidence at the property,albeit approximately fourteen months after the hurricane.quick also stated that if there were not a tornado,then winds of miles per hour destroyed the property.regarding a storm surge,quick stated that the house sustained a surge of only ten to twelve feet.
in response,lexington submitted the testimony of two experts who provided a completely different analysis.meteorologist johnson stated that he examined the radar images of the area from the national weather service doppler radar in slidell and could not find any evidence of a tornado.lexington argued that johnson analysis of the radar images rules out the possibility of a tornado crossing the plaintiffs property.johnson also used data from the national climatic data center to conclude that the property sustained maximum winds of approximately miles per hour,with gusts at miles per hour.johnson testified that these winds were category winds on the scale and could damage roofs,doors,or windows but could not cause major damage to the structure.providing his theory of the cause of the destruction,johnson stated that the height of the storm surge at the counting the waves on feet,just touching the lowest horizontal members of the house.engineer todd cormier cormier reviewed this meteorological data and described how,in his opinion,the force of the waves destroyed the house.he explained that a large storm surge exerted upward pressure and lifted the house off of its foundation.he also noted that a storm surge destroyed a property known as old glory close to the plaintiffs property.
in sum,the plaintiffs expert,an engineer,asserted that either a tornado or high winds destroyed the house and that there was a small storm surge of ten to twelve feet.lexington experts,a meteorologist and an engineer,stated that there was no evidence of a tornado or winds strong enough to destroy the house and that a storm surge of at least fifteen feet caused the destruction.
the district court considered this evidence and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court noted that there was no dispute that the house was worth more than the policy limit.it also stated that there was no dispute that the boathouse was worth more than the policy limit for other structures,although lexington did dispute this finding.
in its conclusions of law,the court recognized that an insurer has the burden of proving that a policy exclusion applies once an insured suffers a loss,and it determined that lexington had not met its burden here.specifically,the court stated that a t best,it is ambiguous as to what caused the destruction of the property.the court noted that lexington and its experts conceded that wind could have caused some of the damage.accordingly,the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to the full payment for loss of the house.the court also found that lexington did not meet its burden of showing that water destroyed the boathouse and awarded the plaintiffs the full policy limit for this loss.
regarding the plaintiffs claim for supplemental contents coverage,the district court ruled that because the plaintiffs had not actually submitted a supplemental contents claim to lexington itself,lexington was not liable for any additional payments for contents coverage.the court then awarded the plaintiffs statutory damages pursuant to louisiana insurance law.specifically,the court awarded of the undisputed amount that lexington eventually paid based on the satisfactory proof of loss,or of.the court rejected the plaintiffs request for statutory penalties for the additional amount that the court had awarded.in sum,the court awarded the plaintiffs in additional payments for loss of the house,for the loss of the boathouse,and statutory penalties in the amount of.both parties appeal this ruling.because the district court,which had diversity jurisdiction,issued a final judgment,we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
a.the.standard of review 
the standard of review for a bench trial is well established findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.bd.of trs.new orleans employers int l longshoremen ass gabriel,cir quoting water craft mgmt.llc mercury marine,cir.accordingly,we review the allocation of the burden of proof de novo and the decision on whether the party met that burden for clear error.see guajardo.dep t of criminal justice,cir per curiam.
as the district court correctly explained,under louisiana law,once an insured suffers a covered loss,the insurer has the burden of proving that a policy exclusion applies to avoid liability.see.ann.b if damage to immovable property is covered,in whole or in part,under the terms of the policy of insurance,the burden is on the insurer to establish an exclusion under the terms of the policy.the insurer must demonstrate that the policy exclusion applies by a preponderance of the evidence.see ferguson state farm ins,wl,at.may,citing ferro gebbia,so d.as there is no dispute that the plaintiffs suffered a covered loss,lexington had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the exclusion applied,that water destroyed the house.
when reviewing a district court factual findings,this court may not the district court resolution of conflicting testimony or its choice of which experts to believe.see ayers united states,cir the resolution of conflicting testimony and the making of credibility choices are within the province of the court sitting without a jury,subject only to the clearly erroneous standard.as we have previously stated,t he credibility determination of witnesses,including experts,is peculiarly within the province of the district court.consequently,we give deference to the findings and credibility choices trial courts make with respect to expert testimony.league of united latin am.citizens roscoe indep.sch,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,we review the district court finding that water did not destroy the house only for clear error.
the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal recently decided a very similar case,which guides our analysis.see veade.citizens prop,so d.that case involved a house near the property that hurricane katrina also destroyed.id.at.at trial,the plaintiffs presented the testimony of the same engineer as in this case,leonard quick,who stated that high winds or a tornado,and not water,destroyed the property.id.at.the insurer presented the opinions of its own experts,who determined that water caused the destruction.id.at.the trial court weighed these competing views and concluded that the insurer had not met its burden of showing that the water damage exclusion applied.id.at.on appeal,the court noted that quick is an experienced forensic engineer who had conducted many katrina related claim inspections.id.the court ruled that the trial court had not committed manifest error in its findings,especially because there were two opposing theories as to the destruction of the property.id.
similarly,much of the bench trial in this case involved a battle of the experts.as discussed above,the plaintiffs presented the testimony of quick,the engineer,who stated that his review of the forensic physical evidence suggested that a tornado or high winds destroyed the house.lexington responded with the testimony of two experts,who discounted the plaintiffs expert and concluded that the only plausible explanation was that water or flooding caused the destruction.on appeal,lexington strenuously objects to the district court finding that it did not meet its burden of showing that water caused the damage,arguing that objective meteorological evidence completely discounts the theory that a tornado or high winds destroyed the house.it notes that its meteorologist expert,johnson,used objective data from the national weather service,the national hurricane center,the national oceanic atmospheric administration,the national climatic data center,and the united states geological survey.lexington also points out that quick did not offer any meteorological data and instead relied on unreliable forensic evidence on the property,which he had examined roughly fourteen months after the hurricane.
however,lexington experts also conceded that a tornado or high winds could have damaged the house.further,lexington engineer,cormier,admitted that halliwell engineering originally concluded that a storm surge destroyed old glory,the property nearby,but later removed that conclusion from future reports regarding that property.thus,the evidence at trial was not as as lexington suggests.
most tellingly,much like in veade,our review of the record shows that there were two permissible views of the evidence,meaning that the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson city of bessemer city,d.although lexington presented a persuasive argument that the meteorological data suggests that water was the proximate cause of the damage,the district court did not view that evidence as conclusive.indeed,the main basis of this lawsuit is that it is unclear whether wind or water destroyed the house,and several experts offered differing views.given that the trial consisted of a battle of qualified experts who all presented plausible theories,the district court was free to choose among these reasonable explanations in rendering its decision.accordingly,by definition,the district court resolution of this issue can not be clearly erroneous,and we affirm the district court finding.
b.the boathouse 
standard of review 
at the close of the plaintiffs,lexington moved for judgment on partial findings under federal rule of civil procedure c,arguing that the plaintiffs failed to prove the value of the boathouse,which was an element of their claim.the district court denied the motion.in its final judgment,the court awarded for coverage of the boathouse,the full policy limit for other structures.when considering a district court ruling under rule c,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.bursztajn united states,cir.
at the trial,lauman described the boathouse as a to foot high structure that had sheet metal sides,a pier,a covered deck,an open fishing area with four large fishing lights,running electricity and water,and a remote control electric launch for lifting,storing,and launching a foot boat.the district court,in denying lexington rule c motion,stated that based on this description and an aerial photograph of the premises,it could conclude that the boathouse was worth well more than the policy limit for other structures.
lexington challenges this finding on appeal,but it fails to demonstrate how the court clearly erred.for example,lexington does not explain why the court went astray in relying on lauman detailed testimony about the boathouse.although additional evidence might have been preferable to support its conclusion,it is well within the fact finder discretion to consider this testimony,view an aerial photograph,and make an inference that the boathouse was,in the district court words,a pretty substantial structure that would cost more than to rebuild.accordingly,we affirm the district court finding on this issue 
supplemental contents coverage 
standard of review 
the district court found that the plaintiffs did not provide lexington with a satisfactory proof of loss for supplemental contents coverage,and,in a,the plaintiffs challenge this conclusion.this is a factual finding that we review for clear error.see gabriel,at boudreaux state farm mut.auto.ins,so
