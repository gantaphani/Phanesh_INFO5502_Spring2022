factual background and procedural history 
united fruit was started by scolio father in.scolio became involved with the company in and was a partner by.in,scolio father died and scolio became the sole proprietor of the business until,when he sold united fruit to john tarantino,irvin rovner,and larry altman.in,the owners brought in ralph paglia to manage the company.scolio remained an employee of united fruit,and was responsible for paying bills and calculating the employees pay.
in,tarantino and altman sold their shares,leaving ownership of united fruit in the hands of paglia,rover,and scolio.according to scolio,he purchased shares for the benefit of paglia who could not afford to buy all the shares that he wanted.although scolio claims that he eventually intended to sell his interest to paglia,he never did so,and thus scolio remained a shareholder at the time of united fruit bankruptcy.
not only was scolio a shareholder and employee of united fruit,but company policy required his and paglia signature for disbursement of united fruit checks.to assist him in this endeavor,scolio had a signature stamp created to use when issuing united fruit checks.
in june,paglia asked scolio to retire,but encouraged him to remain active in the directorship of the company.scolio ceased working for united fruit,but retained his stake in the company,his position as officer,and his title as.scolio also remained a signatory on united fruit bank accounts and united fruit continued to use scolio signature stamp after his retirement.furthermore,scolio acted as a guarantor on transactions between united fruit and dollar bank leasing and possibly first western bank.
soon after scolio retired,united fruit began doing business with and brigiotta.from july,through september,sent five shipments of produce to united fruit,with payment on each shipment due within ten days.october,was the latest date on which payment was due for any of the invoices.brigiotta provided produce in numerous shipments to united fruit from august,through february.again,payments were due within ten days of the date of each invoice,and march,was the latest date on which payment was due on any of the brigiotta invoices.neither seller received any payment for the produce it provided.
united fruit filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on december.the company ceased operations in march.sellers claims were determined to be qualified valid paca claims by the bankruptcy court and each received a partial distribution from united fruit remaining assets.
seeking the rest of the money owed to them,sellers filed suit against scolio in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on april.in their complaint,sellers alleged that scolio breached his fiduciary duty owed to them under paca.a bench trial was held on march,and the district court found scolio liable and ordered judgment in favor of the sellers.the district court also awarded interest and attorneys fees.scolio timely appealed.

iii.analysis 
scolio raises three issues on appeal.first,he argues that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the case on statute of limitations grounds.second,he claims that the district court erred in finding him personally liable.finally,scolio challenges the district court award of attorneys fees and interest.because we conclude that sellers claims were not timely,we do not address scolio other arguments.
this court has had few opportunities to examine paca,thus we begin by examining the history and purpose of the statute.congress enacted paca in to deter unfair business practices and promote financial responsibility in the perishable agricultural goods market.sunkist growers fisher,cir quoting farley and calfee,united states dep t of,cir.the act was designed primarily for the protection of the producers of perishable agricultural of whom must entrust their products to a buyer or commission merchant who may be thousands of miles away,and depend for their payment upon his business acumen and fair dealing.tom lange kornblum,cir quoting,reprinted in.
in congress amended paca to allow for a floating trust for the protection of producers and growers,reprinted in.congress recognized that these producers and growers tend to be small businesses in a high risk industry.id.they generally have capital tied up in land and machinery and their survival depends on timely returns on the sale of their products.id.congress explained 
many commission merchants,dealers,or brokers,in the normal course of their business transactions,operate on bank loans secured by the inventories,proceeds or assigned receivables from sales of perishable agricultural commodities,giving the lender a secured position in the case of insolvency.under present law,sellers of fresh fruits and vegetables are unsecured creditors and receive little protection in any suit for recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make payment as required by the contract.
this legislation would provide a remedy by impressing a trust in favor of the unpaid seller or supplier on the inventories of commodities and products derived therefrom and on the proceeds of sale of such commodities and products in the hands of the commission merchant,dealer or broker in the same manner that has been provided by trust amendments to the packers and stockyards act adopted in.the trust provisions of that act have operated very successfully without imposing a regulatory burden on the industry.
the trust impression by section c of this act is made up of a firm commodity related liquid assets,and is a nonsegregated floating trust,which permits the commingling of trust assets.in the view of the committee it provides the protection needed by the trust beneficiaries without creating an undue hardship to any person.
the committee believes that the statutory trust requirements will not be a burden to the lending institutions.they will be known to and considered by prospective lenders in extending credit.the assurance the trust provision gives that raw products will be paid for promptly and that there is a monitoring system provided for under the act will protect the interests of the borrower,the money lender,and the fruit and vegetable industry.prompt payments should generate trade confidence and new business which yields increased cash and receivables,the prime security factors to the money lender.
these amendments would give the industry and department effective new tools to overcome the payment problems.
id.at.it is clear that congress intended to create a system by which producers and growers would be secured in their transaction with buyers,and in return they were expected to make prompt claims when the buyers failed to pay.with this background,we now turn to the claims against scolio.
