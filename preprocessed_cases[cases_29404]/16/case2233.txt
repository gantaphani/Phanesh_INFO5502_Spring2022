the texas lawsuit 
in,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,alleging that the defendants in that case had obtained proprietary information from a new jersey to as the principal corporation owned by doe.the complaint asserted a rico claim,in which alleged that the defendants had conspired with principal corporation and doe to obtain and use proprietary information.there is no dispute that,while rain and paramount were not named as defendants in the texas suit,the complaint used the pseudonyms doe and principal corporation to refer to rain and paramount.
also in,rain attended the,an annual trade show sponsored by the helicopter association international hai.at the,the amcs,and the arfs sponsored a private customer appreciation event.the first network members purchased passes to the event from to give to their customers.rain obtained a pass from an amc and attended the event.

procedural history 
on september,appellants filed a breach of contract suit alleging that had breached the provision in the settlement by including certain allegations in the texas complaint,and again by escorting rain out of the event.the district court granted motion for partial summary judgment as to the claim based on the texas lawsuit,finding that even if disparaged appellants by accusing them of being involved in racketeering and other wrongdoing,was immune from liability under indiana absolute litigation privilege.following a bench trial on appellants other breach of contract claim,the district court held that treatment of rain at the event did not constitute disparagement in violation of the settlement agreement.in reaching that conclusion,the court looked to black law dictionary to identify the plain and ordinary meaning of the term disparage,which it found to be t o dishonor something or someone by comparison or t o unjustly discredit or detract from the reputation of another property,product or business.the trial judge found that while action may have caused rain embarrassment,it did not detract from his reputation as a businessman or reflect poorly on his character,his products or his business dealings,and thus did not constitute disparagement.appellants timely appealed both rulings.
ii.discussion 
indiana absolute litigation privilege and the texas lawsuit 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see lewis downey,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.on appellate review,we review the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see haefling ups,cir.
indiana law has long recognized an absolute privilege that protects all relevant statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding,regardless of the truth or motive behind the statements.hartman keri.the purpose for the privilege is to preserv e the due administration of justice by providing actors in judicial proceedings with the freedom to participate without fear of future defamation claims.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in the words of one indiana court,the privilege recognizes that the public interest in the freedom of expression by participants in judicial proceedings,uninhibited by the risk of resultant suits for defamation,is so vital and necessary to the integrity of our judicial system that it must be made paramount to the right of the individual to a legal remedy when he has been wronged.miller reinert,citation omitted.
in determining whether a statement is relevant and pertinent,such that it is absolutely privileged,indiana courts favor a liberal rule.id.only those allegations that are so palpably irrelevant to the subject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can doubt their irrelevancy and impropriety are not covered by the privilege.id.the allegations at issue asserted that doe and principal meaning rain and paramount trafficked in intellectual property stolen from and formed an enterprise with the defendants in that case to replicate engine parts and undercut business.there can be no doubt that those allegations were pertinent and relevant to the texas litigation,as fifth circuit precedent required to allege the existence of an enterprise in order to plead its rico claim.see paul mercury ins.williamson,cir.moreover,because the alleged enterprise was an as opposed to a legal entity,was required to show evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,that functions as a continuing unit over time through a hierarchical or consensual structure.id.at.
thus,the requirements for applying indiana absolute privilege are allegations were made in the course of a judicial proceeding to which they were relevant.appellants nevertheless contend that is not immune from liability because the privilege does not extend beyond defamation and other similar tort claims to encompass breach of contract claims.no indiana court has addressed whether the absolute privilege precludes not only tort liability,but also contractual liability.faced with a novel question of state law and no authority from the state courts,we shall examine the reasoning of courts in other jurisdictions addressing the same issue and applying their own law for whatever guidance about the probable direction of state law they may provide.pisciotta old nat.bancorp,cir.
courts in a number of other jurisdictions have concluded that the absolute litigation privilege is applicable to breach of contract actions,at least where immunity from liability is consistent with the purpose of the privilege.see kelly golden,cir holding that missouri absolute privilege precluded liability for an alleged breach of a agreement based on statements made in a judicial proceedi
