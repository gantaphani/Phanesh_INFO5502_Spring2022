this case brings questions of whether an employee acted within the permissive use authorized by his employer,goodyear tires,when he fell asleep at the wheel of a company truck.applying texas law,we conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain,and we reverse and remand.
goodyear tire and rubber company hired corte adams in april as a service technician to change tires and fix flats in its houston,texas shop.in september,adams transferred to the bryan,texas shop,which specializes as a commercial truck tire center he was trained and promoted to the position of truck alignment specialist.after the transfer,adams continued to live in houston and commuted four hours each day to and from bryan.
though adams owned a car,goodyear allowed him to use a gmc pickup truck in his travel between houston and bryan.goodyear did not hire adams as a driver.nevertheless,once or twice a week adams dropped off or picked up tires at the houston shop on his way home from bryan in the evenings or on the way back to bryan the next morning.when he had a delivery or a,adams was on the clock for goodyear until he dropped the tires off at the houston shop in the evening or after he arrived at the houston shop in the morning to pick up tires.when making a delivery or a,adams was paid for the driving time.in addition,goodyear required adams to carry a pager at all times.adams often used the company truck,with his boss knowledge,during working hours to run small personal errands such as picking up lunch.
on friday february,adams left bryan in the late afternoon,approximately.after he delivered the tires to the houston shop at approximately,adams stopped for chinese and drove to his father house,where he arrived by approximately there,adams ate supper,consumed four or five beers,and slept for approximately four hours.sometime between and,adams awoke and drove the goodyear truck to a convenience store in order to purchase cigarettes for his father on his way back to his father home from the store,adams caused a traffic accident when he fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the center stripe into oncoming traffic.he collided with a vehicle driven by patrick mayes,severely injuring mayes adams,too,was injured and unable to work.two months later,goodyear fired adams for using the truck in an unauthorized manner.
after mayes sued adams and goodyear,goodyear insurer,appellees travelers indemnity company of connecticut,travelers property casualty insurance company,travelers insurance corporation collectively travelers,refused to cover adams,thereby refusing to recompense his damages or defend and indemnify him.adams sued travelers and goodyear in state court,alleging violations of the texas insurance code and the texas deceptive trade practices act and bad faith,fraud,and breach of contract for refusal to provide coverage appellees removed adams suit to federal court on diversity grounds.thereafter,travelers moved for summary judgment on all claims.adams failed to timely respond to appellees motion despite receiving two extensions,totaling more than days,and the district court denied both adams motion for leave to file out of time and his motion for a continuance.the district court,then,granted travelers uncontested motion for summary judgment.the district court denied adams motion for a new trial,and this appeal followed.
adams argues that the district court erred by not relying upon his untimely response in opposition to travelers filing for summary judgment,by not granting an extension under rule b and by not granting a continuance for further discovery under rule f we review for abuse of discretion after two extensions beyond the initial february deadline,adams filed both his response to travelers motion for summary judgment and a request for a third extension on june,the day following the final due date the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to apply adams untimely response to travelers motion for summary judgment,despite having read it,or by denying an extension because adams failed to demonstrate excusable neglect adams had ample time to comply with the extended deadline 
rule f authorizes a district court to order a continuance to permit affidavits to be taken or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had,if the files affidavits showing that he or she can not for reasons stated present by affidavit facts necessary to justify the party opposition.a seeking relief under rule f must show why he needs additional discovery and how that discovery will create a genuine issue of material fact a party can not evade summary judgment simply by arguing that additional discovery is needed,and may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed,but unspecified,facts.adams did not provide reason enough to warrant a continuance,relying solely on his personal problems to excuse the failure to rebut travelers assertion that no genuine issue of material fact existed.though relevant,the evidence he wished to acquire,including deposition testimony relating to a corporate policy allowing limited personal use of company vehicles,was available throughout the days of extra time granted by the district court the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying adams motion for continuance to conduct specific limited discovery in response to travelers motion for summary judgment.we,therefore,make our determination regarding the appropriateness of summary judgment based on the record as developed primarily by travelers.
adams attempts to imbue the instant case with the result reached by the texas appellate court in mayes goodyear tacitly invoking both collateral and the principle of diversity jurisdiction which requires this court to apply the law of the state in which it resides mayes issued on the same day as final judgment was entered in the instant case,and,thereafter,adams filed a motion for new trial motion for reconsideration the district court denied the motion we review for abuse of discretion 
mayes does not benefit adams.as an intermediate appellate decision pending appeal to the texas supreme court,it does not control and can not be relied upon as binding state authority or as preclusive given the divergent records therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying adams motion for reconsideration in light of mayes.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as below summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis of its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.in adjudicating a motion for summary judgment,the court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the 
once the moving party meets this burden,the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts in the record showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.an issue is genuine if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party rule does not impose upon the district court a duty to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party opposition to summary judgment.a failure on the part of the nonmoving party to offer proof concerning an essential element of its case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial and mandates a finding that no genuine issue of fact exists as the district court,therefore,explained s ince the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant motion for summary judgment,the inquiry must be whether the facts presented by the defendants create an appropriate basis to enter summary judgment against the plaintiff.
in defending the district court grant of summary judgment,travelers contends that adams does not qualify as an insured.the policy defines an insured as,inter alia anyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire,or borrow emphasis added it is uncontested that the goodyear truck is a covered auto.travelers instead argues that adams accident occurred while without permissive use of goodyear truck and,therefore,that adams is not entitled to defense or indemnification because he can not prove coverage 
nature of permission 
in texas,permission is consent to use the vehicle at the time and place in question and in a manner authorized by the owner,either express or implied.in royal indemnity company abbott sons,the texas supreme court wrote 
while express permission must be affirmatively stated,implied permission may be inferred from a course of conduct or relationship between the parties in which there is mutual acquiescence or lack of objection signifying consent.it is usually shown by usage and practice of the parties over a period of time preceding the occasion on which the automobile was being used 
therefore,permission,sufficient to support coverage under an omnibus clause of an insurance policy,may be either express or implied.
express permission 
adams contended at the hearing on summary judgment and now argues on appeal that he had express authority to use the goodyear truck for personal use,inclusive of the contested time period during which the accident occurred.adams relies on language in a company handbook detailing the operating standards for using company vehicles,referred to as the commercial tire and service center associate expectation ct sc.it reads personal use of company vehicles is to be kept to a minimum.company vehicles are not to be used for vacation travel.the ct sc was not,however,properly before the district court since it was filed on june,one day after the expiration of adams final extension thus,regarding express permission,adams fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the record before the district court,in response to traveler motion for summary judgment.
implied permission 
adams also argues that a pattern of tolerated personal use creates implied permission deposition testimony shows that adams used the company truck on his lunch break,with the knowledge of his supervisors,to pick up food and dry he had at least implied permission to use the truck for personal errands we are persuaded that a fact question exists as to whether adams,as a general matter,had implied permission for personal use of the goodyear truck.but this does not end the inquiry.
scope of permission 
the question remains whether adams necessarily exceeded the scope of his implied permission.the district court held that adams exceeded the sum of his any express or implied permission as a matter of law.
as the district court noted,texas courts apply the minor deviation rule when determining whether an individual qualifies as an insured under a policy that covers permitted drivers texas courts have rejected the notion that any deviation from a company policy constitutes a gross violation under the minor deviation rule,a person may deviate from the permitted usage of an insured vehicle and still be covered under an omnibus provision if the use is not a material or gross violation of the terms of the initial permission.considerations for finding a deviation material include the extent of deviation in actual distance or time,the purposes for which the vehicle was given,and other factors consumption of alcohol constitutes an other factor.some deviations may be so minor that they do not create a fact issue whether permission was revoked other more significant deviations may create such an issue and some deviations may be so material that they revoke permission as a matter of law.
both the district court and the defendants rely on cases,coronado and renfrow,that apply the minor deviation rule to situations involving express prohibitions against any personal use of company vehicles.no such express prohibition against personal use exists in the instant case.in minter,explaining the existing texas precedent,we recently applied the minor deviation rule to a situation in which the driver had permission to drive the truck to and from work and to park it overnight at his apartment the employer explicitly warned the driver employee that the vehicle was not to be used for personal errands the driver was given permission to deliver the truck to a facility in decatur,texas for scheduled maintenance on a sunday morning on saturday evening the employee drove to his sister home so that she could follow him and drive him back to his residence in bridgeport the following morning it developed that his sister could not give him a ride,and,returning to his residence,the employee was involved in a traffic accident 
reversing the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer,we found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employee had express permission to drive the company truck to his sister home,as testimony suggested that his boss had consented to the trip.we went on to say that a fact question also existed as to whether the driver had implied permission because the driver would presumably need to secure return imparting implied permission to do so.importantly,we noted that the driver errand to his sister home was not purely personal,as it related to the delivery of the truck in the morning 
after analyzing the nature of the permission,we applied the minor deviation rule,stating that the driver intoxication did not,as a matter of law,necessarily cause him to exceed the scope of his permission to use the company truck,for the purposes of insurance coverage under a similar omnibus clause furthermore,we stated that the minimal time and distance involved weighed in the driver favor,distinguishing both royal indemnity and renfrow in which the distances traveled were forty and fifty miles,respectively 
thus,we consider the purpose of the errand,assess the distance and time involved,and weigh the additional factor of alcohol consumption.the errand itself,purchasing cigarettes for his father,was personal in nature.but the distances traveled were not so significant as to eviscerate adams implied matter of a few stop where adams had express permission to drive the vehicle between bryan and houston.also,though adams assumed that he should not drink and drive a company vehicle,reasonable people may disagree as to whether four hours of intervening sleep sufficiently reinvigorated adams implied permission moreover,though consumption of alcohol while driving is expressly prohibited in the driver handbook drinking with a meal and subsequently driving is not proscribed.rather,the determinative factor is the driver judgment and impairment.therefore,the simple fact that adams consumed alcohol earlier that night,alone on these facts,is insufficient to sustain summary judgment.
travelers heavily relies upon the time of day when the accident occurred to place the event outside the policy requirement of permissive use.admittedly,adams stands on shaky ground,here the inference that goodyear acquiescence to adams personal use during his lunch hour created implied permission to purchase cigarettes at one or two in the morning is tenuous under texas law.still,we are not persuaded that the deviation is so egregious as to demand summary judgment given the lack of an express prohibition on personal use,the arguably implied permission to use the vehicle for personal errands during adams lunch break,and the minimal distances involved.no fact in the record,alone or in combination,necessitates a conclusion as a matter of law that adams acted outside the scope of permissive use.in short,we are persuaded that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether adams qualifies as an insured under the policy.we need not make an erie guess 
adams also alleges claims depending on the yet unresolved coverage question therefore,summary judgment is inappropriate as to the claims pursuant to the texas insurance code,the texas deceptive trade practices act,and common law bad faith.additionally,travelers gave only cursory attention to the allegation of fraud in its motion for summary judgment,and the district court memorandum opinion acc
