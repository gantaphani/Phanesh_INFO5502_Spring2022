ii.statement of the case 
hardy,a resident of oklahoma,was a of the concierge of houston,concierge,a texas corporation in the nursing home business.in late,keybank national association keybank,an national banking association,loaned concierge so that concierge could purchase a nursing home in houston,texas that was in foreclosure.in exchange,concierge executed a promissory note for that amount payable to keybank.the note was secured by a deed of trust to the property and was personally guaranteed by hardy.we note that the promissory note,the deed of trust,and the guaranty were each executed and delivered in houston,texas.the note was intended to serve as temporary financing until concierge could secure permanent financing however,concierge never secured permanent financing and keybank accordingly posted the nursing home for foreclosure sale,scheduled for july.
on june,concierge filed for bankruptcy under chapter,staying the scheduled foreclosure.unable to collect on its debt,keybank sold the note,along with its associated guarantees and collateral rights,to int l interests,a texas limited partnership.on july,int l interests filed the present lawsuit against hardy to enforce hardy guarantee,and on july,int l interests moved in bankruptcy court to lift the stay of foreclosure so that it could foreclose on the facility under the deed of trust.the bankruptcy court,after affording concierge time to try to obtain permanent financing or to secure a buyer for the property,granted int l interests motion and allowed the foreclosure to proceed.at the november,foreclosure sale,which was conducted in harris county,texas in accordance with texas law,the ireland limited family partnership ilfp,the sole bidder,purchased the nursing home for.after applying this amount to concierge debt,approximately was still owed on the note 
int l interests brought this lawsuit in the court below to recover the deficiency from hardy pursuant to the guaranty agreement hardy filed a counterclaim,alleging that the facility was sold at foreclosure for less than fair market value and seeking,under section of the texas property code,a determination of the facility fair market value and an offset in that amount from any deficiency judgment int l interests moved for summary judgment,asserting that a provision in the guaranty required that ohio does not provide a deficiency the deficiency action,preventing application of section of the texas property code,and even if texas law governed the deficiency action,hardy in the guaranty waived any right to challenge int l interests actions taken to enforce the guaranty.hardy responded that because the foreclosure was governed by texas law under the deed of trust,texas law also governed the resulting deficiency action he did not waive his right to challenge the actions taken by int l interests to enforce the guaranty even if ohio law governed the deficiency action,int l interests was judicially or equitably estopped from pursuing a deficiency under ohio law because it was seeking attorney fees under texas law and if the court found that ohio law governed the deficiency action,it should grant him a continuance to permit him to raise defenses and counterclaims available under ohio law.
the district court granted int l interests motion for summary judgment and dismissed hardy counterclaim,concluding that ohio law governed the deficiency action,that hardy had no estoppel defense,and that hardy was not entitled to a continuance.specifically,with respect to the choice of law issue,the district court made several determinations.first,the district court determined that the law of the guaranty,not the law of the deed of trust,governed the action because u nder texas law a n action against guarantors of a note for a deficiency following foreclosure on real property is an action involving enforcement of the underlying debt.thus,even if hardy is correct that texas law governs the deed of trust,it is the hardy guaranty,not the deed of trust that creates int l interests right to a deficiency judgment in this case and accordingly the law applicable to the hardy guaranty that governs the deficiency action.int l interests,hardy,no,slip op.at,order granting summary judgment second alteration in original quoting resolution trust northpark joint venture,cir quoting res.sav.ass neary,writ denied and citing first commerce realty investors land,dist,writ ref.the district court then conducted a choice of law analysis under texas law and determined that because the parties could have explicitly agreed,without violating ohio law,that hardy would be liable for the full amount of any deficiency judgment with no right of offset,id.at citing chase manhattan bank,greenbriar section ii,dist,no writ,and because under texas law,hardy could have contractually waived the right of offset provided by section of the texas property code,id.at citing lasalle bank ass sleutel,cir,the ohio choice of law provision in the guaranty agreement between the parties was enforceable.hardy appealed.

the first problem in this case is that the parties arguably agreed that the law of one state,texas,would apply to the deed of trust and that the law of another state,ohio,would apply to the guaranty agreement the fifth circuit has held,interpreting texas law,that because a deficiency action is an action involving enforcement of the underlying debt,the law of the guaranty applies in an action to recover that debt to the exclusion of the law of the deed of trust.resolution trust,at citing res.sav.ass n,at.however,this fif
