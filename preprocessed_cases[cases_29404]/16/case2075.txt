schieffelin,an alcohol distributor,appeals two orders from the district court,in which that court abstained from exercising jurisdiction based on the supreme court decision in louisiana power light thibodaux,d.superior beverage has on the same issue.the district court based its decision on the fact that the litigation is it determined that ohio has a complex regulatory scheme dealing with the distribution of alcohol,and that the amendment grants to the states authority to regulate all matters.for the following reasons,we reverse the order of the district court,and remand for further proceedings.
on march,schieffelin issued letters to superior,goodman,and wines,informing them that it would be terminating their distributorship agreements.this action by schieffelin was pursuant to the alcohol beverage franchise act abfa,specifically,ohio revised code section d,which allows a successor manufacturer who acquires the distributorship rights of another manufacturer to terminate a franchise agreement on march,goodman and wines filed an action against schieffelin,alleging violations of the abfa in the court of common pleas in lorain county.the complaint sought declarative and injunctive relief,as well as monetary damages.the main allegation of the complaint was that schieffelin is not a successor manufacturer under,and thus can not terminate the franchise without just cause.superior filed an action against schieffelin in federal district court on march.superior,goodwin,and wines obtained temporary restraining orders against schieffelin.schieffelin subsequently filed a notice of removal in the wines action to consolidate the proceedings in federal court,and the parties agreed to extend the temporary restraining order until the june,preliminary injunction hearing.
on april,schieffelin sent superior,goodman,and wines letters explaining its decision to terminate the franchise relationships pursuant to d.schieffelin further explained that it had just cause to end the franchise relationship,as is required by ohio statute for all terminations except those instituted under d.in response to this letter,wines and goodman filed a motion for contempt and to extend discovery relating to schieffelin just cause argument.the district court denied the motion for contempt but agreed to extend filing.
additionally,the district court requested briefing on whether abstention might be appropriate in this case.the parties submitted briefs on the issue.on may,the district court ruled that it must abstain from the litigation.the court concluded that probably vested exclusive jurisdiction in the ohio courts,but ultimately based its decision on thibodaux,d.the court remanded the action filed by wines and goodman to the court of common pleas in loraine county,where the suit originated,and dismissed without prejudice the action filed by superior because superior only filed in federal court.this appeal follows.
we have jurisdiction over the district court remand order pursuant to.quackenbush allstate ins,d.there is complete diversity between the parties,and the amount in controversy exceeds.the district court did not reach the merits of this action in part because it determined that federal courts most likely do not have jurisdiction over actions under ohio alcoholic beverages franchise act.
standard of review 
when we review a decision to abstain under thibodaux or burford sun oil,we review that decision de novo.see habich city of dearborn,cir recognizing tension within the circuit regarding the proper level of review,and declaring de novo review the rule of the circuit macdonald village of northport,michigan,cir we review the district court abstention de novo.
abstention 
the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction,and rather abstained based on thibodaux,d.in that eminent domain case,the supreme court held that it was appropriate for a federal district court to stay proceedings pending a state court decision as to whether the city could exercise the power of eminent domain under state law.id.at.the court held that it was proper to stay the action based on abstention because eminent domain is intimately involved with sovereign prerogative.id.at.relying upon thibodaux,the district court abstained from exercising jurisdiction based on its conclusion that this litigation involved matters exclusively controlled by the state,a determination that it based in large part on the amendment.an examination of precedent addressing the import of the amendment suggests that the federal courts will intervene in this area of state prerogative only where the state conduct potentially infringes on other constitutional rights.dist.opn.at.the district court concluded that because it was being asked to employ its powers as a court of equity,it had the authority to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.
abstention in a damages action 
first,despite any discussion regarding the propriety of relying on the amendment to abstain from exercising federal jurisdiction,the district court order to abstain contradicts quackenbush,d.in that case,the supreme court held that a federal court power to abstain derives from the discretion historically enjoyed by courts of equity.id.at.therefore,a federal court discretion to abstain from exercising jurisdiction does not extend so far as to permit a court to dismiss or remand,as opposed to stay,an action at law.id.at.several courts have expressed doubt that,given quackenbush,a federal court can dismiss an action that includes a claim for damages under abstention principles.see yamaha motor,stroud,cir holding that a stay rather than a dismissal is appropriate when monetary damages are sought in addition to injunctive relief and the federal court is not asked to declare a state statute unconstitutional in order to award damages pompey broward county,cir it is doubtful that federal district courts may dismiss claims for damages under abstention principles.
macdonald village of northport,cir,in which we affirmed a district court abstention from an action for damages,is not to the contrary.there,homeowners sued a michigan village and the michigan state treasurer regarding the ownership and land use of a platted street,and sought both equitable relief and damages.id.at.this court affirmed the district court order dismissing the case because the burford abstention doctrine and the eleventh amendment created grounds together to dismiss the case.id.at.the macdonald court explicitly recognized that quackenbush held that a dismissal based on abstention is appropriate only where the relief sought is equitable or otherwise discretionary.id.at.see johnson city of chesapeake,virginia,cir unpublished table decision reading macdonald as consistent with quackenbush prohibition against dismissing damage actions on abstention grounds.given this reasoning,a claim seeking both equitable damages and money damages would not be an appropriate claim for abstention.
in this case,the claim was for both equitable and money damages and,therefore,the district court order dismissing and remanding the instant action constituted an abnegation of judicial duty.thibodaux,at.although the district court concluded that the relief sought by the plaintiffs is effectively equitable in nature,it is not exclusively equitable the plaintiffs explicitly seek declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and damages.in determining whether it had diversity jurisdiction,the district court held that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by all plaintiffs is valued at an amount in excess of.the district court determination that the jurisdictional requirement was met by way of the value of the declaratory and injunctive relief does not detract from the fact that goodman and wines explicitly requested in their complaint in the ohio state court action judgment awarding to plaintiffs any and all reasonable damages suffered by them and proximately caused by the conduct of the defendant in violating the ohio alcoholic beverages franchise act,section,et and the contract between plaintiff and defendant.superior also requested legal and equitable relief in its complaint to the district court.superior,goodman,and all see
