facts and procedure 
on april,kenneth adkins adkins reported a workplace altercation,during which his fellow employee loftis verbally and physically assaulted him and threatened to physically harm his family.adkins did not mention physical contact when he initially described the incident to his ups supervisors and the sheriff.however,when he made a second statement two hours after the incident,adkins alleged physical violence.loftis denied that any threats or physical touching occurred,and the only witness to the incident corroborated loftis denial.
ups security supervisor david cole cole conducted an investigation of the incident for ups and concluded that adkins was being truthful.cole found adkins credible because he had put himself in an awkward position by placing a complaint against a union brother,provided detailed and consistent statements throughout the investigation,and was visibly shaken by the incident.moreover,cole noted that loftis had repeatedly and consistently displayed a violent temper by threatening physical violence and engaging in physical violence against his.loftis was discharged on may.
loftis filed a grievance against ups,alleging that he was terminated without just cause.local sought arbitration on behalf of loftis,maintaining that loftis conduct did not justify summary termination under the collective bargaining agreements governing the relationship between local and the ups.
local and ups are parties to two collective bargaining agreements,the national master agreement and the supplemental agreement for the southern region the agreements.pursuant to these agreements,ups can not terminate an employee for misconduct unless the employee has received a written warning during the nine months preceding the occurrence upon which termination is based.the proposed termination must be upheld in arbitration before the employee is taken off the payroll.however,summary termination is permitted in the absence of such written warning for seven cardinal infractions.see appellant br.at referring to the seven specific offenses as cardinal infractions appellee br.at referring to the same seven offenses as cardinal sin s.for example,ups can summarily terminate an employee who engag es in unprovoked physical violence on company property or while on duty.joint appendix at supplemental agreement.
the arbitration of local grievance focused on whether ups had just cause to discharge loftis under the agreements,either because he committed a cardinal infraction or because he violated a workplace zero tolerance policy.at the arbitration hearing,cole testified that verbal threats violate a zero tolerance policy posted throughout the workplace,but admitted that they were not an enumerated cardinal infraction pursuant to the agreements.at,award.because loftis had not received a written warning during the preceding nine months,the validity of his termination turns on whether the agreements permit summary termination for conduct other than the enumerated cardinal infractions.
the arbitrator concluded that the agreements did not preclude summary termination for unenumerated reasons,and issued an award for ups on january,
conclusion 
the arbitrator must make his decision on the provisions of the agreement and the policy established for a safe and secure work environment 
the zero tolerance policy that the union has no quarrel with and the grievant is familiar with is not to be taken lightly,if his acts and words violated the policy than sic just cause exists even though such acts and words are of a short duration they are extremely serious and length of time is not the determing sic factor.the policy specifically states,verbal threats is part of the workplace violence criteria and is not to be tolerated.a violation of the workplace violence criteria will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
the testimony of the supervisor of security carries great weight as it is his responsibility to investigate matters of this nature in an impartial manner and his recommendations and decisions should not be lightly set aside,unless it can be shown his decision was made in an arbitrary,biased and capricious manner and did not follow the provisions of the agreement or the policy.
based on the evidence of record as a whole the grievant violated the policy by making verbal threats against adkins,therefore under that policy just cause was established and since the decision was not made in an arbitrary,capricious or biased manner the arbitrator should not substitute his judgement for that of the company.the decision to discharge the grievant for just cause was proper.the grievance is denied.
local filed a complaint in the district court,seeking relief from the arbitration award.ups filed an answer and counterclaim,seeking to uphold the arbitration award.in february,both local and ups moved for summary judgment.
after the motions were filed,adkins recanted his testimony to the arbitrator that loftis had physically assaulted him adkins now maintains that loftis only verbally threatened him with physical violence.ups supervisor sherry lewis lewis also submitted an affidavit claiming that adkins did not tell her that loftis physically assaulted him when he first described the incident to her.this contradicts lewis memorandum written on the day of the incident,which said that adkins stated chip another car wash person had kept trying to pull loftice sic off him.when i inguired sic about this he said that loftice had him pinned in a chair.at lewis mem.in light of this new information,local filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award based on ups alleged fraud and sought to amend its complaint to allege ups fraud.
the district court denied local motion for summary judgment,motion to vacate the arbitration award,and motion to amend on september.the district court granted summary judgment for ups in the same order,reasoning that the arbitrator was arguably construing or applying the terms of the agreements and was acting within the scope of his authority.at.quotations omitted.because the verbal threats were the ground for termination,the district court concluded that an examination of the alleged fraud would serve no useful purpose.at.
local filed a motion to alter or amend the district court judgment.the motion was denied,and local filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.alleged fraud 
vacating the arbitration award 
local appeals the district court denial of its motion to vacate the arbitration award in light of ups alleged fraud.when a district court decides to confirm or vacate an arbitration award,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.first options of chicago kaplan,d.under federal law,courts may vacate an arbitration award that was procured by fraud a.courts should be hesitant to do so,however,in order to protect the finality of arbitration decisions.dogherra safeway stores,cir,cert.denied,d.to merit the vacation of the arbitration award,local must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence of fraud,that the fraud materially relates to an issue involved in the arbitration,and that due diligence would not have prompted the discovery of the fraud during or prior to the arbitration.pontiac trail med.clinic,painewebber,wl,at cir.july,forsythe int l gibbs oil,cir bonar dean witter reynolds,cir.because the district court made no findings about whether there was clear and convincing evidence of fraud or whether the alleged fraud was discoverable during or prior to the arbitration,we consider only the district court conclusion that the alleged fraud was not materially related to an issue involved in the arbitration.
this court has not discussed the content of the requirement in the context of vacating an arbitration award.the ninth circuit requires a nexus between the alleged fraud and the basis for the panel decision.forsythe,at.thus,when an arbitrator hears the allegation of fraud and then rests his decision on grounds clearly independent of issues connected to the alleged fraud,the statutory basis for vacatur is absent.id.however,a movant need not establish that the result of the proceedings would have been different had the fraud not occurred.bonar,at.
local maintains that ups committed fraud through cole by coercing adkins to testify falsely that loftis physically assaulted adkins.the arbitrator found that loftis made verbal threats against adkins,but the arbitrator did not find that loftis engaged in physical violence.therefore,in one respect,ups and the district court are correct that any false allegations of physical violence could not have impacted the arbitrator decision to deny loftis grievance.nonetheless,the alleged fraud perpetrated on the arbitrator is clearly connected to an issue material to the arbitration.
the fraud alleged by local may have impacted not only on the arbitrator ultimate decision to grant or deny relief to loftis,but also may have directly affected the arbitrator factual findings.the arbitrator relied heavily on cole testimony 
the testimony of the supervisor of security carries great weight as it is his responsibility to investigate matters of this nature in an impartial manner and his recommendations and decisions should not be lightly set aside,unless it can be shown his decision was made in an arbitrary,biased and capricious manner and did not follow the provisions of the agreement or the policy.
at award.the arbitrator essentially deferred to cole findings,while explicitly conditioning his deference on those findings not being arbitrary,biased,or capricious.if true,local allegations of fraud would demonstrate that cole investigation was both arbitrary and biased because it was less an investigation than an effort to manufacture a story thus,local allegations of fraud were materially related to disputed issues involved in the arbitration.
in spite of the relationship between the alleged fraud and the matters decided in the arbitration,this court can not determine whether the arbitration award should be vacated because the district court made no factual determination about whether local has proved the other elements necessary to vacate an arbitration award for fraud therefore,we remand to the district court to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence of the alleged fraud and whether the alleged fraud was discoverable prior to or during the arbitration.see foster turley,cir remanding fraud issue to district court to assess the evidence under the proper standard because the district court did not state whether the complainant had proven fraud by clear and convincing evidence,nor did the court address whether the complainant could have discovered the fraud prior to the arbitration proceedings by exercising due diligence.
motion to amend 
local also maintains that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing local to amend its complaint by adding a new paragraph to allege fraud 
alternatively,plaintiff avers that the award of the arbitrator was procured by fraud or undue means of the defendant,ups.
at mot.to amend.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,a court should freely give leave to amend a complaint when justice so requires.when a district court denies a plaintiff motion for leave to amend his complaint,we generally review the decision for an abuse of discretion.begala pnc bank,ohio,ass n,cir,cert.denied,d.however,when the district court bases its decision to deny leave to amend on a legal conclusion that amendment would be futile,we review the decision de novo.inge rock fin,cir.
local sought leave to amend its complaint more than one year after the original complaint was filed because it believed amendment was necessary to conform to recently discovered evidence of fraud.the district court denied local motion,reasoning,
arbitrator coleman did not base his award in favor of ups on any finding of physical violence by loftis against adkins.it naturally follows that any alleged fraud in adkins original testimony on this particular issue had no impact whatsoever on the award ultimately entered by arbitrator coleman.any amendment to plaintiff complaint making this allegation would therefore be futile.
at.because the district court cited only one reason for denying local request to review this decision de novo.
for the reasons discussed in part a,supra,we reject the district court reasoning about the futility of amendment.although the arbitrator did not base his award on a finding of physical violence,the alleged fraud may have impacted his decision.we remand to the district court to consider whether there are any other grounds for denying local motion to amend its complaint,such as undue delay or undue prejudice to ups.see foman davis,d recognizing as legitimate grounds for denying a party motion to amend undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,and futility of the amendment.
iii.the collective bargaining agreements 
local argues that the district court erred by deferring to the arbitrator interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.although we have decided to remand this case on other grounds,we address this issue because the district court on remand may decide not to vacate the arbitration award for fraud or to allow local to amend its complaint.because the district court decided to defer to the arbitrator interpretation of the collective bargaining agreements in the context of ruling on a motion for summary judgment,we review the district court determination de novo.burchett kiefer,cir.we conclude that the district court properly deferred to the arbitrator interpretation of the agreements to allow summary termination for conduct other than the seven cardinal infractions.
we apply a narrow standard of review for labor arbitration awards as long as the arbitrator award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,and is not merely his own brand of industrial justice,the award is legitimate.united paperworkers int l union misco,d citation omitted truck drivers,local dayton newspapers,cir,cert.denied,d ap parts uaw,cir t his court is very reluctant to vacate an arbitrator award.we defer to the arbitrator finding of facts and his interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.misco,at.this reflects an explicit policy preference for the private settlement of labor disputes under federal law.see d final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing agreement.
the construction and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements is a job for labor arbitrators and not the federal judiciary.united steel
