the question in this case is whether a chapter debtor right to receive payments under a privately purchased disability insurance policy is fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate under j or partially exempt to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and his dependents under code j.because we can not assume that payments under this type of policy will be limited to amounts reasonably necessary for support,we hold that the payments are partially exempt under j.we therefore affirm the district court order directing the bankruptcy court to determine the debtor living expenses and expenditures so as to permit exemption of only that portion of the payments found reasonably necessary to provide support for the debtor and his dependents.sheehan lincoln life.
on may,raymond morehead had a very bad day.early that morning he received a call from lind waldock company,a brokerage firm that he used for margin trading in the futures markets.lind waldock informed morehead that the market had moved against his open positions and that the firm was making an margin call.when morehead was unable to meet the margin call,lind waldock liquidated his positions and informed him that he owed the firm.see morehead,wl cir per curiam describing morehead dealings with lind waldock in more detail.later that same day morehead was fired from his position as a surgeon at the veterans administration hospital in clarksburg,west virginia.shortly after these events morehead began treatment for drug dependency.his condition proved to be disabling.
morehead and his wife,catherine morehead,filed a voluntary chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of west virginia on june.the bankruptcy trustee,martin sheehan,filed a report of no distribution on july,and the case was closed.the trustee discovered a few months later that morehead was receiving payments of per month under a disability income insurance policy he had purchased from lincoln national life insurance company in.the moreheads had not disclosed this policy in their bankruptcy petition.acting on the trustee motion,the bankruptcy court reopened the moreheads case on february.the trustee promptly filed an adversary proceeding against lincoln national and morehead,seeking an order that would require the defendants to turn over to the bankruptcy estate all past and future payments made under the policy.the moreheads then amended schedules b and c to their bankruptcy petition.they listed the disability policy as an asset but claimed that payments under the policy were fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate under j,which allows debtors to exempt their right to receive a disability,illness or unemployment benefit.the trustee objected to the amendment on two grounds.first,he argued that the amendment should be disallowed because the moreheads failure to disclose the disability policy in their initial bankruptcy filing was a fraudulent effort to conceal an asset.second,the trustee argued that even if the amendment was allowed,the disability payments did not qualify as fully exempt under j rather,they were partially exempt to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor under j.
in an opinion and order dated december,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee objection to the moreheads amended schedules,which included the claim of exemption for the disability policy.the court found that the moreheads had not fraudulently concealed the policy and concluded that payments under the policy were fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate under j.the bankruptcy court then dismissed as moot the trustee adversary proceeding against lincoln national and morehead.the trustee appealed to the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court finding that the moreheads did not fraudulently conceal the disability policy however,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court decision that the disability payments were fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate.sheehan,at.reasoning that full exemption of the disability payments would be inequitable and contrary to bankruptcy policy,the district court held that the disability payments should be partially exempted under j.the district court order remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for a determination of the extent to which the disability payments were and are reasonably necessary for the moreheads support.the moreheads now appeal the district court decision that payments under the lincoln national policy are only partially exempt from the bankruptcy estate.this is a decision on a legal issue,and our review is de novo.in re meyer,cir.
when a debtor files for bankruptcy protection,an estate is created that includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.federal bankruptcy law allows a debtor to exempt some of his basic the bankruptcy estate.the exemptions can afford the debtor some economic and social stability,which is important to the fresh start guaranteed by bankruptcy.see williams fid.guar.west virginia has exercised its option under b to enact its own exemption scheme.as a result,debtors domiciled in west virginia,such as the moreheads,claim exemptions under rather than under the federal bankruptcy code,d.see generally julia chincheck,the effects of west virginia bankruptcy exemption statute on resident debtors.at the time the moreheads filed their bankruptcy petition,the relevant exemption provision in the west virginia code provided that 
any person who files a petition under the federal bankruptcy law may exempt from property of the estate in a bankruptcy proceeding the following property 
j the debtor right to receive 
a social security benefit,unemployment compensation or a local public assistance benefit 
a veterans benefit 
a disability,illness or unemployment benefit 
alimony,support or separate maintenance,to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor 
payment under a stock bonus,pension,profit sharing,annuity or similar plan or contract on account of illness,disability,death,age,or length of service,to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor 
j michie emphasis added.the benefits listed in j are fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate without regard to their amount.in contrast,the payments listed in j are partially exempt in the sense that debtors are entitled to exempt these payments only to the extent that the payments are reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and his dependents.a debtor may,of course,be entitled to exempt the full amount of a payment classified under j or j if the payment does not exceed an amount reasonably necessary for support.
because j is identical to d,we may look to case law interpreting the federal exemptions and similar state exemptions for help in interpreting the west virginia statute.our task is to decide whether payments made under a privately purchased disability insurance policy should be classified as fully exempt disability benefit s under j or partially exempt payment s under a contract on account of disability under j.we have not uncovered any case law discussing the relationship between the two disability exemptions in the west virginia statute,nor have we found case law discussing the analogous provisions in the federal bankruptcy code.only two courts,both outside of our circuit,have discussed the treatment of disability payments under state exemption schemes modeled on the federal code.see in re bari,classifying disability payments from an employer as partially exempt under minnesota exemption modeled on d e sanders sanders,me classifying payments under disability insurance policy as partially exempt under maine exemption modeled on d e.we thus have a case of first impression in this circuit.
both sides in this case believe that j classifies types of disability benefits or payments as fully or partially exempt on the basis of their source,but each side of course argues for a different result.the respective a
