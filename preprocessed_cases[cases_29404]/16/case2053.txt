this is a copyright dispute regarding software for filling out legal forms.lawmode compiled and organized a number of michigan legal forms and,using a program,created templates for filling out the forms.after marketing lawmode product for five years,lexis terminated its contract with lawmode and proceeded to compile,create,and market its own set of michigan form templates.lawmode sued lexis for copyright violation and contract breach.we affirm the district court judgment dismissing lawmode copyright claims against lexis.first,while lawmode has a valid copyright in both the selection of forms in its compilation and the organization of those forms,the copyrighted work is not substantially similar to the allegedly infringing lexis product.second,lawmode selection and placement of input items for its form templates involves too little creativity to warrant copyright protection,and lexis consequently did not commit copyright infringement in this regard.however,we reverse the district court dismissal of lawmode claim pursuant to a motion for judgment on the pleadings because lawmode stated a claim for breach of contract.
background 
doing business as lawmode,the firm of ross,brovins oehmke,entered an agreement with lexis to create and market a system of automated michigan legal forms.lawmode entered a contract with lexis in,later modified in,which required lawmode to create various templates for filling in the required information for selected michigan legal forms.lawmode also organized those templates into a software program.this program allowed users to keyboard data into a series of dialog boxes.users save the information entered into the dialog boxes into a data file,and the program automatically inserts the information into corresponding data fields on legal forms.most of the actual forms were forms approved by the michigan state court administrative office scao,and therefore in the public domain.
the advantage of lawmode templates was that information from one form could be easily transferred to another form as the case progressed.this eliminated the need for retyping.the product contained individual forms.while most of the forms were scao forms,lawmode independently created some of its own forms.this case pertains only to the automation of the scao forms because lawmode does not allege that lexis copied any of its independently created forms.
under the agreement,lawmode promised to supply and update form templates using lexis proprietary software called hotdocs pro.these templates were defined in the agreement as content.lexis would then publish those templates in the finished product,which was a cd or software available for download over the internet.the agreement defined the packaged cd or download as product.during,lexis paid lawmode in royalties for sales of product.
pursuant to the terms of the agreement,lexis terminated its contract with lawmode in february of.after the contract was terminated,lawmode was to retain all ownership of content,defined as hotdocs templates created by lawmode.on june,lawmode registered a copyright for its templates.starting in july,lexis published its own version of the product called lexisnexis automated scao forms the lexis product.the lexis product contained scao forms.three hundred fifty of the forms that lawmode had selected also appear in lexis work.
lexis claims that the templates contained in the lexis product were created independently of lawmode.lawmode argues that lexis copied their templates,defined as content in the agreement.it is undisputed that lexis had access to content,and lawmode argues that an internal memorandum encouraged lexis programmers to look at the lawmode content when creating templates in the lexis product.the memo said,ignore any and all markup automation from former michigan projects,lawmode content unless you are really confused about something.lawmode also submitted a presentation that details similarities between lawmode templates and those in the lexis product.lawmode argues that the appearance of the lawmode templates and the appearance of the templates in the lexis product are nearly identical.
lawmode filed a complaint against lexis,alleging claims for copyright infringement,claims for breach of contract,and various claims alleging business torts.after filing the complaint,lawmode voluntarily dismissed its claims for unjust enrichment,unfair competition,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and most of its claims.the remaining claims included a copyright claim and a claim.lawmode alleges that lexis infringed a compilation copyright,a copyright in the organization and selection of forms and a copyright in the automating of the forms,creative choices in how the screen looks and how the variables are.the contract claim was for an alleged breach of lexis promise not to misappropriate lawmode content and not to continue to distribute content after the termination of the agreement.
after discovery,lexis moved for summary judgment.lexis argued that the templates were not protected by copyright,and,in the alternative,that lexis did not copy them.in addition,lexis argued that the contract claim did not meet the jurisdictional requirement,that the claim was preempted by copyright law,and that the complaint did not state that lexis breached the agreement.in a december,order,the district court granted summary judgment for lexis on the copyright claim but denied summary judgment on the contract claim.the district court reasoned that lawmode compilation of forms was copyrightable but that lexis did not copy the compilation.the district court held that the organization of the forms,the look of the screen,and the interrelationship of the variables were not copyrightable.the district court denied all three of lexis grounds for dismissing the contract claims.first,the district court held that the contract claim exceeded the jurisdictional minimum and that there was supplemental jurisdiction over it.second,the district court held that the contract claim was not preempted by the copyright act because the existence of a contract is an additional element not required for a copyright claim.third,the district court found that the contract supported lawmode assertion that lexis breached the contract,as stated in paragraph.b of the complaint,by misappropriat ing lawmode content.thus,one contract claim survived summary judgment.
lexis then filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying summary judgment on the contract claim in paragraph.b of the complaint,arguing that the district court did not specify any contractual promise that would support a finding of breach of contract.on december,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on the ground that a party is not permitted to raise,in a motion for reconsideration,new legal arguments that could have been raised in the initial summary judgment motion.lexis does not challenge that order on appeal.
lexis then made the same argument in a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.the district court applied the standard for judgment on the pleadings,which is the same as the standard for a motion under rule b.the district court reasoned that,on its face,the agreement does not contain a promise that lexis will not misappropriate lawmode templates.thus,the district court dismissed lawmode remaining contract claim and dismissed the case.
lawmode filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.copyright 
lawmode templates are a compilation protected by copyright,but,even taking the facts in the light most favorable to lawmode,lexis did not infringe that copyright.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d describing the summary judgment standard.a compilation is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials that are selected,coordinated or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.the selection and categorization of the forms are protectable elements of the work.although the collection and categorization of the forms are protected by copyright,the district court properly dismissed those claims because lexis product is not substantially similar to lawmode collection and categorization.lawmode also claims that the computer programming that created the interrelation of the variables in the templates is protected.on the facts of this case,however,these items are not copyrightable because they exhibit too little creativity.
lawmode selection of forms 
while lawmode selection of forms is sufficiently creative to warrant copyright protection,lawmode and lexis selections are not similar enough to constitute copying.the two elements for copyright infringement are ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of that expression.see stromback new line cinema,cir.the first element is met but the second is not.
lexis did not copy any protectable elements of lawmode compilation.id.at holding that the substantial similarity inquiry requires the court to look at protectable elements of the plaintiff work and determine whether the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the protectable elements.this conclusion is compelled by the differences between lawmode and lexis compilations.the differences show that lexis used sufficient judgment and creativity to compel a reasonable fact finder to conclude that one compilation is not a copy of the other.our conclusion in this regard is supported by two related considerations.first,lexis did not include a sufficiently large percentage of the same forms to permit a finding of copying.second,nonquantitative aspects of the two compilations support the conclusion that lexis created a new work rather than a copy of lawmode.
the percentage of forms in lawmode compilation that may be found in lexis compilation is not particularly high.lawmode asserts that its compilation contains forms and lexis compilation contains forms.according to lawmode,of the forms in the lexis compilation also appeared in lawmode compilation.thus,lexis compilation included,or out of,of lawmode form selection 
in feist the supreme court indicated that notwithstanding a valid copyright,a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in an author publication to aid in preparing a competing work,so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement.feist,at.emphasis added.subsequent cases have interpreted feist to mean that compilation copyright protection is very limited and usually requires substantial verbatim copying.key pub ns chinatown today,cir.percent can hardly be considered the same selection.see,schoolhouse anderson,cir holding that a ratio of percent of the same items was not substantial similarity in light of feist.
to be sure,in eckes card prices update,cir,the second circuit found that a directory that copied out of of plaintiff baseball card listings constituted copyright infringement.but in that case the defendant copied all of plaintiff listings of premium cards.thus,the relevant percentage was more like.this is not a case where lexis replicated a discrete portion of lawmode work in its entirety.
the eckes case shows that careful attention must be paid to the nature of the creative expression that has allegedly been copied,and that sheer numbers out of context can be misleading.in this case,the nature of the material used by lexis shows that there was no copying as a matter of law.the two works are so dissimilar in expression that reasonable minds could not differ as to the absence of substantial similarity.see stromback,at see also schoolhouse,at basing its decision on the response that a reasonable person would have toward the two works.it is undisputed that lexis made the decision to add at least forms to its database.it is also undisputed that lexis chose not to include various forms used by lawmode in its compilation.the professional judgment used in selecting forms that gave lawmode copyright protection also gives lexis protection from lawmode allegation of infringement.
lawmode arrangement of forms 
lexis arrangement and classification of the forms are also not sufficiently similar to lawmode to constitute a copyright violation,even assuming that there is sufficient originality to warrant copyright protection 
because lexis classification system is not substantially similar to lawmode classification system,it is not necessary to rely on lexis argument that lawmode arrangement of forms is not copyrightable.again,lawmode must provide sufficient evidence to show substantial similarity between its arrangement of the forms and lexis arrangement.see feist,at.while there are some similarities,they result from both parties copying the public michigan forms index.lexis did not copy lawmode original classification or arrangement.
many of lawmode table of contents headings are not original.the website with all forms already groups forms under headings like alternative dispute resolution,corporate or landlord tenant.lawmode can not claim creative expression when it used the same obvious classification headings as the michigan classification because those classifications are not original.see kregos associated press,cir holding that arrangements following conventions that have been used before are not copyrightable.
the original classification headings are not copied and,as a whole,lexis and lawmode classification systems are not substantially similar.lawmode original work can be seen in classifications like concealed weapon license or land contract forfeiture.those original classifications are not used by the michigan classification.lexis did not copy the nonobvious and classifications in its table of contents.thus,there has been no copying of lawmode creative expression.this conclusion is supported by the second circuit reasoning in key publications,at,where the second circuit held that the arrangements of two directories were not substantially similar because a consumer faced with the two directories would instantly realize that they were different.just as in key publications,a reasonable fact finder is compelled to conclude that lawmode and lexis classification headings are not substantially similar.
in sum,the district court properly granted summary judgment on the claim because there was not sufficient evidence of copying of lawmode protectable expression.
lawmode automation of the forms 
lawmode automation is not sufficiently original to warrant copyright protection.by automation we here mean the selection and placement of input fields for the form templates such that the desired information appears in the proper places on the scao forms.this copyright claim has two parts.first,lawmode claims that lexis copied the appearance of the dialog boxes where a user enters information.lawmode does not have a valid copyright in the appearance of the dialog boxes because lawmode used the default settings on hotdocs,the tool used to create the templates.choosing the default setting on an underlying authoring tool is not sufficiently creative to warrant copyright protection.second,lawmode claims that lexis copied the automation by copying the interrelationship of variables in the program.lawmode automation is not sufficiently creative to support a copyright because the choices that can be made to create templates to automate the scao forms are very limited.in fact,the choices are limited by the express dictates of the forms themselves.thus,there is not enough originality in the automation to support a copyright.
the appearance of dialog boxes 
copyright law does not afford lawmode protection for the appearance of the dialog boxes because the appearance is not sufficiently original.the appearance is largely a result of the default settings on hotdocs,the template authoring tool.
lawmode and lexis dialog boxes look very similar,such that a user who looked at lawmode and lexis dialog boxes would have a hard time telling the two products apart.both of the dialog boxes are rectangular and have a header.the area in between text boxes is gray and the fonts are the same.in the table of contents,folders are displayed next to an icon that looks like a manila legal folder.the icon that lets a user close a dialog box is a large red x and the help icon is a blue question mark.these similarities result from both lexis a
