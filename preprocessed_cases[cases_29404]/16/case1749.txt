the district court granted chembulk motion for summary judgment,and novorossiysk appeals.for the following reasons,we reverse.
background 
on may,novorossiysk shipping novorossiysk entered into a with chemex chemex to charter its ship,the tuapse,to chemex.the party granted novorossiysk a lien on all cargoes and all freights for any amounts due under this charter.on august,chemex entered into a with westway trading westway to subcharter the tuapse to westway.in return,westway was to pay chemex freight,ten percent of which was payable at the end of the voyage.in a separate transaction on august,chembulk trading,chembulk the chembulk clipper to chemex.chemex failed to pay both the full amount of hire and demurrage it owed novorossiysk and the freight and demurrage it owed chembulk.
on october,novorossiysk faxed a notice to westway stating that it was exercising its right to a lien on all freight and pursuant to the party.novorossiysk requested that westway remit the remaining balance of freight the westway freight,which westway had not yet paid to chemex,directly to novorossiysk.on october,chembulk sought a writ of maritime attachment and garnishment against the westway freight pursuant to rule b of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims.on october,novorossiysk also sought a writ of maritime attachment and garnishment against the westway freight.
both the chembulk and novorossiysk attachment suits were consolidated.westway then filed a complaint for interpleader,whereupon the district court consolidated all three suits.the district court granted westway leave to deposit the full amount of the westway freight into the court registry,discharged it from the lawsuit,and relieved it of all claims regarding that amount.
on january,chembulk moved to stay the consolidated proceedings pending arbitration of its claim against chemex in accordance with an arbitration clause in the voyage charter.novorossiysk opposed chembulk motion and for summary judgment,alleging that its status gave it priority over chembulk rule b attachment.in response,chembulk also moved for summary judgment,arguing that novorossiysk did not have a maritime lien but was merely a rule b claimant whose claim was preempted by chembulk earlier rule b attachment.further,chembulk argued that even if novorossiysk did have a lien,it could not assert priority in an in personam rule b attachment proceeding since maritime liens can only be asserted in in rem proceedings.subsequently,the district court granted novorossiysk leave to amend its complaint to add an in rem claim to the westway freight under rule c of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims.
on february,chemex and its managing agent,brookwater relinquished all rights to the westway freight.based on that,the district court dismissed as moot chembulk motion to stay pending arbitration.therefore,the sole issue before the court was whether novorossiysk or chembulk was entitled to the westway,whether novorossiysk had a maritime lien on the westway freight giving it priority over chembulk rule b attachment.on march,the district court initially denied both parties motions for summary judgment so that chembulk could respond to novorossiysk in rem claim.however,the parties asked the court to decide the motion on the existing record.
on may,the district court granted chembulk motion for summary judgment.the district court found as a matter of law that the westway freight was properly characterized as subfreights rather than freights because it represented the amount that westway a third party of the tuapse agreed to pay chemex for the shipment of cargo.chembulk trading chemex,amc,wl.consequently,the district court concluded that the party did not give novorossiysk a maritime lien over the westway freight because it provided a lien on all freights and not subfreights.the district court thus treated the case as that of two competing rule b attachments and,accordingly,held that chembulk had priority since it was the first to attach the westway freight.
on june,the district court stayed the disbursement of the westway freight pending appeal.the issue before us on appeal is whether the language in the time charter provided novorossiysk with a valid maritime lien over the westway freight defeating chembulk rule b attachment.
ii.discussion 
introduction 
the district court holding would certainly encourage precision in drafting charter parties.indeed,had the charter at hand specifically used the term subfreights,this whole litigation could have been avoided.however,while the district court reasoning seems logical,in the absence of any meaningful evidence that the terms freights and subfreights are legally,or by custom and usage,mutually exclusive,we are bound by principles of contract interpretation under federal maritime law.we therefore hold that the district court interpretation of the all freights language in the time charter was erroneous as a matter of law.

under general principles of maritime law,claimants with maritime liens are entitled to preference and priority over attaching creditors.triton container int l,baltic shipping,amc,wl.as between two rule b attaching creditors,however,the first to attach has priority.id.at.therefore,as the district court noted,if novorossiysk has a valid maritime lien over the westway freight,its claim takes priority over chembulk rule b attachment.if novorossiysk does not have a lien,then chembulk claim takes priority because chembulk was the first attaching creditor.
shipowners,as a general rule,have a lien upon the cargo owned by the charterer for compensation not yet paid.see bird of paradise,wall.arochem wilomi,cir.accordingly,novorossiysk would traditionally have a lien on any cargo owned by chemex for any hire or demurrage chemex owed to novorossiysk.in contrast,when the cargo is not owned by the charterer,a shipowner generally does not have a lien on the cargo.see finora,amitie shipping,cir.the charter between the shipowner and the charterer,however,may provide for a lien on any freights owed by the cargo owner to the charterer.id.indeed,t wo general conditions are necessary for a shipowner to maintain a lien against such a third person.first,the shipowner must have a contractual right to assert the lien second,the shipowner must properly perfect the lien.biehl,apollonia holding,accord toro shipping veneer,cir.novorossiysk states,and chembulk does not dispute,that novorossiysk perfected whatever lien rights it had by faxing notice of its lien to westway on october,we therefore turn to whether novorossiysk had a contractual right to assert a lien against the westway freight.
a shipowner contractual right to assert a lien against freight owed by a third party arises by an express provision in the charter party granting the shipowner a lien on such freight.marine traders,seasons navigation,cir.the lien provision,as it appears in most form charters,is usually phrased as the owners meaning the owners of the vessel shall have a lien upon all cargoes and all subfreight for charter money due under this charter.am.steel barge chesapeake coal agency,cir emphasis added alteration in original see also united states freights,of mount shasta.toro shipping,at cornish shipping int l nederlanden bank,cir.on the other hand,the lien clause in the time charter provides that o wners shall have a lien upon all cargoes and all freights for any amounts due under this charter.emphasis added.the issue before
