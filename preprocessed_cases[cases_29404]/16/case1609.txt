background 
during amschwand medical leave for a bout with cancer that he did not survive,his employer spherion switched insurance companies,replacing prudential with aetna life insurance company aetna as the new provider of basic and supplemental life insurance benefits under the company plan.a special provision of aetna group insurance policy covering spherion employees was entitled the active work rule and provided 
if the employee is ill or injured and away from work on the date any of his or her employee coverage or any increase in such coverage would become effective,the effective date of coverage or increase will be held up until the date he or she goes back to work for one full day.
this provision was expressly noted in the summary of coverage aetna prepared for spherion employees as part of the transition to the new policy,aetna and spherion agreed that the active work rule requirement would be waived for employees like amschwand,who were not currently working due to a medical condition that antedated the switch from prudential to aetna.for reasons spherion has failed to explain,however,amschwand was not among those who received coverage despite being on disability leave when the policy took effect on may.unlike other similarly situated employees,amschwand never received a waiver and,unbeknownst to him,he remained subject to the active work rule.
spherion,an erisa fiduciary and plan administrator,notified its employees that they could elect to participate in the aetna plan during an open enrollment period,which commenced in march.amschwand duly enrolled and was informed by spherion that he could maintain his existing basic coverage and his level of supplemental coverage under the policy.on november,a representative of spherion human resources department orally confirmed to amschwand that all of his life insurance was convertible under the policy and that he remained eligible for all benefits.
as his condition deteriorated,amschwand repeatedly contacted spherion to confirm that he was fully covered under the aetna policy.each time,spherion representatives failed to mention the active work rule requirement and incorrectly assured him that the full spectrum of coverage he enjoyed under the plan remained valid.moreover,in spite of the amschwands repeated oral requests for documentation of the policy terms and the corresponding summary of coverage,spherion either maintained that informational booklets were not yet available for employees,or simply failed to provide any paperwork describing the conditions of the policy.believing himself covered,amschwand timely paid the basic and supplemental life insurance premiums while on disability leave until his death in february.amschwand diligently sought to ensure that his wife would be provided for under the plan.both parties agree,however,that spherion never informed him that in order for the policy to take effect he was required to return to work for at least one full day.
shortly after her husband death,amschwand filed a claim with aetna only to be informed that because her husband had not satisfied the active work rule,he was ineligible for benefits under the policy.after being denied recovery in aetna administrative appeals process,amschwand filed suit seeking relief under erisa a in the form of monetary losses caused by the spherion defendants breach of fiduciary duty.that is,amschwand sought the equivalent of the combined life insurance benefits that she would have received if her husband had complied with the active work rule.spherion refunded the premium payments but maintained that the additional demand for money damages did not constitute appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of subsection a.the district court agreed,granting summary judgment for spherion.the court also dismissed as moot a complaint filed by aetna.amschwand appeals.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews the district court grant de novo,applying the same standard used below.chacko sabre,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
section a allows a plan participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to obtain,inter alia,appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms or to remedy violations of an plan.the scope and nature of relief available to aggrieved parties under this statutory provision has been circumscribed by a line of supreme court decisions beginning with mertens hewitt associates,d.analyzing the remedies that were historically available in courts of equity,the court in mertens held that a did not authorize a suit for monetary damages against a nonfiduciary that participated in the plan fiduciary breach of duty.despite the fact that monetary damages were among the remedies historically granted by equity courts in actions brought by a beneficiary against a trustee,the court reasoned that consequential damages were a legal rather than equitable remedy and denied relief.id.at.at.justice scalia supported this conclusion by acknowledging that in trust disputes a court sitting in equity could routinely establish purely legal rights and grant legal remedies otherwise beyond its equitable jurisdiction.id.at.at see also george gleason bogert george taylor bogert,the law of trusts and trustees,ed.congress use of the term equitable in subsection a,therefore,was construed to encompass only categories of relief typically available in equity,like injunction,mandamus,or restitution.id.at.at.had congress intended subsection a to authorize the panoply of legal remedies sometimes awarded by equity courts,the term equitable would become superfluous.id.at.at see also larue dewolff,boberg,cir,cert.granted,d.e quitable relief connotes only a subset of the full palliative spectrum.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.money damages,mertens concluded,were the classic form of legal relief and thus not a typically equitable remedy available under a.at.at 
the spectrum of a relief contracted further in life annuity insurance knudson,d,a nonfiduciary insurance company,sought an injunction for money damages as restitution against a plan beneficiary,who had violated the plan subrogation clause by failing to reimburse for his tort recovery in a lawsuit.although restitution was mentioned in mertens as typically equitable,relief,justice scalia clarified in that not all relief falling under the rubric of restitution is available in equity.at.at.the crucial distinction between two historical species of restitution is that equitable restitution seeks only to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession,while legal restitution imposed personal liability for breach of a legal duty.ultimately reaffirms the mertens requirement that the nature of the relief sought under a be typically equitable it adds a second requirement that the cause of action giving rise to the claim be generically equitable as well.desired relief was not equitable within this interpretation of a because under california law a constructive trust or equitable lien can not be established over funds or property not within a defendant control.
the freshest of mertens progeny,sereboff mid atlantic medical services,d,reinforces the equity test.in sereboff,an injured beneficiary who recovered a tort settlement was sued by the plan fiduciary to recoup medical expenses it had paid on the beneficiary behalf.but in contrast to,the sereboff beneficiaries retained possession and control of the particular settlement funds that the fiduciary sought.accordingly,the supreme court held that the relief sought by the fiduc
