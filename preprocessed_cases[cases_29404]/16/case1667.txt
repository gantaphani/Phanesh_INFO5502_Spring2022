in this interpleader insurance action,kenneth lay and jeffrey skilling appeal the district court denial of their motion to compel arbitration and to stay the interpleader action pending arbitration pursuant to.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the fiduciary liability policies 
this dispute centers around the interpretation of two fiduciary liability insurance policies issued by associated electric gas insurance services,aegis,and federal insurance federal collectively,the insurers to enron corporation enron.for the sake of clarity,a brief overview of the policies and the specific provisions at issue is necessary before reviewing the procedural history of the lawsuit and settlement that underlie this appeal.
the primary policy 
aegis issued to enron its primary liability insurance policy,a fiduciary and employee benefit liability insurance policy with an aggregate limit of million,for the period of may,to may,the primary policy.in addition to the million limit,the primary policy also includes a defense costs coverage endorsement to be paid out before the million liability limit to cover the defense costs of the insureds up to million.the primary policy defines the following as insured enron,the employee benefit programs,and any past,present or future trustee,officer,director or employee of enron or the employee benefit program or any fiduciaries or administrators of the benefit program.see at.all parties acknowledge that,as a former director of enron and enron former chief executive officer,kenneth lay lay qualifies as an insured under the policy likewise,they acknowledge that jeffrey skilling skilling qualifies as an insured,having been a former director of enron and enron former chief financial officer and chief executive officer.
the excess policy 
for the same period,federal issued to enron an excess fiduciary policy the excess policy with an aggregate limit of million in excess of the primary policy million limit.the excess policy includes an endorsement that generally incorporates the terms and conditions set forth in the primary policy,including the dispute resolution provisions.see at.
the arbitration clause 
section iv t of the primary policy,titled dispute resolution and service of suit,provides both and binding procedures for settling policy disputes.see at.sections iv t and iv t,titled negotiation and mediation respectively,provide for dispute resolution procedures that must occur before binding arbitration.see id.once the negotiation and mediation processes are exhausted and binding arbitration is invoked,the parties involved in the dispute must follow the specific binding arbitration procedures set forth in section iv t the arbitration clause.see at.the preamble to the arbitration clause states 
any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this policy,or the breach,termination or validity thereof,which has not been resolved by means as provided herein within ninety days of the initiation of such procedure,shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the cpr institute rules for arbitration of business disputes the cpr rules by three independent and impartial arbitrators.
directly following this language,the remainder of the clause sets out specific procedures that the sponsor organization and the company must follow in the event that binding arbitration becomes necessary.under section ii e and p of the primary policy,the sponsor organization is defined as enron,and the company is defined as aegis see at.the arbitration clause specifies that,once binding arbitration has been invoked pursuant to the procedures set forth in section iv t,
t he sponsor organization and the company each shall appoint one arbitrator the third arbitrator,who shall serve as the chair of the arbitration panel,shall be appointed in accordance with the cpr rules.if either the sponsor organization or the company has requested the other to participate in a procedure and the other has failed to participate,the requesting party may initiate arbitration before expiration of the above period.the arbitration shall be governed by the united states arbitration act,et seg.sic,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.the terms of this policy are to be construed in an evenhanded fashion as between the sponsor organization and the company in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the situation forming the basis for the controversy arose.where the language of this policy is deemed to be ambiguous or otherwise unclear,the issue shall be resolved in a manner most consistent with the relevant terms of this policy without regard to authorship of the language and without any presumption or arbitrary interpretation or construction in favor of either the sponsor organization or the company 
in the event of a judgment being entered against the company on an arbitration award,the company at the request of the sponsor organization,shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the united states of america,and shall comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction and all matters relating to such judgment and its enforcement shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice of such court.
procedural history 
the lawsuit underlying this appeal is a class action breach of fiduciary duty suit,tittle enron,no,brought in against enron and its board of directors by various former employees of enron the tittle plaintiffs,alleging breach of fiduciary duties associated with enron collapse in violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the secretary of labor subsequently filed a similar action,chao enron,which was consolidated into the tittle class action.many of the defendants to this class action,including lay and skilling,submitted claims for coverage of their defense costs under the primary policy.the insurers began paying these claims to the defendants to the class action,including lay and skilling,out of the million defense costs coverage endorsement as provided by the primary policy.
on april,a subset of defendants to the tittle class action the settling defendants reached a proposed settlement agreement with the tittle plaintiffs and the department of labor the partial settlement,requiring that the insurers pay the entire combined million policy liability limits to the tittle plaintiffs.see at.the settling defendants did not include lay,skilling,or enron.the partial settlement did not affect the million defense costs coverage endorsement,which at the time was still available to the defendants,including lay and skilling.
on may,in response to the growing prospect of litigation over competing claims to the policy proceeds that was likely to arise as a result of the partial settlement,and because the partial settlement would exhaust the combined policy limits if consummated,the insurers moved to intervene in the tittle action and filed a complaint in the nature of interpleader interpleader complaint pursuant to fed.civ.to determine the proper distribution of the million in policy proceeds see at.the interpleader complaint named as interpleader defendants many of the parties who had submitted or could potentially submit claims against the policies,including the settling defendants,enron and lay and skilling.see at.over opposition from lay and skilling,the district court granted the insurers motion to intervene and subsequently granted the insurers permission to tender the entire million in policy proceeds to the district court.see at.the insurers deposited the funds with the court,reserving in the interpleader complaint their right to recover proceeds to the extent that the funds are not ultimately required to resolve covered claims.at.
on september,various of the interpleader defendants filed answers to the interpleader complaint,asserting their claims to the policy proceeds.see generally specifically,lay and skilling each filed an answer asserting his right to the payment of all attorneys fees and legal costs incurred in their defense of claims asserted against them in the tittle litigation.see at.additionally,they demanded that an equitable share of the policies proceeds be held in reserve to provide them coverage against a possible judgment or settlement in that litigation.id.on the same day,along with his answer,skilling filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the interpleader action arbitration motion pursuant to sections and of the federal arbitration act faa,asserting that resolution of the interpleader defendants competing claims to the policy proceeds is governed by the primary policy arbitration clause,which requires that any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to the policies be resolved by binding arbitration.see at.also on september,lay filed a motion to join skilling arbitration motion.see at.lay and skilling were the only interpleader defendants to request arbitration.
c.the district court memorandum and order 
the district court granted lay motion to join skilling arbitration motion but denied the arbitration motion itself in a memorandum and order dated march.in re enron,derivative erisa litigation,no.march,hereinafter dist.order.based on its review of the policy language,the district court held that the dispute at it characterized as a disagreement among the various insureds over the allocation of the million in policy proceeds that the insurers agreed to pay not an arbitrable dispute because the parties to the policy did not agree to arbitrate a dispute in the nature of the one in question.as an initial matter,the district court found that the arbitration clause applies only to any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to the policy,and a settlement within the policy limits between the insurer and the insureds means that there is no controversy or dispute.dist.order at.further,the district court found that there can be no arbitrable controversy or dispute within the scope of the arbitration clause in this case because a reading of both policies in their entirety reveals that the arbitration clause was meant to apply only to disputes over coverage between the insureds and the insurers.because the insurers agreed to pay out the entire million policy limit,tendered the proceeds to the district court,and proclaimed their neutrality as to the allocation of the proceeds,they no longer have an interest in the million therefore,there is not a dispute between the insureds and the insurers,only a dispute among the various insureds.dist.order at.finally,the district court noted that texas law governing insurance settlements supports its conclusion that no arbitrable dispute exists 
under texas law,an insurer stowers duty to settle a claim against its insured is triggered by a settlement demand if the claim against the insured is within the policy scope of coverage,if the demand is within the limits of the policy,and if the terms of the demand are such that an ordinarily prudent insurer would accept it considering the likelihood and extent of the insured potential exposure to an excess judgment.state farm lloyds ins.maldonado.moreover,an insurer does not have to provide funds for all its insureds before exhausting policy limits.see,travelers indemnity citgo petroleum,cir 
on april,lay and skilling filed their timely notice of appeal from the denial of their arbitration motion with this court.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over the underlying erisa action in this case under e and.it accordingly asserted supplemental jurisdiction over the insurers related.interpleader action pursuant to a.
because the district court denied lay and skilling arbitration motion,which asked the court to stay the proceeding and compel arbitration under,this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a a,b,which provides that a n appeal may be taken from an order refusing a stay of any action under section of this title,or an order denying a petition under section of this title to order arbitration to proceed 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration under.see primerica life ins.brown,cir webb,cir.we also review de novo a denial of a motion to stay a proceeding pending arbitration.see harvey joyce,cir 
the supreme court has enunciated four general principles applicable to determining arbitrability that guide our consideration of the arbitration clause at issue in this case.first,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit,commc ns workers of,d quoting steelworkers warrior gulf nav,d.second,given that arbitrators derive their authority from an agreement between the parties to arbitrate,the question of arbitrability is undeniably an issue for judicial determination.unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator,at.quoting warrior gulf,at.third,in deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration,a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims,at.see also prima paint flood conklin,d primerica,at.and finally,where the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability,at.see also primerica,at citing southland keating,d.such a presumption means that,i n determining whether the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement,ambiguities are resolved in favor of arbitration.fleetwood,gaskamp,cir quoting volt info.sciences,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.
when considering a motion to compel arbitration under the faa a court employs a analysis.first,a court must determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question.webb,at see also mitsubishi motors soler,d.second,a court must determine whether legal constraints external to the parties agreement foreclosed the arbitration of those claims.mitsubishi motors,at.because no party has argued that external legal constraints have foreclosed the arbitration of the claims at issue in this case,we need only conduct the first step of the analysis to resolve the arbitrability question.
the first step of the the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in of two separate determinations whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement.webb,at citing daisy ncr,cir see also pennzoil exploration prod.ramco energy,cir.because no party challenges the validity of the policies or of the arbitration clause,the only issue in this case is whether the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.this question,in turn,will require this court to consider the two major areas of contention in this scope of the arbitration clause itself and the nature of the dispute at issue.
scope of the arbitration clause 
lay and skilling argue that the language of the arbitration clause should be construed broadly to include disputes between the insurers and insureds as well as disputes among the insureds themselves.they assert that the arbitration clause applies to a ny controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this policy,without explicitly limiting its application to disputes between certain parties.
in contrast,the settling defendants and the insurers argue that the arbitration clause applies only to disputes between the insurer and the parties defined as insureds under the policies.they note that lay and skilling quote only the preamble to the arbitration clause in their brief,focusing on the arising out of or relating to language to the exclusion of the remainder of the arbitration clause and the rest of the language in section iv t of the primary policy.the settling defendants argue that reading the arising out of or relating to language in the context of these provisions,which refer only to the sponsor organization,enron and the company,the insurers,necessarily means that the arbitration clause applies only to disputes between enron or the other insureds for whom enron serves as the sponsor organization and the insurers,not to disputes among the insureds themselves under circumstances where there is no dispute with an insurer.
to determine the scope of the arbitration clause at issue in this case,this court must apply texas rules of contract interpretation.see washington mut.fin.group bailey,cir i n determining whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter,courts apply the contract law of the particular state that governs the agreement.harvey,at applying contract principles webb,at c ourts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.quoting first options of chicago,kaplan,d.under texas law a court construing a contract must read that contract in a manner that confers meaning to all of its terms,rendering the contract terms consistent with one another.see fdic.bank,cir coker coker,see also sas,breitenfeld,union fire ins.of pittsburgh cbi.in doing so,courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless no single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect rather,all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.coker,at.
applying these principles to the insurance policies at hand,we agree with the settling defendants and the district court that the scope of the arbitration clause is limited only to disputes,arising out of or related to the policies,that include an insurer and one or more insureds.the arbitration clause itself,located in section iv t of the primary policy,must be read in context with the other provisions of the contract,in particular the entirety of section iv t,which governs dispute resolution and service of suit.the subsections directly preceding the arbitration clause set out a number of dispute resolution procedures that must be invoked by either enron or the insurers before binding arbitration can occur.the language of these provisions,which references only enron and the insurers,indicates that these procedures apply only to situations where there is a dispute with an insurer.for instance,section iv t,a provision addressing negotiation,provides that 
t he sponsor organization and the company shall attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this policy promptly by negotiations between executives who have authority to settle the controversy within thirty days after delivery of the disputing party notice,the executives of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place,and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary,to attempt to resolve the dispute.
at emphasis added.
moreover,while the preamble to the arbitration clause itself uses the phrase arising out of or related to,language which the supreme court has acknowledged can sweep broadly in scope,see prima paint,at,the breadth of that scope is limited by the language in the remainder of the provision.indeed,the very procedures that the arbitration clause requires enron and the insurers to follow once binding arbitration has been invoked would be logical only in the case of a dispute where an insurer is adverse to one or more of the insureds.for example,directly following the arising out of or related to language,the arbitration clause instructs that,upon the initiation of binding arbitration,
t he sponsor organization and the company each shall appoint one arbitrator the third arbitrator,who shall serve as the chair of the arbitration panel,shall be appointed in accordance with the cpr rules.if either the sponsor organization or the company has requested the other to participate in a procedure and the other has failed to participate,the requesting party may initiate arbitration before expiration of the above period.
the terms of this policy are to be construed in an evenhanded fashion as between the sponsor organization and the company in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the situation forming the basis for the controversy arose.
in the event of a judgment being entered against the company on an arbitration award,the company at the request of the sponsor organization,shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the united states of america 
interpreting the arbitration clause to encompass disputes that do not include an insurer would render many of these procedures set forth in section vi t inconsistent and largely meaningless,particularly as those procedures apply to the insurers.if the arbitration clause encompassed such disputes,neither insurer would have an interest in participating in the required dispute resolution procedures prior to arbitration or in selecting an arbitrator in cases where an insurer is not involved in the dispute.nonetheless,these procedures must be invoked in every case prior to commencing binding arbitration,and the arbitration clause does not provide alternative procedures to follow should disputes involving only insureds arise.this omission indicates that the parties to the policies intended the dispute resolution procedures to apply only to the disputes for which procedures are,only to situations where there is a dispute with an insurer.see coker,at in construing a written contract,the primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.furthermore,the arbitration clause itself would be internally inconsistent if it were read to encompass disputes that do not include an insurer because it provides neither an agreement by the insureds to arbitrate disputes only among themselves,nor a mechanism by which each side of a dispute consisting of only insureds may appoint arbitrators.had the parties contemplated arbitration of disputes among competing insureds in circumstances where there is no dispute with an insurer,they could have provided a mechanism to represent the adverse interests of the insureds when appointing arbitrators.they did not.
therefore,given the plain language of section iv t,our reading of the arbitration,that it applies only to disputes,arising out of or related to the policy,that include an insurer and one or more the most natural and,in the context of the entire policy,best harmonizes and gives effect to all of the provisions contained therein.see mci telecomms.util,when interpreting a contract,we examine the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be meaningless.citing city of midland waller,universal credit daniel,coker,at.
nature of the instant dispute 
a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.warrior gulf,at.therefore,having determined that the scope of the arbitration clause extends only to disputes arising out of or related to the policies that include an insurer and one or more insureds,we now must decide whether the dispute in the instant case falls within this scope.that is,we must determine whether the interpleader action arises out of or relates to the primary and excess policies,and constitutes a dispute that includes an insurer and one or more insureds.
lay and skilling argue that the disputes over the distribution of policy proceeds arise out of and relate to the primary and excess policies in the strictest it not for those policies,there would be neither funds to interplead nor any legal basis for the insureds competing claims.br.at.they further assert that the nature of the dispute as an interpleader action does not mean that the dispute falls outside of the scope of the arbitration clause.lay and skilling contend that,rather than avoiding disputes with the insureds when they filed their interpleader complaint,the insurers in effect created a dispute with every insured by not agreeing to any of their demands.finally,lay and skilling argue that the insurers admitted the existence of a dispute when they filed their interpleader complaint because article iii of the united states constitution prevents courts from adjudicating matters that are not actual cases or controversies if there were no dispute,the district court should have dismissed the interpleader action.
on the other hand,the settling defendants and the insurers argue that the dispute is outside the scope of the arbitration clause because it does not arise out of or relate to the policies.moreover,they assert that,even if the dispute did arise out of or relate to the policies,lay and skilling do not have a dispute with the insurers rather,their dispute is with the settling defendants over the proper allocation of the million in policy proceeds.because the insurers have agreed to pay out the entire million policy limit,tendered the funds to the district court,and stand neutral as to the proper distribution of the funds,the settling defendants and the insurers maintain that there is nothing for the insurers to arbitrate with the insureds and therefore no dispute within the meaning of the arbitration clause.
arising out of or related to 
a dispute arises out of or relates to a contract if the legal claim underlying the dispute could not be maintained without reference to the contract.ford nylcare health plans of the gulf coast,cir noting that a claim does not arise out of or relate to a contract if the claim is completely independent of the contract and could be maintained without reference to a contract.under this definition,the instant dispute arises out of and is related to the primary and excess policies because those policies are not only the source of the interpleaded fund,but they are also the source of any insured legal right to the proceeds of that fund.in other words,lay and skilling could not assert a claim to any of the policy proceeds without reference to their contractual right to those proceeds under the policies however,as we explained above,the arbitration clause contains further language limiting its scope to such disputes that include an insurer and one or more insureds,notwithstanding the broad construction that some courts have given to arising out of or related to language in arbitration clauses in cases where the applicability of the clauses to specific parties was not an issue.see prima paint,at.interpreting the arising out of or related to phrase broadly to encompass a fraud in the inducement claim without having to address whether the arbitration clause applied to the specific parties before the court mayflower ins.pellegrino,d,refusing to compel arbitration of a dispute between insureds because the policy arbitration provision contemplated only the arbitration of disputes between the insurer and the insureds.therefore,in this case,because the policy language limits the arbitration clause applicability to disputes that include an insurer,the mere fact that this dispute aris es out of or relate s to the policies does not end our analysis as lay and skilling urge.we still must determine whether this dispute includes an insurer or is more appropriately characterized as a dispute only among various insureds.
b.the interpleader action 
under the circumstances of this case,we conclude that the only existing dispute is one only among various insureds.by filing their interpleader complaint and tendering the entire million in policy proceeds to the district court,the insurers have effectively removed themselves from any dispute by conceding coverage up to the policy limits and remaining neutral as to the proper distribution of the funds.see at.all that now remains is a dispute among the insureds,lay,skilling,and the settling defendants over the appropriate allocation of the policy proceeds therefore,this dispute falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause.
this conclusion is consistent with the purpose of interpleader as a procedural device to shield a stakeholder in this case,the insurers from liability when faced with the threat of multiple inconsistent claims to a single fund by allowing the stakeholder to tender that fund to the court in lieu of defending against multiple possible lawsuits.see rhoades casey,cir the legislative purpose of an interpleader action is to remedy the problems posed by multiple claimants to a single fund,and to protect a stakeholder from the possibility of multiple claims on a single fund.wausau ins.gifford,cir.the procedural device of interpleader,then,allows a stakeholder effectively to avoid a dispute with the claimants while the court determines the proper allocation of the disputed fund 
t he principle of interpleader is that,where two persons are engaged in a dispute,and that which is to be the fruit of the dispute is in the hands of a third party,who is willing to give it up according to the result of the dispute,then,that third person is not to be obliged to be at the expense and risk of defending an action but,on giving up the thing,he is to be relieved,and the court directs that the persons between whom the dispute really exists shall fight it out at their own expense.the mere statement of the principle shows its justice.
charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure.ed hereinafter wright miller quoting evans wright,weekly reporter,law times per willes,eng.emphasis added.in other words,
i nterpleader was originally designed to protect the stakeholder the protection afforded by interpleader takes several forms.most significantly,it prevents the stakeholder from being obliged to determine at his peril which claimant has the better claim,and,when the stakeholder has no interest in the fund,forces the claimants to contest what essentially is a controversy between them without embroiling the stakeholder in the litigation over the merits of the respective claims.
wright miller.likewise,in treinies sunshine mining,the supreme court relied on this concept when it held that a stakeholder citizenship in a statutory interpleader action based on diversity jurisdiction need not be diverse from the citizenship of the claimants because 
there is a real controversy between the adverse claimants.they are brought into the court by the complainant stakeholder who simultaneously deposits the money or property,due and involved in the dispute into the registry of the court.this was done in this case.the interpleader statute provides that the court shall hear and determine the cause and shall discharge the complainant from further liability.such deposit and discharge effectually demonstrates the applicant disinterestedness as between the claimants and as to the property in dispute,an essential in interpleaders.
id.emphases added see also haynes felder,cir citing treinies and holding that only the claimants to the interpleaded fund need be diverse to the requirement in an interpleader action for this reason,lay and skilling contention that the insurers created a dispute with each insured when it filed the interpleader complaint is without merit.characterizing an interpleader action in that manner would undermine a stakeholder primary reason for filing an interpleader complaint in the first place,which is to avoid a dispute with competing claimants to the interpleaded fund.see corrigan dispatch casa guzman,cir interpleader is a device which allows a party in possession of money or property belonging to another to join two or more parties asserting mutually exclusive claims to the property or fund in a single suit,thereby freeing the stakeholder from multiple liability or multiple lawsuits.therefore,faced with the threat of multiple vexation resulting from potential lawsuits with various insureds asserting claims to the policy proceeds,the insurers availed themselves of the procedural protections of interpleader described above.in so doing,they avoided disputes with each of the insureds by tendering the entire million policy limit to the district court and remaining neutral as to its allocation.see rhoades,at wright miller.
nonetheless,lay and skilling contend that,because the insurers filed a complaint in the nature of interpleader rather than a strict bill of interpleader,the insurers have not avoided a dispute with the insureds but such a distinction makes little difference in our analysis,at least as it applies to the dispute as it currently stands.lay and skilling argue that the
