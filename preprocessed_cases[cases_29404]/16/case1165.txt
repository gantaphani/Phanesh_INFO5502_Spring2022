the securities litigation uniform standards act of provides,in part 
class action limitations 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
removal of covered class actions 
any covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security,as set forth in paragraph,shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending,and shall be subject to paragraph.
the slusa removal provision,f,is jurisdictional it creates an express exception to the complaint rule conferring federal removal jurisdiction over a unique class of state law claims.see beneficial bank anderson,d distinguishing between removal of state law claims when congress expressly so provides and removal when a federal statute wholly displaces the cause of action through complete.the jurisdictional inquiry under slusa tracks the plain language of the statute.no matter how an action is pleaded,if it is a covered class action involving a covered security,removal is proper the removing party bears the burden of establishing these elements.difelice aetna healthcare,cir.

in,congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act,et pslra,to curb abuses in private class action securities litigation.see conf,at,reprinted in.the pslra implemented a host of procedural and substantive reforms,including more stringent pleading requirements to curtail the filing of meritless lawsuits.in re advanta sec,cir quoting conf,at.
by,congress concluded that plaintiffs were circumventing the requirements of the pslra by filing private securities class actions in state rather than federal court.slusa was designed to close this perceived loophole by authorizing the removal and federal preemption of certain state court securities class actions.see stating slusa aims to prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the private securities litigation reform act of.as the senate banking committee report explained,congress envisioned a broad interpretation of slusa to ensure the uniform application of federal fraud standards,available at wl.i t remains the committee intent that the bill be interpreted broadly to reach mass actions and all other procedural devices that might be used to circumvent the class action definition.
slusa preempts,inter alia,covered class actions alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f a.this language mirrors existing federal securities law under b and rule of the act.see b prohibiting fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security prohibiting,inter alia,material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.a threshold question,then,is whether existing case law under b and rule informs the interpretation of slusa in connection requirement.
we believe it does.where congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning.nlrb amax coal,d citation omitted see also molzof united states,d.because slusa employs terms with settled meaning under existing federal securities law,congress evidently intended to preempt those actions sufficiently connected to a securities transaction to be actionable under b and rule.in other words,slusa furthers the uniform application of federal fraud standards without expanding or constricting the substantive reach of federal securities regulation.see emphasizing considerations of federalism in slusa legislative findings.accordingly,we will interpret slusa in connection requirement in light of existing doctrine under b and rule 
as noted,the central issue on appeal is whether plaintiff state law complaint alleges a material misrepresentation or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.if so,the action must be dismissed as preempted.plaintiff contends neither the misrepresentation nor the in connection elements are satisfied.
the misrepresentation issue is straightforward.plaintiff complaint is replete with allegations that salomon smith barney disseminated biased and materially misleading investment research.plaintiff alleges salomon smith barney provides customers with biased investment research and analysis artificially inflates the ratings and analysis of its investment banking clients was fined by the nasd for issuing materially misleading research reports and provided biased and misleading analysis that was intended to curry favor with defendant existing and potential investment banking clients.these allegations,which are incorporated by reference in every count in the complaint,readily satisfy the misrepresentation requirement under slusa.
plaintiff responds that the breach of contract claim does not involve a misrepresentation or omission.in other words,plaintiff contends that because misrepresentation is not an essential legal element of his claim under pennsylvania contract law,the factual allegations of misrepresentation included in the complaint are irrelevant to the slusa inquiry.
we disagree.plaintiff suggested the legal and factual allegations in a immaterial under the statute.slusa preempts any covered class action alleging a material misrepresentation or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.f.under this provision,preemption does not turn on whether allegations are characterized as facts or as essential legal elements of a claim,but rather on whether the slusa prerequisites are alleged in one form or another.a contrary approach,under which only essential legal elements of a state law claim trigger preemption,is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute.furthermore,it would allow artful pleading to undermine slusa goal of result manifestly contrary to congressional intent.the congress finds that it is appropriate to enact national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities,available at wl,i t remains the committee intent that the bill be interpreted broadly to reach mass actions and all other procedural devices that might be used to circumvent the class action definition.
where,as here,allegations of a material misrepresentation serve as the factual predicate of a state law claim,the misrepresentation prong is satisfied under slusa.
the in connection issue is more difficult.plaintiff contends the complaint states a straightforward breach of contract claim,salomon smith barney agreed to provide unbiased investment research and failed to provide it.salomon smith barney responds that the action,while nominally resting on state law,nevertheless alleges a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.the issue turns on whether plaintiff allegations,charging salomon smith barney with systematically and materially misrepresenting its investment banking clients investment ratings and analyses,are connected to the purchase or sale of securities.as noted,our analysis is informed by in connection case law under b,rule and slusa.
the supreme court recently addressed the in connection element in zandford,an action under b and rule.the court unanimously accepted the sec broad reading of the phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,at,and held the requisite connection is established where a fraudulent scheme and a securities transaction coincide.id.at.zandford relied upon and reaffirmed superintendent of insurance bankers life casualty,d,which likewise held that a fraudulent scheme touching on a securities transaction satisfied the in connection element of b and rule.
at the same time,zandford broad interpretation is not boundless.it does not transform every breach of fiduciary duty into a federal securities violation.at.federal securities law is circumscribed,and strikes a balance between uniform regulation of a national market and preservation of those areas traditionally left to state regulation,such as corporate,contract and fiduciary law.santa fe indus.green,d emphasizing principles of federalism and holding claims challenging internal corporate mismanagement are not actionable under b.
we also have addressed the in connection requirement in the context of b and rule.in semerenko cendant,we held the in connection criteria is satisfied where material misrepresentations are disseminated to the public in a medium upon which a reasonable investor would rely,cir see also mcgann ernst young,cir sec.gulf sulphur,cir en banc.additionally,we have held that a dispute involving the credit terms of a margin account arises in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,in part because investors maintain brokerage accounts for the very purpose of trading in securities.angelastro,cir.
courts applying slusa generally have adhered to a broad interpretation of the in connection element.in behlen merrill lynch,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that despite plaintiffs removal of all explicit references to any fraudulent activity from their state law complaint,breach of contract claims involving misrepresentations by a securities broker were sufficiently connected to a securities transaction to trigger preemption,cir.other courts have similarly scrutinized the pleadings to arrive at the essence of a state law claim,in order to prevent artful drafting from circumventing slusa preemption.dudek prudential,cir see also prof l mgmt,kpmg llp,cir preempting state law claims where the complaint implicitly alleges that misrepresentations and omissions were made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities emphasis added falkowski,at cir preempting state law claims involving employee stock options because r epresentations about the value of stock are properly subject to uniform federal standards.
the plaintiff theory of damages also bears on the slusa in connection inquiry.see,behlen,at cir considering allegations of excess fees and commissions in determining whether claims are connected to a securities transaction dabit merrill lynch,cir holding that claims for commissions paid are preempted.in other words,the relief sought by as the recovery of investment losses or trading be relevant in connecting the allegations to the purchase or sale of securities 
under existing in connection case law,we find several factors relevant in distinguishing between preempted claims and those remaining within the province of state law first,whether the covered class action alleges a fraudulent scheme that coincides with the purchase or sale of securities,zandford,at.second,whether the complaint alleges a material misrepresentation or omission disseminated to the public in a medium upon which a reasonable investor would rely,semerenko,at third,whether the nature of the parties relationship is such that it necessarily involves the purchase or sale of securities,see angelastro,at noting that customers maintain brokerage accounts for the very purpose of trading in securities and fourth,whether the prayer for relief connects the state law claims to the purchase or sale of securities,see dabit,at 
applying this flexible framework,rowinski state law action is preempted by sl
