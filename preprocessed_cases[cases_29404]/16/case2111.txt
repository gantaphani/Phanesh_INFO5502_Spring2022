according to the united states supreme court,a rbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the costs of litigation.circuit city stores,adams,d.this litigation proves the exception to that rule.this is now the fourth appeal to this court regarding an arbitration award that was finalized in,three years after defendant edwin behr gmbh behr terminated its contract with plaintiff m c corporation,who had been acting as the exclusive sales agent for behr automotive parts.see m c erwin behr gmbh,kg,cir behr i m c erwin behr gmbh,kg,cir behr ii m c erwin behr gmbh,kg,cir behr iii.
in behr iii,this court reversed the district court order holding that award eight of the arbitrator part award is ambiguous with regard to the amounts behr owes m c.the eighth award addresses m c claim that the parties contract entitles m c to commissions on customer orders for behr parts that were placed after behr terminated its contract with m c.this court instructed the district court to specify the particular ambiguity in the eighth award.on remand,via an order dated march,the district court identified a purported ambiguity in the award and again remanded to the arbitrator to determine the exact scope of the commissionable products under the eighth award and to state what payments,if any,are due to each party from the other under that award.
for the reasons stated below,we reverse the district court order,which found an ambiguity in the arbitration award that purportedly justified a remand to the arbitrator.all of the potential products for which m c is seeking commissions were ordered by behr customers more than three years after behr terminated its contract with m under the plain language of the parties contract,m c is not entitled to commissions on these orders,even assuming that m c actively solicited these orders during the contract period.moreover,because the issue of commissionable products can be resolved through the unambiguous language of the contract,the further question of how much money,if any,each party owes the other can be readily determined in a judicial forum.a remand to the district court,however,would only invite further delay in this protracted litigation.therefore,this court shall retain jurisdiction over this case.within days of this opinion issuance,the parties shall submit a joint stipulation reflecting the amounts owed or overpaid pursuant to award eight.if the parties can not agree on these amounts,they are directed to advise the court in writing of their respective positions.after receipt of the joint stipulation or the opposing briefs,the court will enter an appropriate final judgment resolving the issue of payments owed under the contract.
background 
a complete factual background is more fully set forth in this court three prior published opinions.we reiterate only those facts necessary to understand the reasoning in this opinion.
behr,a german limited liability entity,entered into a contract on march,with m c corporation,whereby m c was to serve as the exclusive sales agent for behr in the united states and canada for a period of at least five years for the sale of wood interior panels for luxury automobiles.the contract specifies that the agreement shall be interpreted with and governed by the laws of the state of michigan,and that a ll disputes arising in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the rules of the court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules.
on march,behr terminated the agreement in accordance with the provisions of the contract.when behr failed to forward to m c the commissions it had earned for some sales and client development work,m c filed suit in federal district court seeking damages for breach of contract,improper termination of contract,and tortious interference with contractual relations.the district court stayed any judicial proceedings and ordered the parties to submit the dispute to arbitration as required by the contract.pursuant to the rules of the court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce,a british arbitrator was then assigned to the case and london,england,was designated as the neutral site of the proceedings.on march,after more than one year of submissions of documentation,arguments,and hearings,the arbitrator issued awards.
behr appealed the arbitrator awards to the district court,which the court confirmed on august.on appeal,this court affirmed the arbitrator award of in damages pursuant to a michigan statute.comp.laws b that assesses against a defendant an amount equal to two times the value of commissions due but intentionally not paid to a sales representative,and in legal fees,costs,and expenses.behr i,at.behr did not contest the award of in damages and interest payments for commissions that it wrongfully withheld from m id.at.
while behr i was pending before this court,m c moved in the district court to enforce various arbitral awards,including award eight.the district court found that behr had failed to specifically perform the obligations imposed under award eight and that as a result,behr actions directly violate d the terms of the arbitral award and the district court august,order confirming that award.behr was thereafter held in contempt.
subsequent to this court judgment to affirm in behr i,behr paid m c,in satisfaction of awards four,five,seven,ten and eleven.behr continued to contest,however,the amount due under award eight.award eight does not require the payment of a specific monetary amount rather,the award requires behr to provide m c with documentation for sales of certain products and to pay commissions on the future sales of these products.clause of the parties contract referenced in award eight requires behr to pay commissions on all new orders which are not renewal or extensions orders,received from customers within three years following the date of termination.
behr sought a stay of enforcement proceedings because the amounts owing on that disputed award have not been reduced to judgment.behr contended that the parties disagreed over the interpretation of the word order and that because the issue was not addressed by the arbitrator,a stay was appropriate.in its initial determination,the district court ruled that a stay of enforcement pending arbitration was not warranted because behr had not raised a good faith dispute that had not been previously decided in arbitration.upon behr motion for reconsideration,however,the district court determined that behr had raised a good faith issue of what constitutes an order under the commission contract,and that the prior arbitration award had not addressed that issue.
behr had argued to the district court that the term order was ambiguous because it could mean either a purchase order or a release order.a purchase order contains a list of the general terms including price per unit of future purchases by a customer,whereas the customer must issue a release order for a specific number of parts to be shipped on designated dates.it was behr position that to the extent any release orders were issued more than three years following the termination of the contract,m c was not entitled to receive commissions,as dictated by clause.the district court accepted behr argument that the term orders in clause is ambiguous and granted behr motion for stay of further enforcement proceedings pending resolution of that ambiguity in arbitration.
on appeal in behr ii,this court reversed the district court decision to remand the case to the arbitrator.we held 
a reading of the arbitrator award,together with its opinion,leads this court to find that the award is not ambiguous,and the district court remand to arbitration was not proper.
the arbitrator opinion clearly determined that pursuant to clause of the parties agreement,the payment of commissions is tied to the receipt of all new orders received from customers within three years following the date of termination but which were actively solicited by m c from the customers prior to the date of said termination.emphasis added.as read,there is a requirement in the arbitrator award the order must be received prior to the three years following termination of the contract and such an order must have materialized as a result of the active solicit ation by m c prior to the termination of the contract.
the only order the arbitrator could have referred to was the form entitled purchase order,not a form entitled material release.the purchase order is the only order that m c had direct involvement in actively solicit ing from customers.whereas,it is based entirely on the customer needs when the goods ordered via the purchase order are released.the arbitrator determined,and this court agrees,that the primary intent of the parties agreement was to provide m c the equitable relief of specific commissions for work that it had actively solicited.thus,as the only order that m c had any involvement in actively soliciting were purchase orders,which were also the only orders that were before the arbitrator to consider,the arbitrator has necessarily determined that new orders refers to new purchase orders.
further,even if it is as behr contends that the payment of commissions is tied to payment of money by the customer,this payment of money is also tied to when the material release is issued.therefore,it necessarily follows that a material release,itself,is also tied to the payment of commissions.and the arbitrator award clearly indicates that the payment of commissions is not subject to the limitation.
when behr challenged the continued payment of commissions to m c after termination of the contract,the arbitrator clearly stated,
i have accepted the evidence which shows that an agent,like connelly m c,is involved in significant effort and expenditure before commission accrues when a material release is issued.it obtains the business for its principal by means of such activity which it undertakes in the hope of future award.the contract scheme in clause for the continuance of commission after termination but the cessation of the duty to service at that point seems just and natural and i accept the evidence that commission payment during life of the part is customary in the industry.emphasis added.
thus,even if we assume behr proposition to be true,it was still the active solicitation of m c prior to contract termination which resulted in the receipt of purchase orders during the time frame,and it was the release of those new purchase orders which triggered the receipt of money from the customer and the commission payment s during life of the part.
as the arbitration award is clear,the district court erred in granting behr motion for stay of enforcement pending arbitration.
behr ii,at.
following the decision in behr ii,behr moved for partial satisfaction of the judgment for all amounts due under the eighth award on the k special parts.in the motion,behr represented that it paid m c in commissions and interest on all purchase orders for k special parts for the model year,which,it argued,fully satisfies all sums due for k special parts under the eighth award as interpreted by the sixth circuit.the district court denied the motion.see m c erwin behr gmbh,d.after m c moved for clarification of what behr owed on the eighth award,the district court amended its prior opinion to include the following language 
accordingly,the sixth circuit holding that m c is entitled to commissions for the life of the part means that m c is entitled to commissions on any material release for each k special part order pursuant to any purchase order which was issued by general motors corporation to behr prior to march.
the district court clarification of the sixth circuit interpretation of behr obligation under the eighth award did not end the matter,however,because behr filed yet another motion for partial satisfaction of judgment,contending that it had actually overpaid m c by over.according to behr,it did not owe commissions to m c on certain lines of parts specifically,the ek parts and k parts because they were ordered by general motors more than three years after the termination of the contract between m c and behr and were not therefore actively solicited by m c.in response,m c cited a reference in behr ii to behr obligation to pay commissions during the life of the part and argued that commissions were payable for the life of the part program whenever those orders were renewed or extended.m c argued that the ek parts and k parts were essentially the same as those parts for which m c actively solicited orders and that a simple did not justify depriving m c of a commission.m c further argued that,regardless of whether behr and gm chose to identify parts with a yearly label,k special or ek,all such parts were either renewals or extensions of old orders,new orders,or renewals or extensions of new orders adding a year tag to a part program,adding to k special does not make the program any different,according to m 
the district court rejected m c arguments,agreeing with the magistrate judge recommendation that the only commission to which m c is entitled are those on parts ordered through blanket purchase orders within three years after the termination.the district court reasoned 
the arbitrator award clearly applies to only those parts specifically listed under model year business,cadillac business,and cadillac k car series in the arbitrator award.the language in the arbitrator award that it is immaterial that there should have been design changes in the parts concerned after the application of the sales efforts of the agent does not expand the scope of the parts concerned.similarly,the life of the part language does not broaden the scope of the parts concerned,as plaintiff contends.
the district court remained uncertain,however,as to the amounts,if any,behr owed m c.after receiving briefs from the parties,the same district court that had earlier held the award to be unambiguous found the award to be unclear in its application and that the award did not fully adjudicate an issue that had been submitted to the arbitrator.the court therefore entered an order remanding the matter to the original arbitrator to clarify the amounts owed under that award.according to the district court,remanding to the arbitrator under these circumstances simply would require him to complete his duties by applying his reasoning to the facts and would not reopen the merits of the case.
on appeal in behr iii,this court reversed the district court remand order.we held 
t he district court order lacks any indication of precisely how the eighth award is unclear as to its application,or which issue submitted to the arbitrator was not fully adjudicate d.nor with any confidence can we divine the answers from the circumstances prior to its remand order,the district court had expressly held that the arbitrator opinion and award were not ambiguous with respect to behr obligation to pay commissions on the ek parts and k parts.if the district court has changed its mind about this issue,it needs to say so and explain it.if there is another ambiguity in the award that makes enforcement impossible,the district court needs to identify it.until it does so,we can not undertake a meaningful review of whether the award is ambiguous or whether the circumstances are appropriate for a remand to the arbitrator.moreover,the district court vague order creates a substantial risk that the arbitrator will have insufficient guidance as to how to clarify its award,creating the potential for yet another journey to the district court,to this court on appeal,and back yet again to the arbitrator.accordingly,we find it necessary to remand this case to the district court for clarification of the precise issue or issues that remain for the arbitrator on remand.
behr iii,at emphasis in original.
on remand,by order of march,the district court specified the purported ambiguities in the arbitrator award and remanded to the arbitrator for clarification 
t he eighth award is ambiguous in its scope.the eight award states in part that plaintiff should be paid for any order of products in the territory and specifically including the following products.the award is unclear insofar as the court can not determine whether or not the list that follows this statement is the exclusive list of the products on which commissions are due.furthermore,as defendant notes,there is a continuing controversy over how long particular parts are commissionable the court was unable,based on the language in the award and the parties filings,to divine what amount,if any,should be paid on the award therefore the court will remand this case to arbitrator andrew berkeley to state the exact scope of the products commissionable under the eighth award and to state what payments,if any,are due to each party from the other under the eighth award.
although behr timely appealed the district court order of remand,it failed to ask the district court to stay its remand order,as required by rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.instead,behr moved this court for a stay.on july,this court denied behr motion because,inter alia,behr had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm that would warrant the issuance of a stay.m c erwin behr gmbh,kg,cir.july.on the eve of oral argument,the parties filed a stipulation with the court to dismiss the present appeal,without prejudice,and with each party bearing its own costs.the court denied the stipulation on april.thereafter,the parties moved this court to reconsider the denial of the stipulation,which the court also refused to grant.in that motion,the parties informed the court that the arbitration hearing that the district court ordered had taken place from april through,in london,england and that one of the issues addressed was whether the original arbitration award is ambiguous.at the conclusion of the hearing,the arbitrator purportedly indicated that he would endeavor to issue a decision by may.to date,the parties have not apprised the court of any new decision from the arbitrator.
purported ambiguity of the eighth awarda.standard of review 
a determination of the arbitrability of a dispute is subject to de novo review.behr ii,at.
although federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce arbitrations awards,courts may not go beyond the arbitration award to decide questions that the arbitrator did not decide.behr ii,at citing united steelworkers of america enter.wheel car,d.an ambiguous award may not be enforced but should be remanded to the arbitrator.id.at citing enter.wheel,at.however,if the arbitrator opinion and award,read together,are not ambiguous,the award should be enforced.id.citing int l of workers,local olin,cir.as discussed below,the relevant portions of the arbitration award,as well as the parties contract,are unambiguous and,therefore,the district court erred in remanding to the arbitrator for further clarification on the scope of products for which behr must pay commissions.
behr terminated its sales agency agreement with m c on march.the parties agreement specifies behr obligations to pay commissions to m c as follows 
first,pursuant to clause of the agreement,behr is obligated to pay commissions on a all purchase orders obtained by m c and accepted in writing by behr prior to the termination of the agreement,and b any extensions or renewal purchase orders for the same individual item and accepted in writing by behr prior to the termination of the agreement.
second,pursuant to clause of the agreement,behr is obligated to pay commissions on all extension or renewal purchase orders for the same individual items received from customers following the termination of the agreement.
third,pursuant to clause of the agreement,behr is obligated to pay commissions on all new purchase orders that a are not renewal or extension purchase orders,b are received from customers within three years following the termination of the agreement march,and c were actively solicited by m c prior to the agreement termination.clause defines actively solicited orders to mean purchase orders which may reasonably be regarded to have materialized mainly as a result of the negotiations and sales efforts of m 
as noted,clause obligates behr to pay commissions on renewal orders regardless of when behr receives them,so long as those orders involve the same individual items as in the original purchase order.also as noted,clause obligates behr to pay commissions on all new orders received within three years of the contract termination.viewed in isolation,clause does not,on its face,place a durational limit on renewal orders for which behr has to pay commissions,unlike the window for new orders.clause could be read to impose a commission obligation on renewal orders only for products that were covered by a purchase order that m c solicited and behr accepted prior to the contract termination on march.under a more expansive interpretation,however,clause could be read to impose a commission obligation not only on renewal orders for products covered by a purchase order,but also renewal orders for new orders under clause,renewal orders for products covered by a purchase order that m c actively solicited and that behr received between march,and march.under this latter interpretation of clause,behr obligation to pay commissions on renewal orders for purchase orders that originated within the,termination period would not cease until the renewal orders ended,even if those orders were received more than three years after contract termination.
the following example illustrates how the expansive interpretation of clause would operate.the k special was a new order that m c actively solicited and that behr received on october,during the,termination period.behr concedes that it owes commissions on this purchase order as a new order under clause.under the expansive interpretation of clause,however,behr also would be obligated to pay commissions on all renewal orders for k special parts that are the same individual items as the k special parts,even if those renewal orders were placed more than three years after the contract termination.thus,assuming that the k special parts are the same as the k special parts,behr would be obligated to pay commissions for these parts,even though the purchase order for the k special parts was placed at least five years after the contract termination.
the contract as a whole,does not support this expansive reading of clause.clause specifically states that behr obligation to pay commissions on orders placed within three years of contract termination extends only to new orders,which are not renewal or extension orders.if the parties had intended behr to pay m c commissions for renewal orders of new orders under clause,then they would not have needed to specifically exclude renewal or extension orders from clause.accordingly,the only logical reading of clause and is that m c is entitled to commissions on renewal orders placed after the termination of the contract as long as those renewal orders relate to the same individual items covered by a purchase order that m c obtained and behr accepted prior to the contract termination on march.
in the eighth award,the arbitrator dealt with m c claim that it was entitled to,inter alia,commissions for orders,and ordered behr to pay all commissions for any order of products in the territory and specifically including the following products various parts falling under the classification model year business various parts falling under the classification cadillac business and various parts falling under the classification cadillac k car series.the district court held that the arbitrator use of the specifically including language to define the range of comissionable parts creates an ambiguity because the definition implies that m c might be entitled to commissions on additional parts that the arbitrator did not list with particularity.behr argues on appeal that any ambiguity is irrelevant because the only parts that arguably would be commissionable under a more expansive definition were ordered more than three years after the termination of the contract between behr and m c and,therefore,behr has no obligation to pay,per clause of the agreement.
we agree with behr.behr has paid all commissions on the k special parts that were ordered in the model year behr concedes that it owed commissions for sales of these parts becaus
