this case raises a significant constitutional question of first impression in this circuit whether federal courts have authority,consistent with the separation of powers,to enjoin the executive branch from filing an indictment.although federal courts have this authority in narrow circumstances,we conclude that this is not such a case and therefore reverse the district court judgment to the contrary.
background 
appellee,through its subsidiary transportation group collectively or the company,is a leading supplier of parcel tanker shipping services.in march,general counsel,paul,resigned.according to a complaint filed against in connecticut superior court in november,and a subsequent article in the wall street journal,advised his superiors of illegal collusive trading practices between and two of its competitors,and resigned after the company failed to take action to resolve the problem.on receiving november complaint,hired john nannes,a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division at the department of justice,to conduct an internal investigation of possible antitrust violations by the company and advise it regarding any criminal liability.
on november,nannes met with the chairman of tanker division,samuel cooperman.cooperman informed nannes that rais ed some antitrust concerns in early,and that in response revised its antitrust compliance policy and disseminated it to its employees and competitors.cooperman also told nannes that he believed an internal investigation would demonstrate that the company was in violation of federal antitrust laws and asked nannes about the possibility of leniency from the department of justice.with cooperman permission,nannes spoke with an antitrust division official later that day to inquire about amnesty if were to admit its violations,and the government informed him that an investigation had already begun.
specifically,nannes inquired about possible protection for and its officers under the antitrust division corporate leniency policy.under this policy,the government agrees not to charg e a firm criminally for the activity being reported if in the case of an applicant who comes forward after an investigation has begun seven conditions are met the applicant is the first to report the illegal activity the government does not,at the time the applicant comes forward,have enough information to sustain a conviction the applicant,upon its discovery of the illegal activity being reported,took prompt and effective action to terminate its part in the activity the applicant report is made with candor and completeness and provides full,continuing and complete cooperation with the government investigation the applicant confesses to illegal anticompetitive conduct as a corporation and not merely through individual confessions by corporate officers the applicant makes restitution where possible and the government determines that granting leniency to the applicant would not be unfair to others.the officers and directors of the corporation who assist with the investigation are considered for immunity from prosecution on the same basis as if they had come forward individually.
b.the conditional leniency agreement 
the government informed nannes that would not be eligible for amnesty under the corporate leniency policy if departure was involuntary and due to his exposure of the company antitrust violations.nannes assured the government that left voluntarily and detailed the changes to the company antitrust policy that were implemented in response to concerns.during the ensuing investigation,nannes learned that between and a executive,andrew pickering,exchanged customer allocation lists with two of competitors,presumably for the purpose of apportioning customers among the companies and restraining competition.in january,pickering successor,appellee richard wingfield,provided nannes with four such lists,which confirmed that had indeed engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior.nannes promptly turned these lists over to the government,which entered into a conditional leniency agreement the agreement with on january.
under the terms of the agreement,the government agreed not to bring any criminal prosecution against for any act or offense it may have committed prior to the date of this agreement in connection with the anticompetitive activity being reported.this promise was,of course,subject to strict compliance with the aforementioned conditions,s ubject to verification by the government and subject to full,continuing and complete cooperation.the agreement further stated 
if the antitrust division at any time determines that has violated this agreement,it shall be void should the antitrust division revoke the conditional acceptance of into the corporate leniency program,the antitrust division may thereafter initiate a criminal prosecution against,without limitation.should such a prosecution be initiated,any documentary or other information provided by,as well as any statements or other information provided by any current or former director,officer,or employee of to the antitrust division pursuant to this agreement,may be used against in any such prosecution.
the agreement also provided that the government would not prosecute officers and directors of the company who admit their knowledge of,or participation in,and fully and truthfully cooperate with the antitrust division in its investigation of the anticompetitive activity being reported.specifically,that cooperation entailed producing all documents and records requested by the government being available for government interviews responding fully and truthfully to all inquiries of the government without falsely implicating any person or intentionally withholding any information voluntarily providing any information or materials not requested by the government that were nonetheless relevant to the investigation and testifying under oath when asked by the government.it concluded with a standard integration clause this letter constitutes the entire agreement between the parties,and supersedes all prior understandings,if any,whether oral or written,relating to the subject matter herein.
using the information provided by and its executives including wingfield,the government secured guilty pleas from,resulting in prison sentences for individual executives at those companies and fines totaling million.
c.the government terminates the agreement 
in the weeks following execution of the agreement,the government investigation revealed that participation in the conspiracy persisted for several months after raised his concerns to cooperman in early.the government concluded that,and wingfield in particular,continued to collude unlawfully with competitors until november.based on this information,the government informed nannes on april,that it was suspending obligations under the agreement and considering withdrawing the grant of conditional leniency entirely because the company did not take prompt and effective action to terminate its part in the anticompetitive activity being reported upon discovery of the activity,as required by the agreement.one of wingfield subordinates,bjorn jansen,then admitted that the anticompetitive agreement between and its competitors was still in place in the fall of,despite having told nannes that such conduct ceased in march once the company learned of allegations and issued its new antitrust policy.
in june,the government concluded that wingfield had not fulfilled his obligations under the agreement because he never informed the government that his unlawful communications with competitors did not cease in march when issued its new antitrust policy.on june,the government charged wingfield by criminal complaint with violating the sherman act.the government withdrew its grant of conditional leniency to on march,and announced that it intended to indict the company and wingfield for violations of the sherman act 
district court proceedings 
shortly before the government revoked conditional leniency,the company and wingfield filed complaints in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking enforcement of the agreement and an injunction preventing the government from filing indictments against them.the government agreed to postpone its indictments of both parties pending the district court consideration of the complaints.
the district court bifurcated the proceedings into two phases.in phase one,the court considered whether alleged conduct between march and november violated the terms of the agreement.if so,phase two would determine whether the conduct actually occurred.during the phase one proceedings,the district court consolidated consideration of and wingfield requests for preliminary injunctions with the trial on the merits,and heard testimony from nannes and james griffin,a deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division at the department of justice.
in january,the district court granted judgment in favor of and wingfield and permanently enjoined the government from indicting either of them for violations of the sherman act.see united states,d.the court concluded that the government could not unilaterally rescind the agreement without a judicial determination that and wingfield breached it,an issue appropriate for consideration before indictment because if an indictment were later determined to have been wrongfully secured,it would be too late to prevent the irreparable consequences.id.at.the court further found that the agreement did not specify a discovery date and instead granted amnesty for activity before january,the date on which it was signed.indeed,it found that the date when ended its participation in the conspiracy was never clearly established,id.at,and therefore,in light of the agreement integration clause,doj,especially because it drafted the agreement,can not depend upon a tacit understanding of what it contends was meant to be the discovery date but was not memorialized in the integrated agreement.id.at.the court concluded 
the agreement immunizes from prosecution for activity prior to january.now doj contends the activity had to have stopped at an earlier unspecified date that is not set forth in the agreement.had it wanted to fix the date sometime before january,it could have replaced the words to the date of this letter with the earlier date it now contends the parties contemplated.
the government goals in concluding the agreement with were to pursue and break up the conspiracy.it got what it had bargained for in the agreement now that it has received the benefit of the bargain,doj can not prosecute the party that incriminated itself when it delivered the evidence doj used to accomplish its goals.
on appeal,the government contends that the district court erred in two respects.first,it argues that federal courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin the executive branch from filing an indictment.second,it asserts that the district court erred in holding that and wingfield actions between march and november did not violate the terms of the agreement.for the reasons that follow,the district court judgment is reversed and the case remanded to that court so that it may dismiss the appellees complaints

the supreme court has observed that the executive branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case,united states nixon,d,and the government therefore argues that courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin a criminal prosecution.see united states cox,cir en banc it follows,as an incident of the constitutional separation of powers,that the courts are not to interfere with the free exercise of the discretionary powers of the attorneys of the united states in their control over criminal prosecutions.
there is an exception to this general rule,however,in order to avoid a chilling effect on constitutional rights.see dombrowski pfister,d recognizing that the threat of criminal prosecution creates the potential for a serious chill upon first amendment rights hynes grimes packing.recognizing that the threat of prosecution may deny fishermen the right to earn a livelihood truax raich.recognizing that the threat of prosecution may lead to an unconstitutional denial of the right to earn a livelihood and to continue employment.the supreme court has typically applied the exception in the first amendment context,and in such cases has recognized,
a criminal prosecution under a statute regulating expression usually involves imponderables and contingencies that themselves may inhibit the full exercise of first amendment freedoms the assumption that defense of a criminal prosecution will generally assure ample vindication of constitutional rights is unfounded in such cases w e have not thought that the improbability of successful prosecution makes the case different.the chilling effect upon the exercise of first amendment rights may derive from the fact of the prosecution,unaffected by the prospects of its success or failure.
dombrowski,at,d see also ashcroft aclu,d upholding preliminary injunction against criminal enforcement of the child online protection act because,inter alia,w here a prosecution is a likely possibility,yet only an affirmative defense is available,speakers may rather than risk the perils of trial.
it is also well established that the government must adhere strictly to the terms of agreements made with plea,cooperation,and immunity the extent the agreements require defendants to sacrifice constitutional rights.see,santobello new york,d united states hodge,cir the government must adhere strictly to the terms of the bargains it strikes with defendants.because defendants entering pleas forfeit a number of constitutional rights,courts are compelled to scrutinize closely the promise made by the government in order to determine whether it has been performed.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
therefore,although the government is certainly correct that there is no jurisdiction on the part of courts to enjoin criminal prosecutions,that authority does exist in limited situations where the mere threat of prosecution would inhibit the exercise of constitutional freedoms.federal courts also have jurisdiction to consider,and hold the government to,the terms of agreements it makes with defendants.the question thus becomes whether,even when there is no risk of a chilling effect on constitutional rights,the existence of an immunity agreement provides federal courts with authority to enjoin a federal criminal prosecution in order to avoid the filing of an indictment.
the district court relied on a seventh circuit case,united states meyer,cir,as authority for conducting a review of the agreement before us.see,d at.in meyer,the seventh circuit stated,in dicta,that the preferred procedure,absent exigent circumstances,would be for the government to seek relief from its obligations under the immunity agreement prior to indictment.since the government is required to obtain a judicial determination of a defendant breach prior to trial,it is but a de minimis inconvenience for the government to secure that determination.at.
we have no quarrel with the seventh circuit observation that,in many circumstances,a determination of the parties obligations under an immunity agreement might be useful.we point out,however,that no federal court including the seventh circuit has held that a determination is constitutionally required.indeed,notwithstanding its dicta regarding the preferred procedure,the meyer court held the defendant was constitutionally entitled to a judicial determination of his breach before being deprived of his interest in the enforcement of an immunity agreement,and that this interest was in not be
