this appeal concerns an oil and gas lease the lease between defendants appellants equitrans,and eqt production collectively,eqt as lessees,and plaintiff appellee k d holdings,k d,as lessor.the district court concluded that the lease was divisible into two separate segments one for production and exploration,and one for gas storage and protection of gas storage and found that the production and exploration segment of the lease had terminated after the lease initial term.on appeal,appellants contend that the lease is not divisible and that because they are actively engaged in one of the activities covered by the of stored entire lease remains in effect.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the district court erred and,accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions to enter judgment for eqt.
on december,henry wallace and sylvia wallace executed an oil and gas lease with equitrans,covering acres of land in tyler county,west virginia the premises k d is the to the lessors,the wallaces,and equitrans,is the to the lessee,equitrans.equitrans,subleased to eqt production the rights to produce and sell gas from the premises and subsurface formations that are not used for the storage of gas or protection of stored gas.thus,the lease now governs the relationship between k d and eqt.
the lease grants eqt the right to use the premises to explore for and produce oil and gas,to store gas,and to protect stored gas the term of the lease is established in article iv the durational provision,which reads as follows 
to have and to hold the said land and privileges for the said purposes for and during a period of years from december,and as long after commencement of operations as said land,or any portion thereof or any other land pooled or unitized therewith as hereinafter provided,is operated for the exploration or production of gas or oil,or as gas or oil is found in paying quantities thereon or stored thereunder,or as long as said land is used for the storage of gas or the protection of gas storage on lands in the general vicinity of said land.it is understood that a well need not be drilled on the leased premises to permit the storage of gas thereunder and the lessee shall be the sole judge of when and if said land is being used for the storage of gas or the protection of gas storage on lands in the general vicinity of said land.
since entering into the lease,eqt has not engaged in exploration,production,or gas storage on the premises.it has,however,engaged in protection of gas storage.equitrans,owns and operates a nearby natural gas storage facility known as the shirley storage field,which is authorized and regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ferc established a foot buffer zone around shirley storage field for the protection of the gas storage facilities.it is undisputed that part of this protective buffer zone falls on the premises,and that therefore eqt is using a portion of the premises for protection of storage of natural gas.
because eqt has not used the premises to engage in gas or oil production,k d now seeks to enter into a more lucrative oil and gas lease agreement with antero,but has been unable to do so because of the eqt lease.
on september,k d filed a complaint against eqt in the circuit court of tyler county,west virginia.k d primarily claimed that,because eqt has not produced and sold or used gas or oil on the premises for a period of greater than months,k d was entitled to a rebuttable presumption under west virginia law that eqt has abandoned the lease.see 
eqt removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia,where the parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment.k d claimed that,because eqt has expended no money to explore,test,or drill for over twenty years,the lease was therefore cancelled by operation of law.k d further argued that it should be permitted to lease the unused portion of the premises to another corporation for oil and gas production and stated that any drilling permitted on the leased area would not affect the protective zone for storage in use by eqt.
eqt,on the other hand,argued that west virginia code by its terms does not apply to leases for gas storage purposes.instead,the plain and unambiguous terms of the durational provision,which contain no requirement that gas or oil be produced in order to hold the lease,were determinative of the abandonment issue.
on september,the district court denied the cross motions for summary judgment.the district court rejected k d argument that west virginia code operated to terminate the lease,observing that this provision specifically states that the rebuttable presumption does not apply to leases for gas storage purposes.thus,the provision had no bearing on the outcome of the case.id.
the district court also rejected eqt interpretation of the durational provision.acting sua sponte,the district court found as a matter of law that the lease was divisible or severable,rather than entire.the district court reasoned 
the lease agreement has two purposes for the lease of the land,the exploration for and the production of oil and gas versus the use of the property for the storage of gas and the protection of stored gas.a separate consideration is stated for each.the fact that the leases indicate that the lessee is not obligated to drill any wells is further evidence that the terms of each are not interrelated,as is the fact that the lessee has taken no steps whatsoever to develop the oil and gas underlying the property.
the district court then considered the segment of the lease relating to production of oil and gas and concluded that given that the initial lease term had elapsed without eqt attempting to explore for or produce oil or gas,this segment had expired.because eqt is using a portion of the premises for protection of gas storage,however,the district court concluded that the segment of the lease relating to gas storage and the protection of gas storage remains in effect.
the district court determined that the resolution of these issues leaves general issues of material fact,such as whether the entire premises was necessary for gas storage and whether drilling from an area of the premises not necessary for gas storage protection would interfere with gas protection.
eqt subsequently moved for reconsideration,arguing both that the district court finding of severability was erroneous and that the district court acted improperly by raising this issue sua sponte without giving the parties notice or an opportunity to respond prior to issuing its order denying the cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied this motion.
in anticipation of the district court making a final ruling,the parties jointly filed stipulations before the court that resolved all remaining factual issues with the understanding and agreement that by entering into these stipulations the parties are not waiving any objections or rights to appeal any rulings by the court,including those contained in the order denying cross motions for summary judgment.
the district court issued its final order on january.the court reiterated its conclusion from its previous order that the lease at issue was divisible and that the segment of the lease for the purpose of exploration for and production of oil and gas had expired.given this,and taking into account the stipulations made by the parties,the district court concluded that the plaintiff may drill exploration and production wells on areas which are not within the gas storage protection area and which extend horizontally under the gas storage protection to the marcellus shale area.
eqt timely appealed.
eqt raises two arguments on appeal that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that the lease was divisible into separate segments,one for exploration and production,and one for storage and protection of storage and that the district court erred in finding that the segment of the lease for exploration and production had terminated after its initial lease term.in essence,this appeal asks us to resolve whether the lease required eqt to explore for or pr
