on february,irwin barkan and d d barkan llc collectively barkan filed suit against donuts,and usa,collectively donuts in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.barkan alleged,among other claims that donuts breached a contract in which it had promised to work with barkan and the cit group cit to refinance barkan debt to cit.at trial,the district court excluded the testimony of barkan expert and granted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,judgment as a matter of law in favor of donuts.barkan now appeals both decisions.because barkan failed to present sufficient evidence of causation,we affirm the district court judgment as a matter of law.
facts and background 
a.the evidence presented at trial 
because this is an appeal of a judgment as a matter of law,we set forth the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see malone lockheed martin,cir quoting espada lugo,cir affirming renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b.
in late and early,barkan became a donuts franchisee when he purchased five stores for million.simultaneously,barkan obtained from donuts a store development agreement sda giving him the right,subject to various limitations,to develop additional stores in a specified area of downtown providence.to finance these purchases,barkan secured several loans from cit through a program established to facilitate financing for donuts franchisees.pursuant to this program,donuts guaranteed the loans and promised to make cure payments to cit if barkan failed to meet his obligations.
shortly after this initial transaction,barkan purchased three additional sdas from donuts for each.these sdas gave barkan the right to open stores in other specified locations in rhode island.like the providence sda acquired at the time of the initial transaction,these new contracts also contained various restrictions to his right to develop,including a requirement that barkan be qualif ied for expansion under donuts franchise performance rating system.
pursuant to these development rights,barkan eventually opened new stores in burrillville,warwick,and the providence place mall.to finance this expansion and his donuts franchise operations,barkan testified that he borrowed million from the dms group,which eventually sued barkan to recover much of this allegedly unpaid debt.at about the same time,barkan also began preparations to open a handful of additional stores in areas covered by his sdas.these preparations included acquiring property,negotiating leases,researching neighborhoods,and navigating the zoning processes.
throughout,barkan existing stores struggled to satisfy donuts inspections,thereby jeopardizing barkan right to develop under the sdas.inspectors cited the stores for failing to comply with various donuts regulations,including requirements.
barkan network of stores also struggled financially,and ultimately barkan closed two of the locations.throughout and,barkan repeatedly contacted donuts representatives to express concern about the financial health of his operations.barkan suggested various avenues to profitability,including restructuring his cit loans.by the end of,however,barkan financial difficulties had become so acute that he had ceased paying his monthly obligations to cit,forcing donuts to make cure payments barkan also fell behind on payments to donuts for royalty fees,advertising fees,and the remaining purchase price of the sdas.
finally,in june,donuts and barkan entered into a settlement agreement agreement in an effort to resolve the disputes that had arisen between them and to improve the financial condition of barkan operations.under the agreement,barkan promised to,among other things,timely make all future payments to cit and release donuts from any claims barkan might have against it in exchange,donuts agreed to some modifications of the sdas and,under section of the agreement,promised the following 
donuts hereby agrees to work with barkan and cit to attempt to such existing debt.specifically,donuts will request that cit issue a new note for the current balance of the financing,including interest and cure payments,with interest only payments for months,except for reimbursement to donuts for the above cure payments,such reimbursement to be made at the time of refinancing.donuts makes no representation that cit will provide such refinancing 
in keeping with this promise,donuts assigned betheny blowers to work with barkan and cit.in march,before the agreement was even finalized,blowers contacted laura sneed at cit about barkan debt restructuring blowers learned that the maximum amount of time for which cit would permit payments was four months,and that barkan would need to fill out a rewrite form requiring documentation about his credit history and overall finances.barkan testified that,in april,he faxed the rewrite form to cit along with fifteen pages of attachments that specified his restructuring request,listed his creditors,estimated his personal net worth,and summarized the financial condition of his operations.
over the next few months,blowers continued her efforts to facilitate the restructuring.at barkan request,blowers spoke with sneed about cit waiving its refinancing fee and increasing the period of time for which cit would accept payments.blowers also notified barkan of cit request for a business plan and financial statements.in response,barkan provided blowers with what he termed a brief narrative and supporting projections,which blowers forwarded to cit.
shelly vice president of the portfolio unit at the ultimate decision maker on this particular restructuring request.prior to her involvement with barkan restructuring,she was made aware of his failure to make the monthly payments due to cit.rush deposition testimony,which was read at trial,indicated that she was frustrated with the information,or lack thereof,available to assist with her decisionmaking.this frustration apparently began when she received what she found to be incomprehensible financial documentation about barkan operations.specifically,she was given a pile of spreadsheets,completely lacking the type of summary information such as a balance sheet or income she typically relied on in analyzing a restructure request.rush claimed she never saw the rewrite application that barkan testified he faxed to cit.
in what was the only conversation rush would ever have with a donuts representative pertaining to barkan restructuring efforts,rush and sneed called blowers to clarify their confusion about this mass of information.rush testified that blowers was vague and not forthcoming on the phone.in response to rush complaint about the lack of clarity in the documentation,blowers said she could not share any more information.rush asked if any of barkan stores had closed and,after an initially evasive response,blowers told rush that barkan had closed two stores in the prior months.at that point,rush expressed disappointment that she had not been notified about these closures which had significant implications for barkan existing debt rush testified that the store closures were a red flag that there a lot of activity happening out there that is been sic defined or shared toward the end of the phone call,rush told blowers that she could not act on the application without better information no additional information was ever provided,however,and cit did not approve the restructuring.
although barkan promised in the agreement to make timely payments to cit,he failed to do so.similarly,barkan continued to fail to make payments on other debts he owed to donuts and the dms group.eventually,in january,donuts sent barkan a notice to cure.in february,barkan filed for bankruptcy,and eventually his remaining stores were sold for million.
b.the district court exclusion of the expert testimony and judgment as a matter of law 
after almost six days of trial,the district court considered the admissibility of the testimony of barkan purported expert,frank torchio.barkan theory of damages was that his inability to restructure his debt prevented him from developing additional stores under the sdas,and torchio was prepar
