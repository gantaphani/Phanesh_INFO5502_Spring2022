opinion of the court 
this is an insurance coverage dispute arising out of a lightning strike and fire that damaged keil hall on the campus of mercersburg academy.we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
mercersburg,the insured,is a private secondary and college preparatory boarding school located in mercersburg,pennsylvania.keil hall is a building located on the mercersburg campus that was constructed over a century ago.it has four levels above ground and a basement containing mechanical equipment.the first floor of the building contains public spaces,including an auditorium and classrooms,while the second and third floors contain dormitory housing and common meeting areas.the fourth floor was designed and constructed for dormitory use as well,and had been used for that purpose in the past.at the time of the fire,however,that floor was used as attic and storage space,and was cordoned off from students 
the chimney of keil hall was struck by lightning on june,igniting a fire that caused extensive damage to the roof and fourth floor of the building,as well as smoke and water damage to the first,second,and third floors.following the fire,mercersburg submitted a timely claim to its property insurance carrier,republic franklin insurance company,for the costs to repair the actual fire damage,additional costs to repair the building that were made necessary to bring the building in compliance with applicable laws and various building codes,and lost business income.
republic franklin primary policy only provides coverage for those repairs necessary to return the property to its condition.accordingly,mercersburg purchased a separate ordinance and law endorsement to its policy.that endorsement provides in relevant part 
coverage for loss to the undamaged portion of the building.if a covered cause of loss occurs to covered building property,we will pay for loss to the undamaged portion of the building caused by enforcement of any ordinance or law that a requires demolition of parts of the same property not damaged by a covered cause of loss b regulates the construction or repair of buildings,or establishes zoning or land use requirements at the described premises and c is in force at the time of loss.
coverage cost of construction coverage.if a covered cause of loss occurs to covered building property,we will pay for the increased cost to repair,rebuild or construct the property caused by enforcement of building,zoning or land use ordinance or law.if the property is repaired or rebuilt,it must be intended for similar occupancy as the current property,unless otherwise required by zoning or land use ordinance or law.
the insurer failure to reimburse the academy for all of its costs incurred as a result of the fire prompted it to file a complaint in united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania alleging breach of contract and bad faith.specifically,mercersburg contended that the ordinance and law endorsement required republic franklin to pay for repair and renovation costs required by the americans with disabilities act ada,the pennsylvania handicapped act and universal accessibility standards promulgated thereunder.et.et,as well as other pennsylvania statutes and national building codes including the international mechanical code,the building officials and code administrators international,the national electric code,the international plumbing code and the standards of the american society of heating,refrigerating and engineers.
after extensive factual and expert discovery,the parties settled,resolving all disputes except those related to the ordinance and law endorsement claim republic franklin motion for summary judgment on those claims was granted by the district court.it held that the ada did not apply because the dormitory space in keil hall was not a public accommodation within the meaning of that statute,the pha also did not apply because the costs of the fire damage did not reach the threshold cost to trigger coverage under the act,and nationally recognized standards of design and construction and pennsylvania laws that require private schools to meet certain basic safety standards were inapplicable because the borough of mercersburg had not officially adopted any building code.this appeal followed

iii.merits 
mercersburg asserts that numerous accessibility upgrades made to keil hall were required to comply with the dictates of title iii of the ada and,thus,the costs of those upgrades are covered under the ordinance or law endorsement.the district court ruled that the ada protections afforded disabled persons do not apply to the dormitory space on the second,third and fourth floors of keil hall because dormitory housing is not considered transient lodging that is covered under the ada.citing part appendix a,mercersburg responds that the ada regulations specifically include dormitories as transient lodging,and hence the endorsement covers the costs of accessibility modifications required by the ada.
under title iii of the ada it is unlawful for a public accommodation to discriminate against an individual on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations.id.a.public accommodation is defined in terms of categories which the legislative history indicates should be construed liberally to afford people with disabilities equal access to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled,pt,cong.admin.news,pt,at.the ada obligates a public accommodation only with respect to a facility that is used as,or designed or constructed for use as,either a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility.b i ii.when a public accommodation or a part of it is altered,the act requires that alterations be made so that the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,including individuals who use wheelchairs.a.if an alteration 
could affect usability of or access to an area of the facility containing a primary function,the entity shall also make the alterations in such a manner that,to the maximum extent feasible,the path of travel to the altered area and the bathrooms,telephones,and drinking fountains serving the altered area,are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities where such alterations are not disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope 
given this legal landscape,our analysis of the ada claim proceeds as a inquiry whether mercersburg academy is a public accommodation,the repairs and renovations made to keil hall are alterations,and keil hall is a facility that is used as,or designed for use as,either a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility.
the district court held that mercersburg satisfied the public accommodation requirement and that its repairs and renovations to keil hall were alterations within the meaning of the ada.each of these determinations is correct.mercersburg is a secondary school,which by definition makes it a place of education,and,accordingly,a public accommodation under j.moreover,existing regulations establish that the repairs made to keil hall were alterations because they included remodeling,renovation,or reconstruction b alterations include,but are not limited to,remodeling,renovation,rehabilitation,reconstruction,historic restoration,changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements,and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and partitions.thus,the first two steps of our inquiry are easily satisfied.
the third step is markedly more difficult.the district court first held that the four floors of keil hall should each be evaluated separately as to whether they are covered under the ada,rather than evaluating keil hall as whole,to determine whether the floors are used as,or designed or constructed for use as,a place of public accommodation.employing that principle,the court held that the first floor of keil hall was used as a public accommodation under the ada because it contained classrooms,see j a place of education,and an auditorium,see id.d a place of public gathering,but that the second through fourth floors were not public accommodations because dormitories do not fall within any of the twelve categories enumerated in.according to the court,dormitories are more akin to residential units such as apartments and are not covered by the transient lodging like inns,hotels,and are covered under a.
mercersburg argues that the district court erred because dormitories are transient lodging as defined by the ada regulations and dormitories are part of boarding schools,and,as such,are places of education.we agree.although the statutory definition of public accommodation does not expressly mention private school dormitories,those facilities satisfy that definition under conventional principles of interpretation 
the ada implementing regulations belie republic franklin the district court the ada does not apply to dormitories.see bragdon abbott,d citing chevron,natural res.defense council,d,and explaining that the implementing regulations and views of the united states department of justice doj as to the ada are entitled to deference.the ada accessibility guidelines adaag provide that design,construction,or alteration of facilities in conformance with the ada shall comply with the applicable provisions of appendix a to this part adaag.chapter of appendix a to the adaag provides guidelines for accessible transient lodging,which specifically includes hotels,motels,inns,boarding houses,dormitories,resorts and other similar places of transient lodging.part app.a,ch.emphases added.moreover,chapter of the adaag expressly states that transient lodging includes a building,facility,or portion thereof,excluding inpatient medical care facilities and residential facilities,that contains sleeping accommodations.transient lodging may include,but is not limited to,resorts,group homes,hotels,motels,and dormitories.part app.a,ch.emphasis added.in a nutshell,the ada regulations expressly define dormitories as transient lodging and provide that any construction or alterations to dormitories occurring after january,must comply with the ada and its guidelines.b.
beyond the plain language of the ada implementing regulations,there is an additional reason to rule that it applies to dormitories student integral part of boarding school one of the facilities,privileges,advantages,and accommodations of a place of education covered by title iii of the ada.as a private secondary school,mercersburg itself is a public accommodation that is required to comply with the ada.j.a school may not discriminate on the basis of a student disability nor deny a reasonable accommodation to a disabled student.housing facilities such as dormitories are certainly part of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,and accommodations offered by schools to its students.a.thus,mercersburg could not lawfully deny a disabled student a reasonable accommodation that would permit him or her to live in its dormitories.indeed,the doj has consistently taken the position that all aspects of a school student activities and of the educational experience including,for example,research activities and fraternity housing are covered by title iii of the ada.see doj,americans with disabilities act technical assistance letters,doc,at h ttp may,stating that fraternity houses,owned and operated by a university,like all other aspects of a university experience,are part of the place of education,and are covered by title iii see also doj,americans with disabilities act technical assistance letters,doc,at july,stating that research activities conducted by a university,even if primarily for pharmaceutical research rather than education,are covered by title iii as part of the university obligation to ensure compliance with t itle iii in all of the activities of the place of public accommodation that it owns or operates,a provision intended to be read broadly for the same reasons,the doj has taken the position that student housing is covered by title iii of the ada.see,united states brief as amicus curiae in opposition to emory university motion to dismiss,at stating that student housing owned and operated by a private university is covered by t itle iii of the ada as a facility,privilege,advantage,accommodation of a place of education in this context,we hold that the ada applies to dormitories and,therefore,to all four floors of keil hall 
in light of our disagreement with the district court as to the applicability of the ada to dormitories,one question remains whether any renovations made to the undamaged portions of keil hall were demanded by the ada.there are two standards of compliance under the ada the new construction standard and the alteration standard.new construction is the highest standard and it applies to public accommodations designed or constructed after january,and to the portion of a facility altered after that date.see a.iii at,reprinted at,explaining that b ecause it costs far less to incorporate accessible design into the planning and construction of new buildings and of alterations as compared to retrofitting existing structures,a higher standard of readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities has been adopted in the ada for new construction and alterations and part,app.b,section stating that,with respect to altered portions,t his part does not require alterations it simply provides that when alterations are undertaken,they must be made in a manner that provides access emphasis added see also brother cpl investments,d,stating that the ada does not require alterations.the new construction standards are contained in part,and,as discussed above,the adaag are set forth in appendix a of part.
existing facilities also must comply with the ada,but that obligation is governed by the barrier removal provision of course,if existing facilities are altered,they must conform to the alteration standard,which requires that alterations,as well as the path of travel to primary function areas,be made readily accessible to disabled individuals.a areas containing primary functions refer to those portions of a place of public accommodation where significant goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages or accommodations are provided,pt,at,reprinted in.as a practical example,the path of travel to bathrooms,telephones,and drinking fountains must be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.id.at.as our court has observed,
while congress chose not to mandate full accessibility to existing facilities,it required that subsequent changes to a facility be undertaken in a manner.the use of such changes must be made available to all.the emphasis on equal treatment is furthered,as well,by an expansive,remedial construction of the term usability.usability should be broadly defined to include renovations which affect the use of a facility,and not simply changes which relate directly to access.
kinney yerusalim,cir.it is clear,then,that to the extent the law in force at the time of the the alterations to keil hall a public accommodation after the fire and required the academy to make paths and travel accessible to the areas on each floor of keil hall,the plain language of the ordinance and law endorsement covers mercersburg costs of complying with the ada.
with this backdrop,we part with the district court in two respects.first,because dormitories are transient lodging and mercersburg is a place of education,we conclude that the dormitory floors of keil hall are public accommodations within the meaning of the ada.second,because the endorsement requires the insurer to cover alterations to the undamaged portions of keil hall caused by enforcement of the ada,republic franklin may be liable for certain expenses not directly caused by the fire.of course,any alterations,renovations improvements made to any floor of keil hall that were not mandated by the ada,discretionary alterations do not fall within the scope of coverage of the endorsement,and,as a result,do not obligate the insurer.given that the ada applies to all four floors of keil hall,it is for the district court to determine on remand specifically which renovations if any undertaken by mercersburg in its repair of keil hall were mandated by the issue the court did not reach in its memorandum opinion.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of republic franklin on mercersburg ada claim and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this analysis.
mercersburg also contends that,much like the ada,the universal accessibility standards promulgated under the pennsylvania handicapped act pha.stat.et et,required the accessability upgrades,including the installation of an elevator,to keil hall.the district court held that the pha did not require modifications to keil hall because the repairs required by the fire total less than of the building value.
the pha requires that certain structural improvements be made to maximize accessibility and usability by persons with physical handicaps.stat.unlike the ada,the pha generally applies to buildings used by the public rather than to certain enumerated public accommodations.id.moreover,the pha expressly applies to schools and dormitories.id.
under it,when an existing private building is remodeled,the remodeling must be done to ensure that the remodeled area is accessible to and usable by persons with physical handicaps to a degree based on the proportional cost of the remodeling to the overall worth of the building.id.c b.if the construction cost of the remodeling is less than of the value of the building,only the remodeled area or areas shall be made accessible to and usable by persons with physical handicaps.an accessible route to the remodeled area or areas is not required.id.c b i.if the construction cost of the remodeling is greater or equal to percent but less than percent of the worth of the building,the remodeled area or areas shall be made accessible to and usable by persons with physical handicaps,and an accessible route to the remodeled area or areas shall be provided.id.c b ii.if the construction cost is percent or more of the value of the building,the entire building must be made accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.id.c b iii.for purposes of the latter two subsections,construction made over a period may be calculated as the construction cost.id.c b iv.
the same analytical framework applicable to the ada claim,discussed above,necessarily applies to mercersburg pha claim.simply stated,the lightning strike only damaged certain portions of keil hall when those portions were remodeled,mercersburg was required to comply with the pha republic franklin,in turn,was obligated to pay for that remodeling which it has done it was only obligated to pay for further remodeling to undamaged portions of keil hall if that remodeling was required by an ordinance or law.
the question,then,is whether the pha required any further remodeling.as explained above,the answer to that inquiry depends on a factual determination and the cost of remodeling compared to the worth of keil hall.specifically,if the repairs required by the fire total less than of keil hall total value,the pha requires no further modifications and it follows that republic franklin is not obligated to cover the cost of any further modifications.the converse is also true if the repairs required by the fire total exceed of keil hall total value,then the pha demands further modifications and it follows that republic franklin must cover all or some of the portion of the cost of those modifications under the ordinance and law endorsement.
both sides agree that the total value of keil hall is.moreover,during oral argument,counsel for mercersburg agreed that the aggregate cost of repair to keil hall caused by the fire totals substantially less than of the total value of the building.as a result,the pha required no further modifications to keil hall.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of republic franklin on the pha claim.
building codes 
finally,mercersburg contends that the ordinance and law endorsement provides coverage for renovations it made to undamaged portions of keil hall pursuant to,inter alia,the international mechanical code,building officials and code administrators international,the national electric code,the international plumbing code,and the standards of the american society of heating,refrigeration and engineers.it is undisputed that the borough of mercersburg,in which the academy is located,has adopted none of the foregoing codes nor any other building codes.relying on that fact,the district court held that the terms law and ordinance in the endorsement should be afforded their ordinary meaning.as such,it refused to construe those terms to include building codes or standards adopted by private organizations but not adopted by a governmental body having authority to do so here.

the task of interpreting an insurance contract is generally performed by a court rather than by a jury.the goal of that task is,of course,to ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written instrument.where a provision of a policy is ambiguous,the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer,the drafter of the agreement.where,however,the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous,a court is required to give effect to that language.
