this appeal arises from a dispute between mariner health care mariner and the preston law firm the law firm over legal fees.because a valid compromise was formed through email communications,and because the terms of the compromise clearly and explicitly provided for a permanent discount,we vacate and remand for entry of judgment in favor of mariner.
facts and background 
for many years,the law firm represented mariner in numerous litigation matters.for the most part,they maintained a good working relationship.in late and early,mariner fell behind on paying its legal fees to several law firms,including the law firm.discussions ensued between mariner and the law firm over reaching an agreement on a payment plan for approximately million in legal fees owed through february,and for all legal fees earned thereafter.at first,all communications attempting to resolve the payment dispute were between paul preston preston,managing partner of the law firm,and devin ehrlich ehrlich,general counsel for mariner.in march,roslyn lemmon lemmon,another partner at the law firm,took primary responsibility for negotiating payment from mariner.
prior to march,telephone discussions had taken place between lemmon and ehrlich.on march,lemmon sent ehrlich an email setting forth an agreement regarding payment of the legal fees.ehrlich sent a reply email the same day collectively,the march emails.the march emails had the subject line payment of bills and read in full 
paul asked that i put my understanding of the proposal in writing so that we all have a clear and consistent understanding.
bills submitted through february,will be paid out in equal monthly payments.by way of example,if mariner owes p c million in bills submitted during this time frame,monthly payments in the amount of will be made until the bills are paid in full.no reduction of the bills will be made.going forward from march,bills will be paid within days.
please let me know if my understanding is correct.thanks.
reply by ehrlich 
we have never discussed reductions in bills,but otherwise your understanding is correct.
pursuant to the march emails,an initial contract for payment by mariner of legal fees was formed.
on march,following additional telephone discussions,ehrlich sent lemmon an email the march email setting forth an agreement with terms different from the march emails.the march email had the subject line fee payment agreement and read in full 
this will confirm we will pay all fees incurred as of february,as follows 
the total will be discounted by percent.
will be paid on or before march 
will be paid on or before april 
will be paid on or before may 
or whatever the true balance is will be paid on or before june 
all fees incurred from march forward will be paid on a day basis.
please let me know if your understanding differs.thanks.

the installment payments totaled million a discount on legal fees assumed to total million.each installment payment was made on time,except that the may installment paid on may,was for only with the remaining being paid on june.payments for legal fees incurred after february,and subject to a payment schedule were made by mariner prior to this lawsuit,but most were several days or weeks late.
between may and may,several emails were exchanged between lemmon and ehrlich regarding the underpayment of the may installment by the may email chain.the may email chain had the subject line p c payment and effectively clarified that the may installment was the third scheduled installment pursuant to the terms of the march email and should have been for.lemmon insisted on immediate payment of the additional and ehrlich responded that he would get on it right away.the additional was paid on june.
on august,more than one month after million had been paid pursuant to the march email,lemmon sent ehrlich an email the august email with the subject line payment of overdue p c bills.the august email read in relevant part 
dear devin,
at some point last fall,our bills simply stopped being paid without any warning or explanation whatsoever long overdue bills remained unpaid notwithstanding repeated inquiries.negotiations began and we finally and reluctantly agreed to reduce the total amount owed by for all time incurred through the end of february,with the further understanding that all time incurred from the end of february forward would be paid on a ninety day cycle 
very truly yours,
roslyn lemmon 
the next relevant communication between the law firm and mariner was an email sent by lemmon to ehrlich on september,the september email.the september email,included in an email chain,had the subject line re preston cowan 
the timing is not great,but at some point soon,we need to reach an agreement.with the upcoming trial dates,we need to talk about a retainer for payment.as an additional request,we would also ask that mariner consider paying at least a portion of the amount previously compromised.in other words,we took million out of million owed,and now request that mariner consider paying the debt in full.
the final relevant communication between the law firm and mariner was an email sent by lemmon to one of ehrlich colleagues,copying ehrlich,on october,the october email.the october email had the subject line p c fee proposal and read in relevant part 
w e conditionally accepted a partial payment of million on a debt of million to accommodate mariner during its with sava.in accordance with my previous and discussions with devin,we would ask that mariner now consider paying the debt in full 
thanks and best regards,
no further communications concerning payment of legal fees occurred until the law firm threatened and then brought this lawsuit.
in,the law firm filed suit in louisiana state court under petition on open account for unpaid legal fees of,later corrected to.the law firm also claimed additional attorneys fees for prosecuting its claim under.ann.a,the louisiana open account statute.mariner removed to federal district court,and the law firm amended its complaint to add breach of contract and fraud claims.
mariner moved for summary judgment which the district court denied in part on june,finding that there remained genuine issues of material fact as to the existence,validity,and breach of a compromise agreement the district court later denied cross summary judgment motions on august,finding again that an issue of fact exists as to whether a compromise was reached,and an issue of fact exists as to whether the contract was modified.
a bench trial was held on september and september.the primary evidence was the testimonies of preston,lemmon,and ehrlich,and the emails exchanged between march and october.
preston testified that he was the managing partner at the law firm in.he stated that he turned over negotiations,or at least the frontline negotiations,to roslyn lemmon,although he continued to control the details of it.he explained that an arrangement was reached in that the law firm was going to receive,over a period of time,a payment of million as partial payment of the approximately million that was owed to it for fees through february of.he claimed that the agreement was for a temporary discount and that mariner was required to pay the balance when its cash flow problems subsided.
lemmon testified that she was the partner at the law firm responsible for resolving the legal fees dispute.she stated that her authority to resolve the legal fees dispute with mariner was never at issue.she also stated that the first she heard that the discount was temporary was in the context of this litigation and that she understood the discount to be permanent.with respect to the september email language and the october email language requesting that mariner consider paying the discounted fees in full,she stated that she did have any legal authority to request it,but she thought that maybe mariner would appreciate some of the law firm efforts and compensate it for them.
ehrlich testified that he was the general counsel for mariner in and that he negotiated with the law firm for a permanent discount of the legal fees.he stated that,pursuant to telephone discussions and the march
