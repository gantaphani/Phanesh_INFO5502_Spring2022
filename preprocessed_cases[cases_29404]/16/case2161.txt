background 
procedural history 
plaintiff,a michigan corporation,filed suit against defendant,a new york corporation,in the eastern district of michigan on may,on the basis of diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy being over,claiming that in may of,defendant breached the provisions of the distributing agreement the agreement held between the parties for the distribution of arizona beverage products.plaintiff mailed the complaint to defendant corporate counsel along with a request for waiver of service in may of.the waiver had not been returned as of july of,so plaintiff sent an additional copy of the complaint to defendant corporate counsel via overnight courier.
on or about august and,defendant sent two letters to counsel for plaintiff demanding arbitration.defendant based its demand on a provision of the agreement that provided for arbitration of any dispute that arose between the parties and that the arbitration must be commenced within days following the event giving rise to the claim,and further provided that the failure to abide by such time requirement shall constitute a waiver by the distributor plaintiff of any rights in respect of,and shall constitute a bar on,any claims by distributor on the basis of such event or circumstance.at.defendant letters advised counsel for plaintiff of this provision in the agreement requiring arbitration of all disputes.
on september,via telecopier and mail,defendant restated its objections to plaintiff attempted service by overnight courier and reiterated that plaintiff claims were subject to mandatory arbitration.the letter also advised plaintiff that defendant was willing to continue a dialogue with you in the hopes of achieving at sic an amicable settlement of your claims.please call if you are interested.at.plaintiff arranged for an entry of default on september,with the clerk of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,and on october,plaintiff filed a motion for entry of default judgment.
defendant claims that it was not served with any papers regarding plaintiff actions with respect to the entry of default,but learned of plaintiff actions by way of a message from plaintiff attorney to defendant counsel.defendant responded by sending a letter to the district court via facsimile with a copy to plaintiff counsel wherein defendant explained that entry of default was inappropriate because defendant had not been served in the action,and that defendant had served plaintiff with a demand for arbitration as required under the agreement.at that time,defendant also filed a to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for insufficiency of service of process,and moved to dismiss or stay the action pending arbitration.
on october,defendant initiated arbitration proceedings before the american arbitration association aaa in new york city,new york and,in accordance with the aaa rules,defendant served the arbitration papers on plaintiff via certified mail,return receipt requested.by letter dated october,the aaa acknowledged receipt of defendant arbitration demand and requested plaintiff responses thereto.the aaa also scheduled an administrative conference regarding the matter for october,and provided information and papers with which the parties were to begin the process of selecting arbitrators and hearing dates.
plaintiff filed a motion on october,seeking a temporary restraining order preventing defendant from arbitrating the matter.on november,the district court denied plaintiff motion for a temporary restraining order,and scheduled a hearing for the various other motions.thereafter,the district court entered an order on april,denying defendant motion to dismiss,while also denying plaintiff motion for entry of a default judgment,but granted defendant motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.
in the meanwhile,the arbitration set in new york city was going forward.on april,plaintiff filed its arbitration summary and statement of issues with the aaa setting forth a claim for damages under the agreement.defendant,upon consent of the arbitrators,filed a motion to enforce the contractual time limitations as set forth in the agreement,and thereby requested a dismissal of plaintiff claims as.defendant argued that the time limit barred plaintiff claim and that u nder new york law which governs this dispute as per of the agreement,it is well established that only the arbitrators and not the courts are charged with enforcing a contractual time limitation.at citation omitted.plaintiff responded by claiming that the period did not begin to run until april,and that defendant filing of its demand for arbitration on october,satisfied the time limitation period.in the alternative,plaintiff argued that because of defendant alleged false and deceptive acts throughout the arbitration process,the limitations period should be tolled under the doctrine of equitable tolling.a hearing before the arbitrators was held on march,regarding defendant motion to dismiss plaintiff claim as untimely thereafter,on or about march,the arbitrators issued their award dismissing plaintiff claims in their entirety.
on may,plaintiff,filed an amended complaint in the district court.defendant filed a motion on may,seeking to confirm the arbitration award and to dismiss plaintiff amended complaint.at.plaintiff,in turn,filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court held a hearing on the various motions on august,and then entered a memorandum opinion and order on march,confirming the arbitration award and finding the remaining motions moot.
plaintiff timely appealed from the district court march,memorandum opinion and order confirming the arbitration award and denying plaintiff motion for summary judgment as moot.oral argument was heard on january,after which defendant moved to file a supplemental brief as to a case raised by the panel at oral argument,general star national insurance administratia asigurarilor de stat,cir.defendant motion was granted and its supplemental brief has been considered by this court.
background of the relationship between the parties 
defendant is a supplier of certain alcoholic and beverages including arizona brand teas and soft drinks plaintiff is a distributor of beverage products in the greater detroit,michigan area.in april of,defendant began supplying arizona beverage products to plaintiff for distribution in three michigan counties wayne,oakland,and macomb.about two months later,on june,plaintiff entered into a sales agreement the sales agreement with a third party for the purchase price of,for purposes of securing the rights to distribute arizona products in two additional michigan counties,livingston and washtenaw.according to plaintiff,defendant had to consent to plaintiff purchasing the rights to distribute arizona products in these two additional counties.thereafter,on september,plaintiff and defendant entered into the agreement now at issue for the purpose of providing the terms under which defendant would supply and plaintiff would distribute arizona products.

discussion 
entry of default 
plaintiff first argues that the district court erred in setting aside the clerk entry of default and in dismissing plaintiff motion for a default judgment.
the decision whether to set aside an entry of default under federal rule of civil procedure c is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united coin meter,seaboard coastline,cir citing keegel key west caribbean trading.
legal standards 
the process by which a default may be entered by the clerk of court,and a default judgment entered thereafter by the district court,has been succinctly stated as follows 
the federal rules of civil procedure require a defendant to serve an answer within twenty days of being served with a summons and complaint.a a.rule permits the clerk to enter a default when a party fails to defend an action as required.the court may then enter a default judgment.b.a party against whom a default judgment has been entered may petition the court to set aside the default judgment under rules c and b for good cause,and upon a showing of mistake,or any other just reason.

plaintiff attempted to receive a waiver of service from defendant pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d.rule d provides in part 
an individual,corporation,or association that is subject to service under subdivision e,f,or h and that receives notice of an action in the manner provided in this paragraph has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of serving the summons.to avoid costs,the plaintiff may notify such a defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waive service of a summons.the notice and request 
a shall be in writing and shall be addressed directly to the defendant,if an individual,or else to an officer or managing or general agent other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process of a defendant subject to service under subdivision h 
d a.rule h provides in relevant part 
unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name,and from which a waiver of service has not been obtained and filed,shall be effected 
in a judicial district of the united states in the manner prescribed for individuals by subdivision e,or by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer,a managing or general agent,or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and,if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires,by also mailing a copy to the defendant 
the district court noted that despite plaintiff attempts,it had not received a waiver of summons pursuant to rule d,and that,as a result,plaintiff was required to comply with formal service of process.at.specifically,the court opined 
i think the parties agree that plaintiff request for waiver was in writing.it is unclear whether it was addressed to the appropriate officer or agent of defendant,and it not clear whether the request informed defendant of the consequences of complying or not complying with the request under rule d.
because defendant did give its consent to waive service,plaintiff was then required to follow the formal procedure for service of process and it undisputed,i think,that plaintiff did not properly affect sic service on defendant under the rules.
plaintiff sent defendant the complaint and summons by airborne in care of defendant counsel.
it is not clear to me that under the federal rules overnight mail is not a proper is a proper method of serving an officer agent or authorized agent.and even if were proper service,it is not clear that the clear that the receptionist signed for it.and there is any evidence,i do think,in this record that she is an authorized agent of defendant to receive that kind of document.
the district court did not err in concluding that service of process was not effected inasmuch as plaintiff failed to receive a waiver of summons from defendant,and failed to demonstrate that it served an authorized agent by virtue of an unknown receptionist signing for the overnight package for purposes of complying with rule d or rule h.see lsj inv,cir noting that where the facts are undisputed,determination of whether there was adequate service of process is a question of law see also friedman estate of presser,cir finding that service of process under rule c c ii,as amended by current rule d,requires copy of return of notice and acknowledgment form.
therefore,the question becomes whether plaintiff effected service of process under the alternative method of rule h that being,the manner prescribed for individuals under rule e.see.h.federal rule of civil procedure e provides 
unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed,other than an infant or an incompetent person,may be effected in any judicial district of the united states 
pursuant to the law of the state in which the district court is located,or in which service is effected,for the service of a summons upon the defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state 
the district court found that plaintiff had complied neither with michigan procedures for effecting service of process,nor those of new york.on appeal,plaintiff provides no argument as to whether it complied with the laws of either michigan or new york for effecting service of process.from our independent review of those procedures,we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the procedures of both states were not properly met.see.d stating that service of summons and copy of the complaint must be made upon officer,resident agent,director,trustee,or person in charge of an office or business establishment of the corporation,and sending a summons and copy of the complaint by registered mail to principal office of corporation cplr mckinney personal service upon a corporation or governmental subdivision shall be made by delivering the summons as follows to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.
accordingly,the district court did not err in finding that plaintiff had not properly effected service of process on defendant,see lsj inv,at,and therefore did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the entry of default.see amen,at.in light of this holding,we need not weigh the three factors a court considers when setting aside an entry of default when service of process has been properly effected,and plaintiff claim regarding the district court denial of its motion for a default judgment is moot.
ii.stay pending arbitration 
plaintiff next argues that the district court erred in granting defendant motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration where defendant actions constituted a waiver of the arbitration provision.
