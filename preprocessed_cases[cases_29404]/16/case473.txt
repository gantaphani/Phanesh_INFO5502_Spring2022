this civil case arose out of a dispute over authorship of the fourth edition of a college textbook,personal nutrition,published in august.
gail zyla was a visiting lecturer in nutrition at tufts university from until,when she became an independent writer.earlier in the,she had worked with professor marie boyle struble,a professor and director of the graduate program in nutrition at the college of elizabeth,on the second and third editions of the textbook.both were listed as struble had the first edition with someone else in and was the lead author on all three editions.
in,zyla sued struble,her publisher thomson corporation,and the division of thomson that published the textbook wadsworth over the publication of the fourth edition zyla was unhappy that,in late,thomson had extended the authors original deadline for submission of materials,as well as the publication date for the fourth edition,in order to accommodate struble busy schedule,instead of adopting zyla proposal to give zyla a greater share of the work and of the royalties if the deadline were missed again.zyla withdrew from the project in and notified thomson and struble that they had no permission to use any of the work she had done to date for the fourth edition.only when the book was published,she said,did she learn that her work had been used in the fourth edition without her permission and without appropriate attribution zyla continued to receive of the total royalties on the fourth edition her residuals from earlier editions,but not the she would have received had she not withdrawn as an author.
zyla suit in federal court sought damages and royalties,asserting seven causes of action copyright infringement violation of the lanham act,a breach of contract by struble breach of contract by thomson a petition for a declaration voiding an agreement signed by zyla that reduced the royalties to which she was entitled for the fourth edition to intentional interference with advantageous relations by struble and violation of.laws ann.ch,and.after discovery,the district court entered summary judgment for defendants on all claims.zyla appeals.we affirm.
the facts are described in the light most favorable to zyla,the party.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.
personal nutrition is an undergraduate textbook published originally by west publishing,and later by its successor,thomson.the first edition of the textbook was published in.struble and eleanor whitney were the,with struble acting as lead author.when whitney chose not to work on the second edition,zyla was brought in to replace her as on that edition.although zyla did not have the college teaching experience,academic affiliation,or doctoral degree usually preferred for textbook authors,the editor believed that she could handle the job because she was an experienced writer in the field of nutrition.the second edition was published in.
on january,west entered into an agreement with struble and zyla who are referred to jointly as author in the contract to prepare the third edition.this agreement the third edition agreement stated that it was to be governed by minnesota law.it provided for the authors to receive a combined royalty of percent of net paid sales.zyla was to receive percent of this total,while struble was to receive percent section of the agreement provided that 
if the contribution of any one or more authors is not delivered to west on or before the due date or west determines that the contribution will not be so delivered,west may,after consultation with the authors,terminate this agreement with respect to the author s and continue this agreement with the remaining author s alone or with one or more mutually acceptable,or terminate this agreement.
section provided that if an author did not participate in subsequent revised editions of the book,
author will be paid of author compensation under the third edition with respect to the first revised edition in which author does not participate and of such compensation with respect to the second revised edition in which author does not participate.
the third edition agreement also contained an assignment of copyright in section,which provided that 
author hereby assigns and transfers to west all present and future copyrights and other rights in the work including revised editions of the work and supplements thereto.
the work was defined in section as the third edition of personal nutrition.
the third edition was published by west in.afterwards,thomson succeeded to west rights and obligations under the third edition agreement.
between late august and early september,thomson,struble,and zyla signed an addendum to the third edition agreement to cover the fourth edition the fourth edition addendum.the addendum changed the royalties allocation provision in the third edition agreement to give to struble and to zyla for the fourth edition.it stated that s hould the responsibilities of the authors change during the writing of the revision,the royalties can be adjusted accordingly upon written receipt by the publisher of a letter from the authors signed by both authors reallocating the royalties.the addendum also set a manuscript deadline of march,and stated that if this deadline was not met,the publisher may terminate this agreement or addendum.
in october,walter marshall,the editor whom thomson assigned to work on the textbook,became concerned that struble was behind in her work and suggested that she turn over some of her work to zyla to enable the two authors to meet the march deadline.struble declined to do so.by early,it became clear that the authors would not make the deadline.zyla had submitted revisions for two of her four assigned chapters and two of the eleven nutrition action features that she was to write,and struble had sent a new feature entitled the savvy diner but no revisions for her seven assigned chapters.
thomson chose not to exercise its power under section of the third edition agreement to terminate the agreement with either author.instead,in late,marshall extended the deadline until april,and then until may.the parties dispute the motivation for this move,but the dispute may be more apparent than real.zyla points to a letter from struble to thomson counsel,ken carson,that stated that the fourth edition was placed on hold so that marie boyle struble could first revise her other nutrition with diane morris.marshall admitted in his affidavit that he wanted struble to finish community nutrition first,but said that he wanted struble to do so because community nutrition was further along and he believed that struble worked more effectively when concentrating on one project at a time.he claimed that his first priority in extending the deadline was to promote personal nutrition,which had greater revenue value than community nutrition.in addition,he stated that he also based his decision on the belief that author tardiness was often manageable and on his experience working with struble,who had previously missed internal deadlines because of deaths in her family but had been able to catch up with the final schedule.
zyla told marshall that she would agree to the new deadline,provided that more of the work and royalties would be assigned to her if struble again failed to meet the deadline.marshall and struble refused.marshall stated in his affidavit that he refused because he was concerned that a reallocation would lead struble to withdraw from the project.he believed the participation of struble was critical to the book success,at least in part because she had been the lead author of the first edition.
zyla then wrote a letter to marshall on april,stating that she would not participate further in the fourth edition and that the revisions that she had submitted to struble and thomson could not be used without her permission.sixteen days later,on april,marshall sent zyla a letter informing her that struble had finished the fourth edition and was about to send it for publication.the letter asked zyla to sign an agreement,dated april,indicating her acknowledgment that as agreed under section of the third edition agreement,she would receive of the author royalties from the fourth edition.zyla signed the agreement the april agreement.
the fourth edition was published in august,with struble listed as the sole author.zyla bought a copy in february and says that she discovered then,to her surprise,that the fourth edition copied her line edits to chapters one and two her definitions of terms used in those chapters a section that she had written on dietary reference intakes her revisions to the nutrition action sections of chapters one and four her drawing of a shopping cart and her caption for a photograph.zyla received a copyright registration in those materials two months later,on april.in her registration application,she described the materials as a derivative work of the third edition.after obtaining the registration,zyla called and wrote to thomson and struble,telling them that they had infringed her copyright.
zyla was also displeased with the acknowledgments section to the fourth edition,which contained a statement that i struble am grateful for the work that gail zyla contributed to the second and third editions of this text her insights are reflected in this new edition,still.zyla felt that this statement falsely implied that she had made no contribution to the fourth edition.
on august,zyla brought suit in federal district court against thomson and struble seeking injunctive relief and damages.the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing principally that they had not violated any copyright held by zyla because any copying was de minimis,that zyla had not shown any actual confusion from the acknowledgments section,and that thomson had no obligation to terminate the agreement with struble.they also argued that zyla had already received money exceeding the amount that any reasonable jury could award in damages.thomson had given zyla to defray her expenses in preparing the fourth edition.she spent approximately and never returned the remainder.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all claims.the court found that zyla had assigned any copyright in the revisions for the fourth edition to thomson under the third edition agreement and that the lanham act did not apply because no trademark was at issue.applying minnesota law to the breach of contract claims,the court held that no contract was formed between struble and zyla and that thomson was not in breach of the contract because section of the third edition agreement provided that thomson may terminate a contract with an author who fails to meet a deadline but imposed no obligation on thomson to do so.the court rejected zyla petition for a declaration voiding the april agreement because the court found that even if that agreement had somehow been fraudulently obtained,it merely reiterated the terms of section of the third edition agreement,which zyla had not alleged was obtained fraudulently.the court also rejected zyla claim that struble intentionally interfered with advantageous business relations by refusing to allot zyla more of the royalties and work,concluding that struble actions did not have the effect of interfering with any existing contractual relationship.finally,the court found that zyla.laws ann.ch.claim failed because the claims upon which it was of contract,tortious interference,and already been rejected.
the district court also denied motions by zyla to amend her complaint to add a claim for punitive damages and to impose sanctions on the defendants for discovery misconduct.
zyla appeals from the grant of summary judgment and the denial of those motions.we consider each of her claims in turn.
the district court,construing the third edition agreement and the fourth edition addendum,correctly held that thomson was the sole owner of all copyright interests in the fourth edition.
zyla can not claim a copyright interest in her purported revisions.it is undisputed that under the third edition agreement,zyla assign ed all present and future copyrights in the third edition including revised editions of the third edition to thomson.by zyla own admission in her april copyright registration application,her revisions are a derivative work based on,and pervasively incorporating material from,the third edition.only thomson,which is the sole owner of the third edition,may claim a copyright interest in such derivative works.see gracen bradford exchange,cir since the copyright owner bundle of exclusive rights includes the right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work,the creator of the derivative work could not copyright them without permission to incorporate the material 
furthermore,even if zyla could claim a copyright interest in her revisions,she assigned that interest to thomson as well.the third edition agreement assigns to thomson all copyright interests in the fourth edition,as a revised edition of the third edition.given that the authors of standard textbooks frequently change over time as this case illustrates,as zyla was not involved in the first edition,this allocation of copyright interests to the publisher reflects commercial realities.
zyla argues,however,that it is ambiguous whether this assignment includes revisions incorporated into the fourth edition without her authorization,and that under minnesota law,which governs the interpretation of the third edition agreement,ambiguities must be construed against thomson as the drafting party.current tech.concepts irie.we see no such ambiguity.the assignment provision contains no such limitation.
zyla also argues that the fact that she informed thomson in april that it was not to use her work on the fourth edition deprived thomson of any copyright interest.but neither the third edition agreement nor any communication by thomson in response to zyla letter indicated an abandonment of thomson copyright.
zyla makes a last argument that regardless of the contract language,the parties course of performance confirmed her ownership of a copyright in her work for the fourth edition.she bases this argument largely on the fact that marshall,the editor whom thomson assigned to work on the textbook,took the position that if struble did some improper copying,then struble should compensate zyla,and that marshall did not say then that zyla had no copyright interest in the materials.this argument mixes apples and artichokes.a publisher pragmatic attempt to solve a problem between two authors,neither of whom owns the copyright in the published work,is not an abandonment of its own copyright interest 
dismissal of zyla copyright claim was appropriate.
lanham act 
zyla claimed a violation a of the lanham act,a,based on her contention that the acknowledgments section of the fourth edition falsely credited struble with authorship to zyla detriment.zyla argument sets up a quandary,of course.zyla expressly withdrew from the fourth edition,so crediting her with authorship would have itself created a possible false attribution claim.
the district court dismissed the lanham act claim,essentially for failure to state a claim.zyla correctly argues that a is not limited to the protection of trademark holders.the existence of a trademark is not a necessary prerequisite to a a action.see dastar twentieth century fox film,d while much of the lanham act addresses the registration,use,and infringement of trademarks and related marks,a,a is one of the few provisions that goes beyond trademark protection.
