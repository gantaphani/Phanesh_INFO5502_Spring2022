appellant pci transportation,pci appeals the district court orders denying remand,and a preliminary injunction.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
pci receives and distributes rail cargo in fort worth,texas,via a distribution warehouse serviced by a spur that comes off of railroad lines of the union pacific railroad union pacific and the burlington santa fe railroad bnsf.appellee fort worth western railroad fwwr is a railroad that operates passenger and freight trains within texas.fwwr operates a switching yard that,via pci spur,links its warehouse to the union pacific and bnsf railroads.under various agreements,union pacific and bnsf deliver railcars to fwwr switching yard,after which fwwr switches and delivers these cars to customers of union pacific and bnsf,such as pci,for unloading.after the railcars are unloaded,fwwr returns the empty cars to the main railroads lines.bnsf and union pacific compensate fwwr for its switching services,but the railroads also charge fwwr for the time that it retains the railcars at its switching yard.in turn,fwwr collects fees from customers such as pci.
in august,after a dispute had arisen concerning demurrage charges imposed on pci by fwwr,these parties entered into a contract the contract aimed at avoiding further conflict,a goal that the contract has obviously failed to attain.the entire contract is a one page letter,and is with two different names confidential demurrage contractual agreement and confidential contractual agreement for free time.the language of the contract provides that pci will have four days,and fwwr is committed to providing pci with a minimum of one switch daily,seven days per week.the contract also establishes the demurrage rate applicable after free time expires.the contract was never placed in evidence before the district court,but following oral argument on appeal,it was submitted to us under seal.pci alleges that,since the execution of the contract and in conformity with common industry practice,fwwr has delivered cars to pci on a,fifo basis.
in february,more than two years after execution of the contract,a new dispute arose between pci and fwwr concerning demurrage charges for the month of june.pci contends that fwwr had engaged in several practices that resulted in improper demurrage fees being charged to pci,to wit fwwr varied from its practice of delivering cars to pci on a fifo basis,with the result that fwwr held cars intended for pci customers for longer than four days at times,fwwr had delivered rail cars on pci spur backwards,making it impossible for pci to unload those cars and requiring fwwr to move the cars out,reverse them,then bring them back in again with the next group of cars fwwr provided pci with a delivery schedule the effect of which virtually guaranteed that some of the cars would be held in the fwwr yard for more than four days,thereby unnecessarily incurring demurrage costs.
pci filed suit in state court alleging that fwwr had breached the contract.pci also claimed intentional interference with contractual relations and requested a tro,a temporary injunction,and a permanent injunction restraining fwwr for a period of ten years from providing purported notice of cancellation of any agreements between pci and fwwr refusing to deliver less than ten railroad cars with cargo per day to pci on its spur,to the extent such cars are available delivering cars to pci spur on any basis other than on the basis of delivery of those cars which have been in fwwr possession the most number of days and imposing or attempting to impose any demurrage charges upon pci,or in the alternative,imposing or attempting to impose any demurrage charges upon pci when timely delivery of pci cars on a,basis would have resulted in no demurrage charges,and in those situations where no demurrage charges would accrue but for fwwr service failures.the state court granted pci request for a tro.
fwwr then removed the case to federal court,asserting that pci state law claims were completely preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act of iccta the iccta overhauled the interstate commerce act ica,including the elimination of the interstate commerce commission and replacing it with the surface transportation board stb.pci filed a motion for remand,arguing that the suit was outside the ambit of the iccta.the district court denied pci motion,concluding that removal was proper under the doctrine of complete preemption.
pci filed a request for a temporary injunction and hearing in the district court,seeking essentially the same relief that it had sought in state court.this was pci second motion for injunctive relief.its first motion was denied for procedural reasons.the district court denied pci motion without a hearing,holding that,as a result of pci failure to proffer into evidence the contract on which it based its claims for relief,it had not demonstrated,prima facie,that the district court,as distinguished from the stb,had jurisdiction to entertain pci requested injunctive relief.the district court also held that pci failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable injury absent an injunction.pci appeals the district court denial of its remand motion,denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction,and refusal to hold a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction.
ii.analysis 
appeal of the remand order 
an order denying a motion to remand is not appealable as a final decision within the meaning of standing alone,such a ruling can not be appealed unless certified by the district court under b pci nevertheless contends that we have jurisdiction to consider its appeal of the remand order,citing the ninth circuit decision in university of washington the court in held that an appeal from an order denying a motion to remand is reviewable prior to final judgment when joined with an interlocutory appeal from an order granting or denying an injunction 
several other circuits have held the same,either expressly or implicitly we have not previously addressed the question whether the denial of a remand order becomes reviewable when it is coupled with an interlocutory appeal of an injunction order under a.we did conclude in texas real parties in interest,however,that the denial of a remand order can be reviewed in conjunction with the interlocutory appeal of an order denying a claim of eleventh amendment immunity,the latter order being appealable under the collateral order doctrine in deciding that we could consider the order denying remand,we looked solely to whether the eleventh amendment immunity issue was and properly before us on appeal implicit in that decision is the conclusion that,once appellate jurisdiction has been established,we are compelled to address questions of federal jurisdiction.
in the context of the collateral order doctrine,we perceive no difference in the distinction between eleventh amendment immunity and remand.we thus conclude that pci appeal of the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction is both and properly before us.consonant with our holding in real parties in interest,we first consider the jurisdictional question whether the district court erred in denying pci motion to remand the case to state court.
removal and remand 
the district court denied pci motion to remand the case,relying primarily on the northern district of iowa reasoning in cedarapids,chicago,central pacific railroad and of the iccta.section provides 
b the jurisdiction of the board over 
transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates,classifications,rules including car service,interchange,and other operating rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers and 
the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state,
is exclusive.except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.
pci contends that removal was improper because the relief that pci requests is expressly excluded from the reach of the iccta by of that act.we exercise plenary,de novo review of a district court assumption of subject matter jurisdiction.
pci argument 
fwwr establishes rates for its transportation services,as well as rules and practices related to those services,including specifically the rules relating to the imposition of demurrage fees the injunctive relief pci seeks would regulate the operation of fwwr switching yard and would therefore fall squarely under b.pci argues nonetheless that its dispute with fwwr is purely over fwwr compliance with the contract,and that,under,such contracts are not subject to the iccta and thus not under the jurisdiction of the stb.section provides in relevant part 
a one or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions.
b a party to a contract entered into under this section shall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.
c a contract that is authorized by this section,and transportation under such contract,shall not be subject to this part,and may not be subsequently challenged before the board or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this part.
the exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate state court or united states district court,unless the parties otherwise agree.
none disputes that fwwr is a rail carrier and pci is a purchaser of its services 
pci position on the applicability of can be distilled to two arguments.first,pci argues that the stb has no jurisdiction to hear claims even related to agreements governed by,citing the language of the statute and decisions of the stb refusing to consider such disputes we see nothing in the statutory language that supports pci related to argument,however,and pci fails to direct us to any such language.in fact,b specifies that a party entering into such a contract has only those duties specified by the terms of the contract.the decisions of the stb cited by pci also fail to support its argument.fuller southern pacific transportation is inapposite because the contract at issue there was a comprehensive one that purported to govern the entire relationship between the litigants.fuller,a manufacturer,sued southern pacific,alleging that the railroad had imposed unreasonable storage and demurrage charges.the transportation in question was subject to a contract for carriage.fuller argued that its claims fell outside that contract and thus within the stb jurisdiction,because the contract did not explicitly address demurrage or storage charges.the stb rejected fuller argument and held that the claims fell outside its jurisdiction.although the contract did not explicitly address those areas,it did incorporate by reference the tariffs,rules and regulations which would apply if there was no contract to govern those areas not covered by the contract.therefore,held the stb,the referenced tariff terms became part of the contract.the other two stb decisions that pci cites add nothing to the analysis 
in cross oil refining marketing,union pacific railroad a decision not cited by pci,the stb considered whether a series of purported contracts were the kind governed by.cross oil argued that did not apply because,under the agreements in question,service and equipment were to be provided on the same basis as those provided to other shippers.the stb rejected cross oil argument,ruling that the transportation at issue was provided under the contracts each contract affirmatively stated that it was made pursuant to,identified the origins and destinations,and specified the terms of the contract and the rates for the commodities.as in fuller,the stb held that rail contracts can incorporate tariff provisions by reference yet still fall outside the stb jurisdiction.
unlike the agreements at issue in the cited cases,the contract in the instant case is very limited in scope,and does not incorporate any tariff provisions.as such,any relief requested by pci that falls outside of the contract express coverage is not governed by.
the second argument made by pci is that all relief requested is within the contract coverage and therefore within the reach of.in its reply to fwwr response to pci motion to remand,pci contended in district court that even if the contract does not specifically address whether fwwr was required to place cars at pci spur on a fifo basis,or whether fwwr is required to place a full spot of ten cars at pci spur each day,the consistent conduct of the parties under the contract constitutes their agreed interpretation,causing those requirements to be incorporated into the contract.on appeal,pci no longer asserts that the parties prior conduct interpreted or supplemented the contract,arguing instead that all requested relief is within the language of the contract,namely that the parties prior conduct,as well as the texas railroad industry customs and practices,inform what the term switch means.pci relies primarily on the deposition testimony of charley godsey,the operations manager for fwwr,to establish that the term switch encompasses the portion of injunctive relief that fwwr insists falls outside of the contract.fwwr counters that the switch language in the contract was solely meant to change the number of days per week that switching services would be provided to pci,but does not provide an alternative definition of switch.
under texas law,the primary concern of a court construing a contract is to ascertain the true intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.even when there is neither patent nor latent ambiguity in the wording of a contract,e xtrinsic evidence may,indeed,be admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning consistent with that to which they are reasonably susceptible.a specialized industry term may require extrinsic evidence of the commonly understood meaning of that term within the specialized industry.pci provides a string of citations to the godsey deposition to support its definition of switch.a review of the cited portions of the record reveals,however,that godsey was never asked to explain or define the meaning of providing a switch.his deposition lays out how fwwr deals with customers and states that fwwr does not impose demurrage charges when the mistakes are its own,uses a fifo method to determine which cars to deliver,and will fill the spot available on a customer spur each day.none of this,however,is ever tied by the deposition to the meaning of providing a switch.
even if we were to accept pci broad definition of switch,the injunctive relief it seeks is still broader than that which the contract governed.the last portion of pci request seeks to control fwwr ability to impose demurrage charges under any circumstances,or in the alternative,any circumstance in which no demurrage charges would accrue but for fwwr service failures,not just those situations in which fwwr fails either to provide a full spot of cars or to deliver the cars on a fifo basis.we hold that,at the very least,a portion of fwwr claims are governed by the iccta.
complete preemption 
for the district court to have removal jurisdiction,requires that the case be one over which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.whether a claim arises under federal law is a question determined by reference to the plaintiff complaint.as a defendant may remove a case only if the claims could have been brought in federal court,the question for removal jurisdiction must also be determined by reference to the complaint.under the complaint rule,federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.as a general rule,absent diversity jurisdiction,a case will not be removable if the complaint does not affirmatively allege a fed
