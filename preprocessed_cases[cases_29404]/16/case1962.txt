appellant claude bassett bassett was an assistant football coach for the university of kentucky uk from when he resigned due to allegations of the national collegiate athletics association ncaa rules infractions.bassett filed suit against ncaa,the southeastern conference sec and the university of kentucky athletic association ukaa,alleging conspiracy to violate antitrust laws,fraud,civil conspiracy and tortious interference with contract.the district court granted ncaa,the ukaa and the sec motions to dismiss the antitrust and civil conspiracy claims and granted ncaa and the sec motions to dismiss plaintiff fraud claims.later,the district court granted summary judgment for ncaa and the ukaa on plaintiff remaining claims.bassett now appeals the district court granting of ncaa motion to dismiss the antitrust claim and the district court granting of summary judgment on the ukaa fraud and alleged breach of contract claims.
the appellant appeal is not well taken.we find the district court correctly determined appellant antitrust claim was not commercial in nature and failed to allege an antitrust injury.furthermore,appellant failed to demonstrate reasonable reliance and causation on his fraud claim and appellant failed to plead a breach of contract claim and,even if he did,such contract would be void ab initio as against public policy.
appellant claude bassett was an assistant football coach for the university of kentucky uk from when he resigned due to allegations of ncaa rules infractions.bassett coached at brigham young university for twelve years prior to joining the uk football program and thereafter,bassett was hired by the uk head football coach,hal mumme,as recruiting coordinator and assistant coach.bassett employment contract was with the ukaa,which serves as the athletic department for the uk.on november,larry ivy,the uk athletic director,called bassett and mumme to a meeting,wherein ivy confronted bassett about alleged rules violations.in the course of the meeting,ivy asked bassett to resign in light of the allegations of impropriety.in exchange for bassett resignation,ivy assured bassett no further actions would be taken against him.as a result of the november,meeting bassett resigned.the following day,the uk disclosed that bassett,along with several other assistants,had been fired.the uk conducted an internal investigation of its football program to determine if any ncaa rules violations occurred.the investigation proceeded with assistance from the sec commissioner and lasted through february.on february,the uk turned over the results of its internal investigation to ncaa.as a result,ncaa issued official inquiry letters to bassett,regarding alleged infractions,who responded in writing through his counsel.bassett declined to appear at the hearing before ncaa,to address allegations which included,improper recruiting inducements provided to prospective student athletes and high school coaches and academic fraud in aiding enrolled student athletes by preparing their papers or having student assistants type papers for enrolled student athletes.shortly thereafter,ncaa imposed sanctions against the uk for violations of ncaa rules.in addition to the sanctions against the uk,ncaa issued a show cause order requiring bassett and any ncaa member institution seeking to hire him in an athletically related position,from january,through january,to appear before ncaa division i committee on infractions to consider whether the member institution should be subject to the show cause procedures of bylaw,which could limit the coach athletically related duties at the new institution for a designated period.on september,bassett filed his complaint against the sec,ncaa and the ukaa.
on appeal,bassett claims the district court erred in granting appellee ncaa motion to dismiss bassett antitrust claim on the basis of its finding that ncaa enforcement of its rules did not affect commerce and bassett had failed to state an antitrust injury.bassett further contends the district court erred in granting the ukaa summary judgment motion on bassett fraud and breach of contract claims when it found bassett failed to demonstrate causation and reasonable reliance.

bassett antitrust claim against ncaa 
bassett complaint alleges ncaa,the ukaa and the sec conspired to prevent appellant from coaching at any ncaa member school in violation of the sherman antitrust act,and the clayton act,as the conspiracy amounts to a group boycott.the district court determined bassett antitrust allegation failed to state a claim because ncaa actions were not commercial in nature and therefore,did not violate the sherman act.the district court held enforcement of the rules at issue here is not within the purview of antitrust law as it is not related to the ncaa commercial or business activities.ja.citing smith ncaa,cir,the district court held,r ather than intending to provide the ncaa or any of its member schools with a commercial advantage,enforcement of rules governing recruiting,improper inducements,and academic fraud primarily seek s to ensure fair competition in intercollegiate athletics.ja.
even if they were commercial in nature,the district court reasoned,bassett had still failed to state a claim because he failed to plead an antitrust injury.the district court relied on brunswick pueblo,d,which defined antitrust injury as injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and injury that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.the district court went on to say,because the purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect competition rather than competitors,a plaintiff must allege injury,not only to himself,but to a relevant market.thus,failure to allege an impact on a relevant market amounts to a failure to allege an antitrust injury.ja citing banks national collegiate athletic ass n,cir,brown shoe united states,d.the district court determined bassett complaint failed to allege any anticompetitive effect on an identifiable market,failed to allege any decrease in the supply or quality of coaching services,increase in cost of coaching services,or any harm to consumers resulting from his punishment.ja.the district court concluded,bassett conclusory allegations of an antitrust by any factual allegations that resemble a cognizable antitrust insufficient.ja.
on appeal,bassett contends the trial court misunderstood the trade practice at issue.while bassett claims the district court incorrectly presumed bassett was attacking ncaa standards for defining improper conduct,bassett argues he was challenging ncaa enforcement of its standards.bassett contends ncaa permits member schools to deflect blame from themselves to coaches and such action is commercial in nature as it affects the labor market for all college coaches.the restraint at issue here is ncaa boycott of coaches unjustly or excessively punished because of its disciplinary system.these bans affect interstate commerce by preventing schools across america from hiring boycotted coaches to generate sports revenue and by preventing these coaches from seeking gainful employment with ncaa institutions.final reply brief of at.the restraint at issue group boycott of coaches without adequate due rooted in the commercialization of intercollegiate athletics.id.at.bassett contends ncaa disciplinary scheme impacts commerce because the discipline involves financial sanctions.bassett argues his complaint alleges sufficient facts demonstrating the commercial nature of the trade restraint.according to bassett,the sanction issued by ncaa may end a coach career.
bassett cites to paragraphs and of his complaint,which he contends provide the necessary facts to support his antitrust claim against ncaa.the pertinent paragraphs of bassett complaint may be summarized as follows 
a bassett spends a great deal of time exposing what he calls the myth and the scheme of college football.
b the thrust of his allegations is how ncaa relies on its members to perform the bulk of investigating alleged infractions,yet fails to abide by the due process guarantees under ncaa constitution and bylaws.he then alleges a conspiracy by ncaa which violates the sherman act and clayton act via denial of due process.
ncaa contends bassett admitted to rules infractions while coaching at the uk and therefore,the show cause order issued against him is the result of his own admitted misconduct and not a conspiracy to prevent him from coaching in violation of federal antitrust laws.ncaa argues it is ironic that bassett complains the order and sanctioning conduct constitute commercial activity when the rules enforced by ncaa,in fact,punish the attempted commercialization of student athletes and amateur intercollegiate athletics.furthermore,ncaa contends bassett has failed to allege an antitrust injury.rather,according to ncaa,bassett complaint alleges only injury to bassett and is devoid of facts alleging anticompetitive effects on a discernible market.
ncaa also contends bassett is barred by the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel and law of the case because he failed to appeal the district court dismissal of bassett similar claims against the sec and the ukaa,which are now final judgments.finally,ncaa contends the district court,on summary judgment,found bassett had failed to demonstrate that ncaa acted improperly in following its established enforcement procedures.therefore,ncaa claims bassett is collaterally estopped from relitigating the propriety of ncaa enforcement process.
commercial activity 
the sherman act states,e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.the united states supreme court has held congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan,d.if a court determines the activity at issue is subject to the sherman act it must determine if the restraint on trade is unreasonable under the per se rule or the rule of reason.as a consequence,most antitrust claims are analyzed under a rule of reason,according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed,and the restraint history,nature,and effect.id.some types of restraints,however,have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit,that they are deemed unlawful per se.id.citing northern pacific united states,d.per se treatment is appropriate o nce experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it.id.in the case before this court,section one of the sherman act applies if ncaa enforcement process and sanctions are commercial in nature.see worldwide basketball sport tours,ncaa,cir.
the clayton act provides a private right of action when a person is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.the district court,in analyzing bassett sherman act claim,determined the sherman act was not applicable because ncaa action was not commercial in nature and bassett complaint failed to allege an antitrust injury.the district court relied on our decision in worldwide basketball and sport tours,ncaa,cir,which held the sherman act applies when the alleged violation is commercial in nature.the district court determined the alleged violation in bassett complaint stemmed from ncaa enforcement program and the imposed sanctions arising therefrom.therefore,in order for the sherman act to apply,the enforcement action must be commercial in nature.ja.in examining court precedent in applying the sherman act to ncaa cases,the district court noted that some ncaa rules had been found to be commercial in nature.see worldwide basketball at national collegiate athletic association board of regents,d.the district court also discussed a case wherein ncaa action was held to be noncommercial.see smith ncaa,cir vacated on other grounds by ncaa smith,d.the district court found the reasoning of the third circuit in smith applicable to the facts in this case.in smith,the issue before the court was ncaa eligibility rules,and the third circuit affirmed dismissal of the antitrust claims against ncaa,holding they were not commercial.the district court in the present case held,like the eligibility rules in smith,ncaa enforcement of its rules governing recruiting,improper inducements and academic fraud,did not give ncaa a competitive advantage,rather,they were intended to ensure fair competition in intercollegiate athletics.ja,quoting smith at.
we agree with the district court analysis.in order to state a claim under the sherman act there must be a commercial activity implicated.as we held in worldwide basketball,the appropriate inquiry is whether the rule itself is commercial,not whether the entity promulgating the rule is commercial.worldwide at.although the question before us is whether the enforcement activities of ncaa violate the sherman act and not a particular rule,the analysis must focus on the enforcement action itself and not ncaa as a commercial entity.the smith decision further supports such analysis rather than focus on smith alleged injuries,we consider the character of the ncaa activities.smith at.bassett complaint contains considerable information on the size and scope of college football and the revenues generated by it.the complaint is wholly devoid of any allegation on the commercial nature of ncaa enforcement of the rules it determined bassett had violated.bassett complaint contends ncaa enforcement process violated its own due process requirements and,as a result,constitutes a sherman act violation.we find bassett complaint lacks the critical commercial activity component required to permit application of the sherman act.
similar to the eligibility rules in smith,ncaa rules on recruiting student athletes,specifically those rules prohibiting improper inducements and academic fraud,are all explicitly.in fact,those rules are and designed to promote and ensure competitiveness amongst ncaa member schools.violation of the applicable ncaa rules gives the violator a decided competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining highly prized student athletes.it also violates the spirit of amateur athletics by providing remuneration to athletes in exchange for their commitments to play for the violator football program.finally,violators of these rules harm the academically when coaches and assistants complete coursework on behalf of the.
if the rules themselves and the corresponding sanctions are not commercial,as the reasoning in smith supports,then the enforcement of those rules can not be commercial.as long as the enforcement of rules is reasonably and rationally related to the rules themselves,we find enforcement is a activity.although bassett seeks to compartmentalize the enforcement in his analysis,we must examine the activity of ncaa,and that examination encompasses both the rule and its enforcement.to do otherwise would result in an incomplete analysis contrary to worldwide basketball.such an examination demonstrates the enforcement of rules is not a commercial activity,therefore,we find the allegations in bassett complaint fail to state a claim under the sherman act and we affirm the dismissal by the district court of bassett antitrust claim.
the district court also determined bassett failed to allege an antitrust injury.the district court held bassett complaint alleges only injury to bassett and does not allege injury to a relevant market as required by case law.ja,citing banks national collegiate athletic ass n,cir brown shoe united states,d.taken as a whole,the legislative history illuminates congressional concern with the protection of competition,not competitors,and its desire to restrain mergers only to the extent that such combinations may tend to lessen competition.brown shoe,at.bassett complaint alleges that many coaches,including bassett,have been unfairly investigated or sanctioned through ncaa enforcement process that fails to apply the due process protections contained in ncaa enforcement process.while the complaint contains numerous allegations of the unfairness of the proceedings that resulted in bassett show cause sanction,the complaint is devoid of any allegation of the anticompetitive effect on the coaching market as pointed out by the district court.in banks,the seventh circuit held,
the fundamental requirement at issue in this dispute is that of a sufficient allegation of anticompetitive effects that would result or have resulted from the defendants actions the absence of such allegations is ordinarily fatal to the existence of a cause of action.the purpose of the sherman act is to rectify the injury to consumers caused by diminished competition it is for this reason that congress provided a treble damage recovery for private parties willing to initiate an enforcement action.thus,the plaintiff must allege,not only an injury to himself,but an injury to the market as well 
this circuit has held,a private antitrust plaintiff,in addition to having to show and proximate cause,must allege,and eventually prove,antitrust injury.in re cardizem cd antitrust litigation,cir.plaintiff,alleging violation of the sherman act,may allege antitrust injury either by alleging the plaintiff injury was caused by defendant engaging in antitrust violations,or by alleging the antitrust violation was the necessary predicate for its injury.id.at.
bassett complaint contains no allegations of the effect of ncaa enforcement of its rules on the coaching market.it merely states ncaa actions have resulted in the unfair investigation and sanction of coaches denied due process.bassett alleged injury stems from the denial of his due process rights and the conspiracy which deprived him the opportunity to defend himself against rules violations that led to the ban.bassett does not allege the ban resulted from some anticompetitive purpose.rather,as the complaint states,appellant injury,the ban,was the result of the rules violations.therefore,we agree with the district court that appellant claim fails to allege an antitrust injury sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under.b and we affirm the district court holding accordingly 
bassett complaint alleges the ukaa and the sec employees lied to bassett,encouraging him to take actions depriving him of the due process guaranteed him under both his employment contract with the ukaa and ncaa rules.that lie was the statement by ivy to bassett that if he resigned,no further investigation or prosecution would occur.because the ukaa employees reported bassett alleged violations to the ukaa and ncaa,bassett injury,the show cause order,occurred.
on summary judgment,the district court held,p laintiff has not presented probative evidence that his reliance on ivy promise that his own violations would not be investigated was reasonable under the circumstances.ja.the district court examined bassett contention that he naively relied on ivy representation in light of bassett sixteen years of coaching.the district court found ncaa charged bassett with violations,of which bassett admitted to violating in his october,response to ncaa official inquiry.ja.in finding for the ukaa,the district court held that under kentucky law,equity will grant no relief to a complaining party who has means of knowledge of the truth or falsity of representations.moore,owen,thomas coffey,cir.the district court found bassett could not demonstrate reasonable reliance on ivy promise not to investigate,insofar as ivy statement bound the university to refrain from investigating.ja.the district court found bassett admitted to annual appraisal of ncaa rules,attended annual meetings at which he would take a test on ncaa rules,bassett own employment contract stated he could be terminated for violations of ncaa the sec rules,and bassett testified he was aware ncaa member schools and coaches had a duty to violations to ncaa.the district court quoted bassett november,letter to ncaa stating,coach bassett does not begrudge larry the coach holds in high pursuing the investigation,since he was probably required under ncaa rules to do so.ja.because of bassett knowledge that the uk was required to,he could not reasonably rely on ivy promise.the district court also determined bassett failed to prove his damages were caused by the ukaa allegedly fraudulent actions.
bassett contends his fraud claim is so much that the investigation against him went forward.it that he was tricked into giving up his due process rights as a ukaa employee,rights which would have allowed him to better defend himself when the investigation took place.appellant final reply brief at.also,bassett contends he presented evidence that the uk routinely ignored its ncaa reporting obligations.further,bassett contends he suffered injury because he relinquished his due process rights with the uk internal investigation when he resigned.because ncaa investigation heavily relied on the uk investigation,bassett claims he suffered damages because he was punished for many infractions he did not commit.
the ukaa contends the district court correctly determined that under kentucky law bassett could not demonstrate reasonable reliance on ivy promise.the ukaa argues bassett resigned for a violation,taking a check payable to the uk and depositing it in his own checking account.later,when ncaa violations by bassett began to surface,bassett publicly confessed to several infractions and,once officially charged by ncaa,bassett counsel admitted bassett committed at least ten infractions.based on this evidence,the district court properly concluded bassett could not reasonably rely on ivy promise and could not prove injury attributable to the ukaa in light of his own confessions of impropriety.
in a kentucky action for fraud,the party claiming harm must establish six elements of fraud by clear and convincing evidence as follows a material representation b which is false c known to be false or made recklessly d made with inducement to be acted upon e acted in reliance thereon and f causing injury.united parcel service rickert,citing wahba don corlett motors.in kentucky,a claimant may establish detrimental reliance in a fraud action when he acts or fails to act due to fraudulent misrepresentations.rickert,at.
we find the district court properly presented and relied on relevant kentucky law.it is undisputed bassett knew of the uk duty to report infractions.bassett resigned when confronted with a violation for depositing a uk designated check into his personal bank account,a charge he admitted to at deposition.as stated abov
