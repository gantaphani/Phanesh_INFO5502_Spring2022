opinion of the court 
before us is an appeal by cooperneff advisors,cooperneff of the district court order denying its motion to compel arbitration of the claim filed by its former employee,steven zimmer,on the ground that the arbitration clause in the employment agreement between zimmer and cooperneff was unconscionable and,alternately,that cooperneff waived its right to compel arbitration by litigating its claims against zimmer.
zimmer,who holds a in economics from harvard university,has worked in the financial industry since,including at the federal reserve bank of new york and at morgan chase.he developed an interest in hedge fund management while he was working as a portfolio manager at the vanguard group vanguard,and began to search for a new position in that capacity.during the latter part of,zimmer discussed terms of employment with several interested financial companies,including cooperneff,a trading and investment firm.
as part of the interview with cooperneff chairman and ceo,andrew sterge,zimmer discussed and demonstrated the capabilities of a stock trading model that he had developed and that he intended to use in his new employment.cooperneff extended zimmer a job offer by letter dated february,which stated that the formal agreement between the parties would be embodied in a forthcoming employment agreement.the letter further stated that u ntil the employment agreement has been finally negotiated,signed and approved by bnp paribas global headquarters,either cooperneff or zimmer may at any time terminate further participation in negotiating the terms of employment with cooperneff.app.at.zimmer accepted cooperneff offer of employment.he alleges that by doing so,he forfeited approximately in deferred compensation from vanguard.
on march,the first day of zimmer employment,cooperneff provided zimmer with the employment agreement.paragraph of that agreement includes an arbitration clause covering any and all legal or contractual disputes of any nature arising at any time including after termination of employment between the employee on the one hand and the company and its affiliates on the other app.at.the employee must first submit such disputes to the company human resources department and,if not mutually resolved,the dispute would then be sent to an independent arbitrator paragraph c explains 
the types of claims and disputes that will be resolved under these procedures include all claims and disputes arising under this agreement or in connection with your employment by the company all claims arising from the terms and conditions of your employment all claims arising from the termination of your employment however,the company retains the right to bring any claims to enforce any of its rights in paragraph of this agreement directly in a court of competent jurisdiction and the company need not arbitrate any such claims.
app.at emphasis added.
paragraph is entitled exclusivity of services,confidentiality,intellectual property,return of documents and property upon termination,and enforcement provisions.app.at.that paragraph contains six clauses setting forth the parameters of the substantive provisions listed in the title.for example,the intellectual property clause states that any intellectual property that the employee invented,discovered,produced or the like using in whole or in part any of the company resources or on company time will be the sole and exclusive property of the company.app.at.the effect of the retention language underlined above is to authorize cooperneff to file a law suit against an employee on any issue covered in paragraph.
zimmer testified that he initially refused to sign the employment agreement because he was concerned about how the intellectual property clause in paragraph would be applied to his model.he stated that he brought his concerns regarding that clause to cooperneff human resources personnel and then to sterge.sterge stated that the offer letter did not contemplate his negotiation of the terms of the agreement and that zimmer would be terminated if he did not sign the agreement as drafted.zimmer eventually signed the agreement 
while zimmer worked at cooperneff,he implemented his model as part of a hedge fund called the cooperneff quantitative strategies fund.zimmer testified that he attempted to keep the model isolated from cooperneff systems to the greatest extent possible.for example,he did not permanently install the model in cooperneff system,instead bringing the model to work every day on a portable hard drive.
in june of,after zimmer had been at cooperneff for almost fifteen months,he gave notice that he would be resigning his position at cooperneff effective july.he intended to work at another hedge fund,qvt.at his exit interview on june,he was handed a copy of an unfiled complaint and motion for an injunction.the following day,cooperneff filed a complaint in equity against zimmer in pennsylvania montgomery county court of common pleas seeking injunctive and other remedies under six different theories inadequacy of legal relief,breach of contract,misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,and unfair competition.on july,the state court entered a temporary restraining order tro enjoining zimmer from disclosing or using the model the parties agree that at some point during the state court proceedings,three depositions were taken,two by zimmer and one by cooperneff.
zimmer and cooperneff proceeded to litigate on two fronts for the remainder of.zimmer filed a federal complaint and sought to remove cooperneff action to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.because zimmer had not yet received a copyright for the model,the district court dismissed his federal action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remanded the action to state court.
zimmer filed his application for a copyright on the trading model on july,and he obtained it by august.zimmer then filed the federal complaint underlying this appeal,alleging copyright infringement,defamation,conversion,tortious interference with contractual relations,and misappropriation of trade secrets.on august,following a hearing on zimmer motion for a preliminary injunction and tro,the district court granted him a tro ordering cooperneff to cease all use of plaintiff computer model and any copies,derivatives,modifications,or adaptations of the computer model until the court enters an order with respect to plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction.zimmer cooperneff advisors,wl,at.the district court then scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for september.
on september,cooperneff answered zimmer complaint and asserted two counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments pertaining to zimmer copyright ownership of the model.on september,zimmer answered cooperneff s complaint in state court.on september,cooperneff filed an amended answer to zimmer federal complaint,for the first time asserting a right to arbitration.
on september,the day before the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing,cooperneff filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay further proceedings.the district court heard argument on that motion and denied it from the bench before commencing the preliminary injunction hearing.on the second day of the hearing,cooperneff attempted to renew its motion to compel arbitration.on december,the district court filed a memorandum opinion denying cooperneff renewed motion to compel,holding that the arbitration agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable and that cooperneff had waived its right to compel arbitration.see id.at.cooperneff timely appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction under the copyright act,et,and,and.although there has been no final order,we have jurisdiction under the federal arbitration act faa,et,which permits appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.a.
we exercise plenary review over questions of law concerning the applicability and scope of arbitration agreements.harris green tree fin,cir.to the extent that the district court decision relied on factual findings,we review those findings for clear error.medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir.we review the district court determination of state law de novo.kowalsky long beach,cir.
the district court provided alternate grounds for its denial of cooperneff motion to compel,namely that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and that cooperneff had waived its right to compel arbitration by proceeding with its litigation against zimmer in state court.we discuss each holding in turn.
the district court applied pennsylvania law in holding that the employment agreement arbitration clause was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.procedural unconscionability refers specifically to the process by which an agreement is reached and the form of an agreement,including the use therein of fine print and convoluted or unclear language.harris,at.substantive unconscionability looks to whether the arbitration provision unreasonably favors the party asserting it.salley option one mortgage.
the district court found procedural unconscionability on the basis of the extreme inequality in bargaining position between zimmer and cooperneff at the time zimmer signed the employment agreement,and cooperneff s unwillingness to negotiate that agreement.zimmer,wl,at.in alexander anthony int l,cir,the primary authority relied upon by the district court,we held that an employment agreement that compelled crane operators in the virgin islands to arbitrate their claims and pay for that arbitration was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.in discussing procedural unconscionability,we stated that t he arbitration agreement in the hourly employee contract was prepared by the party with excessive bargaining power and presented to plaintiffs for signature on a basis.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we elaborated that the employer,which conducts business throughout the nation and the world,clearly possessed more bargaining power than two equipment operators with limited educational backgrounds and,at best,very narrow options for other employment.id.
in contrast to the employees in alexander,zimmer is a economist,previously employed by morgan chase and the federal reserve bank of new york.zimmer had been the manager of a two billion dollar fund at vanguard,had multiple offers of employment at the time he accepted cooperneff job offer,quickly secured a new position when he decided to leave cooperneff,and,according to counsel at oral argument,is currently working in the industry.
zimmer was told by cooperneff when it offered him the job that the offer was contingent on the negotiation of a signed employment agreement and that the negotiation of that agreement could be terminated by either party at will.cooperneff presented zimmer with the employment agreement on his first day of work.there is no evidence that zimmer either sought a copy of the agreement or sought to negotiate the agreement before accepting the job offer or beginning his employment.zimmer noted his concern with the intellectual property provision in paragraph of the agreement,but agreed to sign the agreement after speaking with sterge.thereafter,he remained at cooperneff for more than a year.there is no evidence that zimmer challenged the provision of the employment agreement that reserved judicial remedies exclusively for cooperneff.
zimmer educational background and field of employment are highly distinguishable from the crane operators in alexander.so too is the context in which the ultimatum was issued.zimmer was employed by vanguard when he accepted cooperneff offer of employment,and accepted that offer with full knowledge that an employment agreement had not yet been reached.he does not allege that he was denied an opportunity to negotiate the contract before accepting cooperneff offer of employment rather,he alleges that the company forced him to sign the agreement after he had already been on cooperneff payroll for over a month 
in summary,zimmer was a party with various employment opportunities who accepted an employment offer without first examining the terms of that employment and who now seeks to nullify the contract that he ultimately signed.under these circumstances,considering the entire context of zimmer dealings with cooperneff and his employment opportunities at the time he accepted cooperneff job offer,we conclude that zimmer did not lack a meaningful choice in accepting the challenged arbitration provision.therefore,we reverse the district court holding that the arbitration clause was unenforceable by reason of unconscionability.
in considering substantive unconscionability,the district court noted that this court and the pennsylvania superior court disagreed whether there was a presumption of unconscionability under pennsylvania law when an arbitration contract limits one party to arbitration but permits the other to reserve access to the courts.specifically,in harris,this court stated that a s long as the requirement of consideration is met,mutuality of obligation is present,even if one party is more obligated than the other.at citing greene oliver realty.three years after our decision in harris,the pennsylvania superior court stated that under pennsylvania law,the reservation by one party of access to the courts for itself to the exclusion of another creates a presumption of unconscionability,which in the absence of business realities that compel inclusion of such a provision in an arbitration provision,renders the arbitration provision unconscionable and unenforceable under pennsylvania law.lytle citifinancial,emphasis in original.based on lytle,the district court held that cooperneff had not shown any business realities justifying its exclusive right of access to the courts,and concluded that the arbitration clause was substantively unconscionable.
lytle was not reviewed by the pennsylvania supreme court.however,that court recently undertook an examination of the unconscionability issue in the context of an arbitration clause,confirming that the party challenging an arbitration agreement has the burden to demonstrate that the agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.salley,at.because we have concluded that the arbitration agreement here was not procedurally unconscionable and reverse on that basis,we need not decide whether the district court decision as to substantive unconscionability was correct.nonetheless,we take this occasion to note our concern about the district court holding on substantive unconscionability as well.
we deem it significant that the salley decision rejected the presumption relied upon by the district court in finding substantive unconscionability.the arbitration clause at issue in salley reserved judicial remedies for lenders in the lending industry.id.at.in expressly abrogating lytle,the pennsylvania supreme court concluded that the burden of establishing unconscionability lies with the party seeking to invalidate a contract,including an arbitration agreement,and there is no presumption of unconscionability associated with an arbitration agreement merely on the basis that the agreement reserves judicial remedies associated with foreclosure for lenders,to the exclusion of borrowers.id.at.salley did not hold that an arbitration clause reserving remedies could never be unconscionable rather,it held that there is a facially apparent business justification for such an exception in the context of mortgage lending,as the safeguards thereby preserved assure regularity and consistency for the benefit of both lender and borrower,and accordingly,there are sound pragmatic and policy reasons why foreclosure proceedings should be pursued in a court of law.id.at.
in this case as well,cooperneff asserted that there are plausible reasons why it needed to reserve for itself the option for access to the courts.nonetheless,because the district court relied on lytle discredited presumption of unconscionability and did not place the burden to demonstrate substantive unconscionability on zimmer,it is questionable whether the district court conclusion could be upheld.we do not hold,and we believe the pennsylvania supreme court did not hold,that unequal access to the courts can never be
