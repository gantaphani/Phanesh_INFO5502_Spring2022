facts and proceedings 
smith worked for emc as a commissioned salesman of technology products from through.smith annual compensation was governed by one of emc north american sales compensation plans,which detailed the salary,commissions,and bonuses for which smith was eligible.each year,smith met with emc representatives to sign a goal acknowledgment form gaf,which formalized and executed the year compensation plan.
in march,smith and emc entered into a series of negotiations about the terms of smith compensation plan.a gaf was signed by smith and greg johnson,the director of financial services,in september.the parties contest this compensation plan terms smith contends the agreement provided him per year,while emc alleges the version offered only.
the parties also dispute the document validity.johnson testified at trial that the compensation plan could not have been approved or authorized without the signature of bill connell,the director of operations.smith asserts that he never knew that johnson lacked the authority to execute the september gaf.
in march,smith sued emc for breach of contract,defamation,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligence,and gross negligence.he filed suit in texas state district court,invoking texas state law.emc removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of texas based on diversity jurisdiction.on october,emc filed an unsuccessful motion to abate and compel arbitration.emc then filed a motion for partial summary judgment on smith tort claims and on two of his breach of contract claims.smith withdrew his contract and negligence claims.the district court granted summary judgment on his defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress allegations.smith five remaining breach of contract claims,alleging that emc failed to compensate him fully from to,proceeded to trial.
on june,emc filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence relating to smith attorney fees.massachusetts law prohibits awarding attorney fees in breach of contract cases.because the compensation plans contained massachusetts provisions,the district court granted emc motion for purposes of evidence admitted at trial,but reserved judgment on smith legal entitlement to receive attorney fees.
the jury trial began on june.on june,emc employee greg johnson testified that he lacked authority to execute the september gaf that he and smith had signed.based on this evidence,on june,smith sought leave to amend his complaint to include a cause of action for fraud.the district court denied smith leave to amend.

iii.discussion 
denial of smith motion for leave to amend a fraud claim 
smith contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend a fraud claim both because the district court lacked any valid reason to do so under federal rule of civil procedure a and the parties tried the fraud claim by consent under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying smith motion under either subsection of rule.
federal rule of civil procedure a 
rule a requires a trial court to grant leave to amend freely,and the language of this rule evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend.travel am.airlines,cir quoting chitimacha tribe of harry laws,cir.a district court must possess a substantial reason to deny a request for leave to amend.id.quoting jamieson shaw,cir.however,decisions concerning motions to amend are entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court quintanilla.television,cir quoting wimm jack eckerd,cir.
as outlined by the supreme court,this circuit examines five considerations to determine whether to grant a party leave to amend a complaint undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments,undue prejudice to the opposing party,and futility of the amendment.rosenzweig azurix,cir citing foman davis,d.absent any of these factors,the leave sought should be freely given.foman,at.the district court correctly denied smith motion based on his undue delay in filing the motion to amend,as well as the proposed amendment undue prejudice to emc.
undue delay 
although it is generally true that leave to file amendments should be freely given,amendments should be tendered no later than the time of pretrial,unless compelling reasons why this could not have been done are presented.glass chem,cir quoting nevels ford motor,cir citation omitted.although rule a does not impose a time limit for permissive amendment,at some point,time delay on the part of a plaintiff can be procedurally fatal.whitaker city of houston,cir quoting gregory mitchell,cir.in such a situation,the plaintiff bears the burden of showing the delay to be due to oversight,inadvertence,or excusable neglect.id.quoting gregory,at.
to excuse the lateness of his motion to add a fraud claim,smith argues that any delay was caused by emc.he contends that he was unable to plead a fraud claim prior to trial for two reasons emc failed to fulfill its discovery obligations and emc waited until trial to argue that the september gaf required connell signature.we find both arguments unpersuasive.
although emc was sanctioned for discovery violations,smith does not argue that emc failed specifically to provide him with the gaf document at issue.as to smith second argument,it is undisputed that smith had not discovered prior to trial that johnson would testify that he alone could not authorize the september gaf.smith lack of information does not excuse his delay in recognizing a potential fraud claim.considering that the only claims with sufficient merit to proceed to trial focused entirely on the compensation plans,smith should have explored the documents validity during discovery.instead,smith focused on fruitless tort claims and alternate contract theories.in the parties pretrial order,smith contended that he and emc possessed merely an oral contract which governed his claims.per his own litigation strategy,smith did not make the gaf an issue prior to trial and did not question johnson about the gaf during his deposition.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that smith insufficient discovery did not excuse his adding a claim near the close of trial.
undue prejudice 
the district court correctly concluded that smith motion,filed on the second to last day of trial
