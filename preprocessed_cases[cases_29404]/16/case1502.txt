iii.analysis 
emc duty to defend lacy masonry

an insurer duty to defend 
under a typical cgl policy an insurer assumes two distinct duties the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend.see ohio cas.ins.time warner entm t,writ denied.whereas the duty to indemnify protects insureds from payment of damages they may be found legally obligated to pay,the duty to defend protects the same parties against the expense of any suit seeking damages covered by the policy.pine oak builders,great am.lloyds ins,quoting heyden newport chem.ins.
the texas supreme court recently summarized the duty to defend under texas law.see zurich am.ins.nokia.an insurer must defend its insured if a plaintiff factual allegations potentially support a covered claim,while the facts actually established in the underlying suit determine whether the insurer must indemnify its insured.id.citing guideone elite ins.fielder.baptist church.therefore,an insurer may have a duty to defend but,eventually,no obligation to indemnify.id.citing farmers.county mut.ins.griffin.
texas follows the rule,in which an insurer duty to defend is determined by the plaintiff pleadings,considered in light of the policy provisions,without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.id.at quoting guideone,at.a court resolve s all doubts regarding the duty to defend in favor of the duty and construe s the pleadings liberally.id.citations omitted.where the complaint does not state facts sufficient to clearly bring the case within or without the coverage,the general rule is that the insurer is obligated to defend if there is,potentially,a case under the complaint within the coverage of the policy.id.quoting heyden newport,at citation omitted.
the court must resolve all doubts regarding coverage in favor of the insured,but it can not look outside the pleadings,or imagine factual scenarios which might trigger coverage.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,merchs.fast motor lines.although the burden is typically on the insured to show that a claim against him is potentially within the scope of coverage under the policies,when the insurer relies on the policy exclusions,it bears the burden of proving that one or more of those exclusions apply.federated mut.ins.grapevine excavation,cir.when assessing the insurer proffered exclusion,t he court must adopt the construction of an exclusionary clause urged by the insured as long as that construction is not unreasonable,even if the construction urged by the insurer appears to be more reasonable or a more accurate reflection of the parties intent.utica ins.of am.indem,quoting union fire ins.of pittsburgh,hudson energy.
