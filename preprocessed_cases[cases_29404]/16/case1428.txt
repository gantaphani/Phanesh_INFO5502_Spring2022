burbach broadcasting brought suit against elkins radio for breach of contract and specific performance based on an alleged agreement made between the parties for the purchase of elkins radio station assets.the agreement burbach sought to enforce took the form of a letter of intent,signed by the parties on october.the district court granted judgment on the pleadings,finding that the letter of intent was not binding because it was subject at all times to the negotiation and execution of a mutually agreeable asset purchase agreement,and no such agreement was ever reached by the parties.burbach contends that the letter of intent contained all the elements of a complete,binding and enforceable contract and that the lack of an asset purchase agreement does not affect elkins obligation to sell the assets.it argues that it could waive the provision calling for an asset purchase agreement because the sole purpose of that provision was to protect itself,due to limited information provided by elkins.in the alternative,burbach contends that the letter of intent was,at a minimum,a binding agreement obligating the parties to negotiate in good faith towards a final contract.we find that the complaint adequately states a claim on which relief can be granted,and because the parties intent to be bound can not be discerned on the face of the pleadings alone,we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
