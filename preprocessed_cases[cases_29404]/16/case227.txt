both parties appeal from grants of summary judgment in this dispute concerning the benefit eligibility language of a disability benefit plan regulated by the employee retirement income security act erisa.plaintiffs d h therapy associates,llc d h,and robin dolan appeal from a grant of summary judgment against their claims that dolan was eligible for and entitled to benefits under the plan or,in the alternative,damages for fraud in the inducement.defendant boston mutual life insurance company boston mutual,in turn,appeals from entry of summary judgment against its counterclaim that it is entitled to reimbursement for payments already made to dolan,which it says were mistaken.
d h obtained an erisa plan from boston mutual in.under the plan,employees who suffer specified reductions in monthly earnings due to disability are eligible for benefits.dolan is both a and an employee of d h.in,she became physically unable to continue some of her tasks as an employee,which prompted a reduction in her monthly w earnings.in,she began receiving benefits under the plan.after a audit,however,boston mutual terminated the benefits and demanded dolan return past payments.it told dolan that she had failed to account for her income,including earnings from her ownership stake in d with those ownership earnings included,boston mutual stated,dolan monthly earnings had been higher than her monthly earnings since,and so she was not and had never been eligible for payments.
after dolan filed unsuccessful administrative appeals with boston mutual claims administrator,she and d h initiated this litigation against boston mutual.except as needed we refer to both plaintiffs as dolan.dolan challenges her benefit termination on two grounds.first,she argues that the plan defines earnings as w income such that income is not relevant to eligibility determinations.second,she argues that boston mutual should be estopped from construing the plan otherwise because it represented to d h at the time of purchase that the plan defined earnings as w income.in the alternative,dolan claims that boston mutual representations fraudulently induced d h to forego renewing its preexisting insurance policy.boston mutual counterclaims that under the plan it is entitled to reimbursement of the it paid to dolan.
the district court granted summary judgment to each party on the claims brought by the other.as to dolan claims,it held that boston mutual construction of the plan language was within its discretion as the plan administrator and that dolan fraudulent inducement claim was preempted by erisa.as to boston mutual counterclaim,it held that the reimbursement sought did not qualify as appropriate equitable relief under erisa.
we hold that boston mutual abused its discretion when it determined that dolan has never been eligible for benefits under the plan.this holding requires entry of judgment for dolan on both her wrongful denial of benefits claim and on boston mutual counterclaim for recoupment of past payments.accordingly,we reverse the district court entry of judgment for boston mutual on dolan denial of benefits claim and affirm for dolan on boston mutual counterclaim.we need not reach dolan equitable estoppel argument or her fraud in the inducement claim.
dolan and her partner kim havunen each hold a half ownership stake in d h,a firm that provides physical,occupational,and speech therapy services at several clinics in rhode island at all times relevant to this suit,dolan and havunen were also employees of the firm.dolan served as the director of clinical services and as a physical therapist,while havunen served as the director of business operations.like other employees of the firm,dolan and havunen drew salary based on the number of hours they worked.their salaries were not influenced,at least directly,by their ownership stakes in d 
d h acquisition of the boston mutual plan 
in,d h obtained a disability insurance policy from guarantee life insurance company guarantee life.d h obtained the policy with the help of an insurance agent,benefit services,benefit services.havunen led the efforts to obtain this policy.she testified that she explained to a benefit services representative that d h wanted a policy that would protect w earnings such that the principals of the firm would be insulated against loss of the salary form of their income.havunen understood the guarantee life policy to reflect this request.according to havunen,the policy defined protected earnings for principals as w earnings.
in,the guarantee life policy was expiring.as d h considered whether to renew the policy,the same benefit services representative who had assisted d h with the guarantee life policy contacted havunen.the representative,maureen baker,informed havunen that she had received a quote from a different insurance provider at a better rate.havunen testified that she told baker that d h would only consider switching to the new policy if the policy protected w earnings in the same manner as she understood the guarantee life policy did.havunen testified further that when baker identified the quote in question as belonging to boston mutual,havunen reiterated this requirement.
to ensure that the boston mutual policy would meet these specifications,havunen testified,she and baker met with a boston mutual agent,thomas liszanckie.havunen testified that liszanckie assured her that the boston mutual policy would contain the same definitions of earnings and income as the guarantee life policy.she testified as well that liszanckie brought a written group insurance proposal,which he said contained the requested protection for w income.havunen testified that liszanckie identified the last page of the proposal as ensuring this protection.that page includes the following statement definition of earnings basic annual earnings shall mean the insured person earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the group policyholder on form w.
havunen testified that,based on liszanckie statements and the proposal definition of earnings,d h did not renew the guarantee life policy and instead purchased the boston mutual policy.when havunen received the final language of the policy,she expressed some concern to baker about the policy terms relating to any other income from employment,which might be construed to include income other than w income.baker,havunen testified,assured her that this language only referred to other income that may be included in w earnings,like bonuses and commissions.havunen did not contest the final policy language.she testified that d h would not have signed on to the policy if not for liszanckie and baker representations.
boston mutual disputes havunen testimony concerning her conversations with baker,the content of the guarantee life policy,and her interactions with liszanckie.baker testified that,in her discussions with havunen about both the guarantee life policy and the boston mutual policy,havunen told her that she wanted to protect the k income of d h principals,not their w income.baker also speculated that a portion of the guarantee life policy not present in the record defined earnings for principals differently from that of other employees and included income liszanckie testified that while he occasionally dropped off insurance forms to customers before they signed an insurance policy,he rarely met with the customers and he could not recall whether he met with havunen and baker.
b.the terms of the boston mutual plan 
having reviewed these disputed facts concerning d h decision to obtain the boston mutual policy,we turn to the plan language that governs that policy.there is no dispute that the policy,unlike the guarantee life policy,is governed by erisa.we divide discussion of the plan contents between provisions concerning benefit eligibility,provisions concerning benefit calculation,and provisions concerning overpayment of claims.
as to benefit eligibility,principals and all other employees are eligible for benefits if they suffer a specified loss in earnings due to disability.this applies when these individuals are not able to perform some or all of the material and substantial duties of their regular occupation and have at least a loss in their earnings.this litigation does not concern what rises to an inability to perform occupational duties.
it concerns,instead,what it means to have a loss in earnings as defined by the plan.for both principals and all other employees,the plan gives these definitions concerning earnings earnings means your monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins.basic annual earnings shall mean the insured person earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the group policyholder on form w,excluding commissions.if an individual has earnings for less than a calendar year,the plan provides that basic annual earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month worked and annualizing the result.
the plan lists a series of circumstances that justify benefit termination.these include when an individual is no longer disabled,has reached the end of the maximum payment duration,or has current earnings that exceed of his or her earnings.benefits will also be terminated when an individual is able to increase his or her current earnings by increasing the number of hours he or she work s or the number of duties he or she perform s in his or her regular occupation but do es not do so.the plan emphasizes,in bolded letters,that if an individual is disabled and working,earning more than of his or her earnings,no payment will be made.
as to benefit calculation,the plan specifies that the maximum monthly payment is and the minimum monthly payment is or,presumably of monthly earnings.it includes two formulas for benefit calculation.the first applies to individuals earning less than of their earnings,whether they are currently working or not.the second applies to individuals working and earning between and of their earnings.the plan makes no express provision for how to calculate benefit payments for individuals who are not working but are nonetheless earning between and of their earnings.
the specifics of the two formulas are as follows.under the first,monthly payments are figured by taking the lesser of a and b of earnings,and then subtracting any other income amounts except any income the individual earn s or receive s from any form of employment.under the second,benefits are initially the lesser of a,b of earnings minus any other income amounts including current income the individual earn s or receive s from any form of employment,and c of earnings.after months,additional payments under this formula are determined by taking the lesser of a,and b of income,and then subtracting of any income the individual earn s or receive s from any form of employment and of any other income amounts.
the policy defines other income amounts in six categories.all the categories except for one pertain to benefits and awards an individual either receives or is eligible to receive under specified laws or employer insurance plans.the remaining category,particularly important for our purposes,states that other income amounts includes any income you earn or receive from any form of employment.
as to overpayment,the plan provides,we have the right to recover overpayments due to fraud an error we make in processing your claim or your receipt of other income amounts.it also states,if we determine that we overpaid your claim,then we require you repay us in full.we will determine the method by which you will repay us.
c.the dispute under the boston mutual plan 
in february,shortly after d h obtained the boston mutual policy,dolan underwent orthopedic surgery.when she returned to work in august,she worked fewer hours and received less salary.in january,boston mutual approved dolan claim under the policy and began dispensing benefits.these benefits continued until,when boston mutual claims administrator,disability reinsurance management services drms,conducted an audit.
based on the audit,drms concluded that dolan benefit payments had not properly taken account of business profits she received as a principal of d h and another entity,associated professional management.with those profits included,drms calculated dolan monthly earnings to be and her monthly earnings in to be.in an august letter,boston mutual informed dolan of the audit and asserted its right under the policy to recover overpayments due to fraud or error.dolan,through her attorney,contested this finding.she argued that this business income fell outside the definition of earnings relevant for determining eligibility under the policy.
notwithstanding dolan objections,by an october letter boston mutual discontinued her benefits and reasserted its demand that she repay past benefits.the letter stated that the benefits dolan had received since january had resulted in an overpayment of.dolan twice appealed the termination determination,and in each case drms denied the appeal.in her appeals,dolan argued that she had disclosed her ownership interests at all relevant times and that the intention of d h and its principals in purchasing the policy had been to protect w earnings.she did not submit evidence that boston mutual had represented to d h that the policy would protect w earnings in this fashion.after drms denied these appeals,dolan filed this lawsuit.
in the district court,dolan challenged her benefit termination under erisa civil enforcement provision.she argued that the plain language of the plan renders income irrelevant for benefit eligibility,and boston mutual should be equitably estopped from asserting otherwise given liszanckie representations to havunen.in the alternative,dolan argued that d h was fraudulently induced to purchase the boston mutual plan and sought damages in tort under state law.as a remedy for fraudulent inducement,dolan argued that she was entitled to the benefits she would have received under the guarantee life policy had d h renewed it.dolan also asserted state law contract claims,but later conceded that these claims are preempted by erisa.
boston mutual counterclaimed,demanding reimbursement under the plan for in overpaid benefits the parties for summary judgment on dolan claims and boston mutual counterclaim.
three arguments boston mutual made before the district court are relevant on appeal.first,it argued that its determination that dolan had not been eligible for benefits was reasonable and within the discretion afforded to certain plan administrators under erisa.second,it argued that the district court could not consider four affidavits dolan submitted concerning purported misrepresentations because they had not been part of the administrative record third,it argued that erisa preempts dolan state claim for fraud in the inducement.
initially,the district court granted boston mutual motion for summary judgment on dolan claims but denied both parties motions for summary judgment on boston mutual counterclaim.boston mutual moved for reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment as to its counterclaim in light of a supreme court decision,sereboff mid atlantic medical services,on permissible relief under erisa that the district court had not considered.dolan moved for reconsideration of her claims in light of a recent decision of this court,denmark liberty life assurance of boston,cir,concerning conflicts of interest in certain discretionary decisions by erisa plan administrators.
the district court reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment for boston mutual on dolan claims.on reconsideration,however,it granted dolan motion for summary judgment on boston mutual counterclaim.in the two decisions,the district court held boston mutual eligibility determination was reasonable and thus entitled to deference under erisa,erisa preempts dolan claim for fraud in the inducement under a,and boston mutual claim for reimbursement for overpaid benefits is not appropriate equitable relief under a.the district court did not expressly address dolan equitable estoppel argument.it also did not address boston mutual motion to strike the four contested affidavits,as the motion was deemed moot in light of the court grant of summary judgment for boston mutual.
in the present,dolan appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for boston mutual on her claims and boston mutual appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for dolan on its counterclaim.

cases that concern benefit determinations under an erisa plan,however,are not typical cases when it comes to summary judgment.when an erisa plan gives an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or construe the plan terms,the district court must uphold the administrator decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.cusson,at quoting gannon metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in such cases,summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue and the party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.id.quoting orndorf paul revere life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties agree that the plan at issue here affords boston mutual authority to determine benefit eligibility and construe its terms.accordingly,the district court reviewed boston mutual benefit determinations for abuse of discretion.our de novo review of the district court grants of summary judgment as they relate to benefit determinations must look to whether the district court erred in finding that boston mutual determinations were within its discretion.our de novo review of the district court grants of summary judgment as they relate to other issues must employ the review typically employed on summary judgment.see orndorf,at.
we address in concert the two benefit determinations relevant to this appeal,as both rest on the same stated rationale.boston mutual terminated dolan benefits because it deemed dolan ineligible for benefits under the plan,and it demanded recoupment of past payments made to dolan because it deemed that dolan had never been eligible for benefits under the plan.it has been boston mutual position that dolan has never been eligible for benefits because her earnings have always exceeded her earnings as defined by the plan.there are no disputed facts concerning dolan income.the parties only dispute how to interpret the plan terms and thereby determine dolan eligibility for benefits in light of her income.
this interpretive dispute centers on four constructions present in the plan earnings,basic annual earnings,earnings,and current earnings.dolan argues that the plan definition of basic annual earnings defines earnings as w income and that a reasonable reading of the plan demands a consistent application of this definition,irrespective of the temporal periods and current.it has been boston mutual position that when the term earnings precedes the terms or basic annual it refers to monthly w income,but when the term earnings is used alone or combined with the term current it refers to all income that derives from employment,including ownership income 
existing circuit law 
in this circuit,we have held that an erisa benefit determination is within the discretion of the plan administrator so long as it is reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.wright donnelly sons grp.benefits plan,cir quoting gannon,at.we have emphasized that our review of whether a plan administrator abused its discretion does not require that we determine either the best reading of the erisa plan or how we would read the plan de novo.stamp metro.life ins,cir quoting lennon metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have also noted that the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply to review of an erisa plan construction advanced by an administrator given authority to construe the plan.id.at citing morton smith,cir.
challenges to benefit determinations in this circuit have typically involved the application of contested facts to uncontested plan terms.in leahy raytheon,cir,for example,we noted that the relevant plan terms were clear and unambiguous but that,a s in many such instances,the devil is in the details of applying the facts to those terms.id.at.most often,plaintiffs have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence underlying an erisa plan administrator factual conclusions.see,cusson,at orndorf,at.they have also challenged benefit determinations on the grounds that the erisa plan administrator improperly credited certain evidence.see,medina metro.life ins,cir buffonge prudential ins.of,cir.
we are aware of only two cases decided in this circuit concerning purely interpretive questions like the one raised in this appeal.understandably,neither of these cases articulate general guidelines as to when a plan administrator construction is sufficiently lacking in reason that it rises to the level of an abuse of discretion.in the more recent case,coffin bowater,cir,we upheld a plan administrator construction because we found its construction significantly more persuasive than that offered by the plaintiffs.id.at.in so holding,the court did not need to reach the more difficult question of when a plan administrator construction will be sufficiently reasonable to warrant deference even though it is only as persuasive or less persuasive than the interpretation offered by the plaintiffs.
in an earlier case,kolling american power conversion,cir,we held it within a plan administrator discretion to reasonably construe the term employee,which was circularly defined by the plan as employee of the employer.id.at.citing trombetta cragin fed.bank for sav.emp.stock ownership plan,cir.we held that the plan administrator had permissibly looked to the insurance company intention in defining the plan scope and that the evidence supported its determination regarding that intention.id.we also held that the insurance company had consistently applied its definition of employee in the past.id.we did not address when these indicators or others might require a holding that a plan construction was unreasonable.
the supreme court has not spoken directly to how courts should assess whether an administrator construction of a plan term is so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.in firestone tire rubber bruch,the court noted that erisa abounds with the language and terminology of trust law,id.at,and that given this,it had held that courts must develop a federal common law of rights and obligations under plans,id.quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that t rust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers,and that when a trustee is given such power to construe disputed or doubtful terms the trustee interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.id.at.
the court has not given precise content to this standard.it has held that courts must consider conflicts of interest that may arise when an administrator,like boston mutual,both determines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket.metro.life ins.glenn,see also conkright frommert.in glenn,the court noted that courts will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.glenn,at.it did not identify other relevant factors,however,and warned against creating formulas that will falsif y the actual process of judging or serve as instrument s of futile casuistry.id.at quoting universal camera labor relations,alterations in original.
law beyond this circuit 
in the absence of clear guidance from either this court or the supreme court,we look to the law of other circuits.the circuit courts have articulated the abuse of discretion standard afforded to erisa plan administrators under bruch in various ways.jayne zanglein susan stabile,erisa litigation ed.we do not delve into how the circuits have formulated this standard for all cases in which an erisa plan administrator has power to make benefit determinations.rather,we limit our attention to the question of when an erisa plan administrator,acting pursuant to a grant of power to construe the plan terms,construes the plan in a manner that is unreasonable and thus abuses its discretion.
at the outset,we note that i t is notoriously difficult to venture a general definition of the term abuse of discretion,and none is canonical indeed,the term has different meanings in different legal contexts.evans eaton.long term disability plan,cir.as judge wilkinson wrote in evans,the standard draws a line or rather demarcates a region between the unsupportable and the merely mistaken,between the legal error,disorder of reason,severe lapse of judgment,and procedural failure that a reviewing court may always correct,and the simple disagreement that,on this standard,it may not.id.at citing harry edwards linda elliott,federal standards of review.it goes without saying that terms like reasonable,which underlie the standard here,are similarly difficult to define precisely.
it also bears emphasis that this standard of review,which concerns a fiduciary element of the role of an erisa plan administrator,must reflect the relevant principles of trust law,rather than the law of contracts.matthews sears pension plan,cir see also bruch,at.as the supreme court has held,trust law can ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different,often,factors,reaching a result by weighing all together.glenn,at.in this context,our analysis must weigh the values advanced by erisa in empowering plan administrators as fiduciaries,evans,at,with the dangers policed by the statute arising from breach of fiduciary duty.mut.life ins.russell.
in their review of erisa plan constructions like the one presented in this case,courts beyond this circuit have looked to the language and purpose of the plan.in some circuits,the analysis has been conducted with reference to the consistency of an administrator construction with the plain meaning of the plan.see boyd bert rozelle nfl players ret.plan,f d,cir wagener sbc pension benefit plan non bargained program,pagan nynex pension plan,cir fuller cbt,cir.these circuits have not defined how courts should determine whether an interpretation does not accord with an erisa plan plain meaning.
at least four circuits have advanced more specific standards.the fifth circuit has split the inquiry into two steps,each of which contains three guiding factors,while the third,fourth,and eighth circuits have listed a general set of guidelines.
the fifth circuit first asks whether an administrator interpretation is legally correct.chacko sabre,cir.in so doing,it considers whether the administrator has given the plan a uniform construction whether the interpretation is consistent with a fair reading of the plan and any unanticipated costs resulting from different interpretations of the plan.id.if the interpretation is legally correct,it must stand if it is not,the court considers three factors to determine if it is an abuse of discretion the internal consistency of the plan under the administrator interpretation,any relevant regulations formulated by the appropriate administrative agencies,and the factual background of the determination and any inferences of lack of good faith.gosselink am,cir.
the third,fourth,and eighth circuits each employs a test to determine whether a plan construction constitutes an abuse of discretion.the third and eighth circuits each considers the following five factors 
whether the administrator language is contrary to the clear language of the plan whether the interpretation conflicts with the substantive or procedural requirements of erisa whether the interpretation renders any language of the plan meaningless or internally inconsistent whether the interpretation is consistent with the goals of the plan and whether the administrator has consistently followed the interpretation.
manning am.republic ins,cir see also howley mellon fin,cir.the fourth circuit list of factors includes these five factors as well as whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled,any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion,and the fiduciary motives and any conflict of interest it may have.carden aetna life ins,cir.
boston mutual construction of the plan 
although these standards are instructive,we do not adopt them or any specific guiding factors.with all due deference to boston mutual role as a fiduciary,it is clear that its construction of the erisa plan at issue stretches beyond the bounds of reasonableness.this is so for a number of reasons,which are specific to the particular case at hand.
as an initial matter,boston mutual construction of the term earnings can not be applied consistently within its own account of the plan meaning.it has been boston mutual position that the term earnings refers to w income when it is used in conjunction with the terms or basic annual.it has also been boston mutual position that the term earnings refers to all income deriving from employment when it is used alone or with the term current.yet the plan express definitions of earnings and basic annual earnings can not support both of these positions at once.
the plan expressly defines earnings as well as basic annual earnings with reference to the unaccompanied term earnings.the plan defines earnings as your monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins.emphasis added.it defines basic annual earnings,in turn,as the insured person earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the group policyholder on form w,excluding commissions.if the person has earnings for less than a calendar year,basic annual earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month worked and annualizing the result.emphasis added.
if boston mutual definition of the unaccompanied term earnings were applied to that unaccompanied term as used within the plan stated definitions of earnings and basic annual earnings,the term earnings would have to refer to both w income and income when used in conjunction with the terms and basic annual.if,on the other hand,one accepts boston mutual definition of earnings as used in conjunction with and basic annual,then the definition of the unaccompanied term earnings as used within the plan definitions of earnings and basic annual earnings would have to refer only to salary income.
boston mutual attempts to counter this contradiction by invoking the broader structure of the plan.it argues that the clear import of the plan is to reduce and potentially eliminate benefit payments once the claimant earns enough money from other sources of income.in support of this claim,boston mutual points in particular to the plan provision that benefits may be limited by a participant receipt of other income amounts,a term the plan defines,inter alia,as a ny income you earn or receive from any form of employment.boston mutual argues that its various constructions of the term earnings,notwithstanding the definitions at the beginning of the plan,are consistent with the plan effort to take account of income from employment.
specifically,boston mutual relies on language concerning benefit termination.the plan states that if an employee covered by the plan is disabled and working,earning more than of his or her earnings,no payment will be made,and payments will stop the date the covered employee current earnings exceed of his or her earnings.emphasis added.boston mutual argues that these provisions only allow payment of benefits when the sum of a covered employee w income and income from employment is at least less than that individual w income.the benefit formula,which sets payment amounts for those earning at least less than their earnings,mirrors this requirement under boston mutual construction.
this argument elides clear divisions within the plan structure that distinguish between questions of benefit calculation and questions of benefit eligibility.the plan employs the term
