opinion of the court 
this is an appeal by plaintiffs alice jaasma and the trust of ralph mcewan hereinafter jaasma from an order of the district court granting judgment as a matter of law against jaasma pursuant to.a,because jaasma had not established that the defendants,shell oil company shell and its assignee,motiva enterprises,llc motiva had breached their obligations under a lease agreement to operate a gasoline station or that she had suffered cognizable damages as a result.
motiva ceased operating the gasoline station on jaasma property,and terminated the lease on october.however,when motiva removed the gasoline station underground storage tanks one week before the termination of the lease,fuel residue was discovered on the adjacent soil,which led to a year investigation by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep.it was not until february,that njdep issued a final no further action nfa letter concluding the investigation.while soil samples taken between october,and february,indicated that the levels of hazardous compounds were in fact below regulatory standards,it took over two years of sampling to prove the safety of the property to the satisfaction of njdep.
jaasma suit,which alleged that shell and motiva breached the lease,sought damages for loss of use during the pendency of the njdep investigation.the appeal presents two principal questions.first,is there is a legally sufficient basis for a jury to find that breached the lease agreement we conclude that there is.second,does new jersey law recognize loss of use as a measure of damages for temporary harm to property interests as a result of the uncertainty surrounding a property environmental status which impairs its marketability the district court found that new jersey law limits the measures of damages to only permanent diminution in value and cost of repair or cost of remediation,and therefore does not recognize damages for such temporary harm.we conclude,however,that the loss of use described is a cognizable measure of damages under new jersey law,and that judgment as a matter of law was therefore inappropriate because there is sufficient evidence of lost use for the case to proceed.
defendants urge that even if loss of use is cognizable,jaasma was unreasonable in her mitigation efforts by failing to immediately market the property.however,because the reasonableness of mitigation efforts is generally a question of fact,and because the evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that jaasma was reasonable in her efforts to market the property,we decline to dispose of this case as a matter of law on the grounds of lack of mitigation.
finally,we agree with jaasma that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the expert testimony of gary dipippo because the court decision was based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of dipippo testimony.dipippo testimony was relevant to the measure of damages and to the reasonableness of jaasma mitigation efforts,and thus the exclusion of his testimony was not harmless error.therefore,we will reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law and the order excluding dipippo testimony.
our review of the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law is plenary.mosley wilson,cir.judgment as a matter of law is warranted only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of jaasma.a.the question is not whether there is literally no evidence supporting the party against whom the motion is directed but whether there is evidence upon which the jury could properly find a verdict for that party.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,quoted in patzig,cir 
factual and procedural background 
jaasma owns a parcel in west paterson,new jersey,which she leased to shell in.shell or its franchisees had been operating a gasoline station at this site since,and continued to do so after entering into the lease agreement.on october,shell exercised an option to extend the lease for an additional five years,and two years later,shell assigned the remainder of the lease to motiva.in a july,letter,motiva stated its intention to leave the property at the end of the lease,which was scheduled to terminate on october.
jaasma claims,however,that motiva and shell failed to return the property to its original state as required by the lease terms.paragraph of the addendum to the lease states in pertinent part 
it is also agreed that all gasoline,waste oil and fuel oil tanks shall be removed from the premises at the expiration of the lease by shell and the premises restored to its original state.
shell shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and shall hold the lessor harmless and shall indemnify the lessor against all claims whatsoever arising out of any violation of said laws or any contamination of the subject property by hazardous substances attributable to shell.
additionally,paragraph of the lease states,at any termination of this lease or any tenancy thereafter,shell shall surrender the premises to lessor,subject to ordinary wear and tear 
jaasma alleges that the property was contaminated by the gas station operations during the lease.the environmental problems on the property first began in november,when,during the removal of a tank,contaminants were noticed in the adjacent soil.the leak was reported immediately to njdep.between and,njdep required shell and motiva to remediate the property and to conduct nearly seven years of sampling of the soil and groundwater to monitor contaminant levels.on january,njdep issued a conditional nfa,which stated,shell has complied with the existing requirements regarding the remedial investigation and remedial action for the underground storage tank system,but found that levels of contamination remained above the state ground water quality standards.as a result,njdep required to conduct further sampling to ensure that the soil and groundwater control complied with njdep regulations and restricted the use of groundwater as a potable water supply without the proper precautions.
on october and,one week before the end of the lease,removed the underground storage tanks,and petroleum discharges were again found in the soil adjacent to the tanks.on january,three months after the lease terminated,motiva prepared an underground storage tank closure remedial investigation report,which stated that,while some discharge was apparent,the tanks were structurally intact,they had no holes or cracks,and soil samples did not identify any concentrations of regulated compounds.the remedial investigation report also stated that nearly tons of soil were removed from the property as part of excavation activities and replaced with clean fill 
three months later,on april,njdep acknowledged the receipt of motiva remedial investigation report.the njdep response did not,however,give the property a clean bill of health,but rather identified certain deficiencies that motiva still needed to address.in particular,njdep stated that the soil samples had not been properly prepared and that motiva needed to resample in accordance with njdep requirements and to install new monitoring wells.
motiva claims that it was delayed in completing this testing because,in june,njdep requested that motiva conduct further groundwater sampling pursuant to the amendments to state environmental regulations.on september,motiva submitted the supplemental information requested in njdep april,letter.this report confirmed that the contaminants in the soil and water continued to be below regulated levels.njdep issued a final nfa on february,which reported that the groundwater and soil met the applicable environmental standards under,and thus,concluded its oversight of the property.
defendants maintain that soil and water samples have consistently demonstrated that the property was in fact environmentally safe during the period of njdep oversight following the termination of the lease.they contend that,between october,and february,njdep only requested additional confirmatory samples,but no further remediation measures were taken or required.moreover,defendants have provided records chronicling each sample taken from october,before the lease terminated until july,reflecting that the soil and groundwater contaminants were below regulated levels.
jaasma does not dispute that contaminant levels in the soil and groundwater were,with hindsight,compliant with environmental standards during the period between october,and february.rather,jaasma alleges that,due to the ongoing njdep review and the uncertainty surrounding the environmental status of the property,she was not able to rent or sell the property at fair market value for the months from the termination of the lease until njdep issued the final nfa.thus the problem,according to jaasma,was not the actual environmental condition of the property,but her inability to confirm that the property was in compliance with new jersey environmental regulations and the corresponding lack of an nfa.jaasma represents that three different realtors advised that she would not receive fair market value for the property and could not warrant the condition of the property to prospective purchasers without an nfa.
jaasma alleges that defendants would not communicate about the status of the property for eight months following the termination of the lease,notwithstanding three letters sent to them soliciting information about the removal of the tanks and compliance with environmental laws.moreover,jaasma asserts that defendants did not transmit the tank closure report until january,and that she only learned about the ongoing njdep investigation of the property on may.thus,it is jaasma position that her use and marketability of the property was hampered by the lack of an nfa and her inability to ascertain the true environmental status of the property from defendants.
jaasma claims that,as a result,she waited to market the property until may,when she believed that the issuance of the nfa was imminent,although in reality the nfa was not issued until nearly a year later.jaasma acknowledges that she received several offers to purchase the property in the meantime.while the offers to buy the property were not consummated for reasons other than the lack of an nfa,jaasma points out that each potential buyer specified that an nfa was a precondition of closing,or at least conditioned the transaction on proof that the property was free from contamination 
jaasma sued defendants in state court alleging in count i,that defendants failed to vacate the property at the termination of the lease and were holdover tenants in count ii,that defendants negligently contaminated the property and in count iii,that defendants breached the lease by failing to return the property to its original condition.defendants timely removed the case to the district court for the district of new jersey and then moved for summary judgment on all counts.after oral argument,the district court granted summary judgment on the holdover tenancy claim count i and the negligence claim count ii.
just prior to trial on the breach of lease claim count iii,the district court heard oral argument on several motions in limine.first,the court granted defendants motion to exclude the testimony of jaasma expert,gary dipippo,after determining that his testimony did not meet the requirements of daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.then,after reviewing the deposition testimony of jaasma remaining expert witness,charles lanyard,the district court dismissed the amended complaint,pursuant to.a the court concluded that jaasma could not prove damages,and suggested that there was no evidence defendants had breached the lease.the court stated 
it is undisputed that the market value of the property has not been a ffected.it unchallenged.what is sought by the plaintiffs by way of demonstration is that in lanyard,who was a real estate salesman working with the brokerage in commercial real estate,sought prospective buyers of that property.and he says they,among other concerns besides the price,was the property clean or were the re environmental conditions that had to be met.and he spoke generally of the need for an nfa 
i am constrained,reluctantly but i am constrained to say that insufficient legally in this circumstance.and the defendant is right in its recitation of the law.the measure of damages would be a diminution of the market value of the property occasioned by whatever might be attributable to the unreasonable actions of the defendant or the cost of remediation or the cost of repair.w e do have any assertion that the market value has been diminished.
we do have any assertion as to any cost of remediation visited upon the plaintiff and we do have any assertion of what any reasonable fact finder could conclude would be an unreasonable delay by shell in doing what it was supposed to do in regard to enforcing,by enforcing i mean living up to the two paragraphs that i spoke of 
thus,by limiting the measure of damages to diminution in value or cost of remediation or repair,the district court implicitly rejected jaasma argument,presented during the oral argument on the rule motion,that new jersey law recognizes damages due to temporary impairment of the use or marketability of property caused by uncertainty over its environmental status.
ii.breach of the lease agreement 
we must first address the difficult question whether defendants breached the lease agreement.while the district court relied essentially on the damages issue in granting judgment as a matter of law,the court also suggested that defendants may not have breached their obligations under the lease we conclude,however,that a jury could reasonably find that defendants violated the lease.
under new jersey law,a commercial lease is governed by traditional contract principles,see ringwood assocs.jack of rte,matter of barclay,cir,under which d iscerning contractual intent is a question of fact unless the provisions of a contract are wholly unambiguous.id.at citations omitted.thus,only where the terms are unambiguous is judgment as a matter of law appropriate.paul fire marine ins.lewis,cir.to interpret a contract,courts will consider the actual words of the agreement themselves,as well as any alternative meanings offered by counsel,and extrinsic evidence offered in support of those alternative meanings,reading contract terms in context.see barco urban renewal housing auth.of atlantic city,cir restatement second of contracts.additionally,where the contractual language is ambiguous,we may look to the conduct of the parties following the execution of the lease to interpret the ambiguous lease provisions.see michaels brookchester,where ambiguity exists,the subsequent conduct of the parties in the performance of the agreement may serve to reveal their original understanding.
there are two phrases in paragraph of the addendum to the lease agreement that could support jaasma claim that defendants breached their obligations under the lease first,the lease states that shell shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and second,the agreement states that the property shall be returned to its original state.
under the lease agreement,it was shell responsibility to comply with all applicable environmental laws.the pertinent environmental regulations include both substantive and reporting requirements.thus,the regulations governing underground storage tanks not only require physical remediation,but also contain a series of sampling and reporting requirements in the wake of a reported discharge of petroleum contaminants.see et.although there is no explicit obligation for shell to obtain an nfa or to provide information to jaasma about the environmental condition of the property after the termination of the lease,we believe that a reasonable factfinder might determine that compliance with all applicable environmental laws includes the obligation to produce the evidence and reports necessary for njdep to issue an nfa.evidence of custom and practice in the trade might also support such a finding.see vrg gkn realty,looking to,inter alia,custom and usage as evidence of the parties intention.
second,defendants had a contractual duty to return the property to its original state.jaasma argues that this obligation encompasses not only a duty to leave the property free from physical contamination,but also a duty to leave the property in marketable condition.under this view,even if defendants had successfully remediated the soil and groundwater prior to the termination of the lease agreement,after the contamination was discovered,an nfa was a crucial aspect of returning the property to the original state so that the property could be freely marketed for sale or lease.
we need not decide,as an abstract proposition,whether an nfa per se is required we do however believe that a reasonable fact finder could determine that the duty to return the property to its original state encompasses the duty to leave the property free from the kind of impediments that would render it unmarketable based on the deposition testimony of charles lanyard who served as both a fact and expert witness for jaasma,on jaasma proffer that three realtors told her that she could not sell the property at market price without an imminent nfa,and on the evidence that prospective buyers made an nfa a precondition for sale,we believe that a factfinder could reasonably find that the property was not fully marketable prior to the issuance of the nfa 
finally,new jersey courts have given great weight to the parties course of conduct in discerning the intent of the parties.see joseph hilton,evans,savarese corcoran.where the contract terms are ambiguous,new jersey courts have been willing to infer contractual duties based on the conduct of the parties.for example,in michaels,at,tenants sued their landlord for failure to repair a cabinet door hinge,which gave way,injuring one of the tenants.the new jersey supreme court found that the lease contain ed no clearcut promise by the tenant or landlord with respect to repair of the defect ive cabinet door id.at.nevertheless,the court found that w hen we look to the actual performance of the parties,we find conduct which persuasively justifies the conclusion that the parties did intend by the writing that the landlord make repairs because the landlord generally furnished a maintenance crew,had made repairs on prior occasions in response to tenants calls,and readily agreed to repair the cabinet door when asked.id.at.
the parties course of conduct in this case supports the view that it was defendants obligation under the lease not only to clean up the property,but also to engage in the sampling and reporting necessary to obtain an nfa and to restore the property to fully marketable status.jaasma has adduced evidence which shows that,following the first spill in,defendants took full responsibility for dealing with njdep regulatory procedures by conducting all of the physical remediation,and by taking the necessary samples,submitting the data,and handling the regulatory processes in order to obtain a conditional nfa.moreover,as in michaels,during the events which gave rise to this litigation,defendants have apparently never disputed that they were responsible for obtaining an nfa and they have in fact done so.the parties course of dealing thus further justifies submitting the breach element to the jury.
in sum,given the varying interpretations offered by jaasma and defendants of the contractual language,see paul fire marine,at looking to alternative meanings offered by counsel to discern contractual intent,we can not say that the lease is wholly unambiguous as to defendants contractual duties.and we conclude that the language of the lease and the parties course of dealing present a jury question whether defendants had a duty under the lease to obtain an nfa following the discharge of contaminants from defendants underground storage tanks and to render the property fully marketable by the conclusion of the lease term.
iii.damages 
loss of use as a measure of damages 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether new jersey law recognizes loss of use as a measure of damages for breach of lease resulting in uncertainty impairing the marketability of real property.jaasma contends that the district court erred as a legal matter in holding that,under new jersey law,the only two measures of damages for breach of lease are diminution in value and cost of repair or remediation.it is clear,however,that new jersey recognizes lost rental income as a standard measure of damages for breach of a lease.see mcguire city of jersey city,river road assocs.chesapeake display packaging,d,under new jersey law,a commercial landlord may recover for lost rental income resulting from a tenant breach of a lease.
moreover,in both t e,safety light,and siligato state,new jersey courts recognized that loss of use is one of several possible measures of damages for tortious harm to real property.this comports with the common law of property,which includes loss of use or lost rental value as a proper measure of damages when land is temporarily unusable,but then later returned to its original state.thompson on real property states 
loss of rental value may be the appropriate measure of damages,if the property itself is not harmed but its usefulness has been impaired if temporary damages are recovered for harm to property,those damages are measured by the loss of the rental value or loss of use value of the property as a result of or during the continuance of the nuisance.
thompson on real property a,at david thomas ed see also powell on real property,at michael allan wolf,matthew bender when the harm caused by a nuisance is only temporary and can be abated,the measure of damages normally is the depreciation in the rental or use value of the affected property.
the more difficult question,presented here,is whether damages for loss of use are available during the period of uncertainty which may occur after the is physically completed,but before the property has been certified as compliant with all environmental regulations.jaasma argues that,even if the property did not in fact require any further environmental remediation after the termination of the lease,she suffered damages so long as the cloud of uncertainty from the prior contamination lingered.
we are satisfied that new jersey law does recognize damages for the uncertainty that follows in the wake of environmental contamination.more specifically,bahrle exxon,supports the proposition that new jersey law recognizes an injury due to the temporary uncertainty surrounding the environmental status of property created by njdep investigation.in bahrle,adjoining landowners sued the proprietors of a gasoline service station under a nuisance theory for groundwater contamination due to alleged spills from the station underground storage tanks.the trial judge had dismissed the claims of seventeen plaintiffs whose water never registered as contaminated,but who lived within the redlined area where njdep prohibited new wells.the appellate division reversed,finding that even though these landowners wells were not contaminated in fact,there was foreseeable damage caused by the redlining itself,including plaintiffs hesitancy to use the water for drinking or showering during the pendency of the investigation.id.at.
nrc amoco oil,cir,is also instructive.amoco had leased land from nrc for a gasoline station.at the end of the lease period,it was discovered that the underground storage tanks were leaking and had contaminated the property.nrc sued amoco for the loss of the use of the property during the remediation period,and the district court awarded the full fair rental value from the time of the termination of the lease until the indiana department of environmental management approved the corrective action plan and remediation was completed.id.at.
amoco claimed that nrc could have used the property during the remediation and argued that nrc had voluntarily declined to market the property.the seventh circuit disagreed,concluding that the evidence established that until the corrective action plan was approved the property was unmarketable.after that time,while the property was undergoing remediation,uncertainty remained.testimony demonstrated that lenders would be reluctant to get behind the property without guarantees that remediation wa
