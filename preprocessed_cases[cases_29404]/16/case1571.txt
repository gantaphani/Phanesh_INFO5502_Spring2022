the attorney general of louisiana filed a class action,naming the state and numerous louisiana citizens as plaintiffs.the class action alleged that the defendant insurance companies failed to pay covered insurance claims following hurricanes katrina and rita and as a result breached the insurance contracts to which the state is a partial assignee.it requested damages and declaratory and injunctive relief,all under state law.at several defendants request,the case was removed to federal district court under the class action fairness act cafa louisiana moved to remand to state court,arguing that cafa did not apply and that louisiana enjoyed sovereign immunity from involuntary removal to federal court in that it was suing in its state court to enforce state law.the district court denied remand.louisiana petitioned this court for permission to appeal the interlocutory order under cafa,which we granted.
louisiana administers the road home program,which advances money to louisiana homeowners for reconstructing homes damaged or destroyed by hurricanes rita and katrina.any homeowner could receive up to from louisiana with a written assignment to the state of the owner claim against his insurer in the amount of the payment received from the state.only an owner claim for damage to his dwelling was assigned.these assignments,functionally subrogation agreements,read in part 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,this is a limited subrogation and assignment,and is limited to an amount not to exceed the amount of the grant received by the undersigned insured under the program,to which the state has not been reimbursed from other sources.
while an owner assignment was partial in that the owner retained his claim against his insurer for amounts exceeding the sum advanced by the state,the assignment also granted louisiana the right to sue his insurer in the owner name for the owner insured losses 
under a louisiana statute,all insurance claims relating to damages from hurricane katrina had to be filed by september,on august,louisiana filed this suit in orleans parish against more than insurance companies.by an amended petition filed five days later,louisiana added a class action against the same defendants under louisiana code of civil procedure,article it was filed on behalf of the state of louisiana,individually and on behalf of the state agency administering the program.the asserted class consisted of 
a ll current and former citizens of the state of louisiana who have applied for and received or will receive funds through the road home program,and who have executed or will execute a subrogation or assignment agreement in favor of the state,and to whom insurance proceeds are due owed for damages sustained to any such recipient residence as result of any natural or occurrence associated with hurricanes katrina rita under any policy of insurance,as plead herein,and for which the state has been or will be granted or be entitled to recover as repayment or reimbursement of funds provided to any such recipient through the road home program.
the amended requested injunctive relief,declaratory judgment,damages,and an order finding the insurance company defendants liable to the state and the recipients members of the class,as plead herein,f or an injunctive order directing that the insurance company defendants pay all coverage afforded under the terms of the recipients policies,and where a total loss is found,an injunctive order directing the payment of the full value placed on the recipients residence with full reimbursement or repayment of any funds to which the state is entitled to as a result of any grant issued under the road home program,f or a declaration of the state and the recipient sic rights under louisiana law,and a declaration of the insurance company defendants responsibilities to the state and the recipients,as plead herein,for an injunction prohibiting the insurance company defendants from committing further breaches of their duties owed to the state and members of the class,and forbidding defendants from failing to honor the coverage provided by the all risk policies issued to the recipients,and f or any and all monetary,general and equitable relief or injunctive relief as this court deems just and appropriate under louisiana law,whether plead herein or otherwise.
the amended petition alleged breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and breach of fiduciary duty,asserting inter alia that repeated demands were made by recipients to the defendants which refused to meet their obligations under the all risk policies and refused to pay the full damages for recipients homes being destroyed or damaged,that the insurance companies had by failing to pay the recipients all of the benefits due and owing them violated the duties of good faith and fair dealing owed to recipients,and that defendants failure to fully disclose and properly advise the recipients breached the fiduciary duties owed to them as their policyholders.the amended petition also requested a declaratory judgment that under louisiana valued policy law,et,recipients are entitled to recover the full value placed on their residences by the insurance company defendants without deduction or offset,especially without any deduction or offset for funds received under the road home program.
on the filing of the amended petition with its class action allegation,several defendants filed a notice of removal in which others joined and consented.louisiana moved to remand to state court,arguing that cafa did not apply and that exercise of federal jurisdiction over the suit offended its sovereign immunity.following a hearing,the district court refused to remand.at the hearing,the insurance companies argued that removal was proper under cafa and the multiparty multiform trial jurisdiction act mmtja,which provides for original jurisdiction in the district court,and removal to district court,for certain minimal diversity actions arising from a single accident.finding minimal diversity under cafa,the district court declined to reach the claim of jurisdiction under mmtja 
louisiana here argues that cafa does not apply,and that even if it does apply by its terms,it can not abrogate sovereign immunity from federal process,or at the least congress did not clearly do so in cafa and that mmtja does not apply by its own terms.
enacted in,cafa provides for removal of class actions involving parties with minimal diversity.it defines a class action as 
any civil action filed under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by or more representative persons as a class action.
louisiana argues that a state has never been treated as a person for purposes of diversity jurisdiction and that it has not filed a class action as defined by cafa.the argument is not without force but we are not persuaded.cafa only requires that the action be brought under rule or a state statute that authorizes class actions to be brought by a person louisiana article a is such a statute,as it permits members of a class to sue or be sued as representative parties.congress considered and rejected an amendment that would have exempted class actions filed by an attorney general from removal under cafa nor can we agree that cafa use of the term citizen bars its application here.the statute refers to the citizenship of any class member and any defendant it signifies that cafa,in expanding federal jurisdiction over certain class actions filed in state court,escaped the rule that citizenship of the named representative is controlling 
cafa has additional general jurisdictional requirements that must be met.cafa requires that a class action involve an aggregate amount in controversy of at least and present at least minimal diversity of parties louisiana contests only whether the requisite diversity is met.louisiana argues that it is the real party in interest and as a state,it is not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.we agree that a state is not a citizen under the diversity statutes,including cafa but that is not this case.louisiana seeks relief for both the state and the citizens as recipients of insurance.while it is true that as partial assignees and assignors,both the state and the citizens are likely real parties in interest we need not pause to examine its force.with citizens of louisiana joined as plaintiffs there is minimal diversity.cafa supplies federal jurisdiction and a path to removal unless state sovereignty turns away its exercise.we turn to this difficult question.
our precise question is not the insulating force of any sovereign immunity of the state of louisiana from removal of a suit filed by it alone in its own state courts,seeking enforcement of its state laws against insurers who each qualified to do business in the state and are subject to its regulation.that question states louisiana claim of sovereign protection from removal in its most powerful form and has never been directly answered.it has eluded answer for the practical reason that it has been long settled that a state is not a person for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.this,with the long time companion insistence upon complete diversity,made the presence of additional parties aligned with the state irrelevant to federal diversity jurisdiction.cafa,with its grant of jurisdiction to the federal district courts of qualifying class actions with minimal diversity of parties,pushes the question forward but does not tax the immunity claimed here by removal of its suit in its own courts to enforce its own laws against companies subject to its regulation.
defendants reply that louisiana enjoys no immunity as a plaintiff that its immunity is from suit filed against it.as the argument goes,it is only those actions against the state that offend its dignitary interests and imperil its coffers.and indeed several courts seem to say as much.we would stop here if we found these cases to be dispositive,for joinder of the class would not weigh on the question of state as a plaintiff would then surely have no protection from removal to federal court of a suit it filed in state court.this would be so whether such immunity as a plaintiff rule rested on the substantive reach of its immunity or waiver.louisiana would distinguish these cases where either federal questions were at issue or the cited language was dicta.we will briefly explain why we do not share defendants dismissive ease,although we will ultimately conclude that any immunity from removal to federal court was waived by the addition of the class of private citizens in the amended complaint,and relatedly that immunity of the state from removal to federal court does not extend to the members of the class.
by their logical order we would first address whether louisiana has any of the immunity from federal process that louisiana claims for itself as a plaintiff suing in its own courts to enforce its own laws,turning next to whether congress has sufficiently expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity and then to whether the state can extend any of its immunity to private citizens of louisiana suing citizens of other states for money damages and declaratory relief.we will follow a narrower course.
by this course,we accept for now that there is some measure of insulation.doing so,the question becomes rather whether the state can extend that protection to private citizens of the immunity net casts so broadly as to protect private citizens joined in a state claim.there is a footnote to the question of whether louisiana waived immunity by bringing private citizens into its suit,parties that provided the requisite minimal diversity under cafa.if louisiana had not named these citizens as plaintiffs,we would have faced the question of what effect immunity may have had given the fact that the assignments are only partial.stated more directly,because louisiana brought a class action,we need not address whether louisiana might have been compelled to join these additional parties in any event,or its effects upon federal jurisdiction 
constitutional questions unanswered by the founders and which remain open ought not be reached unless doing so is necessary to the resolution of a case or controversy.a brief repair to history informs our decision.the scope of sovereign immunity is put in play by the intersection of article iii,section of the constitution,providing for federal jurisdiction over controversies between a state and citizens of another state,and the eleventh amendment,which provides,the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
as freestanding prose these grants and limitations could be read to end our inquiry,and,without more,affirm the district court denial of remand.louisiana as plaintiff has brought a suit against citizen insurance companies of other states and the insurance companies,as defendants,have not commenced or prosecuted a suit against louisiana.but read as constitutional text,sovereign immunity is a fundamental rule of which the amendment is but an exemplification.in hans louisiana,the court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits against a state by the state own citizens,stating 
t he plaintiff in error contends that he,being a citizen of louisiana,is not embarrassed by the obstacle of the eleventh amendment,inasmuch as that amendment only prohibits suits against a state which are brought by the citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of a foreign state it is an attempt to strain the constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.can we suppose that,when the eleventh amendment was adopted,it was understood to be left open for citizens of a state to sue their own state in federal courts,while the idea of suits by citizens of other states,or of foreign states,was indignantly repelled 
the hans court also held that despite the eleventh amendment text,states as defendants may consent to federal jurisdiction in principality of monaco mississippi,the court recognized that there is no express provision that the united states may not be sued in the absence of consent a rticle iii extends the judicial power to controversies to which the united states shall be a party.literally,this includes such controversies,whether the united states be party plaintiff or defendant.yet it concluded that by reason of the established doctrine of the immunity of the sovereign from suit except upon consent,a rticle iii does not authorize the maintenance of suits against the united states.in seminole tribe of florida florida,the court held that congress through its article i powers could not abrogate states immunity against suit in federal court holding,although the text of the amendment would appear to restrict only the article iii diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts,we have understood the eleventh amendment to stand not so much for what it says,but for the presupposition which it confirms.in alden maine,the court upheld a similar principle for suits against states in state court reasoning that 
sovereign immunity derives not from the eleventh amendment but from the structure of the original constitution itself.the eleventh amendment confirmed rather than established sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle it follows that the scope of the states immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the amendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design 
the many cases looking to immunity purpose and rejecting a strict textual interpretation of immunity have all focused on the importance of protecting states as defendants,as did the founders debates over article iii.the alden court emphasized states immunity from suit,observing,t he doctrine that a sovereign could not be sued without its consent was universal in the states when the constitution was drafted and ratified.in seminole tribe,the court held that the presupposition confirmed by the eleventh amendment is that it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the su
