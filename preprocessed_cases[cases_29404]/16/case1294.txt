hillary kunda brought suit against her former employer,bard,bard,alleging that bard violated maryland law when at the time of her termination,it failed to pay her for unvested shares earned through the company profit sharing plan.she argued that despite a new jersey provision in the plan agreement,maryland law applies to the contract because the maryland wage payment and collection law mwpcl constitutes a fundamental maryland public policy.
the district court granted bard motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the court found that new jersey law applies to the contract because the mwpcl is not a fundamental public policy of maryland and that the unvested shares are not wages under new jersey law.furthermore,the court held that even if maryland law applied,the unvested shares are not wages under the mwpcl and thus were never owed to kunda.as explained below,we affirm the district court decision.
bard,a new jersey corporation,hired kunda,a maryland resident,as a sales representative and employee in.when hired,kunda compensation included a salary,commissions,and other fringe benefits.
in,bard implemented the bard optimum program,an equity based incentive program for top performing sales representatives,in order to recruit and retain top talent by offering an opportunity to defer bonus and commission awards on a basis.the plan contained a new jersey provision.
participation in the optimum program was entirely elective,with eligibility determined on a yearly basis.to be eligible,sales representatives had to meet certain criteria,including ranking among the top percent of the domestic sales force and maintaining a fully satisfactory performance rating for the year.
by electing to participate in the optimum program,eligible sales representatives deferred part of their compensation in return for fully vested elective units,which could be redeemed for a number of restricted shares of bard stock determined by the stock price on the date of issuance.moreover,bard would match each elective unit with two,three,or four unvested premium units,also determined by the stock price on the date of issuance a participant right to fully vested premium units depended on continued employment with bard for a vesting period after issuance of the unvested premium units.the premium units would not vest if the employee no longer worked for bard at the end of the vesting period except in cases of death,permanent disability,or retirement.
kunda participated in the optimum program for the calendar years of,and she received four premium units per elective unit in and two premium units per elective unit in and.in,bard terminated kunda employment without cause.apart from certain premium units from that bard vested in kunda on an accelerated schedule,kunda premium units were unvested at the time of termination,and bard deemed kunda premium units forfeited.
kunda brought suit against bard in the united states district court of maryland,claiming that she was entitled to the remaining vested premium units not given to her upon termination.the district court granted bard motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.first,the court held that new jersey law,and not maryland law,applied.second,the court held that kunda had failed to state a valid claim under the new jersey wage payment law njwpl or any other new jersey law.third,the court found that even if maryland law applied,kunda had no claim under the mwpcl.
we review bard motion to dismiss under rule b de novo.robinson am.honda motor,cir.in doing so,we must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.bell atl.twombly,d.in order to survive bard motion,kunda complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations,which accepted as true,state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.therefore,we may only grant bard motion where it appears beyond doubt kunda can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.conley gibson,d.
kunda first challenges the district court finding that new jersey law,and not maryland law,applies.despite the new jersey provision within the optimum program agreement,kunda argues that the maryland law should apply here because the mwpcl is a fundamental maryland public policy.we find her argument unpersuasive and agree with the district court that new jersey law applies.
under maryland law,of the second restatement of conflict of laws governs the determination of whether maryland or new jersey law applies.see jackson pasadena receivables,see also kronovet lipchin,quoting restatement second conflict of laws taylor lotus dev.the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied unless 
a the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice,or 
b application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which otherwise would be the state of applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.

as we have previously stated,not every statutory provision constitutes a fundamental policy of a state.volvo constr.equip.of,clm equip,cir.merely because maryland law is dissimilar to the law of another jurisdiction does not render the latter contrary to maryland public policy and thus unenforceable in maryland courts.bethlehem steel varnas.moreover,there is a heavy burden on the party who urges rejection of foreign law on the ground of public policy.harford mut.bruchey.
no maryland state court has yet evaluated whether the mwpcl embodies such a strong public policy.sedghi patchlink,wl,at.however,maryland district courts,including the district court in this case,have thrice held that the wage law does not appear to represent a fundamental policy of the state of maryland for the purpose of choice of law analysis.taylor.at sedghi,wl,at yeibo e park of,wl,at.
maryland state courts have struck down contractual provisions contrary to a fundamental public policy in cases where the related statute contains an express statement that the law is a fundamental public policy,an provision,or similar language of clear legislative intent.thus,in bethlehem steel,the maryland court of appeals refused to uphold the provision of a pennsylvania contract that indemnified for negligence because doing so would violate a fundamental maryland public policy.at.the maryland general assembly specifically addressed such clauses in construction contracts and has unequivocally told the maryland judiciary that such a clause is void and unenforceable.id.at.furthermore,in the language of the statute governing indemnity agreements,the general assembly expressly stated that such indemnity provision is against public policy.id.
similarly,in national glass,jc penny properties,the maryland court of appeals invalidated a pennsylvania clause that required a subcontractor to waive its right to a mechanic lien,a provision that was legal in pennsylvania but explicitly prohibited by maryland statute.the court held that honoring the contract choice of law would violate a fundamental maryland public policy because the relevant maryland statute stated that a ny provision of a contract made in violation of this section is void as against the public policy of this state.id.at emphasis added.
in contrast,the mwpcl contains no express language of legislative intent that that law is a fundamental maryland public policy.furthermore,the mwpcl contains no language indicating that any contractual terms contrary to its provisions are void and unenforceable,or that any provision of the mwpcl may not be waived by agreement.thus,we find that the mwpcl is not a fundamental maryland public policy.
contrary to kunda assertions,the maryland court of appeals decision in medex mccabe fails to show that the mwpcl is a fundamental maryland public policy and is easily distinguishable.in medex,
