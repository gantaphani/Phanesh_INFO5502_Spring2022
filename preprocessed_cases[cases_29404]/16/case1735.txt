bbc chartering logistics gbmh,bbc is the owner of the vessel bbc sealand sealand.argonaut shipping international and pegasus marine finance are two companies owned by sole shareholder cosvogiannis tmm lines,llc and lykes lines was the cargo owner.cps ships is the parent of.

the charter agreement between bbc and contained a lien provision which provided that the owner bbc would have a lien on the cargo for freight and all other amounts due under the charter including costs of recovery the charter agreement also provided that only the vessel owner,master or owner agent could issue bills of lading.charter hire was set at payable in a lump sum and the charter agreement stated that the vessel would not leave a loading port until the freight was paid in full.
on december,the sealand arrived in itajai and cargo was loaded.bbc advised that the vessel was arriving and that it would not sail from the load port until the freight was paid.despite the fact that the freight was not paid,the sealand sailed from itajai destined for santos that same day.on december,issued bills of lading without authorization from bbc for the cargo loaded in itajai.the bills of lading contained a lien clause in favor of the carrier.carrier is defined as pegasus and any connecting or substituted carrier performing transportation under the transportation agreement evidenced by this bill of lading.on december,the sealand arrived in santos,brazil,where cargo belonging to bbc was loaded.on december,bbc forwarded draft bills of lading for the cargo to,noting that originals would come from bbc houston office.
the record reflects that on either december or,paid the full amount it owed in freight to.cp ships corporate representative testified that freight was paid on december by electronic transfer.he acknowledged that the bills of lading issued by were marked freight prepaid even though on the date of issuance,december,freight had not yet been paid.receipts from jbl for the payment are dated december.from these facts bbc contends that the payments were made december.the district court did not make a finding on this point.
on january,the sealand arrived offshore puerto cabello where cargo was to be discharged.as it had at various stages of the voyage,bbc demanded payment of freight from and advised that the sealand would wait for hours and if freight was not paid,the vessel would transport the cargo to houston,its next port of call.the parties attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate a compromise.in bbc acknowledged that cp ships parent had paid but that had not yet paid bbc.after hours,the sealand sailed for houston without discharging cargo.
on january,forwarded a copy of the charter party to parent,cp ships.the next day,bbc advised and cp ships that unless it received all freight due,it would assert a freight lien against the cargo once the vessel arrived in houston.the sealand arrived in houston on january.the cargo was discharged to bbc warehouse,but later released to after posting of security.then transshipped the venezuela cargo from houston to venezuela.bbc never received payment due under the charter party.
when the sealand arrived in houston,bbc filed a complaint against the cargo in rem seeking to enforce bbc lien for nonpayment of freight.the claim was amended to add an in personam claim against and cosvogiannis.filed a complaint against the sealand,bbc and alleging breach of contract,damage to the cargo and conversion.also arrested the sealand asserting a maritime lien for its claims.in a separate proceeding,bbc obtained an arbitration judgment against.
after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of bbc against and cosvogiannis for and in favor of against and cosvogiannis for.no appeal was taken from these awards.the court also found that the sealand committed a deviation by failing to deliver the cargo to its intended destination,puerto cabello,and entered judgment for against the sealand for cost of transhipping the cargo from houston to puerto cabello.the court concluded that bbc was not entitled to a lien against cargo for the vessel freight charges and denied relief on that claim.bbc and the sealand appeal.
bbc argues that the district court erred by finding that bbc could not assert a carrier lien for freight against cargo,in rem.bbc is correct that maritime law recognizes a lien arising as a matter of law in favor of the vessel owner against the cargo for charges including unpaid freight.gilmore black,the law of admiralty ed,quoting the bird of paradise,wall.see also tetley,maritime liens and claims.ed,benedict on admiralty.however,when cargo is shipped under a charter,this lien only extends to cargo that is owned by the charterer.id.
the cargo in this case was not owned by the charterer,but by a third party shipper.
when cargo shipped under a charter is owned by a third party,general maritime law does not give the shipowner a lien against either the cargo or the freight money.charter parties,however,customarily provide that the owner shall have lien against cargo and freight and require the charterer to insert appropriate clauses in bills of lading subjecting the bills to the lien provision in the charter.
gilmore black,the law of admiralty ed,see also tetley,maritime liens and claims.ed,benedict on admiralty.the charter party between bbc and contains such provisions and provides that the vessel owner will have a lien on the cargo for freight and all other amounts due under the charter including costs of recovery.
the lien arising under the charter party does not arise by operation of maritime law,as do other maritime liens.finora amitie shipping,cir citing benedict on admiralty.rather,this lien is a creature of contract and arises from the original charter party between the vessel owner,in this case bbc,and the charterer,in this case.id.to be enforceable against a third party cargo owner,like,who is not a party to the charter party agreement,the vessel owner lien must be perfected.hornbeck offshore operators ocean line.to perfect its lien,the vessel owner must give actual notice of the lien provision in the charter party to the cargo owner before the cargo owner pays its freight to the bill of lading issuer.otherwise the lien is discharged.toro shipping veneer,cir finora,at hornbeck.at.actual notice can be given,for example,by incorporating the lien from the charter party in the bill of lading issued to the shipper or by providing a copy of the charter party to the shipper.hornbeck.
the district court found that did not have actual notice of the lien provision in the charter party until january,when bbc sent a copy of the agreement to.the district court did not make a finding as to when paid.although the bills of lading dated december were marked freight prepaid,cp ships corporate representative testified that freight was paid on december by electronic transfer.receipts from jbl for the payment are dated december.from this evidence,we are satisfied that the payments were made no later than december.if the district court is correct that did not have actual notice of the lien provision in the charter party until january,it correctly held that bbc could not assert a lien against the cargo.
bbc argues that had constructive notice of the lien based on the company knowledge that the sealand would be the carrying vessel and because cosvogiannis asked cp ships to confirm payment to bbc in writing.these arguments fail because none of these facts constitute actual notice of the lien provision.even if these facts constitute constructive notice,constructive notice is insufficient to perfect liens against third party cargo owners.finora,at.
bbc alternative argument is that the lien provision in the bill of lading provided actual notice of the charter party lien to.the bills of lading contains a provision that the carrier shall have a lien on all goods,which survived delivery for all freight,demurrage and other charges due under this contract.it also defines carrier as pegasus marine finance,and any connecting carrier performing transportation under the transportation agreement evidenced by this bill of lading.the sealand was identified as the vessel on the face of the bills of lading.bbc argues that these provisions in the bill of lading coupled with knowledge that the sealand was the vessel which would be carrying their cargo constitute actual notice to of the lien provision in the charter party in favor of bbc.we disagree.
we have found no cases supporting an argument that such incomplete information places the cargo owner on notice of the lien provision in the charter party.the cases finding notice generally do so when the cargo owner is notified that the vessel owner is claiming a lien,the legal basis for the lien the charter party agreement and that the vessel owner intends to enforce it by demanding payment of freights directly to it.for example in hornbeck at,the vessel owner agent notified the cargo owner that it claimed a lien under the terms of the charter party and requested that the cargo owner pay all outstanding freights owned to the charterer directly to the vessel owner.in finora,a vessel owner request to the subcharterer to pay subfreights directly to it was not actual notice of the lien in favor of the vessel owner because it was based on the ground that the charterer had assigned the subfreights.finora at.the court held that the notice should inform obligors of the existence of the lien,the legal basis for the lien,and the fact that the lienholder intends to exercise it.finora at.nothing in the bill of lading makes reference to a lien in favor of bbc,the legal basis for the lien the charter party agreement or that bbc intended to enforce it.finora,at.the language of this provision does not satisfy the requirement of clear notice required to impose a lien for unpaid charter hire on cargo owned by a party not in privity with the vessel owner and charterer.id.such notice was not given to until january,after had paid its freight obligation to.
accordingly,the district court did not err by finding that bbc could not assert a carrier lien for freight against cargo,in rem,either under the general maritime law or pursuant to the lien provision in the charter party with.
bbc argues next that the district court erred in finding that the sealand ratified and then breached the bills of lading issued by,making the sealand liable in rem for transshipment costs incurred by.
bbc argues that the district court erred by concluding that the sealand was bound by bills of lading issued by and liable thereunder for a deviation because the bills of lading were unauthorized and because they were issued after the sealand sailed with the cargo on board.neither of those factors affect the sealand in rem liability for a deviation.the general rule is that 
when cargo has been stowed on board the vessel and bills of lading are issued,the bills of lading become binding contracts on the vessel in rem upon the sailing of the vessel with the cargo.the sailing of the vessel constitutes a ratification of the bills of lading this action gives rise to a maritime lien which is the basis of the in rem recovery.even though the vessel is operating under charter parties,the lien against the vessel is not affected.
cactus pipe supply montmartre,cir citations omitted.the bills of lading issued in cactus pipe by the charterer may have been authorized by the master of the vessel.id.at.however,even if bills of lading are issued without the master authority,as in this case,the same principle applies.
moreover,if bills of lading are not signed by the master or with his authority,but by the charterer,the sailing of the vessel with the cargo on board,and even the receipt of the cargo on board,binds her in rem on the bills of lading as the sailing,as well as the receipt of the cargo on board,is held to be ratification of the bill of lading contracts.
benedict on admiralty,citing the muskegon,if the voyage is begun,the vessel must carry the goods to destination on the terms agreed by the shipper with the charterer for when the vessel starts upon the voyage,by implication,there is a ratification and adoption by the ship of the charterer contract with the shipper.it is presumed that the master knows that the charterer will issue bills of lading for the cargo loaded thus binding the vessel and cargo together.id.accordingly,the fact that the bills of lading issued by the charterer were unauthorized by the vessel is irrelevant.id.
bbc reliance on insurance of north america american argosy,cir,a case from the second circuit,is misplaced.that case holds that the doctrine of ratification of a bill of lading does not apply to a bill of lading issued by a nonvessel operating common carrier without the knowledge or consent of the owner,charterer or master of the vessel in this case,the bill of lading was not issued by a,but by,the charterer.in a ruling which no one appeals,the district court found that argonaut,pegasus,and pegasus marine are the same company.accordingly,a bill of lading issued by pegasus was issued by and with the knowledge of the charterer,argonaut,making this case distinguishable from the argosy decision.
this leaves only bbc contention that ratification can only occur if the bills of lading are issued before the ship sails.according to benedict on admiralty,the common carrier liability starts upon accepting delivery of cargo for carriage and it is clear that if the vessel sails before the bill of lading has been issued,the instrument which is eventually issued is the contract covering the venture from the start.
based on the above,the district court did not err by binding the sealand to the terms of the bills of lading issued by.a contract of carriage was created by the acceptance of the cargo on board the sealand for transport and the terms of the bill of lading,even if not authorized by the vessel,set the terms of the agreement.
bbc argues next that assuming a valid contract was formed when the sealand ratified the bills of lading,the district court erred in finding that the sealand breached the contract by failing to discharge cargo in puerto cabello.the district court,in its second amended final judgment,found that when the sealand did not discharge cargo in venezuela as required by the bills of lading,but instead discharged the cargo in houston,texas,this constituted a deviation and a breach of contract for which the vessel is liable for the costs incurred by to ship the cargo from houston to its correct destination,puerto cabello.we agree.
deviation has come to mean any variation in the conduct of a ship in the carriage of goods whereby the risk incident to the shipment will be increased,such as carrying the cargo on the deck of the ship contrary to custom and without the consent of the shipper,delay in carrying the goods,failure to deliver the goods at the port named in the bill of lading and carrying them farther to another port,or bringing them back to the port of original shipment and reshipping them.articulos nacionales de goma gomaven aragua,cir emphasis added.by carrying cargo that was bound for venezuela to houston,the sealand deviated.only an unreasonable deviation has any affect on the liability of the vessel.this court has found a shipper can make out a case of unreasonable deviation simply by proving that his cargo was offloaded at a place other than the stipulated destination.spartus v.the yafo,cir 
bbc argues that its performance was excused by commercial impracticability because of the failure of to provide a berth,stevedores and pay freight as required in the free in and out provision in the charter party.we disagree.the free in and out provision simply means that the vessel does not pay for the costs of loading,stowage or disch
