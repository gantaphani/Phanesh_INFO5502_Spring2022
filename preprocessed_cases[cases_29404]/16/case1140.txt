opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on an appeal by elliott frantz,elliott frantz from orders of the district court entered april,and april,granting company summary judgment on elliott frantz contract claims arising out of termination of the parties distributor selling agreement.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the orders in part and reverse in part and will remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings.
ii.factual and procedural history 
the parties and their agreement 
plaintiff elliott frantz is an industrial construction equipment sales and service provider incorporated under the laws of pennsylvania with its principal place of business in that state.defendant is a manufacturer and supplier of industrial construction equipment incorporated under the laws of new jersey with its principal place of business in that state.in august,elliott frantz and entered into a written distributor selling agreement the agreement pursuant to which elliott frantz would have rights to promote,sell and service equipment within a specific geographical area,referred to as the area of primary sales responsibility,consisting of various counties in eastern pennsylvania and delaware.although the agreement granted elliott frantz the right to represent products within the area of primary sales responsibility,elliott frantz asserts that the parties treated the agreement as granting it an exclusive right.
the agreement imposed certain responsibilities on including,inter alia,the obligation to provide sales assistance,engineering and application advice,reasonable quantities of advertising materials,campaigns and instruction in sales and service.app.at.on the other hand,the agreement required elliott frantz,inter alia,to use its best efforts to develop business,to promote the sale of and to sell equipment covered by this agreement within its area of primary sales responsibility and to furnish prompt,efficient,and courteous service.app.at.
most relevant for our purposes,the agreement contained a termination provision,which read in pertinent part 
duration and termination of agreement 
a.this agreement,unless terminated as hereinafter provided,shall continue in full force and effect until terminated by either party,without cause,on sixty days written notice to such effect given to the other party.
b.this agreement may be terminated by on thirty days written notice to distributor,should the distributor fail to satisfy the sales objectives as prescribed by this agreement.
app.at.emphasis added.the agreement further provided that the agreement including its attachments contains the entire and only agreement between the parties respecting the sale to and the purchase by the distributor of the equipment referred to herein,and any representation,promise or condition not incorporated herein shall not be binding on either party.app.at.finally,the agreement provided that all questions arising under it were to be governed by new jersey law.
termination of the agreement 
in july,notified elliot frantz of its dissatisfaction with what it stated was elliott frantz declining performance under the agreement.on may,sent a letter to elliott frantz terminating its distributorships in pennsylvania and delaware.in particular,the termination letter read 
p ursuant to section of the agreement,the agreement and our business relationship with respect to the pennsylvania counties covered by the agreement will terminate sixty days from your receipt of this letter.the agreement and our business relationship with respect to delaware will terminate one hundred eighty days from receipt of this letter.
app.at.explained that it based its decision to terminate the agreement on the continued unacceptable performance of elliott frantz and the significant decline in its overall sales and market share with respect to products in,which led to conclude that its products were not being adequately represented by elliott frantz.app.at.
procedural history 
in response to the termination,elliott frantz commenced this action in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania,alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing elliott frantz alleged that breached the agreement by terminating it without cause inasmuch as,according to elliott frantz,the parties had by conduct amended the agreement to eliminate ability to terminate without cause.app.at.with regard to this purported contractual modification,elliott frantz alleged that annual review of elliott frantz,performance indicated by its nature that so long as elliott frantz,performed satisfactorily,it would be permitted to continue to have the right to sell products,and would not be terminated without cause.app.at.of course,in elliott frantz view it had performed satisfactorily.elliott frantz also alleged that further breached the agreement by failing to provide the service and support that the agreement required.finally,elliott frantz claimed that breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by,among other things,arbitrarily terminating the agreement,fabricating a pretext to terminate for cause,and failing to reveal its corporate strategy that called for termination of the agreement.
removed the action to the district court on diversity of citizenship jurisdictional grounds on august,and thereafter filed an answer including affirmative defenses and a counterclaim during discovery,elliott frantz inquired into the factual bases explaining decision to terminate the agreement,and represented that it based its decision on elliott frantz unacceptable performance and decline in sales and market share.shortly before the scheduled trial date,filed a motion for summary judgment on elliott frantz claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,arguing principally that it had an absolute right to terminate the agreement without cause.app.at.further asserted that elliott frantz failed to proffer facts to support an allegation it advanced that the parties assented to,and provided new and independent consideration for,the purported modification of the agreement.finally,argued that the undisputed material facts demonstrated that it fulfilled all of its obligations under the agreement.
elliott frantz opposed motion for summary judgment.notably elliott frantz asserted that had waived its right to terminate the agreement without cause by failing to raise that right as an affirmative defense in its pleadings or during discovery.on april,the district court conducted a hearing on motion for summary judgment and,later that same day,granted the motion and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of on elliott frantz claims.
in a subsequent memorandum dated april,the district court set forth the reasons for granting motion for summary judgment in its memorandum,the court explained that did not waive its right to advance the without cause termination provision by failing to reference it in the termination letter.the district court rejected elliott frantz contract claim predicated on the assertion that wrongfully had terminated the agreement without cause,as the court explained that any purported modification of the agreement to eliminate the termination without cause provision failed for lack of consideration.the court also rejected elliott frantz arguments based on new jersey public policy aimed at preventing economic duress.finally,with regard to the claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,the district court stated that t he contract calls for reasonable support to be provided,and a reasonable jury could not conclude that defendant failed to meet that standard,inasmuch as did not completely withdraw its contractually obligated support thereafter,elliott frantz filed a timely appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised removal diversity of citizenship jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to and,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review of the orders granting summary judgment.see dilworth metro.ins,cir haugh allstate ins,cir.thus,we will affirm those orders if our review reveals that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter or law.c.as the moving party,bears the burden of proof,and we view the facts in the light most favorable to elliott frantz,the party against whom summary judgment was sought and entered.see dilworth,at haugh,at.the parties agree that new jersey law governs,and we will decide the case on that basis principally relying on opinions of the supreme court of new jersey by which we are bound with respect to questions of new jersey law.see united states jefferson,cir.
iv.discussion 
inasmuch as the district court granted summary judgment in favor of on elliott frantz claims for breach of contract and for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,we will address each claim separately.
breach of contract 
initially we agree with the district court conclusion that did not waive its argument predicated on its right to terminate the agreement without cause.to start with,did not contractually waive its right to terminate the agreement without cause even though its termination letter did not state explicitly that the termination was without cause.after all,as the district court noted,the agreement did not include a provision requiring a particular form of a notification of termination.in any event,although the termination letter did not cite precisely to subsection.a of the agreement,which pertained to termination without cause,did cite to section by stating that pursuant to section of the agreement the pennsylvania distributorship would terminate sixty days from receipt of the letter.app.at.this locution is significant because the notice provision was unique to the without cause termination provision in section.a,and thus reference to both section and the notice requirement of section.a undoubtedly informed elliott frantz that was invoking and relying upon section.
it is also obvious that was terminating the agreement pursuant to the without cause provision for the negative reason that the agreement provided that could terminate it on days notice if elliott frantz did not meet the agreement sales objectives.clearly inasmuch as said that it was terminating elliott frantz because of the significant decline in its sales and market share with respect to products,the termination provision was available to it,but did not mention the termination provision in its letter.
we also hold that did not waive its right to terminate the agreement without cause by specifying the reason for its action in the termination letter.it seems obvious to us that even if a party does not need cause to terminate a contract,it would be quite surprising if it did so without what it believed was good cause inasmuch as businesses,ordinarily at least,do not make decisions for whimsical reasons.thus,the real benefit to a party of having the right to terminate a contract without cause is that it need not demonstrate that it can justify the cause for its actions.
we also believe that it would be remarkable to hold that in order to preserve its rights to terminate a contract without cause,a party is obliged to withhold the actual reason for its action from the other party,particularly when,as here,it had had a lengthy relationship with that party.thus,we hardly can conceive that could have preserved its right to terminate the agreement without cause by writing to elliott frantz that we are terminating the agreement without cause but that it waived that right by indicating why it was terminating the agreement.we can not bring ourselves to believe that the supreme court of new jersey which,as we shall explain,places much emphasis on good faith and fair dealing,would reach such a result.we hope that the obvious decline in civility in our society has not reached such a level.
in addition,the record does not support elliott frantz characterization of pleadings as evidencing its election to forego its contractual right to terminate the agreement without cause or that the pleadings otherwise indicated that it did not intend to hold elliott frantz to the without cause termination provision.in its answer to the complaint,repeatedly denied that it surrendered the right to terminate without cause 
the agreement provides that it can be terminated with cause or without cause.
admits the allegation in this paragraph.
subsequent to entering into the agreement,the parties by conduct amended the contract to eliminate ability to terminate without cause 
denies the allegations in this paragraph.
upon information and belief,decided to terminate the agreement for cause because of the conduct of the parties that eliminated the without cause provision of the agreement 
denies the allegations in this paragraph.
app.at.a person reading answer does not need the abilities of a soothsayer to understand that intended to preserve and exercise its right to terminate the agreement without cause.
moreover,on the contractual waiver point,we can not even conceive why would waive its rights to terminate the agreement without cause at the time that it was terminating the agreement.the possibility that elliott frantz might challenge the termination could not have escaped consideration,and surely it would not have intended to waive a strong legal position with which to defend against potential litigation just at the time that it might be useful to have a defense based on that position.in this regard,as we explained above,the advantage of having a without cause termination provision is that it relieves a party of the necessity of justifying its action even if it believes that it has acted for good cause.
second,we reject elliott frantz argument regarding procedural waiver in which elliott frantz urges us to treat the contractual right to terminate the agreement without cause as an affirmative defense that waived by failing to plead in a timely manner.although failure to raise an affirmative defense by responsive pleading or by appropriate motion generally results in the waiver of that defense,charpentier godsil,cir,assertion of its contractual right to terminate the agreement without cause is not an affirmative defense.on this point we observe that it is not among the affirmative defenses enumerated in.c,and is not recognized as a matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense under federal or new jersey law see.rather,the right to terminate the agreement without cause in this case is a general defense inasmuch as it negates elliott frantz prima facie case for breach of contract.see,in re rawson food,cir noting that a general defense,unlike an affirmative defense,challenges whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case.accordingly,the district court correctly rejected elliott frantz arguments concerning waiver.
termination without cause 
in further support of its breach of contract claim,we reiterate that elliott frantz alleged that violated the agreement by terminating it without cause in contravention of an oral modification of the agreement supposedly eliminating right to do so.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that the purported modification was not supported by consideration because continued performance under the existing contract does not amount to fresh consideration.elliott frantz submits that the district court erred in its analysis of the consideration issue and that it raised genuine issues of material fact concerning the purported modification.elliot frantz further argues that new jersey public policy prohibited from terminating the agreement without cause in light of what it regarded was a gross disparity in the two corporations bargaining power.
under new jersey law,parties to an existing contract,by mutual assent,may modify their contract,and modification can be proved by an explicit agreement to modify,or by the actions and conduct of the parties,so long as the intention to modify is mutual and clear.county of morris fauver,a proposed modification by one party to a contract must be accepted by the other to constitute mutual assent to modify,and,u nilateral statements or actions made after an agreement has been reached or added to a completed agreement clearly do not serve to modify the original terms of a contract id.in addition,an agreement to modify must be based on new or additional consideration.see also unalachtigo band of the lenape nation state.
initially on the modification issue,the parties dispute whether there was new or additional consideration supporting the purported modification.elliott frantz submits that the district court erred in concluding that its continued performance under the agreement could not amount to consideration sufficient to support the purported modification.in particular,elliott frantz argues that under new jersey law,inasmuch as the parties modified the agreement to eliminate ability to terminate it without cause,elliott frantz continued performance,which it could have discontinued at any time without cause,constituted consideration see woolley roche,modified on other grounds,nolan control data,following woolley.but this contention faces a possible barrier as the supreme court of new jersey seems not to have determined that the implied employment contract analysis of woolley,in which consideration by performance is presumed,is applicable outside the employment context.ultimately,though,we need not decide the absence of consideration question because we find that elliott frantz modification claim fails on other grounds.
even when construing the record in the light most favorable to elliott frantz and drawing all inferences in its favor,as we must,there are no facts to support a finding that the parties modified the agreement to eliminate the without cause termination provision,and,absent such a modification the breach of contract claim predicated on the termination of the agreement must fail.in support of its argument that the parties modified the agreement to eliminate the without cause provision,elliott frantz relies primarily on testimony by a former employee,ronald keating,to the end that representatives informed elliott frantz,along with other distributors,that as long as you remain above the national market share average,you do have anything to worry about.if you fall below,you need to be concerned.app.at.moreover,elliott frantz points out that other representatives of said substantially the same thing.of course,in deciding this appeal we assume that the employees made these statements.
but contrary to elliott frantz claim that such statements implied a promise by that it would only terminate their distributorship contracts for cause,appellant br.at emphases added,plainly such representations can not amount to a modification eliminating express right to terminate the agreement without cause,and a trier of the fact could not draw a reasonable contrary inference.moreover,to the extent that they related to the termination provision of the agreement they plainly related to subsection,which dealt with termination by reason of a distributor failing to satisfy sales objectives.the statements did nothing more than explain that subsection.
in any event,at most,the representations were unilateral expressions of likely intent with respect to termination of the agreement and were explanations that if elliott frantz failed to perform adequately might terminate the agreement as section.b contemplated.the expressions can not possibly be regarded as a relinquishment by of its critical right to terminate the agreement for any reason or for no reason at all,as provided in section.a of the agreement.they never even touched on that right.
as an analytical matter,it is one thing to explain that a particular circumstance,such as decline in market share,could result in termination and quite another to agree to terminate only for that particular reason.it is significant that elliott frantz does not point to evidence suggesting that the participants in the conversations at issue referred to the agreement generally or its termination provisions in particular,or that represented that only a decline in market share would trigger termination.in short,elliott frantz has not produced any evidence to show,or from which a trier of the fact reasonably and fairly could infer,that made an offer to relinquish its express right to terminate the agreement without cause,let alone that it made an offer to modify the agreement to the end that it could terminate the agreement only by reason of elliott frantz having a declining market share 
in asserting its claim of modification,elliott frantz reliance on woolley is misplaced.in woolley,an employee brought a breach of contract claim against his employer claiming that certain express and implied promises in the employer personnel manual created a contract under which the employee could not be fired at will,but rather only for cause,and then only after the employer followed procedures outlined in the manual.the new jersey supreme court held in woolley that an implied promise contained in a personnel manual that an employee will be fired only for cause may be enforceable against an employer even when the employment is for an indefinite term and would otherwise be terminable at will.at emphases added.
but the personnel manual,the distribution of which was deemed to constitute an offer in woolley,stands in stark contrast to oral statements.first,the personnel manual was a lengthy written document distributed by the employer to a large class of employees with the intent that all employees be advised of the benefits it confers.id.at.second,the manual contained five full pages devoted to termination,which set forth the purpose and policy of the termination section and,most notably,defined the types of termination,which did not include termination without cause.id.as a result,the court concluded that the policy manual represents the most reliable statement of the terms of employment.id.at.the same simply can not be said for employees comments.here the agreement remained the most reliable statement of the terms of the parties contractual relationship.elliott frantz assertion is thus simply inaccurate when it claims that made the same types of promises as the defendant employer in woolley.appellant br.at.on the contrary,woolley is starkly different,and employees comments fall far short of the representations the personnel manual in woolley contained.
moreover,elliott frantz comparison to woolley fails outside the employment context.during oral argument counsel for elliott frantz pressed the assertion that woolley involved the same type of promise as here,arguing that the only difference factually was that woolley was an context.transcript of oral argument at.in addition to counsel being incorrect about the factual similarities,he understated the legal effect of the one difference he concedes.the promise in woolley was made in a context vastly different from that here,and this distinction is critical inasmuch as the new jersey supreme court in woolley made clear that the context in which the promise was made in that case was central to its holding that the personnel manual constituted an offer for modification.thus,the court explained that the context of the manual preparation and distribution is,to us,the most persuasive proof that it would be almost inevitable for an employee to regard it as a binding agreement,legally enforceable,concerning the terms and conditions of his employment.at emphasis added.
to the best of our knowledge,the new jersey supreme court has not applied its woolley holding beyond the employment context and instead has followed that case only in cases involving personnel manuals.see,wade kessler,nicosia wakefern food,witkowski thomas lipton.in this regard we point out that the parties have not directed our attention to any case in which that court has applied woolley in a context analogous to that here.moreover,the new jersey supreme court has limited its holding in woolley even within the employment context.see shebar sanyo bus,explaining that woolley pertained to established termination policies and not individual oral promises related to employment.elliott frantz does not supply us with any reason to extend woolley beyond the contours the new jersey supreme court delineated in that case and we decline to do so.
we also point out the startling implications of elliott frantz contention as it attempts to tie right to terminate its dealership to a demonstration that elliott frantz did not maintain its sales performance at a certain level.thus,it necessarily follows in view that if it maintained its performance at that level could not terminate its distributorship.such a contract construction necessarily would give it the right to maintain its distributorship for an indefinite period,thereby hobbling ability to operate its business in the most desirable way as circumstances changed.as a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction,we would be loath to apply state law to support such a claim.rather,if new jersey law is to go to where elliott frantz wants it to go,the new jersey legislature or supreme court should take it there.see leo chem,cir.
we also affirm the district court rejection of elliott frantz breach of contract claim insofar as elliott frantz based it on public policy.the case on which elliott frantz bases its public policy argument,shell oil marinello,pertains to franchise practices,a type of relationship creating legal consequences not germane in this proceeding.in point of fact,in reaching its decision in shell oil,the new jersey supreme court based its public policy analysis largely on the legislative concerns embodied in the new jersey franchise practices act,stat.ann.west,see at,a statute which is not applicable in this case and does not apply to the parties relationship.our rejection of the public policy theory is consistent with the new jersey supreme court rejection of similar attempts to extend the holding of shell oil beyond the context of franchise agreements.thus,in alcoa,the court held that an distribution agreement was in no sense comparable to the franchise agreement that produced the holding of in shell oil.
furthermore,even if we were inclined to credit elliott frantz characterization of new jersey public policy as establishing that without cause termination provisions are ineffective where there is grossly disproportionate bargaining power,appellant br.at,there is no foundation in the record on which we could anchor an acceptance of its conclusory allegation that there is grossly disproportionate bargaining power between the parties in this case.plainly,from its own representations we are constrained to conclude that elliott frantz is not a weak entity as it claims that since it has earned a reputation for being a distributor of industrial and construction equipment,maintaining numerous offices throughout pennsylvania,maryland,and delaware.app.at.moreover,was concerned with the possibility that elliott frantz would distribute products competitive to those of.thus,in assessing elliott frantz public policy argument,this is an excellent case for us to apply the principle that courts can not write a better contract than the one the parties made for themselves.see kotkin aronson,citing kampf franklin life ins.
we also point out that merely because is a far larger business than elliott frantz,it did not necessarily have grossly disproportionate bargaining power in their dealings.certainly a court must measure parties bargaining power in the context of the subject matter of the bargaining at hand.for example,an individual owning a property that a major corporation greatly needed might have more bargaining power than the corporation in negotiations regarding the sale of the property and could compel it to pay a price for the property far exceeding what,in another context,would be regarded as its market value.
in this case the material time concerning the bargaining power of the parties was in when they entered into the agreement including the without cause termination provision.at that time,as we already have explained,elliott frantz long had been a distributor of industrial and construction equipment,and had numerous offices throughout pennsylvania,maryland,and delaware.app.at.certainly elliott frantz was operating in a major market geographic area,and it would have been useful to to be represented by a distributor as successful as elliott frantz.in the circumstances,we do not understand how a court could conclude that,in negotiating its agreement with,elliott frantz was in the weaker position.clearly elliott frantz position was markedly different from that of an individual seeking to obtain a franchise from a major corporation so that he or she can go into business.if elliott frantz did not like the without cause termination provision,the time to reject it was when the parties negotiated the agreement,and if had insisted on it being in the agreement,elliott frantz could have declined to be its distributor and continued on with its already successful business.
failure to provide required support 
in addition to claiming that improperly terminated the agreement without cause,elliott frantz asserted in the district court that it failed to provide certain services and support required by the agreement.the district court addressed this claim solely in the context of the good faith and fair dealing claim and rejected it,concluding that t he contract calls for reasonable support to be provided,and that a jury could not conclude that failed to meet this standard.
the district court did not elaborate on its determination that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to the level of support provided,nor did the court explain why it was appropriate for it on a motion for summary judgment rather than the trier of fact at a trial,to decide whether provided a reasonable amount of support.yet in richie pat bonvie stables,irving,the court held that the reasonableness of a party reliance on a representation was a jury question for which evidence of industry custom and usage may have relevance.it seems to us that if reasonableness was a jury question in that context,it should be a question for the trier of the fact,whether the court at a bench trial or a jury,in the context here as there is a genuine dispute of facts regarding a similar question of reasonableness.
but there is a more fundamental problem with the district court analysis on this issue.in fact,the reason we will reverse the judgment insofar as it rejected elliott frantz service and support claim arises from the vagueness of the contractual language at issue.the district court based its conclusion on the premise that the agreement required a reasonable amount of support,but the agreement did not say that,as the provision on that point read 
shall provide sales assistance,engineering and application advice,reasonable quantities of advertising materials,campaigns and instruction in sales and service.
app.at.contrary to the district court suggestion that the contract calls for reasonable support to be provided,the term reasonable does not appear with regard to the quantity or quality of support and services required generally and the parties used the term reasonable only once to refer specifically to quantities of advertising materials.
nevertheless,elliott frantz,like the district court,treats the agreement as calling for reasonable quantities of support and services,including sales assistance,engineering and application advice,and instructions in sales and service.we recognize that a requirement that a party performance under a contract be reasonable ordinarily would commend itself to a court,however,asserts that the agreement did not mandate a quantitative level of assistance,and consequently even minimal amounts of support would suffice.see appellee br.at.in this case,the parties differing constructions of the provision underscore its vagueness.there is notably absent from the provision any indication that the parties agreed on how,how much,or when would provide sales assistance,engineering and application advice,campaigns and instruction in sales and service or what level its performance would have to reach with respect to these matters to be reasonable,if that is the proper measure of the required performance.nor is it clear what constitutes a reasonable quantity of advertising materials.
as a result,the breach of contract claim based on this provision of the agreement was particularly for disposition on a motion for summary judgment.where a contract contains vague provisions,new jersey courts will fill gaps or interpret missing terms in it so as to furnish sufficiently definite meaning to the contract so long as there is evidence that the parties intended to enter into a bargain.paley barton sav.loan ass n,accord driscoll constr.dep t of,w here there is uncertainty,ambiguity or the need for parol evidence in aid of interpretation,then the doubtful provision should be left to the jury.satellite ent,keaton.in construing vague provisions,new jersey courts will imply a reasonable missing term or,if necessary,will receive evidence to provide a basis for such an implication.satellite,at.in particular,courts will look to,among other things,all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction,as well as evidence of the parties course of dealing,usage and course of performance.see,leitner braen,holding that contract for the usual sponsorship fees was enforceable despite vagueness and that evidence of custom and usage is always relevant to make definite words which would otherwise be vague and indefinite see also allan farnsworth,contracts,at ed.
in sum,absent an understanding of just what obligations undertook or at least what would be a reasonable performance of its obligations,if that is the applicable standard,the district court should not have determined that adequately performed under the agreement.accordingly,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of on elliott frantz breach of contract claim insofar as it rests the claim on alleged failure to provide support and services required under the agreement 
we make a final observation regarding the services and support provision of the agreement.we are aware that contracts frequently have provisions similar to the service and support provision in the agreement,and we further recognize that our opinion on this point might be taken as extending an open invitation to litigation when the parties to a contract become dissatisfied with each other performance.we regret these possible implications of our opinion,but we see no escape from them because vague provisions,even if their use in a contract can not be avoided,invite disputes.but we nevertheless reach our result,as applicable principles of new jersey law by which we are bound when coupled with summary judgment standards require that we do so.
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the district court also rejected elliott frantz claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and elliott frantz challenges that disposition.but our review of the record satisfies us that the court correctly granted summary judgment on this issue.
under new jersey law,e very party to a contract is bound by a duty of good faith and fair dealing in both the performance and enforcement of the contract.brunswick hills racquet club,route shopping ctr,see also gaydos ins.agency,consumer ins,onderdonk presbyterian homes.the new jersey legislature has adopted the uniform commercial code definition of good faith,defining the term as meaning honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.stat.ann.b west see also brunswick hills,at.the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing requires that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the full fruits of the contract.gaydos ins.agency,at.
the supreme court of new jersey has adopted the restatement of contracts explanation that good faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with justified expectations of the other party.id.citing restatement second of contracts,cmt.a.a plaintiff may be entitled to relief in an action under the covenant if the defendant acts with ill motives and without any legitimate purpose to destroy the plaintiff reasonable expectations.wilson amerada hess.however,bad motive or intention is essential,and an allegation of bad faith or unfair dealing should not be permitted to be advanced in the abstract and absent improper motive.id.thus,as we indicated in northview motors,chrysler motors,cir,in a point the supreme court of new jersey has approved even though we decided the case under pennsylvania law,see brunswick hills,at,the covenant should not be construed too broadly as it could become an statement of the parties obligations under contract law,imposing unintended obligations upon parties and destroying the mutual benefits created by legally binding agreements.
in this case,there are no facts to demonstrate,or from which to infer,bad motive or intention.elliott frantz offers only conclusory allegations that had such motives based largely on the timing of the termination of the agreement.however,the record suggests just the opposite inasmuch as elliott frantz concedes that members of management disagreed over what was the best course for their company and engaged in protracted internal debate regarding corporate strategy and the costs and benefits of utilizing stores.as the supreme court of new jersey explained in wilson,a party does not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing merely because its decisions disadvantaged another party,and contract law does not require parties to behave altruistically toward each other.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.absent bad motive or intention,decisions a contract expressly permits which happen to result in economic disadvantage to the other party are of no legal significance.id.accordingly,if we allowed elliott frantz breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim to proceed we would be disregarding the caveat in wilson that such claims under new jersey law should not be permitted to be advanced in the abstract and absent improper motive.wilson,at.
in addition,the case to which elliott frantz likens this matter,brunswick hills,is distinguishable and does not support elliott frantz argument.the in brunswick hills sought to exercise a lease option that allowed for a renewal,and notified the of its intention to do so on numerous occasions but without realizing that it had failed to meet all requirements for valid exercise.despite knowing of the plaintiff stated intention to exercise the lease option,defendant,through its agents,engaged in a pattern of evasion,sidestepping every request by plaintiff to discuss the option and ignoring plaintiff repeated written and verbal entreaties to move forward on closing the year lease.id.at.the supreme court of new jersey explained that the defendant receipt of plaintiff repeated letters and telephone calls concerning the exercise of the option obliged the defendant to respond and to respond truthfully.id.at.the breach of the implied covenant in brunswick hills was a demonstrable course of conduct,a series of evasions and delays,that lulled plaintiff into believing it had exercised the lease option properly.id.
this case presents a starkly different set of facts and claims elliott frantz does not claim similarly thwarted its attempt to exercise some contractual right,let alone that it did so with bad motive or intent.while elliott frantz alleges that fail ed to reveal its corporate strategy of terminating the agreement and opting for stores,app.at,the record does not contain any facts from which to infer that in implementing its strategy engaged in gamesmanship similar to that that the supreme court condemned in brunswick hills.
a more instructive precedent to consider regarding failure to reveal its corporate strategy,and one on which elliott frantz relied before the district court,but abandoned on appeal,is,a leading case in which the new jersey supreme court considered a good faith and fair dealing claim arising from the termination of an distributorship in,the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an exclusive distributorship agreement,but the defendant ultimately terminated the exclusivity provision by appointing four additional dis
