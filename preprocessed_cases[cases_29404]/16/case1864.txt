this appeal presents issues under mississippi law concerning the statute of limitations for breach of warranty claims,contractual warranties,and the assessment of damages resulting from the failure of machinery.
in,company dresser designed and sold mississippi chemical corporation mcc a gas compressor train for use in the production of ammonia.the compressor train consisted of,inter alia,two separate high case compressor and a low case compressor the compressor train did not work as promised.the high case compressor broke in.the low case compressor broke in and again in.each time one of the compressors malfunctioned,dresser attempted to repair the compressor train.
mcc eventually filed suit,claiming negligent design,breach of express warranty,and breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.a jury awarded mcc damages on the warranty claims in the amount of.dresser appeals the judgment,arguing issues relating to the statute of limitations,to the terms of the warranty,to the proper notice of breach of the warranty,and to damages 
we hold first that the statute of limitations does not preclude mcc express warranty claim because the failure of the repair or replace remedy for the warranty occurred within six years of the date that the complaint was filed.second,we hold that the express terms of the warranty do not bar mcc cause of action.third,we hold that mcc provided adequate notice of the defects in the compressor train to trigger liability under the express warranty.finally,we hold that the damage award calculation made by the jury was not as a substantive matter,incorrect or under the evidence presented,speculative.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
mcc produces ammonia at its fertilizer plant in yazoo city,mississippi.for the most part,the ammonia is used as an input in small amount is sold on the market or stored in inventory for future use.the production of ammonia involves the compression of gas in a compressor train.each train consists of,among other things,a low case and a high case compressor.
in,in an effort to increase its ammonia production,mcc bought a specially designed compressor train from dresser.the sales contract for the train contained an express warranty guaranteeing that the train would be free from defects and comport with certain technical specifications.as an exclusive remedy for the breach of this warranty,dresser offered to correct promptly any defect at its own expense.
in april,the high case compressor broke.mcc notified dresser of the problem and shipped the high case compressor to new orleans for repair.dresser supplied a redesigned compressor and assured mcc that this new compressor would cure all the defects in the train.
in december,however,mcc began to experience excessive vibrations in the low case compressor.in may,these vibrations became sufficiently severe to require a reduction in the speed of the compressor train.this reduction resulted in a loss of ammonia production.
in september,dresser identified a fracture in a component the stage impeller of the low case compressor as the cause of the vibration problem and recommended a modification of that component.in december and again in,similar vibration problems were identified in the other components of the low case compressor specifically,the,and stage impellers.dresser agreed to inspect and modify these components.
in december,dresser advised mcc that similar repairs would have to be made to the impeller components of the high case compressor.
in march,mcc filed suit for breach of the express warranty,breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,and negligent design.
dresser filed a motion to dismiss,asserting that mississippi chemical warranty claims were barred by the statute of limitations.in denying the motion,the district court found that dresser statute of limitations defense contained mixed questions of law and fact and,therefore,was not amenable to summary disposition.
after discovery,dresser filed a motion for summary judgment asserting again that the statute of limitations barred the warranty claims and,for the first time,asserted that the economic loss doctrine barred mcc claim the district court denied this motion.
the case proceeded to trial.at the end of mcc,dresser renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law based on the same reasons given in its summary judgment motion.the district court granted the motion in part,holding that the economic loss doctrine barred mcc negligent design claim.on the remaining warranty claims,however,the case went to the jury.
the jury found that dresser had breached the implied warranty of merchantability the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and the express warranty.the jury based its breach of the express warranty finding on a conclusion that the exclusive repair and replacement remedy had failed its essential purpose.the jury awarded mcc in damages for the profits lost during the three different periods when the compressor train was malfunctioning.
the district court then denied dresser motions for judgment as a matter of law and remittitur or a new trial.dresser now appeals the denial of these motions 
we review de novo the district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.see cozzo tangipahoa parish government,cir citation omitted.however,when an action is tried by a jury,such a motion is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.brown bryan county,ok,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we consider the evidence drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the party.id.furthermore,we must always keep in mind that our standard of review with respect to a jury verdict is especially deferential.id.thus,we will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have arrived at the verdict.snyder trepagnier,cir citation omitted,cert.dismissed,d.

we first address dresser arguments with respect to liability.
dresser argues that it is not liable for the breach of the express or implied warranties because the statute of limitations bars any cause of action.
the mississippi version of the ucc sets out the statute of limitations for contract claims 
an action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within six years after the cause of action has accrued.
a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when the tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
code ann.dresser argues that the second sentence of section bars any cause of action based on breach of or express.dresser correctly states that in breach of warranty cases,the code defines,as the starting date for the statute of limitations,the date of delivery in all but one situation,where there has been a guarantee of future performance.
applying this definition to the facts at hand,dresser states that it is undisputed that it delivered the compressor train to mcc in,more than six years before mcc filed its complaint.consequently,dresser concludes that all of mcc warranty claims are barred as a matter of law.with respect to mcc express warranty claim,this argument is unpersuasive.
the express warranty for the compressor train reads in relevant part 
seller warrants to purchaser that the equipment supplied hereunder by seller will be free from defects in material and workmanship,will be of the kind and quality designated and described in this offer and will conform with all applicable specifications and drawings incorporated herein.if,within eighteen months from the date of delivery of the equipment to purchaser,or months from the date of,whichever occurs first,seller receives from purchaser written notice that the equipment supplied hereunder does not meet the warranties specified above,and if the equipment does not meet such warranties,seller shall promptly correct each such defect at its own expense.
purchaser exclusive remedies for breaches of the express warranties contained in this contract shall be stated herein.
this express warranty is a repair or replacement warranty.to repair or replace represents the exclusive remedy for a breach of the express warranty.under the mississippi ucc,backing up an express warranty with an exclusive promise to repair or replace the good in question is permissible.code ann.a.but if the repair or replacement remedy fails its essential purpose,then the buyer may seek any alternative remedy provided in the code.code ann.under section,the buyer first must seek repair or replacement to remedy a breach of an express warranty,and only if the seller fails to meet this promise in ucc speak,the repair or replacement remedy fails its essential purpose,may the buyer bring a contract action.
it is important to distinguish dresser repair or replace promise from its promise that the compressor train would be free from defects.see delhomme,houston beechcraft,cir distinguishing a warranty and the limited remedy to enforce that warranty.based on this distinction,we read sections and in tandem.accordingly,we hold that the cause of action based on the express warranty did not accrue for the purpose of section,until the promise to repair or replace the compressor train failed its essential purpose.the high case compressor failed in.dresser immediately repaired and replaced this part of the compressor train.the train then functioned normally until december,when the low case compressor began to malfunction.the malfunction caused the train to run at a diminished rate and produce less ammonia.thus,as a matter of law,december represents the earliest possible date that the repair and replace remedy could have failed its essential purpose.up until that point in time,the remedy was accomplishing its,the repairs were successful and the compressor train was running smoothly.because mcc filed its complaint within six years of december earliest possible date that dresser could have breached the limited remedy for the express warranty the statute of limitations does not bar mcc express warranty cause of action 
along slightly different lines,dresser argues that the express terms of the warranty limit the duration of the warranty to eighteen months from the date of purchase or twelve months from the date of.the malfunctioning periods for which the jury assessed damages began in,more than twelve months after the date of the sometime shortly after october.so,according to dresser,the compressor train was not covered by the express warranty during the malfunctioning periods at issue.we find this argument is unpersuasive.
as noted above,the relevant provision of the express warranty reads 
if,within eighteen months from the date of delivery of the equipment to purchaser,or months from the date of,whichever occurs first,seller receives from purchaser written notice that the equipment supplied hereunder does not meet the warranties specified above,and if the equipment does not meet such warranties,seller shall promptly correct such defect at its own expense.
by its very terms,the eighteen and twelve months time limitations refer to the notice of the breach,not to the duration of the warranty.the contract required mcc to provide notice within twelve months of,but if timely notice was given,the contract did not impose any time bar on dresser promise to repair.the contractual terms,therefore,do not preclude a breach of the express warranty claim stemming from the failure of the low case compressor in and,if we assume that mcc provided adequate notice we now turn to address whether mcc furnished notice sufficient to trigger dresser liability under the express warranty.
there are two notice requirements at specific notice provision contained in the warranty and the default notice provision of the mississippi ucc.dresser arguments and our analysis are,however,the same with respect to both requirements.we outline the two relevant notice requirements before considering dresser arguments.
as previously noted,the express warranty reads 
i f,within eighteen months from the date of delivery of the equipment to purchaser,or twelve months from the date of,whichever occurs first,seller receives from purchaser written notice that the equipment supplied hereunder does not meet the warranties specified above,and if the equipment does not meet such warranties,seller shall promptly correct each such defect at its own expense.
the other notice provision at default notice provision of the mississippi that a buyer who accepts tender of goods must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy.c ode ann.a.for notice to be sufficient under a,it need not be a specific claim for damages or an assertion of legal rights.eastern air lines,mcdonnell douglas,cir citations omitted.
the sale of the compressor train occurred in march.in april,mcc wrote to dresser,stating t his letter constitutes notice by mcc that dresser is in breach of the warranties provided in said contract.dresser argues that this notice letter relates only to the damaged high case compressor.dresser asserts that it did not mandated by the warranty notice of the defects in the low case compressor,that is,within twelve months of the date of the.dresser contends that the plain terms of the warranty,therefore,exclude claims based on the failure of the low case compressor.along similar lines,dresser argues that because it never received written notice of the defects in the low case compressor,mcc did not comply with the default notice requirement of the mississippi ucc and,therefore,mcc express warranty claim is barred as a matter of law.the express warranty here required notice of defects in the equipment to trigger liability under the express warranty.the contract,in turn,defined equipment to include both the high case and the low case compressors.
it is undisputed that mcc gave notice of defects in the high case compressor within the time frame contemplated by the warranty.it is further undisputed that mcc provided evidence that the defects in the high case compressor were common to the low case compressor as well.given this evidence,a reasonable jury could have the express notice provision of the contract the default notice provision of the mississippi mcc letter provided sufficient notice to trigger liability for any common defect in the low case or the high case compressor.see eastern air lines,at citations omitted holding that whether a notice provision has been complied with is a question which is particularly within the province of the jury 
the district court therefore did not err in denying dresser motion for judgment as a matter of law based on a lack of notice.
we now turn our attention to the issue of damages.in this appeal,dresser challenges both the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the damage award and whether the jury method of computation was flawed under mississippi law.
as noted previously,our standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is highly deferential to the jury verdict.see boeing shipman,cir en banc if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict,granting of the motions is proper,overruled on other grounds,gautreaux scurlock marine,cir en banc.in contrast,we review de novo the legal conclusions that the district court made concerning the damage award.see nero indus.molding,cir holding that the court should review legal issues,such as the availability of a specific type of damages,de novo 
at trial,mcc put on evidence of the damages resulting from the lost production of ammonia during the three different periods when the compressor train was malfunctioning.the periods were may,to september,december,to august,and november,to february.for the most part,during each of these three periods the compressor train continued to produce ammonia,albeit at a diminished rate.
mcc damage was accepted in whole by the of a process first,mcc computed the profit per unit of ammonia during each of the three malfunctioning periods second,it estimated the quantity of ammonia lost in each malfunctioning period because of the reduction in the speed of the compressor train.finally,it multiplied the profit per unit by the number of units lost to come up with the total amount of damages,lost profits caused by the malfunctioning compressor train.
dresser lodges two objections to this damage calculation.first,it suggests that because mcc dipped into other sources of ammonia,its existing inventory,its production from its donaldsonville plant,and the open market to make up for the lost production from the malfunctioning compressor train,its damages should be limited to the replacement cost of these substitute sources.dresser refers to these substitute sources in ucc parlance as cover,and contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because mcc offered no evidence concerning the value of this cover.
second,dresser argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of tim sterling the person whose testimony primarily supported mcc damage calculation because he had no personal knowledge of the facts underlying his testimony.without sterling testimony,dresser concludes,the jury could not have arrived at the same verdict.
we first address dresser argument on the substantive merits of the damage award and then proceed to its evidentiary argument.throughout our analysis,we must keep in mind that the crux of dresser challenge is to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the damage award.
t he point of an award of damages,whether it is for breach of contract or for a tort,is,so far as possible,to put the victim where he would have been had the breach or tort not taken place.chronister oil unocal refining and marketing union oil of california,cir posner,citation omitted.this general principle serves as the focal point of the appropriate measure of damages as we work our way through applicable provisions of the mississippi ucc.
in the event of a breach of warranty,a buyer may seek direct,incidental,and consequential damages.code ann.here,the jury was only instructed presumably only damages.we therefore restrict our attention to consequential damages and do not consider any direct damages caused by the breach of the express warranty.
under the mississippi ucc,consequential damages include 
a any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise and 
b injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.
code ann.under mississippi law,lost profits are recoverable as consequential damages if three requirements are met the seller had reason to know at the time of contracting that if he breached the contract,the buyer would be deprived of those,the lost profits were foreseeable the lost profits are reasonably ascertainable and the lost profits could not have been reasonably prevented.see,evans,so d.
the first requirement,foreseeability,requires that the breaching party,at the time of contracting,have reason to know that such lost profits were possible.see id.internal citation omitted.foreseeability is to a large extent a notice requirement that requires the time of disclose the potential extent of their damages or forfeit the right to claim such damages upon breach.such notice is critical because it ensures that the contracted for price reflects the entire scope of the risk,the potential liability for breach that the seller has agreed to bear.see richard posner,economic analysis of law ed.aspen.
whether damages are reasonably foreseeable is a finding of fact within the province of the jury.see migerobe,certina usa,cir.here,the jury heard evidence that dresser knew if the compressor train malfunctioned the ammonia plant would have to be dresser knew that ammonia was necessary for the production of mcc products and in the past dresser predecessors in interest had trains for mcc.from this evidence,a reasonable jury could draw the conclusion that the lost profits from the lost production of ammonia were reasonably foreseeable.
we now turn to the cover requirement necessary for the recovery of lost profits.as noted above,dresser argues that mcc damages should be limited to the value of the substitute ammonia it secured to replace the diminished production by the compressor train.under section consequential damages are restricted to those damages which could not be prevented by cover or otherwise.code ann.this cover requirement imposes on the buyer a duty to mitigate his damages.comment ucc.when dealing with lost profits,this duty means that a buyer can not recover for losses he reasonably could have prevented.see,so d at.
dresser cites a number of cases for the proposition that because mcc covered by securing alternative ammonia,its damages are limited to the cost of that cover.this argument does not reflect the law in mississippi for the recovery of lost profits.to reiterate,the applicable law provides that the buyer can only recover for the lost profits he could not have prevented by cover or otherwise.code ann.a.if the buyer chooses not to cover,mitigate his damages and cover would have prevented the lost profits,the buyer can not recover for lost profits.see h w,occidental chemical,cir failure to cover does not deprive the buyer of all remedies but he may not recover consequential damages.treating century forest,cir.the loss of potential profits could have reasonably been prevented by a different form of cover or otherwise.in the absence of such preventive measures,the district court award of consequential damages is not authorized,cert.denied,d.in short,this duty to mitigate restriction on the award of lost profits has nothing to do with the actual cost of the cover.
to recognize that cover,as argued by dresser,is not mitigation of lost profits in this case,one must understand that the substitute sources of is,ammonia from a profit opportunity for mcc.it makes no ultimate difference whether the jury measured the damages as it did here see supra page or as dresser argues the jury should have measured the,by computing the value of the ammonia units procured from mcc own inventory.the ammonia was completely fungible.because mcc had to make up for the lost ammonia production by dipping into its own inventory,it had fewer total units of ammonia.the jury heard evidence about the fewer number of units.it also heard evidence concerning the value in terms of profits of each of these units.the jury multiplied these two terms together to come up with the amount of lost profits.this award places mcc in the same position as it would have been but for the breach of is,if mcc had not had to dip into its own inventory.as noted earlier,this is the precise point of a contract damage award.see chronister oil,at.
accordingly,the damage award was de novo review of the legal issues.moreover,insofar as dresser challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award,a reasonable jury,drawing all inferences in favor of mcc,could have determined the amount of damages as awarded in this case.in sum,the award complied with the three requirements necessary to recover lost profits as consequential damages under mississippi law.accordingly,the district court did not err by denying dresser motions for remittitur,a new trial,or judgment as matter of law based on an alleged misguided damage calculation.
finally,we address dresser evidentiary challenge.dresser argues that the district court abused its discretion when it allowed testimony by sterling,mcc director of risk management and property taxation,concerning the amount of lost profits caused by the defective compressor train.sterling testimony wa
