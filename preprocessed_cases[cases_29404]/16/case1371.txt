larry hyman,the liquidating trustee for the governmental risk insurance trust grit,appeals the district court application of north carolina doctrine of abatement,which resulted in the dismissal of grit diversity action against the city of gastonia,north carolina gastonia.for the reasons that follow,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
grit is a workers compensation fund that was formed to provide workers compensation insurance to governmental entities.gastonia entered into a contract with grit for grit to provide workers compensation insurance in exchange for premiums that gastonia paid to grit.the contract was in effect until march,when grit filed for bankruptcy.
in november,grit sued gastonia in florida state court under various contract theories alleging that gastonia owed it in unpaid premiums.gastonia removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of florida based on diversity of citizenship.see west supp west.after removing the case,gastonia filed a motion to dismiss arguing,inter alia,that venue was improper,see.b,that service of process was insufficient,see.b,and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,see.b,because the statute of limitations had run.the florida district court agreed that venue was improper and transferred the case to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina.thereafter,the north carolina district court granted gastonia rule b motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process and dismissed the action without prejudice see.b for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with the federal rules of civil procedure or any order of the court,a defendant may move for dismissal of an action.grit appealed the district court dismissal.hyman city of gastonia hyman i.cir unpublished.
while grit appeal in hyman i was pending in this court,grit filed a second diversity action hyman ii against gastonia in the same north carolina district court,this time properly effecting service.grit second action set forth the same claims,involved the same transactions and occurrences,and sought relief identical to that sought in grit first action.indeed,as grit candidly admits,hyman ii is the same cause of action as hyman appellant br.at.gastonia moved under rule b to dismiss hyman ii,arguing that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because it was subject to dismissal under north carolina doctrine of abatement.under this doctrine,a defendant may assert,as an affirmative defense requiring dismissal,that a substantially identical,action is pending on appeal.clark craven reg l med.
on february,the north carolina district court granted gastonia motion,holding that this was a classic case for application of the doctrine of abatement under north carolina law.at.on may,we affirmed the district court dismissal in hyman i.at.the district court granted grit leave to file an notice of appeal in hyman ii,and on august,grit filed its notice of appeal.
grit primarily argues that the district court erred in dismissing hyman ii because application of north carolina doctrine of abatement is inconsistent with the district court rule b without prejudice dismissal of hyman i and,under erie tompkins,rule b,not north carolina doctrine of abatement,should apply.
we have an obligation to inquire into jurisdictional issues sua sponte.ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir.therefore,after we heard oral argument in this case,we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether we have the authority to consider hyman appeal in light of west there shall be no reversal in the supreme court or a court of appeals for error in ruling upon matters in abatement which do not involve jurisdiction.
we now conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear hyman appeal because the district court dismissed this case under north carolina doctrine of abatement.although has existed,with slightly different wording,since the judiciary act of,see stephens monongahela nat.bank,there have been few applications of this statute,and we have no relevant precedents interpreting its provisions nevertheless,we conclude that bars our consideration of this appeal because the district court abatement ruling falls within the strictures of as interpreted by the supreme court,and the statute deprives us of appellate jurisdiction to review the district court abatement ruling.
section places restrictions on appellate review of matters in abatement,but the statute does not define that phrase.generally speaking,abatement refers to t he suspension or defeat of a pending action for a reason unrelated to the merits of the claim.black law dictionary ed.at common law,abatement is the equivalent of a dismissal,and it results from the defendant raising some procedural or formality error in the plaintiff action.d abatement,survival,and revival.examples of abatement defenses include a defense of prematurity,that the plaintiff commenced the lawsuit before the underlying cause of action accrued a defense that the plaintiff interest in the pending has terminated or transferred to another party a defense that a lawsuit can not proceed because of the death of either the plaintiff or the defendant and a defense that there is a separate,identical lawsuit pending.d abatement,survival,and revival.because abatement defenses defeat the particular action for procedural defects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff claim,the plaintiff can typically correct the defects and proceed in another action.see bowles wilke,cir noting that an abatement defense defeats the pending action but not the cause of action.
to decide whether applies to this case,however,we need not determine whether matters in abatement include each of the abatement defenses listed above.instead,we can rest solely on the supreme court decisions in piquignot,how,and stephens 
in piquignot,the plaintiff sued the defendant in state court and then,while the state court suit was pending,sued the defendant in federal trial court on the same cause of action.at.the defendant raised as an abatement defense the fact that the state court suit was pending,and the federal court ruled for the defendant.the supreme court concluded that applied to this type of abatement defense and accordingly refused to review the federal court abatement ruling.id.
stephens involved the same abatement defense,that the federal court should not proceed in the case because of a pending state court suit between the same litigants for the same cause of action.at.citing piquignot,the supreme court held that an abatement defense that another action was pending fell within the meaning of and that the court could not review the federal court ruling on that defense.id.the supreme court explained that bars appellate review of a ruling on an abatement defense because t he defense is one which merely defeats the present proceeding,and therefore does not address the merits of the action or prevent the plaintiff from suing in the future.id.
piquignot and stephens set forth the rule that whatever else the phrase matters in abatement means in the context of,it surely encompasses a ruling in which a trial court dismisses a case because there is a separate,identical pending case.this rule covers the exact circumstances here the district court dismissed hyman ii because of grit identical,pending action in hyman because the supreme court has held that such a ruling involves a matter in abatement under,we conclude that the statute applies to our review of the district court abatement ruling see also teixeira goodyear tire rubber,cir holding that applies to a judgment of abatement for another action pending green underwood,cir same charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.by far the most common cases in which has been invoked involve rulings on motions to stay proceedings in deference to an action pending in another court.
grit offers three unpersuasive arguments for why does not apply to this case.first,grit contends that the district court abatement ruling was not a matter in abatement within the meanin
