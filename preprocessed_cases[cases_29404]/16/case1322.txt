in considering cec assertion of personal jurisdiction,we first set forth the applicable law.a federal district court may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation if such jurisdiction is authorized by the statute of the state in which it sits and application of the statute is consistent with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,const.amend.xiv.carefirst,at see also stover,cir.we turn first to state law.
the relevant portion of virginia statute provides,a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person,who acts directly or by an agent,as to a cause of action arising from the person t ransacting any business in this commonwealth.ann.a.the exercise of personal jurisdiction is proper,then,only if the asserted cause of action aris es from the defendant t ransacting business in virginia.a see also desantis hafner creations,chedid boardwalk regency.because virginia statute is intended to extend personal jurisdiction to the extent permissible under the due process clause,the statutory inquiry merges with the constitutional inquiry.young new haven advocate,cir citing stover,at see also english smith metzger,cir peninsula cruise,new river yacht sales.

this court has synthesized the due process requirements for asserting specific personal jurisdiction in a three part test in which we consider the extent to which the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the state whether the plaintiffs claims arise out of those activities directed at the state and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir quotations and citations omitted.
the first prong articulates the minimum contacts requirement of constitutional due process that the defendant purposefully avail himself of the privilege of conducting business under the laws of the forum state.while this requirement is not susceptible of mechanical application,see int l shoe,at.kulko superior court,d,courts have considered various nonexclusive factors in seeking to resolve whether a defendant has engaged in such purposeful availment.in the business context,these factors include,but are not limited to
