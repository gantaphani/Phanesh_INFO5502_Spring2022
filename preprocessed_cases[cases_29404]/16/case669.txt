this case requires us to consider whether a clause in a settlement agreement which bars a patent licensee from later challenging the patent validity is void for public policy reasons under the supreme court decision in lear,adkins,where the parties entered into the agreement after an accusation of infringement by the patent owner but prior to any litigation.we hold that,in these circumstances,such a clause is void under lear.we therefore affirm the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,dismissing the complaint in this action.
background 
according to the first amended complaint complaint rates technology rti is the owner of two patents the patents that cover inventions relating to the automatic routing of telephone calls based upon cost.rti alleges that it is well known in the telecommunications industry for its policy of settling patent infringement claims in accordance with a payment tiered pricing structure based on the size of the accused infringer measured by its annual sales.in or around april,rti became aware that the patents were being infringed by speakeasy,speakeasy,a telecommunications company that provided broadband,voice,and data services to businesses.rti notified speakeasy that it believed speakeasy was infringing the patents and,in accordance with company policy,offered to release speakeasy from liability in exchange for a payment consistent with rti tiered pricing structure.
on april,rti and speakeasy entered into an agreement,which was styled as a covenant not to sue hereinafter,the agreement.the agreement began with a series of recitals,which declared that rti is the holder of the patents rti has alleged that products,services,and technology made,used,sold,offered for sale and imported by speakeasy infringe the patents speakeasy has denied any possible infringement and the parties desire to settle their potential differences on the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.the agreement then provided that rti release d and promise d not to sue speakeasy for any past or future infringement of the patents.in exchange,speakeasy agreed to make a payment of to rti.the agreement further provided that speakeasy acknowledges the validity,and enforceability of the patents.speakeasy does not admit that it has infringed the patents.
the agreement also included a provision barring speakeasy from ever challenging,or assisting others in challenging,the validity of the patents 
speakeasy hereby warrants and represents to rti that on and after the execution date of this covenant speakeasy will not anywhere in the world challenge,or assist any other individual or entity to challenge,the validity of any of the claims of the patents or their respective foreign counterpart patents or their respective foreign counterpart patent applications,except in defense to a patent infringement lawsuit brought under the patents against speakeasy,its products and services,and except as otherwise required by law.
this clause was accompanied by the following liquidated damages provision 
in the event that the above representation is incorrect then speakeasy agrees that it shall pay to rti as liquidated damages the additional amount of twelve million million dollars plus all legal expenses necessary to collect this added amount.
the agreement further defined speakeasy to include both speakeasy and best buy,which had previously announced plans to acquire speakeasy.shortly after the agreement between speakeasy and rti was signed,best buy acquisition of speakeasy closed.
three years later,on june,best buy announced a plan to sell speakeasy and merge it into entities associated with the various covad covad defendants the particular details of the merger,and of the byzantine corporate relationships among the covad defendants,are not relevant to this appeal.what is relevant is that around the time this transaction was announced,rti once again learned of an infringement of the patents.on june,rti notified one of the covad defendants,covad company,that rti believed it was infringing the patents.rti offered to release covad company from any liability for infringement in exchange for a payment in an amount to be determined by rti tiered pricing structure.on july,covad company responded by filing a declaratory judgment action against rti in the united states district court for the northern district of california the california action seeking a declaration that the patents were invalid and unenforceable.
about a month later,on august,rti initiated the present lawsuit.rti complaint,as amended,alleges that during due diligence conducted in anticipation of the proposed merger,another of the covad defendants,covad group,learned of the agreement between rti and speakeasy.it further alleges that speakeasy best buy provided certain information relating to the rti patents to covad group,and that covad group or one of the other parties to the merger provided that same information to covad group subsidiary,covad company.according to rti,covad company used this information in formulating the allegations of the complaint in the california action.
accordingly,rti complaint alleges that speakeasy and best buy breached the agreement clause which included a prohibition on assist ing any challenge to the patents validity by providing information relating to rti patents that helped covad company challenge the validity of the patents in the california action.the complaint also claims that all of the covad defendants are liable for the breach of contract by virtue of the merger.the complaint seeks to hold all of the defendants jointly and severally liable,and to enforce the agreement million liquidated damages clause.
a few months after the present lawsuit was filed,covad company voluntarily dismissed the california action before rti filed an answer.see notice of dismissal at,covad commc ns rates tech,cv,ecf thereafter,the defendants in this case moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.on may,the district court granted the motions.the court relied on the supreme court decision in lear,which held that the doctrine of licensee estoppel under which a licensee of intellectual property effectively recognizes the validity of that property and is estopped from contesting its validity in future disputes,idaho potato comm m m produce farm sales,cir is unenforceable in the context of challenges to the validity of patents,rates tech.speakeasy,cv,wl,at may,citing lear,at.the district court held that the clause in this case,which was entered into prior to the commencement of any litigation,was contrary to the public interest in litigating the validity of patents identified in lear and its progeny.id the court therefore held that the clause was invalid,and that dismissal of the complaint was required.
rti appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.speakeasy moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or to transfer the appeal to this court.on september,the federal circuit determined that it lacked jurisdiction over this case because the district court jurisdiction did not arise in whole or in part under the laws governing the federal circuit appellate jurisdiction and because this contract dispute does not require the resolution of a related question of patent law,such as inventorship,infringement,validity,or unenforceability.rates,speakeasy,app x,citing lab.of am.holdings metabolite.rather than dismiss the appeal,the federal circuit transferred it to this court.id.
discussion 
rti argues that the district court erred in applying the public policy rationale articulated in lear favoring challenges to the validity of patents to invalidate the clause in the agreement.for support,rti invokes a series of circuit court decisions which recognize that the strong public interest in settling ongoing litigation can justify the enforcement of clauses that might otherwise be deemed invalid under lear.as we explain below,those decisions do not render the clause in this case enforceable,because the rti speakeasy agreement was entered into prior to any litigation between the parties.
lear and its progeny 
our analysis must begin with lear,a decision in which the supreme court repudiated the doctrine of licensee estoppel in patent law.as the court noted,licensee estoppel was rooted in contract law,which generally forbids a purchaser to repudiate his promises simply because he later becomes dissatisfied with the bargain he has made.at.federal patent law,by contrast,requires that all ideas in general circulation be dedicated to the common good unless they are protected by a valid patent.id.characterizing earlier judicial efforts to reconcile these radically different concerns as a failure,the court determined that the concerns of contract law were outweighed by those of patent law and therefore abandoned the doctrine of licensee estoppel.id.at overruling automatic radio hazeltine research.
in justifying its holding,the court explained that a typical patent licensor equities are far from compelling.id.at.the grant of a patent simply represents a legal conclusion reached by the patent office a conclusion reached in an ex parte proceeding and based upon factors as to which reasonable men can differ widely.id.accordingly,the court considered it not unfair to require a patentee to defend the patent office judgment when his licensee places the question in issue,especially since the licensor case is buttressed by the presumption of validity which attaches to his patent.see also a patent shall be presumed valid.as the court explained,
the equities of the licensor do not weigh very heavily when they are balanced against the important public interest in permitting full and free competition in the use of ideas which are in reality a part of the public domain.licensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the patentability of an inventor discovery.if they are muzzled,the public may continually be required to pay tribute to monopolists without need or justification.we think it plain that the technical requirements of contract doctrine must give way before the demands of the public interest in the typical situation involving the negotiation of a license after a patent has issued.
in addition,the court held that after the patent was granted the licensee in lear could not be required to comply with the provision in its contract requiring it to pay royalties until the patent was actually held invalid,explaining that 
t he parties contract is no more controlling on this issue than is the state doctrine of estoppel,which is also rooted in contract principles.the decisive question is whether overriding federal policies would be significantly frustrated if licensees could be required to continue to pay royalties during the time they are challenging patent validity in the courts.
it seems to us that such a requirement would be inconsistent with the aims of federal patent policy.enforcing this contractual provision would give the licensor an additional economic incentive to devise every conceivable dilatory tactic in an effort to postpone the day of final judicial reckoning moreover,the cost of prosecuting trial proceedings and defending an inevitable appeal might well deter many licensees from attempting to prove patent invalidity in the courts lastly,enforcing this contractual provision would undermine the strong federal policy favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain.
as we have recognized,lear is notable not only for its particular holdings regarding the doctrine of licensee estoppel and the enforcement of contracts for royalties,but also for establishing a balancing test for weighing the public interest in discovering invalid patents against other competing interests.idaho potato comm n,at.in the decades since lear was decided,lower federal courts have repeatedly been asked to balance the public interest in identifying invalid patents with federal policies favoring the resolution of disputes.in reviewing these decisions,we find it helpful to distinguish several methods by which patent disputes can be resolved.
first,a dispute over patent infringement and invalidity can be litigated to a final decision by a court.such a decision ordinarily triggers the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,which holds that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.monahan city dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.like the federal circuit,we are aware of no court which has even suggested that lear abrogates the application of res judicata principles based on a judgment imposed by the court after full litigation.foster hallco.
second,disputes regarding patent infringement and validity can be and often are resolved through the entry of a consent decree following litigation between the parties.after some initial uncertainty,see kraly distillers chem,cir,we and other courts applying lear have recognized that such decrees estop future challenges to a patent validity,see,wallace clark acheson,cir foster,at am.equip.wikomi,cir schlegel usm,cir.as we explained in wallace clark,
the interests of litigants and the public in general will be best served by according res judicata effect to consent decrees adjudicating a patent infringement as well as its validity.while in some cases this policy may result in the survival of invalid patents,the agreements are arrived at in settlement of adversary litigation with infringement as well as validity determined and with the discovery machinery of the courts available to the parties,and are subject to court scrutiny,in contrast to the purely private license agreements on which estoppel was based.
at see also foster,at distinguishing lear on the ground that it did not consider the policy concerns evoked when preserving the finality of a judgment.
third,a patent dispute can be settled privately after the initiation of litigation,without the imprimatur of a consent decree.in warner jenkinson allied chemical,cir,we held that such a settlement did not estop a patent licensee from later challenging the validity of the patent in a later dispute over royalties.as we noted,
t here is certainly a public interest in the avoidance of litigation through the peaceful resolution of lawsuits.in the patent field,however,this interest is to be balanced against the public interest in having invalid patents cleared away through litigation.if encouragement of such litigation is important enough to justify allowing licensees to sue to invalidate patents,then it makes little sense for us to strain to preserve the termination of such litigation through a settlement.
id.at see also int l telemeter teleprompter,cir noting that enforcement of a settlement agreement providing for payment of damages for past infringement did not estop licensee from challenging the validity of the patent when that claim is properly raised.we suggested,however,that the result in warner jenkinson might have been different if the agreement had contained a clause.at i f a settlement agreement contains an explicit prohibition on licensee suits during some future period a court may feel that effect should be given to such provisions.
aside from our ambivalent dictum in warner jenkinson,we have not addressed how lear should apply to a settlement that resolves pending patent litigation and contains a clause.however,the federal circuit has held that a clause in such a settlement is valid under lear.see flex foot,crp.in flex foot,the federal circuit noted that the license in lear did not contain,and was not accompanied by,any promise by the licensee not to challenge the validity of the patent.id.at.as a result,lear did not implicate the important policy of enforcing settlement agreements and res judicata.id.concluding that the policy interests underlying the settlement of litigation are more strongly favored by the law than the technical requirements of contract doctrine at issue in lear,the federal circuit held that 
o nce an accused infringer has challenged patent validity,has had an opportunity to conduct discovery on validity issues,and has elected to voluntarily dismiss the litigation with prejudice under a settlement agreement containing a clear and unambiguous undertaking not to challenge validity enforceability of the patent in suit,the accused infringer is contractually estopped from raising any such challenge in any subsequent proceeding.
id.at see also hemstreet spiegel,f d,holding that a party must pay royalties under a settlement license agreement even though the patent was held unenforceable in another court because t he enforcement of settlement of litigation involves another public policy totally absent in lear the encouragement of settlement of litigation and the need to enforce such settlements in order to encourage the parties to enter into them.
fourth,and finally,disputes about patent infringement and validity can be resolved by agreement prior to any litigation between the parties.the ninth circuit confronted a case involving such an agreement shortly after lear was decided.see massillon cleveland akron sign golden state adver,cir mca.in that case,mca accused several parties,including golden state advertising golden state,of infringing its patent,and threatened to take legal action against them.id.at.a lawsuit was averted when the parties entered into a written agreement settling the controversy,under which golden state acknowledged the validity of the patent and covenanted to refrain from directly or indirectly contesting or questioning the validity of the patent.id.several years later,mca sued golden state,alleging that it had breached the settlement by again infringing the patent.golden state asserted the patent invalidity as a defense,and mca argued that the settlement barred golden state from challenging the patent validity.id.at.the ninth circuit held that the strong federal policy referred to repeatedly in lear required it to hold that the covenant barring golden state from contesting the validity of mca patent was void on its face and unenforceable.id.at.the ninth circuit found it unimportant that the covenant is part of a settlement agreement rather than of a typical patent licensing agreement,suggesting that if such a distinction were recognized it would be easy to couch licensing arrangements in the form of settlement agreements.id.
ii.applying lear to pre litigation settlement agreements 
as noted above,our task in this case is to balance the policy concerns of patent law articulated in lear against countervailing policy concerns that favor requiring parties to adhere to the terms of agreements resolving their legal disputes.see idaho potato comm n,at lear makes clear that courts should weigh the federal policy embodied in the law of intellectual property against even explicit contractual provisions and render unenforceable those provisions that would undermine the public interest.the situation in this case most resembles the one in the ninth circuit mca decision.according to the complaint,rti became aware that speakeasy was infringing the patents in april,and that same month the parties resolved their incipient dispute by entering into the agreement.neither side filed a lawsuit,and thus speakeasy never had the opportunity to conduct discovery regarding the validity of rti patent.like the settlement agreement in mca,the agreement between speakeasy and rti contains a provision in which speakeasy promised not to contest the validity of the patents a provision that,speakeasy and the other defendants now argue,is invalid under lear 
we find the ninth circuit decision in mca persuasive.as the present case demonstrates,it is common for patent licensing agreements to be entered into after a patent owner makes an initial accusation of infringement.in these circumstances,patent owners eager to avoid future challenges to their possibly invalid claims to a monopoly have a strong incentive to couch licensing arrangements in the form of settlement agreements by including recitals in their agreements declaring that the patent is valid.mca,at.if clauses in agreements were held to be valid and enforceable,lear strong policy favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain could be evaded through the simple expedient of clever draftsmanship.at.the validity and scope of patents are often controversial,and any negotiation for a license agreement has the potential for the licensee to raise questions about the patent validity in order to secure a more favorable price.creating a good faith dispute about patent validity that can be settled by a license including a covenant never to challenge the patent would rarely be an obstacle to parties seeking to evade the strictures of lear.as a result,allowing such whenever a license agreement is cast as a settlement could close the doors of the courts to a large group of parties who ha ve sufficient interest in the patent to challenge its validity,schlegel,at,and thereby render lear prohibition of licensee estoppel a prohibition that the supreme court held was required by strong public policy considerations a dead letter.
moreover,we note that prior to the initiation of litigation,the parties to a patent dispute will not have had an opportunity to conduct discovery that may shed light on the patent validity.see flex foot,at upholding a clause where the parties settled after the alleged infringer had an opportunity to conduct discovery on validity issues and the parties had fully briefed opposing summary judgment motions on the issue of invalidity.the fact that parties have conducted discovery seems to us significant in two respects.first,it suggests that the alleged infringer has had a full opportunity to assess the validity of the patent,and is therefore making an informed decision to abandon her challenge to its validity.second,the fact that parties have conducted discovery is evidence that they had a genuine dispute over the patent validity,and that the patent owner is not seeking to prevent its monopoly from being challenged by characterizing ordinary licensing agreements as settlement agreements.
thus,while we recognize the important policy interests favoring the settlement of litigation may support a different rule with respect to clauses in settlements entered into after the initiation of litigation,see warner jenkinson,at flex foot,at and we are conscious of the great costs that can be associated with patent litigation,we believe that enforcing clauses in settlements would significantly undermine the public interest in discovering invalid patents,idaho potato comm n,at.we therefore hold that covenants barring future challenges to a patent validity entered into prior to litigation are unenforceable,regardless of whether the agreements containing such covenants are styled as settlement agreements or simply as license agreements.
we find rti various arguments urging us to find the clause in the agreement enforceable unpersuasive.first,it is true,as rti observes,that we and other courts have recognized a strong judicial policy favoring the settlement of litigation,including patent litigation.see in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust,cir noting our longstanding adherence to the principle that courts are bound to encourage the settlement of litigation internal quotation marks omitted foster,at t he federal circuit has repeatedly expressed the view that there is a strong public interest in settlement of patent litigation.asahi glass pentech,d,posner,sitting by designation the general policy of the law is to favor the settlement of litigation,and the policy extends to the settlement of patent infringement suits.
as noted above,however,the present case involves a settlement.while such agreements are ordinarily enforceable,and indeed desirable,see mckenzie,maynard,cir noting that a prompt and efficient attorney who achieves a fair settlement without litigation serves both his client and the interests of justice,we believe that in the patent context enforcing clauses in settlements would too easily enable patent owners to muzzle licensees the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the patent validity,lear,at.as the ninth circuit correctly noted in mca,recognizing a distinction between settlements
