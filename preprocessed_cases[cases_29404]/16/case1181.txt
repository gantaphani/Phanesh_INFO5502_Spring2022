this litigation has its genesis in an optimistic gambling junket to atlantic city and a return flight that ended tragically in death.the flight was part of a shuttle operated by executive airlines ea on behalf of caesars casino caesars.elaine pilosi,a passenger on the junket,lost her life when the ea airplane in which she was traveling crashed.pilosi left two sons who were the beneficiaries of an accidental death insurance policy that she had purchased from the defendant,penney life insurance company penney life or the insurer.the policy had three categories of losses,two of which are pertinent in this litigation.part i provided benefits of million for accidental death in a public conveyance operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service.part ii provided for payment of for accidental death in a private passenger automobile.and part iii provided for the payment of for all other injuries.
penney life paid under part iii of the policy and rejected the claim of the pilosi brothers pilosis or insured for million under part i.the insurer sued for a declaratory judgment pursuant to in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania seeking a determination that the pilosis were not entitled to the million benefit.the pilosis responded and also raised affirmative defenses asserting,inter alia,that penney life claim is barred by the doctrine of waiver estoppel,by its own bad faith,and by the doctrine of frustration of the purpose of the contract.in addition,the pilosis counterclaimed for breach of contract and bad faith denial of their claim under.the district court,in a carefully considered opinion of a difficult case,entered summary judgment for the pilosis in the sum of million but rejected their claim under pennsylvania law for bad faith damages.the pilosis timely appealed the entry of summary judgment in favor of penney life on the bad faith claim,and penney life the entry of summary judgment awarding million coverage.we affirm in part and reverse the summary judgment against penney life.

where federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship,as it is here,we apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the district court sat.paul fire marine ins.lewis,cir citing klaxon stentor.this action was instituted in the middle district of pennsylvania.under pennsylvania choice of law rules,an insurance contract is governed by the law of the state in which the contract was made.crawford manhattan life ins,mcmillan,at.an insurance contract is made in the state in which the last act legally necessary to bring the contract into force takes place.crawford,at.in most cases,this last act is delivery of the policy to the insured and the payment of the first premium by him.ruhlin life ins,cir.
in the instant case the policy makes no mention of insurance coverage being contingent upon delivery of the policy.however,the policy provided that coverage will become effective on the certificate effective date shown on the schedule page provided that penney life receive s the initial premium within days of the certificate effective date and while you are alive.the certificate effective date was two days after pilosi orally accepted penney life telephone solicitation offering three months of coverage at no cost and no obligation to continue.payment of the first three monthly premiums was made by pilosi credit card company as part of a promotion that it offered in conjunction with penney life.because the first three premium payments were automatically triggered upon pilosi oral acceptance,the last act legally necessary to bring the contract into force was pilosi telephonic acceptance of the policy.this occurred at her residence in pennsylvania.therefore,pennsylvania law governs construction of the terms of the insurance policy.
public conveyance 
the threshold issue is whether the ea airplane in which pilosi died qualifies as a public conveyance.counsel for the pilosis strenuously argue that,much like a taxicab,the airplane was a public conveyance.although caesars controlled who was allowed to board this particular flight,the pilosis assert that the airplane was available for any member of the public to charter before and after the caesars flight.on the other hand,the insurer contends that the airplane was not a public conveyance because members of the public were not free to purchase tickets for the flight.
unfortunately,the policy does not define public conveyance.however,the record reveals that the carrier was,indeed,a public conveyance.the airplane in which pilosi was traveling was owned and operated by an air carrier licensed by the federal aviation administration to conduct common carriage.the airplane belonged to a company that was engaged in the business of hiring out airplanes for general public use.
more importantly,ea made its services available to the general public.according to the deposition of ea ceo,michael peragine,ea was open to anyone who had money who wanted to fly.thus,ea could be hired by anyone with the ability to pay,either before or after the caesars flight.analogous to a public taxicab,which the pennsylvania supreme court has held to be a public conveyance,primrose cas,t he use of no one of ea machines was limited to any particular person,but anyone able to pay the price and privilege of riding in it could do so.id.at.
penney life challenges the taxicab analogy.it disputes the pilosis reliance on the holding in terminal taxicab,kutz.the issue in terminal taxicab was whether a taxicab company that offered its services to hotel guests pursuant to a contract with the hotel still retained its public character.the court held that the taxicab company retained its public character even though it served primarily hotel guests.the court noted that n o carrier serves all the public.his customers are limited by place,requirements,ability to pay and other facts id.
penney life efforts to distinguish terminal taxicab are unpersuasive.penney life distinguishes the terminal taxicab taxi from the ea airplane on the ground that anyone could access the taxis stationed in front of the hotel,while the airplane was restricted to caesars passengers.penney life insistence that a vehicle must be available for passengers in order to qualify as a public conveyance misses the point.
as both the terminal taxicab and primrose courts articulate,passenger limitations imposed by any particular customer with regard to any particular taxi,designating the passengers,the destination,and the schedule of the not negate the public character of the conveyance.terminal taxicab,at.primrose,at see also brill indianapolis life ins,cir holding that hiring a helicopter on a particular occasion limited the helicopter operation however these limitations as to time,place and passengers were no different than those imposed on the taxi service discussed in terminal taxicab.for purposes of the one flight,the decedent and his employer had the exclusive use of the helicopter as to contents,direction and time of use.their control was not so pervasive,however,as to negate the public character of the helicopter service.
penney life claims that the proper test to determine whether a conveyance is public or private is the extent to which the public has access to the conveyance.under penney life test,however,the plane qualifies as public because it can be accessed by any member of the public who has the financial means to rent it.penney life is insensible to the public nature of the air taxi because general members of the public may not board the flight on those occasions when caesars charters the plane.but being temporarily restricted to a paying client does not transform a public conveyance into a private carrier.when a patron enters a public taxicab,the cab is effectively private for the duration of the fare.however,once the fare is completed,anyone may hire the taxi.the same goes for an air taxi,such as ea.when the plane is engaged by a person,that person is the very public to which the plane is available.
the final indicator that ea plane was a public conveyance is that caesars did not use exclusively the particular aircraft employed for the fateful november echo juliet.penney life assertion that the flight was private rather than public would be more persuasive if,instead of being available for public hire,the ea jet was reserved exclusively for caesars however,other members of the public in addition to caesars could use the echo juliet plane when not otherwise committed.caesars merely procured ea services on a regular basis.we are therefore convinced that the plane was a public,rather than private,conveyance.however,this conclusion does not resolve the issue,for we must examine other pertinent terms of the policy contract.
interpretation of the policy language 
we turn to the proper interpretation of the clause operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service.a reasoned analysis reveals that regular passenger service modifies the adjective licensed,so that coverage extends narrowly to those common carriers specifically licensed to conduct regular passenger service.
pennsylvania law on the interpretation of insurance contracts 
pennsylvania law,under which this insurance policy must be interpreted,provides several principles governing the interpretation of insurance policies.as a threshold matter,t he task of interpreting a contract is generally performed by a court,rather than by a jury.the goal of that task is,of course,to ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written instrument.standard venetian blind am.empire ins,citations omitted.where an insurance policy provision is ambiguous,it is to be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured mcmillan,at state farm fire cas.macdonald.an ambiguity exists when the questionable term or language,viewed in the context of the entire policy,is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.med.protective,at citing reliance ins.moessner,cir,in turn citing gamble farm inn,selective ins,quoting hutchison sunbeam coal.
where,however,the language of an insurance contract is clear and unambiguous,a court is required to enforce that language.med.protective,at citing standard venetian blind,at.that is,a court must refrain from torturing the language of a policy to create ambiguities where none exist.mcmillan,at macdonald,at.in addition,wherever possible,a court should interpret the policy so as to avoid ambiguities and give effect to all of its provisions.little mgic indemnity,cir.the policy must be construed as a whole,not in discrete units.giancristoforo mission gas oil products,citing luko lloyd london.thus,w here the policy contains definitions for the words contained therein,the court will apply those definitions in interpreting the policy.monti rockwood ins,citing adelman state farm mut.auto.ins.
in the instant case,the policy requires that the insured must have been traveling in a public conveyance operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service by air.the parties dispute which word the clause for regular passenger service modifies.the pilosis argue that the phrase for regular passenger service modifies operated,meaning that the common carrier must be duly licensed and must be operated for regular passenger service.on the other hand,penney life argues that the disputed clause modifies licensed,so a carrier is not covered unless its license specifically authorizes regular passenger service.although the meaning of the clause is disputed,a contract is not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not agree upon the proper construction.macdonald,at.when the disputed language is read in context with the policy definitions,only one interpretation is reasonable.
as stated above,the insurance policy requires that the conveyance be operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service by air.the policy,in turn,defines common carrier to mean an air conveyance operated under a license for regularly scheduled passenger service.read in context,therefore,the phrase requires the airline to possess a license for regularly scheduled passenger service to qualify as a common carrier for regular passenger service.there is no reasonable alternative interpretation.the explicit definition of common carrier is adequate to put the pilosis on notice that there would be no coverage unless the carrier was licensed for regular passenger service.peerless dyeing,indus.risk insurers,when a word or phrase is specifically defined within the policy,that definition controls in determining the applicability of the policy.
the pilosis believe the policy language is ambiguous.they therefore urge application of the rule of insurance construction that interprets policy clauses providing coverage in a manner which affords the greatest possible protection to the insured.see geisler motorists mut.ins.although this rule does,indeed,represent the law in this area,application is warranted only where the language is,in fact,ambiguous.the canon does not apply where,as here,the language of the policy,viewed in context,is clear.treasure craft jewelers,jefferson ins.of,r ule of strict construction against the insurance company has no application where the language is clear and unambiguous.citing sidebothom metro.life ins.the plain meaning of the phrase operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service,when viewed in conjunction with the definition of common carrier,is that coverage extends only to those carriers that are licensed for regular passenger service.see loomer flying,where the terms of the insurance contract are not ambiguous the court must read the policy in its entirety and give the words therein their plain and proper meanings.
the interpretation suggested by the pilosis fails to accord proper significance to the written contract,historically the true test of parties intentions.standard venetian blind,at.to interpret the phrase as extending coverage beyond those airlines licensed specifically for regular passenger service renders the policy definition of common carrier useless.pennsylvania courts have held that n o provision within a contract is to be treated as surplusage or redundant if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts can be given to it.sparler fireman ins.of newark,see quigley life ins,courts have no right to add anything to the insurance contract or to give it a construction that renders any part of it useless and unnecessary,if it can be reasonably construed just as written and without any change,addition or elimination.because penney life policy language can be reasonable construed as written,no portion of its language should be ignored.
this is not a case where the insurance policy as a whole fails to provide the court with any additional tools to tease out the disputed phrase alleged plain meaning.see mcmillan,at construing an ambiguous,undefined provision of an insurance policy against the insurer because n either the context of the rest of the policy nor any other evidence extrinsic to the phrase itself renders the meaning of the disputed phrase more conspicuous.rather,the definition of common carrier provides ample clarification of any ambiguity that may result from the distal placement of the modifier for regular passenger service.because the meaning of the disputed phrase is clear,this court need not determine whether any reasonable person upon reading it could decide that it encompassed airlines operated for regular passenger service.
to be sure,the burden of drafting with precision rests with the insurance company,the author of the policy.mcmillan,at.however,where,as here,the scrivener has adopted precise language to accomplish its purpose of limiting coverage to those carriers licensed for regular passenger service,that intent must control.accordingly,it was erroneous to have found the language of part i of the policy ambiguous.
rules of statutory interpretation 
in addition to the plain language of the policy,rules of statutory interpretation demonstrate that the plane must be licensed for regularly scheduled passenger service.a general rule of statutory construction,the doctrine of last antecedent,teaches that qualifying words,phrases,and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding,and are not to be construed as extending to and including others more remote.resolution trust nernberg,cir see united states hodge,cir commonwealth of,dep t of pub.welfare united states dep t of health human,cir.this rule suggests that the clause for regular passenger service modifies the antecedent adjective licensed,rather than the verb operated,which is located distally in the middle of the sentence.see also norman singer,sutherland statutory construction ed.referential and qualifying words and phrases,where no contrary intention appears,refer solely to the last antecedent.
to be sure,this rule of the last antecedent is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning barnhart thomas,d applying the rule of last antecedent to statutes.however,in this case other indicia point overwhelmingly towards the conclusion that the clause modifies the word licensed.even if we were to ignore the contrary meaning provided by the definition of common carrier,construing the phrase as the pilosis urge would contort the language beyond its limits because such an interpretation would require a reorganization of the clause.the rewritten phrase would read operated by a duly licensed common carrier and operated for regular passenger service.by contrast,interpreting the phrase to mean that the airlines must be licensed for regular passenger service requires no such reorganization.by rewriting the policy to read that ea was a duly licensed carrier and operated for regular passenger service,the district court created an ambiguity where one does not exist.see fosse allianz life ins.of,wl,at,an ambiguity does not arise simply because an alternative interpretation of a word can be created through reasoning that renders common words meaningless.
in light of the plain language of the policy and the contextual clarity provided by the definition of common carrier,coupled with the absence of any reasonable alternative interpretation of the coverage language,the policy is unambiguous in requiring that the flight be licensed for regular passenger service.
regular passenger service 
both the plain meaning of the policy language and rules of statutory interpretation reveal that insurance coverage extends narrowly to those common carriers specifically licensed to conduct regularly scheduled passenger service.furthermore,ea license includes a significant provision that t he certificate holder is not authorized and shall not c onduct scheduled operations at authorized airports.but even assuming that coverage did extend to all licensed common carriers operating regularly scheduled passenger service,the pilosis can not overcome the reality that ea was not conducting regularly scheduled passenger service within the meaning of the policy and under the terms of its license.
the ea shuttle flew patrons from scranton,pennsylvania to atlantic city,new jersey on alternating saturdays at,and returned the following morning at although the flight was part of a regular pattern of flights engaged by the casino,ea did not dictate the schedule rather,its client,caesars,did.ea was operating a service for a client who hired the flight for its convenience on alternate saturdays.there is a distinction between an airline that accommodates a client who regularly engages a flight once every two weeks and an airline that conducts regularly scheduled passenger service.we hold that when the time and destination of the service is dictated by the convenience or business of the charterer and the airline license specifically prohibits regularly scheduled service at authorized airports,the service does not qualify as regular passenger service under the terms of the policy.merely chartering a plane on a regular basis does not transform an airline operating into a regularly scheduled service provider.see fosse,wl,at holding that where an air taxi service operated upon demand,it did not operate its flights pursuant to a set schedule.
as mentioned previously,ea provided air taxi service.ea was licensed as a charter operation providing taxi services under emphasis added.in addition,ea faa air carrier operating certificate designated the airlines as an air taxi.moreover,the preliminary accident report filed by the national transportation safety board described the aircraft as an charter flying a flight.finally,the airline operations specifications not only provided that ea is not authorized and shall not c onduct scheduled operations at authorized airports,but defined a scheduled operation by an air carrier as one for which the certificate holder or its representative offers in advance the departure location,departure time,and arrival location.the facts of this case demonstrate that ea does not meet the definition of regular passenger service.
to summarize,part i of the policy provided benefits of million for accidental death in a public conveyance operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service.the ea flight was,indeed,a public conveyance,but was not operated by a duly licensed common carrier for regular passenger service as required by the plain language of the policy.because all of the elements of part i are not satisfied,it was error as a matter of law to grant summary judgment in favor of the pilosis on the issue of coverage.
under pennsylvania law,a plaintiff can only recover for bad faith of an insurer under.if he or she shows,by clear and convincing evidence,that the insurer did not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy and knew or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.realty,ins,cir citing keefe prudential prop.cas.ins,cir.although the term bad faith is not defined by the pennsylvania bad faith statute,pennsylvania courts have interpreted it as any frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay proceeds of a policy.terletsky prudential prop.cas.ins,quoting black law dictionary ed.the clear and convincing standard requires that the plaintiff show that the evidence is so clear,direct,weighty and convincing as to enable a clear conviction,without hesitation,about whether or not the defendants acted in bad faith.bostick itt hartford group,d.thus,the plaintiff burden in opposing a summary judgment motion is commensurately high in light of the substantive evidentiary burden at trial.kosierowski allstate ins,d.
given that ea was not licensed for regular passenger service,penney life had a reasonable basis for denying the pilosis claim under part i of its policy.a reasonable basis is all that is required to defeat a claim of bad faith.horowitz fed.kemper life assurance,cir.
admittedly,some of penney life conduct may have created an appearance of bad faith.although penney life marketing material claimed that coverage applied broadly to any form of public transportation and any type of common carrier,company officials testified under oath that these statements were false,probably false,or not necessarily totally true,and that,in reality,the company applies a much narrower definition of common carrier in deciding claims.
penney life also appears to have taken inconsistent positions on whether the individual requirements of the policy were satisfied.for instance,penney life continued to argue that the ea flight was not a public conveyance despite the testimony of its employee that the plane met the definition of public conveyance.in addition,penney life argued in an unrelated case that a helicopter must be certified under in order to be a duly licensed common carrier.but in the instant case,penney life took the position that ea did not qualify as a common carrier in spite of its certification under.
however,even considering penney life apparent inconsistencies,there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that it was unreasonable for penney life to deny the pilosis claim.because the policy precludes coverage,it was reasonable for penney life to challenge the pilosis part i claim.as stated previously,a reasonable basis defeats a claim of bad faith.horowitz,at.see hyde athletic,cont l cas,although an insurance company has a duty to accord the interests of its insured the same consideration it gives its own interests,an insurer is not bound to submerge its own interest in order that the insured interests may be made paramount,and an insurer does not act in bad faith by investigating and litigating legitimate issues of coverage.quoting cowden aetna cas.sur.accordingly,we see no error in the district court conclusion that penney life is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith claim 
the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the pilosis on the amount of coverage is reversed because the part i policy requirements were not satisfied.for the same reason,we affirm the district court denial of the pilosis bad faith claim.each side to bear its own costs.
i agree that we must reverse the order granting summary judgment in favor of the insureds because they are not entitled to coverage under part i of the insurance policy.i therefore join parts and of the majority opinion.i also agree that the insureds have not made out their bad faith claim under,and i therefore agree that we must affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of penney life on the insureds bad faith claim.however,i write separately because i do not agree that the plane that crashed qualifies as a public conveyance,under the terms of the insurance policy.accordingly,i can not agree with the analysis in part of the majority opinion.
according to penney life,caesars casino controlled who could board charter flights like the one at issue here.no one could make a reservation for those flights.rather,caesars pennsylvania marketing representative was responsible for the required coordination and arrangements.in order to travel on one of these charter flights,a person had to meet caesars definition of a qualified player for its gambling business,or be a guest of someone caesars deemed a qualified player.although it was not favored,caesars would also allow passengers who,in caesars estimation,had the potential to qualify as a qualified player or someone who was a guest of a qualified player.however,even some of caesars regular customers might not qualify to travel on these charters.penney life says that caesars used the flight for its own interests to increase its gambling business.
according to penney life,no passenger ever paid a fare for any of these flights,and caesars never sold any seats or packages in connection with the flights.obviously,the flights were never advertised.rather,the flights were exclusively a complimentary perquisite that caesars created and controlled,and doled out to those it defined as high rollers based upon its own customer ratings.given these restrictions,and the near total exclusion of the public,the executive airlines ea flight at issue here simply can not qualify as a public conveyance.
the majority conclusion that ea flight does qualify as a public conveyance for purposes of pilosi insurance policy rests in large part upon terminal taxicab,kutz.although the analysis in terminal taxicab is similar to the inquiry required of us here,i believe that it is of less value than at first appears.moreover,to the extent that the discussion in terminal taxicab does assist our inquiry,i believe that the court holding there counsels that the charter flight at issue here was not a public conveyance within the meaning of penney life insurance policy.
before discussing terminal taxicab,i think it important to note that the issue there was not whether a given cab was a public conveyance.rather,the issue was whether the taxicab company was subject to the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission of the district of columbia.at.identifying the issue as whether the plaintiff is a common carrier under the definition in the act.in order to resolve that inquiry,the court first noted that the cab company basically conducted three different kinds of business.
percent of the company business involved the cab company exclusive right to solicit taxi cab business from all persons passing to or from trains in the union station.id.at.insofar as that portion of the cab company business was concerned,the court assumed that a person taking a taxicab at the station would control the whole vehicle both as to contents,direction,and term of use,although not,so far as indicated,in such a sense as to make the driver of the machine his servant.id.the court reasoned that this portion of the taxicab company business was an agency for public use for the conveyance of persons and nonetheless that it only conveys one group of customers in one vehicle.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the next item of plaintiff business consisted of contracts with hotels by which the cab company agrees to furnish enough taxicabs within certain hours reasonably to meet the needs of the hotel,receiving the exclusive right to solicit in and about the hotel but limiting its service to guests of the hotel.id.at.this arrangement with hotels constituted approximately percent of the company business.although the public access was limited by the terms of the company exclusive arrangement with the hotel,that limitation did not remove the public character of the cab company service because n o carrier serves all the public.his customers are limited by place,requirements,ability to pay and other acts.id.at.the court stressed that the public is generally free to go to hotels if it can afford to,and through the hotel door to call on the plaintiff for a taxicab.id.significantly for our purposes,the court was reluctant to conclude that either its contract or its public duty allowed it arbitrarily to refuse to carry a guest upon demand.id.the court went further and stated w e can only assume that in its own interest it does not attempt to do so.id.moreover,the court added that,despite limitations arising from the exclusive nature of the company contract with hotels,t he service affects so considerable a fraction of the public that it is public in the same sense in which any other may be called so.id.
here,of course,ea not only arbitrarily refuse s to carry a guest upon demand,it refuses to carry anyone upon demand.that decision is the exclusive province of caesars.furthermore,it can hardly be said that the charter service provided to caesars affects so considerable a fraction of the public that it is public in the same sense in which any other may be called so.
this distinction is evident from the court analysis of the third part of terminal taxicab business.as to the two parts i have mentioned thus far,the court concluded that the cab company was a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the district of columbia public utilities commission.
the court reached a contrary conclusion as to the remaining portion of the company business.that percent of the company business consists mainly in furnishing automobiles from its central garage on orders,generally by telephone.id.the court noted that the cab company asserts the right to refuse the service,and no doubt would do so if the pay was uncertain,but it advertises extensively,
