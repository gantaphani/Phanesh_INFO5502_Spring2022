this appeal arises out of an allegation by appellant philip decohen that he paid for something that he did not receive.the question presented is whether the maryland law that protected his expectation is enforceable.
decohen bought a used chrysler pacifica and financed it with a loan from a maryland car dealer,nation auto of marlow heights nation auto.the amount financed included a charge for a debt cancellation agreement.under the maryland credit grantor closed end provisions clec,com.law et,such an agreement requires a lender to cancel the remaining loan balance when a car is totaled and the insurance payout does not cover the entire outstanding balance.but that did not happen here.decohen car was totaled,but nation auto had assigned his loan to appellee capital one,capital one,and capital one argues that it does not have to cancel the remaining loan balance because the national bank act nba and federal regulations preempt maryland clec law.decohen filed this putative class action,asserting claims for,inter alia,breach of contract and violation of the clec.
the district court was persuaded that the nba and federal regulations preempt the clec,and that decohen failed to state a claim for breach of contract it therefore granted capital one motion to dismiss.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court erred.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
decohen purchased a used chrysler pacifica from nation auto in temple hills,maryland,on september,for,financing the purchase with a retail installment sale contract ric.the ric lists decohen as the buyer and nation auto as the creditor seller.the total price of the vehicle included a charge for an optional debt cancellation agreement.the applicable law section of the contract stated 
federal law and maryland law apply to this contract.this contract shall be subject to the credit grantor closed end credit provisions subtitle of title of the commercial law article of the maryland code.
the contract also contained a holder notice that stated 
any holder of this consumer credit contract is subject to all claims and defenses which the debtor could assert against the seller of goods or services obtained pursuant hereto or with the proceeds hereof.recovery hereunder by the debtor shall not exceed amounts paid by the debtor hereunder.

under maryland clec law,the only valid debt cancellation agreement that can be financed as part of the purchase of a vehicle is one that pays off the entire remaining loan balance in the event of a total loss,com.law h,c.the law defines a debt cancellation agreement as an agreement between a credit grantor and a borrower which provides for cancellation of the remaining loan balance in the event of theft or total destruction of the collateral for the loan minus the proceeds of any insurance maintained on the collateral for the loan id.h.
the debt cancellation agreement that was part of decohen contract did not comply with maryland law.the agreement stated that the agrees to cancel a portion of the customer indebtedness in the event of a total loss of the vehicle.emphasis added.the agreement states that portion will be calculated as the unpaid net balance less the actual cash value of the vehicle.id.the agreement goes on to define unpaid net balance and actual cash value such that the customer remaining loan balance may not be entirely cancelled.the agreement defines the unpaid net balance as the purchase price of the vehicle the amount financed,divided by the total number of payments,and then multiplied by the number of payments remaining after the loss of the vehicle.this formula,however,omits interest payments.decohen amount financed,according to his ric,was the purchase price.his total number of payments was.divide by,and the resulting monthly payment is.decohen ric,however,specified that the monthly payment on the loan would be,which includes interest with the principal.
a second provision of the debt cancellation agreement also was at odds with the clec.the agreement defines the actual cash value of the vehicle as the amount paid by the insurance company,or the kelley blue book retail value of the car,or the national automobile dealer association nada used car guide retail value whichever is greater.the clec,however,requires a debt cancellation agreement to cancel the remaining loan balance minus the proceeds of any insurance maintained,com.law h.the law does not allow for the use of retail car guides in the calculation.see id.
decohen suffered a total loss of the pacifica in.his insurance company paid a total of.but decohen owed another on the vehicle.under maryland law,as described above,the holder of the note on the vehicle would have been compelled to cancel the remaining balance.consequently,decohen submitted a claim to the servicer of the debt cancellation agreement,beacon industries worldwide,of fort lauderdale,florida.beacon calculated the unpaid net balance to be beacon then calculated the actual cash value of the car by looking to the nada used car guide,which set the car value at.as the value was greater than the balance,beacon denied the claim.as a result of the claim denial,capital one demanded payment of the remaining loan balance.
on september,decohen filed suit in the circuit court for baltimore city against capital one,beacon industries,and abbasi llc nation auto is a registered trade name of abbasi llc,and nation auto apparently has gone out of business.the lawsuit alleged violations of the clec,the maryland consumer protection act mcpa,and the maryland retail installment sales act risa,as well as claims for breach of contract,declaratory relief,and restitution and unjust enrichment.defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the district of maryland under the class action fairness act cafa,and d 
the district court dismissed all claims against capital one and beacon.decohen abbassi,llc,no.wdq,wl,at.july.because decohen appeals only the dismissal of the clec and breach of contract claims against capital one,we limit our review to those claims.first,the court found that the debt cancellation,or guaranteed asset protection gap,agreement attached to decohen financing contract was not permissible under maryland law.specifically,the court stated decohen complaint is sufficient to show that the gap agreement is not a debt cancellation agreement within the meaning of the clec,and therefore may not be financed in connection with closed end credit offered and extended under the statute.id.at quoting,com.law b.thus,the court reasoned,the clec claim will not be dismissed on the basis that decohen allegations fail to state a basis for relief under maryland law.id.
the district court,however,found the clec claim was preempted by the nba.id.at.the court first noted that national banks are controlled by the nba and regulations promulgated thereunder by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ.id.at.under occ regulations,national banks have authority to enter into debt cancellation contracts in connection with extensions of credit.id.at quoting a.the court then noted that under the nba,a debt cancellation contract is defined as a loan term of contractual arrangement under which a bank agrees to cancel all or part of a customer obligations to repay an extension of credit from that bank upon the occurrence of specified events.id.quoting f.thus,the court concluded,the gap agreement in the instant case was a debt cancellation contract for nba purposes.id.because such contracts are governed by federal law and regulations,the court held,state regulation of such contracts is preempted.id.
finally,the district court reasoned that the fact that capital one did not originate the loan,but rather was assigned it,does not change the preemption analysis.id.to support this legal conclusion,the court cited aguayo bank,d,which held that because loans purchased by national banks are subject to the same regulation as loans originated by the bank,it follows that assigned retail installment contracts are subject to the same preemption analysis as direct loans.however,since the district court adopted that view in the instant case,the ninth circuit has reversed aguayo,see aguayo bank,cir,finding that state laws relating to contracts and rights to collect debts are not preempted by the nba because they are covered by an occ savings clause,e 
the district court also found that decohen failed to state a claim for breach of contract,decohen,wl,at,reasoning that nothing in the complaint,credit contract,or gap agreement shows that capital one agreed,or was otherwise required,to cancel decohen remaining loan balance.id.the court further stated that no provision in the clec mandates that creditors cancel a remaining loan balance in the event of a total loss.id.the court thus dismissed the breach of contract claim.

decohen argues that the district court erred in finding that federal law preempts the clec and in dismissing his breach of contract claim.we first consider decohen clec claim.
the constitution supremacy clause states that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.in mcculloch maryland,the supreme court held federal law supreme over state law with respect to national banking.in congress enacted the national bank act and established the system of national banking still in place today.see watters wachovia bank.the act vested in nationally chartered banks enumerated powers and all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.seventh.to prevent inconsistent state regulation from impairing the national system,congress provided no national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by federal law.a.
the supreme court,in interpreting the nba,has repeatedly made clear that federal control shields national banking from unduly burdensome and duplicative state regulation.watters,at.despite the broad scope of the nba,however,national banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or the general purposes of the nba.id.states are permitted to regulate the activities of national banks where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank or the national bank regulator exercise of its powers.id.at.but when state regulations significantly impair a national bank authority under the nba its ability to engage in the business of banking the state regulations must give way.id.at.
the doctrine of federal preemption,which regulates the interplay between federal and state laws when they conflict or appear to conflict,tilts in favor of the federal government in the arena of national banking.the grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks are not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.barnett bank of marion county,nelson.our precedent is clear that the presumption against preemption,which governs fields traditionally regulated by the states,does not apply to the nba.see.city bank of turnbaugh,cir holding the presumption against preemption does not apply to state regulation of federally chartered banks epps,at same.we have specifically declined to apply the presumption to maryland clec because the state law regulates an area with authorized federal presence.epps,at.
following the supreme court lead,we have acknowledged three types of federal preemption express preemption,in which congress expressly states its intent to preempt state law,cox shalala,cir field preemption,in which congress occupies a certain field by regulating so pervasively that there is no room left for the states to supplement federal law,id.citing fid.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,and conflict preemption,arising when state law is preempted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law,id.citing pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm.in the instant case,the district court found that the nba and the relevant regulations both expressly preempt and field preempt state regulations of debt cancellation contracts.we disagree.
in examining both express and field preemption under the nba,we must consider the guidance of the occ and its regulations.congress has authorized the occ to promulgate regulations implementing the nba.see.those regulations contain both an express preemption provision and a savings clause.the express preemption provision states 
except where made applicable by federal law,state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized estate lending powers are not applicable to national banks.
a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning 
iv the terms of credit,including the schedule for repayment of principal and interest,amortization of loans,balance,payments due,minimum payments,or term to maturity of the loan,including the circumstances under which a loan may be called due and payable upon the passage of time or a specified event external to the loan.
d.following the preemption provision is the savings clause 
state laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the estate lending powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent that they only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks estate lending powers 
rights to collect debts 
acquisition and transfer of property.
e the savings clause.
the occ has also promulgated regulations concerning debt cancellation contracts dccs entered into by national banks.the occ regulations appl y to debt cancellation contracts and debt suspension agreements entered into by national banks in connection with extensions of credit they make and are governed by applicable federal law and regulations,and not by state law.c.the regulations define a debt cancellation agreement as one under which a bank agrees to cancel all or part of a customer obligation to repay an extension of credit from that bank upon the occurrence of a specified event.f emphasis added.the regulations also state that national banks are authorized to enter into debt cancellation contracts and debt suspension agreements and charge a fee therefor a.further,the occ has stated that national banks are authorized to enter into dcc with respect to loans they purchase as well as loans they originate directly.occ interpretive letter,wl.capital one relies heavily on the fact that the occ has stated that retail installment contracts purchased by banks are treated the same as loans originated by banks for regulatory and reporting purposes.id.therefore,the occ stated,the purchase of a ric constitutes an extension of credit on which a national bank may offer a dcc id.
having carefully considered the matter in light of the plain language and purpose of the regulatory regime and our precedent,we conclude,first,that the clec provisions regarding debt cancellation agreements are not expressly preempted by federal law when the agreements are part of credit contracts originated by a local lender and assigned to a national bank.the occ regulations explicitly concern debt cancellation agreements entered into by national banks.see c this part applies to debt cancellation contracts and debt suspension agreements entered into by national banks in connection with extensions of credit they make.undoubtedly,if capital one had directly loaned decohen the money to purchase his vehicle,and that loan included a debt cancellation agreement,it would be governed by federal regulations.that is not the case before us.here,capital one did not loan decohen the money to purchase his vehicle nation auto did,and then nation aut
