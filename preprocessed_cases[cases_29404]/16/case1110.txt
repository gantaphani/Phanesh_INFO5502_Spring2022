opinion of the court 
the pennsylvania employees benefit trust fund,joseph macken,and linda watters plaintiffs sued zeneca,and astrazeneca pharmaceuticals,collectively referred to as zeneca in the united states district court for the district of delaware,asserting that zeneca engaged in deceptive conduct in the advertising of its new drug nexium.claim one alleged unlawful advertising under the delaware consumer fraud act dcfa.the second claim alleged violations of the consumer protection statutes of the states for false,misleading,and deceptive advertising.claim three alleged unjust enrichment,and stated claims under delaware common law for restitution,disgorgement,and constructive trust.the fourth claim was for negligent misrepresentation,and it alleged that the company released misleading advertisements for the prescription drug nexium.the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
this appeal presents two principal questions whether the dcfa exemption for advertising regulated by the federal trade commission applies to the facts of this case and whether federal law preempts the plaintiffs state consumer protection claims.the plaintiffs also assert that primary jurisdiction was an improper basis for dismissal,that their unjust enrichment claim was improperly dismissed on the ground that they had not pled individual reliance,and that they should have been allowed to amend their complaint.we will affirm the judgment of the district court 
on february,the plaintiffs filed a putative class action against zeneca,alleging that zeneca marketing campaign for nexium was deceptive because it misleadingly advertised nexium as an improvement on prilosec.nexium and prilosec are both inhibitors,drugs that treat gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd and erosive esophagitis,conditions that are commonly known as acid reflux disease and frequent heartburn.prilosec was a profitable drug for zeneca,and had sales of billion in.the patent for prilosec was due to expire in,at which point it would be available for sale as the generic drug omeprazole.on february,zeneca obtained approval from the food and drug administration fda for final labeling on nexium for healing of erosive esophagitis,maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis,and treatment of symptomatic gerd,heartburn.
one published clinical study of nexium compared both mg and mg doses of nexium to the approved mg dose of prilosec.the data from this study showed that mg of nexium had a statistically significant healing rate over mg of omeprazole.this study was among those used to obtain fda approval of zeneca new drug application for nexium.the fda later determined that nexium should be approved at recommended dosages of mg or mg once daily,for four to eight weeks,for the healing of erosive esophagitis,and at mg for both maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and symptomatic gerd.
in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that the promotional campaign for nexium,which included both marketing and advertising,was misleading because it incorrectly represented that nexium was superior to prilosec.the plaintiffs asserted that a dose of mg is not needed in most patients and a fair comparison of mg of nexium to mg of prilosec would not have proven nexium to be superior.the plaintiffs also contended that zeneca initially sold nexium at a price below prilosec in order to establish brand loyalty,but then raised the price of nexium while the price of prilosec dropped.nexium now sells for per pill versus per pill or less for prilosec.on november,the district court granted zeneca motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.

the application of the dcfa exemption 
the first issue raised on appeal is whether fda approval of prescription drug labeling and regulation of advertising brings the plaintiffs claims within the dcfa exemption of any advertising or merchandising practice that is compliant with federal trade commission regulations.the purpose of the dcfa is to protect consumers and legitimate business enterprises from unfair or deceptive merchandising practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce in part or wholly within this state.code ann.the dcfa proscribes 
the act,use or employment by any person of any deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise,misrepresentation,or the concealment,suppression,or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment,suppression or omission,in connection with the sale,lease or advertisement of any merchandise,whether or not any person has in fact been misled,deceived or damaged thereby 
code ann.a.the exemption language in the dcfa at issue states that t his section shall not apply t o any advertisement or merchandising practice which is subject to and complies with the rules and regulations,of and the statutes administered by,the federal trade commission.code ann.b.the district court concluded that all of the advertising materials cited by the plaintiffs in their complaint are related to the safety and efficacy of nexium,are consistent with the labeling and,therefore,are not actionable under the dcfa pursuant to.b.
plaintiffs argue that the exemption should be read more narrowly than the district court read it,and that,properly construed,the exemption did not protect zeneca conduct.in particular,plaintiffs assert that the exemption is limited to conduct expressly approved by the ftc the fda did not explicitly approve zeneca marketing campaign and zeneca marketing deviated from statements approved by the fda for nexium label.zeneca points to the broad prohibitions in and,which declare unlawful unfair methods of competition and the dissemination of false advertisements,as proof that prescription drug advertising is subject to the statutes administered by the ftc.
as a preliminary matter,we decline to read the dcfa exemption to require that an advertisement or merchandising practice must be expressly approved by the ftc in order to qualify for the exclusion.the plain language of b requires only that the conduct be subject to and compliant with rules and regulations created by the ftc and the statutes administered by that agency.accordingly,the lack of express ftc approval of the nexium marketing campaign is not a basis for declaring the statutory exemption inapplicable.
we are left,then,with the thornier question presented by plaintiffs assertion that the exemption reach does not extend to matters subject to fda oversight.by congressional decree,the ftc and the fda originally shared jurisdiction over prescription drug advertising.see pub,stat.codified as amended at n see also and n removing any advertisement of a prescription drug,published after the effective date of regulations issued under this paragraph applicable to advertisements of prescription drugs,from the purview of the provisions of b the fda shall promote the public health by taking appropriate action on the marketing of regulated products in a timely manner.because congress gave the agencies concurrent jurisdiction with respect to regulating prescription drug advertising until the fda promulgated regulations,the fda and ftc established their own interim division of responsibilities in the working agreement between ftc and food and drug administration,the two agencies agreed that t he food and drug administration has primary responsibility with respect to the regulation of the truth or falsity of prescription drug advertising.this statement does not preclude ftc regulation of prescription drug advertising,but rather notes the agencies mutual understanding that the fda will take the lead in regulating such activities,subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of both agencies.the statement explicitly limits the fda primary responsibility to determining the veracity of the advertising claims it does not suggest that regulating technically true,but potentially misleading,advertisements is the exclusive domain of the fda.accordingly,this arrangement alone does not remove the claims regarding nexium advertising from the purview of regulations and statutes administered by the ftc.however,the fda subsequent promulgation of regulations for prescription drug advertising effectively eliminated the ftc authority in this area.
even if zeneca can show that the marketing was almost identical to the specifically authorized labeling,the fda is not merely acting as the ftc proxy in regulating prescription drug advertising.the fda has responsibility for regulating the advertising of prescription drugs that is independent of any delegation from the ftc 
although there is an affinity between ftc and fda guidance and the scope of the federal trade commission act ftca is broad,the reasoning of the district court rests on the premise that advertising that is based upon labeling approved by the fda falls within the dcfa exemption.this is an unsupportable extension of the language of b.
the distinction between labeling and marketing is significant for regulatory purposes.although there is often a strong correlation between a drug labeling and marketing,federal approval of labeling does not necessarily authorize marketing practices.labeling is defined as all labels and other written,printed,or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers,or accompanying such article.m.it functions as the primary mechanism through which fda and drug manufacturers communicate essential,prescribing information to health care professionals.requirements on content and format of labeling for human prescription drugs and biologics requirements for prescription drug product labels,see also l stating that material such as b rochures,booklets,mailing pieces,detailing pieces,file cards,bulletins,calendars,price lists,catalogs,house organs,letters,descriptive of a drug and references published for example,the physicians desk reference for use by medical practitioners,pharmacists,or nurses,containing drug information supplied by the manufacturer,packer,or distributor of the drug and which are disseminated by or on behalf of its manufacturer,packer,or distributor are hereby determined to be labeling emphasis added.
in contrast,advertisements are published in journals,magazines,and newspapers,and are broadcast through media such as television and radio.advertisements also come in the form of pitches by sales representatives,computer programs,and electronic media.see l.although advertising may also serve as a mechanism to distribute safety information about a drug,its primary not to promote safety but rather to promote market expansion.see,agency information collection activities submission for office of management and budget review comment request experimental evaluation of variations in content and format of the brief summary in print advertisements for prescription drugs,march,although advertising of prescription drugs was once primarily addressed to health professionals,increasingly consumers have become a target audience,as dtc advertising has dramatically increased in the past few years frequently,sponsors print in small type,verbatim,the sections of the approved product labeling also called the package insert,professional labeling,or prescribing information.this labeling is written for health professionals,using medical terminology.zeneca has shown,through documentary evidence,that the fda approved its labeling.however,the plaintiffs contend that the advertising differed sufficiently from the labeling such that it can not also be considered to have been approved by the fda.
approval of a new drug application occurs after the fda determines that the drug meets the statutory standards for safety and effectiveness,manufacturing and controls,and labeling c emphasis added.the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,requires that applicants for new drug applications submit c opies of the label and all labeling for the drug product,e ii,and it specifically prohibits misbranding of drugs.a drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.a a i ii labeling of a drug shall be deemed to be misleading if it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of other representations made or suggested by statement,word,design,device or any combination thereof or material with respect to consequences which may result from use of the article under i the conditions prescribed in such labeling or ii such conditions of use as are customary or usual.the fda may refuse to approve an application on the grounds that t he proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular.b.thus,to the extent that the advertising statements regarding nexium were consistent with statements used in the labeling approved by the fda,the fda has determined that they are not false or misleading 
the fda division of drug marketing,advertising and communications advises drug makers on proposed advertising and promotional labeling,in accordance with j.however,this review process is largely voluntary.id.any advertisement may be submitted to the food and drug administration prior to publication for comment.but see b the applicant shall submit specimens of mailing pieces and any other labeling or advertising devised for promotion of the drug product at the time of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of initial publication of the advertisement for a prescription drug product.section n of the fdca exempts the content of any advertisement from secretarial scrutiny,except in extraordinary circumstances.n a.
whether zeneca is correct in its assertion that the complaint is fundamentally based on the labeling is a legal question.the complaint attacks both the actual marketing tactics used by zeneca,as well as the studies upon which fda approval was based.to the extent that the complaint alleges that zeneca marketed nexium as superior to prilosec,those claims of superiority might be actionable inasmuch as such comparisons are not supported by the labeling and therefore might be false or misleading.although we need not decide this question now,we note that the fda regulations require prescription drug advertisements to comport with approved labeling.see,e iii the information relating to side effects and contraindications shall disclose each specific side effect and contraindication contained in required,approved,or permitted labeling for the advertised drug thomas hayes,drug labeling and promotion evolution and application of regulatory policy,food drug,explaining that,under the regulations,advertising claims may be based either on substantial evidence or on substantial clinical experience,but the standard for labeling is substantial evidence see a disallowing claims or suggestions of drug use on labeling if there is a lack of substantial evidence.
congress expressly gave the fda authority over prescription drug advertising in the fdca.the fdca lists a number of required elements of prescription drug advertising and states that no advertisement of a prescription drug,published after the effective date of regulations issued under this paragraph applicable to advertisements of prescription drugs,shall with respect to the matters specified in this paragraph or covered by such regulations,be subject to the provisions of sections to of title.n.section of title declares unlawful the dissemination of false advertisements.subsection n of the fdca was added in.pub,a.
the dcfa became law in.see brandywine volkswagen,state of community affairs and econ,div.of consumer affairs,citing,ch.in enacting this statute,the delaware general assembly expressed its intent to protect consumers and legitimate business enterprises from unfair or deceptive merchandising practices.code ann.the legislature also explicitly declared its intent that such practices be swiftly stopped and that this subchapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.id.reading the exemption in b to exclude from the scope of the dcfa marketing practices that are subject to the rules and regulations of the fda,and which are required to be based on labeling that is expressly approved and required by the fda,improperly broadens the reach of the exemption beyond its explicit limitation to practices that are compliant with ftc rules and regulations.we will not rewrite the text of the exemption to include regulation of activities that are not within the ftc authority.accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in ruling that the plaintiffs claims were not actionable under the dcfa.
preemption 
the district court further concluded that the nexium advertisements that complied with the labeling were not actionable under the state consumer protection laws because those laws were preempted by federal law.the district court correctly analyzed this issue under the rubric of implied conflict preemption.plaintiffs assert that the district court application of federal preemption is incorrect because there is not an irreconcilable conflict between the state consumer fraud laws and the fdca.in particular,the plaintiffs argue that the approval of nexium labeling did not extend to an assertion of nexium superiority over prilosec.
implied conflict preemption renders state law without effect when,without express congressional command,state law conflicts with federal law.see cipollone liggett group,d.as the supreme court has explained,t his question is basically one of congressional intent.did congress,in enacting the federal statute,intend to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the laws of a state if so,the supremacy clause requires courts to follow federal,not state,law.barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.the court has found implied conflict where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.sprietsma mercury marine,a div.of brunswick,d quoting freightliner myrick,d quoting hines davidowitz.thus,the question presented here is whether state consumer fraud laws pose an obstacle to the fda regulation of prescription drug advertising.
for purposes of this case,the critical characteristic of the fdca is that it regulates the safety of drugs.the fdca states that the mission of the fda is to promote the public health by promptly and efficiently reviewing clinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of regulated products in a timely manner with respect to such products,protect the public health by ensuring that b human drugs are safe and effective.b.prior to the introduction of a new drug,the fda must find that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.d explaining in detail the test that the fda uses in determining whether to approve a drug see also grinspoon dea,cir.as part of this process,the fda must find that there is substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have id.during the approval process,the secretary may determine,based on relevant science,that data from one adequate and clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence obtained prior to or after such investigation are sufficient to establish effectiveness id.emphasis added.such data and evidence constitute substantial evidence under.
section n lists three items that prescription drug advertising must include the actual name of the drug,if a trade or brand name is used the ingredient list and quantitative formula for each ingredient and a brief summary of side effects,contraindications,and effectiveness.the subsection is called the brief summary provision.it requires a true statement of these three items in the brief summary included in advertisements.the statute explains that,to the extent that an advertisement complies with subsection n in listing the three items,it is not subject to the false advertising provisions of the ftca.however,as noted above,n requires only approval of advertisements in extraordinary circumstances.
pursuant to its regulatory authority over prescription drug advertising,the fda promulgated regulations that lay out the specific requirements for advertising prescription drugs.see.in particular,the regulations stipulate that an advertisement does not include a true statement if it is 
f alse or misleading with respect to side effects,contraindications,or effectiveness or i t fails to present a fair balance between information relating to side effects and contraindications and information relating to effectiveness of the drug in that the information relating to effectiveness is not fairly balanced by a presentation of a summary of true information relating to side effects and contraindications of the drug or i t fails to reveal facts material in the light of its representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the advertisement.
e.the regulation includes an extensive,but,list of reasons why a n advertisement for a prescription drug is false,lacking in fair balance,or otherwise misleading e i the subsequent subsection explains the circumstances under which a n advertisement may be false,lacking in fair balance,or otherwise misleading e emphasis added.the regulations further state that d issemination of an advertisement not in compliance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act that causes the drug to be misbranded j.the fda explains that a ny advertisement may be submitted to the food and drug administration prior to publication for comment,but does not require that manufacturers submit their ads for preapproval.j.however,the fda does require manufacturers to submit advertising specimens at the time of initial publication of the advertisement for a prescription drug product.b i requiring transmittal of the advertisement with form.
the degree of discretion inherent in the regulations demonstrates that the fda envisioned itself occupying an ongoing and extensive role in the supervision of prescription drug advertising.see.at in order to carry out the public health protection purposes of the act,fda monitors drug labeling and prescription drug advertising to help ensure that they provide accurate information about drug products.advertising of prescription drugs withdrawal of moratorium,fda will continue to regulate prescription drug advertising,regardless of its intended audience,in accordance with section n of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act n and the implementing regulations cfr part.furthermore,congress shared that vision.see n b however,neither the language of the fdca nor the regulations explicitly preempt state consumer fraud law.
the central tenet of preemption analysis is that t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in determining whether state law is preempted.cipollone,at.quoting retail clerks schermerhorn,d however,the supreme court has long indicated that agency regulations are also a source of preemptive law.see,louisiana public serv.comm fcc,d may result not only from action taken by congress itself a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may state regulation.in medtronic,lohr,d,the court considered fda regulations in the course of its preemption analysis and noted that,under the regulations,state requirements are only when the fda has established specific counterpart regulations or other specific requirements applicable to a particular device.id.at.quoting d.while the court emphasized congressional intent in determining whether preemption was appropriate,id.at,the court also looked to the statutory and regulatory language in evaluating the allegedly preempting federal requirement and the allegedly state requirement id.at.
similarly,in geier american honda motor,d,the court examined whether the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of,and a standard promulgated under it by the department of transportation,preempted a state common law tort action in which the plaintiff claims that the defendant auto manufacturer,who was in compliance with the standard,should nonetheless have equipped a automobile with airbags.id.at.the court concluded that the act,taken together with fmvss the standard,the lawsuit.id.emphasis added.both medtronic and geier suggest the sort of confluence between congressional purpose and agency purpose that had previously been recognized in fidelity federal savings and loan association de la cuesta,d 
federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.where congress has directed an administrator to exercise his discretion,his judgments are subject to judicial review only to determine whether he has exceeded his statutory authority or acted arbitrarily.united states shimer,d.when the administrator promulgates regulations intended to state law,the court inquiry is similarly limited.

following medtronic and geier,the supreme court examined conflict preemption in buckman company plaintiffs legal committee,d.the court determined that claims in state tort law were preempted by the medical device amendments,et.id.at.the court explained that t he conflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the fda to punish and deter fraud against the administration,and that this authority is used by the administration to achieve a somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives.id.in so holding,the court emphasized the flexibility inherent in the statutory and regulatory framework,and noted that such flexibility was necessary for the fda to pursue difficult and often competing objectives.id.at.the court distinguished medtronic,noting that the medtronic claims arose from the manufacturer alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product,not solely from the violation of fdca requirements.id.at.because the existence of these federal enactments was a critical element in the plaintiffs case,the court held that to allow the claims to proceed would exert an extraneous pull on the scheme established by congress id.at.in the plaintiffs claims against zeneca under state consumer fraud laws,the fdca is not as clearly a critical element,because plaintiffs may not need to show with the fdca in order to prevail.however,allowing these claims to proceed would unnecessarily frustrate the fdca purpose and fda regulations,as the extent of agency involvement in regulating prescription drug advertising is extensive and specific.see e i and e i xiii draft guidances for industry on improving information about medical products and health conditions withdrawal availability,fda has responsibility under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act the act for regulating advertising for prescription drugs.
an even stronger case for preemption occurs when labeling is the basis for allegedly fraudulent representations made in prescription drug advertising.the essential affinity between advertising and labeling is clear in the composition of the fdca and its associated regulations.n explaining criteria for determining whether the labeling or advertising is misleading n requiring that all advertisements include the formula showing quantitatively each ingredient of such drug to the extent required for labels see,a the order of listing of ingredients in the advertisement shall be the same as the order of listing of ingredients on the label of the product,and the information presented in the advertisement concerning the quantity of each such ingredient shall be the same as the corresponding information on the label of the product.e ii w hen an advertisement contains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent,the advertisement shall name a type or types of infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required,approved,or permitted in the drug package labeling.although labeling is often directed at medical practitioners,the rules that govern labeling form the basis for the advertising regulations.see requirements on content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products,the purpose of prescription drug labeling is to provide health care practitioners information necessary for safe and effective use.prescription drug advertising content and format for labeling of human prescription drugs,june,the use of quantitative statements of safety or effectiveness is permitted in drug advertisements when the representation has been approved as part of the labeling.accordingly,the purpose of protecting prescription drug users in the fdca would be frustrated if states were allowed to interpose consumer fraud laws that permitted plaintiffs to question the veracity of statements approved by the fda.
implied conflict preemption of state consumer fraud laws is required in this setting because both the fdca and fda regulations provide specific requirements for prescription drug advertising.congress specifically determined that all proceedings for the enforcement,or to restrain violations,of the fdca shall be by and in the name of the united states.a.the high level of specificity in federal law and regulations with respect to prescription drug advertising is irreconcilable with general state laws that purport to govern all types of advertising.see,n b.accordingly,the plaintiffs state consumer fraud claims are preempted 
leave to amend 
the decision whether to grant leave to amend is within the discretion of the district court.rolo city investing.liquidating trust,cir.the supreme court has explained that 
in the absence of any apparent or declared as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of amendment,leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.
foman davis,d.the district court did not rule on appellants request for leave to amend.
the plaintiffs amended their complaint once in response to a motion to dismiss dated march,that advanced the same arguments presented in the motion to dismiss at issue here.plaintiffs had an opportunity to revise their complaint in response to the renewed objections,but failed to cure the deficiencies.additionally,although the plaintiffs suggest that some additional facts might be pled in order to cure the defects of the complaint,amendment would be futile.in particular,the plaintiffs state that they could allege that in negotiations between the fda and astrazeneca regarding nexium labeling,the fda stated it would not approve any representations by astrazeneca that nexium is more effective than prilosec,and astrazeneca responded it would not make any such statement.this will not overcome the deficiencies in the complaint because the advertisements are not subject to state consumer fraud law,as explained in part iii.
the dcfa exemption for advertisements or merchandising practices which are subject to and compliant with the rules and regulations of,and the statutes administered by,the ftc.code ann.b,does not preclude the plaintiffs suit.the language of the exemption circumscribes the federal agencies to which advertisers may look in seeking to exclude their conduct from the prohibition of a.the fda is not referenced in subsection b,nor does the fda act as a proxy for the ftc in its regulation of prescription drug advertising.we therefore decline to read that section more broadly than the delaware general assembly plainly drafted it.
although the dcfa exemption does not bar the plaintiffs suit,their state consumer fraud claims are preempted by federal law.by specifically excluding advertisements covered by n and the regulations promulgated thereunder from the scope of,congress signaled its intent to give the fda exclusive authority to regulate prescription drug advertising.the fda has established specific regulations regarding such advertising.to allow generalized state consumer fraud laws to dictate the parameters of false and misleading advertising in the prescription drug context would pose an undue obstacle to both congress and the fda objectives in protecting the nation prescription drug users.accordingly,the state consumer fraud laws are preempted by the extensive federal legislative and regulatory framework.we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
the majority conclusion that the fdca and the implementing regulations displace the delaware consumer fraud act and the consumer protection statutes of the fifty states ignore s the teaching of th e supreme court decisions which enjoin seeking out conflicts between state and federal regulation where none clearly exists.huron portland cement city of detroit,d.because the state laws do not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the federal law,hines davidowitz,i respectfully dissent.
in areas of traditional state regulation,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator.see also medtronic,lohr,d b ecause the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,it ha s long been presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.the protection of consumers against deceptive business practices is an area traditionally regulated by the states.california arc am,d given the long history of state and statutory remedies against unfair business practices,it is plain that this is an area traditionally regulated by the states.footnote omitted.lime and avocado growers,paul,d statute to prevent the deception of consumers within scope of state police powers plumley commonwealth of.recognizing state power to prevent deception or fraud in the sales of property within their respective limits.similarly,t hroughout our history the several states have exercised their police powers to protect the health and safety of their citizens.medtronic,at.as such,a presumption against a finding of preemption clearly applies in this case.applying the presumption against preemption and general principles of conflict preemption,i can not agree with the majority finding of preemption,as discussed below.
my first point of disagreement lies with the majority heavy reliance upon the high level of specificity in the federal regulations as a basis for a finding of preemption.while the prescription drug advertising regulations are unquestionably detailed and extensive,it is that a preemption inquiry can not be judged by reference to broad statements about the comprehensive nature of federal regulation.head bd.of exam rs in optometry,d citations omitted english,d ordinarily,the mere existence of a federal regulatory scheme,even one as detailed as,does not by itself imply of state remedies.hillsborough county,automated med,d i f an agency does not speak to the question of,we will pause before saying that the mere volume and complexity of its regulations indicate that the agency did in fact intend to.
despite the volume and specificity of the federal regulations,state statutes,otherwise valid,must be upheld unless there is found such actual conflict between the two schemes of regulation that both can not stand in the same area,or evidence of a congressional design to preempt the field.head,at.quoting.lime,at.lime,at.finding no inevitable collision between the two schemes of regulation as discussed further below,no such actual conflict has been demonstrated or found in this case.
my second point of contention is with the majority statement,at least within the context of this case,that congress purpose of protecting prescription drug users would be frustrated if plaintiffs were permitted to question the veracity of statements approved by the fda.it is undisputed that the fda has not approved the veracity of the particular advertisements in question,and,as discussed in greater detail below,plaintiffs are not attacking,directly or indirectly,the labeling approved by the fda 
the majority refers to the essential affinity between advertising and labeling in support of its preemption finding.admittedly,in defining the scope and substance of certain information to be included in drug advertisements,the fda regulations refer to the information required or permitted in the approved labeling.see,a order of listing of ingredients,e iii side effects and contraindications,e xi conditions of drug use.consequently,a claim,alleging that an advertisement consistent with the approved labeling contains inadequate disclosures or warnings regarding such matters as ingredients,side effects,contraindications,and conditions of use,might indirectly present a conflict with the fda labeling determination.that kind of case would present a more difficult preemption question than the one presented here.
in the instant case,on the other hand,plaintiffs claim that advertisements of nexium contain a false and misleading drug comparison.the labeling of a prescription drug does not contain or require a showing of a drug superiority over other drugs on the market.unsurprisingly,then,the fda has not rendered an official opinion approving or disapproving a claim of superiority of nexium over prilosec as a result,there is no risk that a successful claim,alleging that nexium advertisements contain false and misleading drug comparisons,would conflict with the fda approval of the statements in the nexium labeling.
the fda own advertising regulations demonstrate as much.the regulations categorize as false and misleading any advertisement that c ontains a drug comparison that represents or suggests that a drug is safer or more effective than another drug in some particular when it has not been demonstrated to be safer or more effective in such particular by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.e ii.unlike the provisions in the regulation,see,a,e iii,e xi,the false and misleading drug comparison provision does not turn on the approved labeling,but on the existence of substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.e ii.the essential affinity between advertising and labeling,therefore,does not subsist in a claim attacking a statement of drug superiority in an advertisement.
in summary,because the fda has not approved or disapproved the veracity of the advertising statements that plaintiffs challenge in this case,and plaintiffs particular challenge does not question the veracity of any statements in the labeling approved by the fda,there is no likelihood that plaintiffs claims would conflict with the fda responsibility in protecting prescription drug users.as stated by the late chief justice rehnquist,merely identifying a purpose is not enough for conflict preemption it must also be shown that the state law inevitably frustrates that purpose.jones rath packing,d rehnquist,dissenting.emphasizing that point,he noted 
we must also be careful to distinguish those situations in which the concurrent exercise of a power by the federal government and the states or by the states alone may possibly lead to conflicts and those situations where conflicts will necessarily arise.it is not a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers,but an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a right of state sovereignty.
id.quoting the federalist,wright ed.only if the purpose of the federal law can not be its operation must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural the state law yield to the regulation of congress.savage jones.
while the majority has identified the congressional purpose of protecting prescription drug users,it has not articulated how the state law must inevitably frustrate that purpose.there is certainly no immediate constitutional repugnancy between an finding that a claim of drug superiority in an advertisement is false and misleading and the congressional purpose of protecting prescription drug users.jones,at.rehnquist,dissenting internal quotations marks and citation omitted.as such,i can not agree with the majority finding of preemption on that basis.
my third concern relates to the majority finding that congress exclusion of prescription drug advertisements from the scope of signals a congressional intention to preempt state consumer fraud laws.the text of n only excludes coverage under and does not purport to bar tort actions.nor does the legislative history to n indicate a congressional purpose to supplant actions.see english,at.most importantly,the exclusion of prescription drug advertisements from coverage under the federal statute does not approach the required clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt state law.see rice,at.
fourth,i disagree that the majority attempt to analogize this case to buckman plaintiffs legal committee,d,where the supreme court found preemption based upon specific conflicts between certain fda objectives and claims and the interdependency between the state claims and fdca requirements.in buckman,the court found that the plaintiffs claims would have had the effect of deterring beneficial uses,despite the fda objective not to regulate the practice of medicine,and would have caused a deluge of information concerning uses,resulting in administrative burdens and delays.id.at.in addition,the court found that unlike the traditional state tort claims,the claims existed solely by virtue of fdca disclosure requirements,which congress had given the fda the exclusive responsibility to enforce.id.at.for these reasons,the court held that the plaintiffs claims were preempted.id.at.
unlike the claims in buckman,plaintiffs claims here do not exist by virtue of a violation of fdca disclosure requirements.the state consumer protection statutes at issue existed long before the federal enactments.moreover,the majority does not identify any actual conflicts between the federal regime and the state statutes.there is,for example,no cited risk that the availability of remedies would conflict with a particular federal objective or a careful balancing of interests that the federal government has achieved in policing prescription drug advertising.for these reasons,the claims in this case can not be reasonably analogized to the claims in buckman,and,thus,the majority use of the reasoning in buckman to support its preemption finding is misguided.
fifth,i disagree with the majority finding of preemption to the extent it is based upon the presence of parameters for false and misleading advertisements.as discussed below,the mere presence of state law standards would not inevitably lead to a collision with the federal regime.
as an initial matter,the majority characterizes plaintiffs claims as both interposing standards and vindicating federal requirements.implicit in this dual characterization is,necessarily,the recognition that the state standards and federal requirements are not inconsistent.yet,it is that the mere presence of claims that parallel federal requirements is not sufficient to support a preemption finding.see medtronic,at.the presence of a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different requirement that is necessary under the statute rather,it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing requirements under federal law.cipollone liggett group,d prohibitions on false statements of material fact do not create diverse,nonuniform,and confusing standards.unlike obligations concerning the warning necessary to render a product reasonably safe,proscriptions on intentional fraud rely only on a single,uniform standard falsity.
on a number of occasions,the supreme court has upheld state laws that provide remedies parallel to the remedies provided by the federal law.see,silkwood,d paying both federal fines and punitive damages for the same incident would not appear to be physically impossible.nor does exposure to punitive damages frustrate any purpose of the federal remedial scheme.hayfield chi.and transp,d although it may seem unfair to allow a shipper a second bite at the apple in state condemnation proceedings,that second opportunity does not frustrate the purpose of the federal valuation scheme.kewanee oil bicron,d t he patent policy of encouraging invention is not disturbed by the existence of another form of incentive to invention.as explained by the supreme court,state causes of action are not solely because they impose liability over and above that authorized by federal law.california,at.english,at.same.but see capital cities cable,crisp,d since the oklahoma law compels conduct that federal law forbids,the state ban clearly stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the federal regulatory scheme.internal quotation marks and citation omitted franklin nat.bank new york.finding a clear conflict between federal law,which authorized national banks to receive savings deposits but did not specifically less by such banks,and new york law,which forbade them from using the word savings in their advertising or business.
the state statutory damages remedies for false and misleading advertisements would not frustrate the federal policy of protecting prescription drug consumers.the veracity of drug advertisements is essential to the protection of consumers.as stated in the legislative history to n,when a doctor is misled his patient health is endangered,reprinted in.given that there are limitations to the fda oversight over prescription drug limitations,such as the lack of authority to require preapproval,n,and practical limitations attendant to the sheer volume of drug advertisements in the media,see donna vogt,crs report for congress advertising of prescription drugs congressional research service,the library of congress noting that in alone,the fda received advertisements from drug sponsors the supplementation of remedies would seem to aid the fdca objectives and purposes,not frustrate them.
for these reasons,i can not agree that the mere presence of state law standards for false and misleading advertisements would present a conflict with the federal law.
of final note,congress failure to provide a private remedy for persons injured by false and misleading advertisements further convinces me that the state law remedies are not preempted.as the supreme court stated in silkwood,i t is difficult to believe that congress would,without comment,remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.at.see also bates dow agrosciences,d i t seems unlikely that congress considered a relatively obscure provision like b to give pesticide manufacturers virtual immunity from certain forms of tort liability.
in addition,where the state law in question provides a long available form of compensation,it would be expected that congress would express an intent to deprive injured parties of that compensation even more clearly.see bates,at.here,the long history of state consumer protection statutes in this country which,incidentally,were modeled after and coexisted with the ftca,the fdca predecessor insofar as prescription drug advertising is concerned adds force to the basic presumption against preemption.see id.at.that presumption has not been rebutted in this case.
in summary,because congressional intention to remove all judicial recourse for parties injured by deceptive business practices is far from clear,a finding of preemption is not permitted under supreme court precedent.
based upon the foregoing,i respectfully dissent,insofar as the majority concludes that the state claims are preempted 
the district court had diversity jurisdiction under d and,which confers federal jurisdiction over class actions where any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant and the amount in controversy exceeds.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to and.
on april,zeneca filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as to seven of the original ten plaintiffs on the ground that the notice of appeal included only the pennsylvania employees benefit trust fund,joseph macken,and linda watters.the three named plaintiffs contested the motion to dismiss,which is now before us.because of our disposition of this case,we need not reach this issue.w
