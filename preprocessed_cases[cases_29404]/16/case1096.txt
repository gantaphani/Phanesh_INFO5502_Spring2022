opinion of the court 
this matter arises out of a dispute over whether a policy for life insurance was in force upon the death of james west.the insurer,appellee lincoln benefit life company lincoln benefit,argues that west policy had lapsed for nonpayment of premiums and had not been reinstated.because the policy was not in force at the time of west death,lincoln benefit submits,it is not obligated to pay benefits under the policy terms.appellant patricia west,james west wife and beneficiary of the policy,argues that pennsylvania law imposed a temporary contract of insurance when,after notice of lapse,she sent an application for reinstatement and payment of overdue premiums.for the reasons that follow,we agree with lincoln benefit and will affirm summary judgment in its favor.
on april,west obtained a life insurance policy from allstate insurance company.on the application for the policy,he stated that he was taking medicine for high blood pressure.after medical testing or examination by allstate,the insurance policy was issued.in february,west converted the allstate policy to a term policy with lincoln benefit and added a term rider benefit the policy.at the time of conversion,lincoln benefit did not require a medical examination or other proof of insurability.west named west beneficiary of the policy.
the policy terms are as follows the insured must remit a quarterly payment of to remain insured.if a premium payment is not received by its due date,a grace period of days goes into effect.at the end of days,if the premium is still outstanding,the policy is terminated.after termination but before the death of the insured,however,the policy may be reinstated provided that the insured requests reinstatement within five years of the date that the policy entered the grace period gives lincoln benefit the proof it require s that the insured is still insurable in the payment class under which the policy was issued pays an amount large enough to cover the unpaid monthly deductions for the grace period makes a payment sufficient to keep the policy in force for three subsequent policy months and pays or asks lincoln benefit to reinstate any outstanding loan,with interest.at.
lincoln benefit addressed all correspondence to west at his home address.west would open the mail addressed to him,then give west any mail that required a response,including bills and notices of payment due issued by lincoln benefit.west would respond or write a check for payment,as appropriate,and maintain the file of insurance documents.west recalled two occasions when west gave her a notice from lincoln benefit that the premium payment was overdue and coverage would terminate unless payment was made by a particular date.both times she sent a check immediately to continue the policy in force.she saw only the correspondence from lincoln benefit that west gave to her.she does not know if there were letters or bills from lincoln benefit sent to her husband that he did not then pass on to her.the wests paid all premiums due through february.
on april,lincoln benefit sent west a reminder that his next premium was due on may.on may,because it had not received payment,lincoln benefit sent west a letter informing him that the policy had entered the grace period.his policy would terminate on july,if the premium was not received on or before that date.on may,lincoln benefit sent west a second notice that his may premium was due 
west did not submit payment to lincoln benefit on or before july.thus,on july,lincoln benefit sent him a letter stating that the grace period for premium payment on his policy had expired.the letter advised west that he could apply for reinstatement.the second paragraph of the letter stated,t o continue your valuable coverage,complete the application for reinstatement form on the back and return it with your payment of.upon underwriting approval,and receipt of the sufficient payment,coverage will continue uninterrupted.at.enclosed with the letter was an application for reinstatement.the application itself states,i each undersigned request that the company reinstate this policy coverage will not start again until this request is approved by the company and all required premiums and interest are paid.if this request is not approved,any amount tendered will be returned.id.at.
west recalls having read only the first sentence of the second paragraph of the letter,t o continue your valuable coverage,complete the application for reinstatement form on the back and return it with your payment of.she interpreted it to mean that if she filled out the form and sent it to lincoln benefit with payment,west insurance would be reinstated.west did not read,or does not remember reading,any of the language in the letter or the application stating that underwriting approval was required before reinstatement would be effective.
the application asked ten questions regarding the applicant medical history.west filled out the application on west behalf.she answered nine questions in the negative,indicating that west had no medical issues relating to those questions.she answered yes and no to one,in the past ten years or during the time west was insured under the policy,he had been diagnosed with,sought or received treatment or advice for heart attack,disease of coronary arteries or other blood vessels,other heart disorder,high blood pressure,diabetes or stroke.id.in the blank provided for an explanation of full details,including diagnosis,severity,treatment,name and address of doctors,hospitals,and clinics,she wrote controlled with medication.id.she answered yes because west still had the high blood pressure disclosed on his initial application for life insurance with allstate.she knew west to be in good health because he was taking medication to control his blood pressure and he had recently passed a physical exam with no medical problems.thus,she believed that lincoln benefit would approve the application for reinstatement immediately upon receipt of the application and payment.
lincoln benefit received the application for reinstatement on july,along with west check for.on july,lincoln benefit deposited the check pursuant to its standard practice.
west died on july,and lincoln benefit received notice of his death two days later.the underwriting department had not completed its review of the application and had not made a decision on whether to reinstate his policy.because lincoln benefit did not consider west policy to be in effect at the time of his death,on july,the company denied west claim for payment of benefits and refunded the premium payment of that had accompanied the application for reinstatement.

the facts of this case implicate a specific area of insurance of a lapsed policy of life general principles of insurance law as declared by the pennsylvania courts.we will address each paradigm in turn.
a.the law of reinstatement 
pennsylvania insurance department act of was enacted to protect the public.collister nationwide life ins.one of its requirements is that all life insurance policies delivered in pennsylvania contain the provisions of.ann,or terms more favorable to the insured.see generally lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.w here statutory requirements are enacted,they automatically become part of any insurance policy issued thereafter,notwithstanding more limiting language in the policy.the statute requires that all premiums may be paid in advance,a,and if a premium is not received when due,the insured is entitled to a grace period in which to pay,b.if an insured does not pay within the grace period and the policy lapses,k governs the rights and obligations of the insured after lapse of a policy,should the insured wish to apply for reinstatement 
t he holder of a policy shall be entitled to have the policy reinstated,upon written application therefor,at any time within three years from the date of default in premium payments,unless the policy has been duly surrendered or the extension period expired,upon the production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company,payment of all overdue premiums with interest at a rate to be specified in the policy and the payment of any other indebtedness to the company upon said policy with interest 
the conjunctive phrasing of k makes it clear that each requirement must be payment of overdue premiums is not sufficient to effect reinstatement.fisher am.ins,cir sykes united ins,selby equitable beneficial mut.life ins,peters colonial life ins.of,stager fed.life ins,fishman.assurance,franklin best,pennsylvania insurance law ed.see russ segalla,supra,where two or more conditions to reinstatement exist,it is necessary that the insured satisfy all of the conditions in order to obtain reinstatement.the insured holds the burden of proving compliance with all conditions precedent to reinstatement.riebel prudential ins.of,sykes,at selby,at peters,at stager,at fishman,at.because our analysis turns on the second requirement,that the insured must provide evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer,we will evaluate the law on that issue only.
the pennsylvania supreme court was presented with an opportunity to interpret the meaning of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer in riebel.a man applied for life insurance and received a policy.at.the policy lapsed for of premiums.id.the reinstatement provision in riebel was phrased in exact accordance with the statutory text of k that was then in effect,such that the lapsed insured was required to pay past arrears and furnish evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer.id.at.the lapsed insured submitted his application for reinstatement and payment of premiums.id.he also submitted a physician report of his health indicating that he had lost twenty pounds,looked anemic,had contracted the flu during the previous year and had not felt well since.id.at.the next day,he died.id.four days later,and without notice of the lapsed insured death,the application for reinstatement was denied because the evidence presented did not satisfy the company that he was still insurable.id.the arrearage payment was tendered back to the estate of the lapsed insured.id.
the pennsylvania supreme court held that the insurer was clearly within its rights to deny reinstatement under the statutory predecessor to k,the insurance policy,and the application for reinstatement,when no satisfactory evidence of the insurability of the lapsed insured was provided see best,supra,russ segalla,supra,r einstatement may be denied if the insured is uninsurable at the time he or she seeks reinstatement.e ven if the court could overlook the contractual and statutory requirement,that the evidence of the insurability of the insured must be satisfactory to the company,plaintiff has furnished no evidence which would justify either the court or jury in so determining on this unsatisfactory proof riebel,at.accordingly,the supreme court affirmed entry of judgment for the insurance company and against the beneficiary of the lapsed insurance policy.id.
as demonstrated by riebel,evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company must,in fact,be satisfactory to the company.if this evidence is not provided,or is not satisfactory,the insurer need not reinstate.stager,at russ segalla,supra.the insurer can not be arbitrary or capricious in considering the evidence of insurability provided in an application for reinstatement.rothschild life ins.ultimately,however,the insurer has the right to make the final decision as to whether it will accept or deny an application for reinstatement.fishman,at see k evidence of insurability must be satisfactory to the insured.
the method of proof of insurability may vary.insurers often rely initially on forms to provide evidence of insurability.these forms require the insured or an examining physician to answer questions about the insured health.see stager,at.incomplete or answers to the insurer questions do not provide satisfactory evidence of insurability.id.at.in stager,such a form was used in an application for reinstatement.the application asked,have you now any diseases or disorders if any,give details.id.at.the lapsed insured responded bladder.id.the insurer replied with the following if that question is answered correctly and the insured now has a bladder disorder he would not be insurable.we are returning the application for him to modify if that question is incorrectly answered.id.this answer,unchanged,imposed no obligation upon the insurer to reinstate because it was not responsive to the question asked and did not provide satisfactory evidence that the lapsed insured remained insurable.id.at.
subsequent developments in insurance law 
in the late,the pennsylvania supreme court issued decisions that demonstrated its approach to insurance law by allowing the expectations of the insured rather than the plain terms of a policy to control insurance disputes.none of these decisions involved reinstatement of a lapsed policy none purport to interpret or modify the law governing reinstatement described supra.
in rempel nationwide life insurance,plurality,the claimed negligent misrepresentation by an insurer agent.id.at.the agent informed the insured that upon his death,his policy would pay the remainder of his mortgage balance plus.id.the terms of the policy did not,in fact,contain such provisions.id.the rempels did not read the policy to confirm the agent assertions,but the pennsylvania supreme court did not impose a duty upon them to do so.id.at.instead,c onsumers,such as the rempels,view an insurance agent as one possessing expertise in a complicated subject.it is therefore not unreasonable for consumers to rely on the representations of the expert rather than on the contents of the insurance policy itself.id.put another way,consumers rely on an agent to translate the specialized language of an insurance policy into words that they understand.accord collister,at t he insurance industry forces the insurance consumer to rely upon the oral representations of the insurance agent.such representations may or may not accurately reflect the contents of the written document and therefore the insurer is often in a position to reap the benefit of the insured lack of understanding.because there was no evidence indicating that the rempels knew,or should have known,that the policy which they received did not contain the provisions which the agent led them to believe would be in the policy,the rempels were entitled to the additional that they reasonably expected as a result of the agent misrepresentation.rempel,at.
a year later,in collister,the pennsylvania supreme court considered the question of whether a temporary contract of insurance arose when a proposed insured submitted a new application for insurance and contemporaneously paid his first premium.at.the insurance agent who received the application and payment informed the proposed insured that a medical examination was required.id.at.the agent also provided the proposed insured a conditional receipt which stated no insurance will become effective prior to policy delivery unless the acts required by this receipt are completed.id.at.one of the acts required was a medical examination demonstrating the applicant insurability.id.the applicant died before submitting the results of a medical exam.id.at.the insurer had not accepted or rejected his application for a new policy.id.the beneficiary claimed that a temporary contract for insurance had arisen at the moment of premium payment.id.at.the pennsylvania supreme court agreed.id.at.
the court held that the proper resolution of questions such as that presented by the instant appeal depends upon an analysis of the totality of the transaction involved.id.at.it further held that 
i n situations where the circumstances of the transaction do not indicate that the insurer intended to provide interim insurance,but nevertheless show that the insurer accepted payment of the first premium at the time it took the application,it is then up to the insurer to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the consumer had no reasonable basis for believing that he or she was purchasing immediate insurance coverage.
id.ultimately,courts were directed to examine the dynamics of the insurance transaction to ascertain what are the reasonable expectations of the consumer and give effect to those expectations,regardless of the ambiguity or clarity of the language of an insurance contract.id.at.
following rempel and collister,however,insurance case law appeared to diverge under two subsequent decisions by the pennsylvania supreme court standard venetian blind american empire insurance,and tonkovic state farm mutual automobile insurance.standard venetian blind adhered to the language of the insurance contract to determine an insurer obligation to pay,without regard to the expectations of the insured.it did not cite collister.instead,the pennsylvania supreme court stated that the intent of the parties is 
manifested by the language of the written instrument.where a provision of a policy is ambiguous,the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer,the drafter of the agreement.where,however,the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous,a court is required to give effect to that language.in the absence of proof of fraud,failure to read the contract is an unavailing excuse or defense and can not justify an avoidance,modification or nullification of the contract or any provision thereof.
standard venetian blind,at quotation,citations,and alterations omitted.standard venetian blind did admonish that in light of the manifest inequality of bargaining power between an insurance company and a purchaser of insurance,a court may on occasion be justified in deviating from the plain language of a contract of insurance.id.at.
the facts of that case,however,did not permit such deviation because the policy limitation at issue was clearly worded and conspicuously displayed.id.the insured,upon application for the policy,requested full coverage on everything we have.id.at.the policy contained standard exclusion provisions,which were clear,unambiguous,and not contrary to law.id.at.the insurer did not describe the limitations of the policy,but neither did it misrepresent that the policy had no exclusions or that the exclusions were anything other than what they purported to be.see id.to allow the insured to avoid application of the clear and unambiguous policy limitations in these circumstances would have required the supreme court to rewrite the parties written contract,which the court would not do.id.instead,it sought to accord proper significance to the written contract,which has historically been the true test of parties intentions.id.at.
by contrast,tonkovic focused on the reasonable expectations of the insured rather than the clear language of the contested policy because the insured specifically requested disability insurance,but was issued a policy that did not include disability insurance.at.tonkovic held that where an individual applies and prepays for specific insurance coverage,the insurer may not unilaterally change the coverage provided without an affirmative showing that the insured was notified of,and understood,the change,regardless of whether the insured read the policy.id.at.there is a crucial distinction between cases where one applies for a specific type of coverage and the insurer unilaterally limits that coverage,resulting in a policy quite different from what the insured requested,as the facts of tonkovic demonstrated,and cases where the insured received precisely the coverage that he requested but failed to read the policy to discover clauses that are the usual incident of the coverage applied for,as occurred in standard venetian blind.accord toy metro.life ins,affirming that an insurer has a duty to inform an insured that it issued a policy different from what the insured requested.
the cases that follow reflect the tonkovic distinction.in the absence of an affirmative misrepresentation by the insurer or its agent about the contents of the policy,the plain and unambiguous terms of a policy demonstrate the parties intent and they control the rights and obligations of the insurer and the insured,kvaerner metals div.of kvaerner,commercial union ins,madison constr.harleysville mut.ins,the polestar of our inquiry is the language of the insurance policy.gene harvey builders.mfrs.ass ins.when a provision of the policy is clear and unambiguous,it must be enforced.madison constr,at.an unclear,ambiguous provision will be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.id.
an analysis of the reasonable expectations of the insured is rightly employed when a claimant alleges that the insurer engaged in deceptive practices toward the insured,either to misrepresent the terms of the policy or to issue a policy different than the one requested by the insured and promised by the insurer.matcon diamond,penn ins,pressley travelers prop.cas.in this context,the clear and unambiguous language in the policy is one aspect of the totality of the circumstances that may lead to the reasonable expectations of the insured.bubis prudential prop.cas.ins,frain keystone ins,see reliance ins.moessner,cir pressley,at,concurring and dissenting but see dibble sec.of am.life ins,evaluating the dynamics of the transaction viewed in its entirety without regard to the language of an application for a new policy or the policy itself bierer nationwide ins,the fact that the policy rider and application are unambiguous in their provisions does not,by itself,defeat the reasonable expectations of the consumer.a n insured may not complain that his or her reasonable expectations were frustrated by policy limitations which are clear and unambiguous.frain,at.however,even the most clearly written exclusion will not bind the insured where the insurer or its agent has created in the insured a reasonable expectation of coverage.reliance ins,at.m ere assertions that a party expected coverage will not ordinarily defeat unambiguous policy language excluding coverage.matcon diamond,at.
