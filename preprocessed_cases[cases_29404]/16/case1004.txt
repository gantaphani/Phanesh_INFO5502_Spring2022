background and procedural history 
ford manufactures vehicles and sells them through a nationwide network of independent franchise dealers.the dealers purchase vehicles from ford at wholesale prices and resell them at retail prices.with each new vehicle sold,ford provides a basic manufacturer warranty that entitles the customer to have ford repair or replace certain defective vehicle components.customers can bring their vehicles to any ford dealer,regardless of where they purchased the vehicles,and obtain warranty service free of charge.ford then reimburses the dealers for their labor and parts used.since,ford has provided dealers a of over cost for most parts used in warranty services this means that ford pays the dealer,in total,of the cost of those parts.however,under the new jersey franchise protection act njfpa,ford must reimburse dealers for warranty parts at the prevailing retail rate,which is the rate dealers charge retail customers in connection with work.stat.ann.a.as a result,new jersey dealers are reimbursed at higher rates than their counterparts in other states.
in,ford implemented a dealer parity surcharge dps in order to recoup the increased cost of reimbursing new jersey dealers under the njfpa.under the dps,ford calculated,for each new jersey dealer,the cost of increased warranty reimbursements due to the higher retail reimbursement rate,and then divided that total by the number of wholesale vehicles purchased by that same dealer.that amount constituted the surcharge added to the wholesale price of every vehicle purchased by that specific dealer.consequently,the wholesale vehicle surcharge a dealer faced would increase in direct proportion to the amount of warranty claims the dealer submitted.
in and,liberty lincoln mercury,and other franchise dealers filed suit against ford,contending that the dps was unlawful.the united states district court for the district of new jersey dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice but granted summary judgment for the dealers in the lawsuit on the grounds that the dps violated the njfpa.liberty lincoln mercury,ford motor liberty i.in affirming the district court order,we recognized that the njfpa did not preclude systems effected through wholesale vehicle price increases,but reject ed ford contention that the dps constitute d such a system.liberty lincoln mercury,ford motor liberty ii,cir.the dps,which accrued in direct proportion to the amount of warranty reimbursement submitted by each new jersey dealer,did not function as a wholesale price increase effected through vehicle sales transactions.id.at.instead,it automatically reduc ed the franchisees reimbursements to rates,violat ing the njfpa clear mandate that the franchisor shall reimburse the franchisee for warranty parts in an amount equal to the prevailing retail price.id.citing stat.ann.a.
subsequently,ford ceased assessing the dps and devised a new system,termed the new jersey cost surcharge njcs.under the njcs,ford calculated its total cost of complying with the njfpa across all new jersey dealers and divided that cost by the total number of wholesale vehicles sold in the state.this resulted in a flat surcharge for every wholesale vehicle sold in the state,rather than a surcharge that varied across dealers.thus,a dealer total njcs increased in proportion to the number of vehicles the dealer purchased,regardless of how many warranty repairs the dealer submitted to ford.
in,shortly after the njcs took effect,a group of new jersey dealers filed a complaint alleging that the njcs violated,among other laws,the njfpa.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the dealers on the issue of liability.liberty lincoln mercury,ford motor liberty iii,wgb,wl,at,however,the district court rejected the dealers argument that they were entitled,as a matter of law,to full reimbursement of the surcharge without proving actual damages.accordingly,it denied the dealers motion for summary judgment on the issue of damages as well as their application for a prejudgment interest rate under stat.ann.the district court also denied the dealers motion for summary judgment and granted ford motion for summary judgment on certain engine and transmission assembly reimbursement claims.
because the district court established that the dealers must prove actual damages for the njfpa violation,four of the plaintiffs proceeded to a jury trial.the jury awarded the full amount of damages requested by each of the dealers.ford filed a timely appeal on the issue of liability under the njfpa.the dealers filed a timely on the issue of damages and application for a interest rate,as well as the engine and transmission assembly reimbursement claims.

iii.discussion 
a.the new jersey franchise protection act 
the njfpa provides that 
the motor vehicle franchisor shall reimburse each motor vehicle franchisee for such warranty services as are rendered and for such parts as are supplied,in an amount equal to the prevailing retail price charged by such motor vehicle franchisee for such services and parts in circumstances where such services are rendered or such parts supplied other than pursuant to warranty provided that such motor vehicle franchisee prevailing retail price is not unreasonable when compared with that of the holders of motor vehicle franchises from the same motor vehicle franchisor for identical merchandise or services in the geographic area in which the motor vehicle franchisee is engaged in business.
stat.ann.a.ford appeals the district court holding that the njcs violates the express language of the statute and frustrates its legislative purpose.we review the district court interpretation of the njfpa de novo and construe the statute as we believe the new jersey supreme court would construe it.liberty ii,at.as a general rule of statutory construction,we look first to the language of the statute.if the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and admits of only one interpretation,we need delve no deeper than the act literal terms to divine the legislature intent.first resolution inv.seker,citation omitted.when the language of the statute is ambiguous,courts may look to the statute history,policy,purpose,and other extrinsic aids to ascertain statutory intent.see cedar cove,stanzione.
consistent with this court reasoning in liberty ii,at,we conclude that ford assessment of the njcs does not violate the clear text of the njfpa the liberty ii court stated that in general,ford was permitted to recover its cost of complying with the njfpa.id.at.it drew a distinction,however,between permissible and impermissible systems.id.at.
when determining whether ford dps was a permissible system,the liberty ii court looke
