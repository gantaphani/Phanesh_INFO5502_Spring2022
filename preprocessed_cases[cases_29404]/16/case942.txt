plaintiff appellant seabury construction corporation seabury appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york michael mukasey,judge,entered may.seabury sued defendant appellee jeffrey chain corporation jeffrey,claiming breach of contract arising from failures in industrial collector chain.the chain was manufactured by jeffrey and sold to seabury for installation at the hunts point water pollution control plant in the bronx,new york,which was under renovation by the new york city department of environmental protection the dep.
following a bench trial,the district court found that the chain failed because some of the links had been manufactured to hardness levels that exceeded contract specifications and that these failures occurred while the chain was under warranty.however,the lower court dismissed seabury complaint because it concluded that jeffrey compliance with a required testing protocol trumped otherwise applicable contract specifications.because we do not believe that the protocol overrode either the hardness requirements or performance assurances contained in the contract,we reverse and remand for a determination of damages.
background 
in april,the dep entered into a contract with seabury to reconstruct water treatment tanks located at the hunts point plant.the dep contract with seabury consisted of seabury bid,the information for bidders and standard city agreement,and the city general conditions and detailed specifications.the tanks in question facilitate wastewater treatment by allowing the water to settle,at which point it is skimmed to remove waste product.the skimming equipment consists of collector and drive chains,which resemble large bicycle chains,assembled into arrays that are continually passed through the tanks to remove solid waste materials.in order for chain to survive in a highly corrosive wastewater environment,it must be manufactured to precise contract specifications,including those related to the hardness of the links.
seabury contract permitted it to subcontract with jeffrey,hitachi metal limited,or another comparable supplier for production of the necessary chain.following negotiations,jeffrey and seabury executed a purchase order dated april.as set forth in the purchase order,jeffrey agreed to provide feet of steel chain and other related equipment required by the contract for a purchase price of.the purchase order provided,among other things,that a ll equipment shall be acceptable to the city of new york,department of environmental protection,and they sic shall be the sole judge of acceptability,and any replacement shall be at jeffrey chain expense.any inspection testing shall be at jeffrey chain expense.the purchase order created a warranty on the drive chain and a warranty on the collector chain as per the new york city requirements,which mandated that the contractor promptly repair,replace,restore or rebuild,as the commissioner of the dep may determine,any finished work in which defects of materials or workmanship may appear or to which damage may occur because of such defects,during the one year period subsequent to the date of final acceptance except where other periods of maintenance and guarantee are provided for.the purchase order further required that r eplacement of problem or failed chain is at the description discretion of.with input from jeffrey.finally,the purchase order provided that a ll aspects of the standard contract specifications and drawings are hereby made a part of this purchase order most notably sections,b,and 
jeffrey manufactured the chain in the fall of at its morristown,tennessee plant.section of the detailed specifications,which was incorporated into the purchase order,required jeffrey to test samples of each day production for,among other things,strength and hardness,and,prior to delivery,to conduct additional tests that could be witnessed by the dep.the provision also required jeffrey to perform the latter set of tests in a manner which shall conclusively prove that the characteristics of the material or equipment subject to test comply fully with the requirements of the specifications.dep representatives observed the ultimate testing,and jeffrey determined that the chain passed all of the required tests and forwarded appropriate certifications to seabury.the dep subsequently approved the chain for delivery,and the chain was delivered in december and installed between march and september.
following installation,extensive chain failures occurred in the side bars of the collector chain.the first failure occurred in june,when a chain shattered after nine months in operation.subsequently,chain failed in a number of other tanks,with some tanks experiencing multiple failures.these failures were in marked contrast to the performance of chain in other tanks at hunts point manufactured by hitachi to the same specifications,which had been in use since without significant failures.
jeffrey,seabury,and the dep all attempted to determine the cause of the failures.in august,the dep sent samples of broken chain to an independent metallurgist,lucius pitkin,lpi.lpi concluded that the failures were caused by stress corrosion cracking.stress corrosion cracking occurs when chain is made too hard,thereby compromising its structural integrity.section c of the detailed specifications,which was incorporated into the purchase order,required that,prior to installation,the side bars of the collector chain be heat treated to rockwell b,a scale measuring the hardness of steel lpi concluded that the chain failed because some links had been manufactured to a hardness level that exceeded contract specifications.specifically,lpi found that t he root cause of the chain failure is attributable to the high hardness,well in excess of that specified by section c,for the type martensitic stainless steel side bar material comprising the chain.
jeffrey performed its own analysis on samples of the broken chain in july and found that the failed chain ranged in hardness from to rockwell b,generally exceeding contract specifications.in november,jeffrey conducted tests on more of the failed links.these tests further confirmed that the failures were caused by stress corrosion cracking and that the additional failed links ranged in hardness from to rockwell finally,in april,seabury retained its own metallurgical expert who also found that the average hardness of the failed chain exceeded section c specifications.
seabury claims that,to fulfill its contractual obligations to the dep,it spent over repairing and replacing failed chain.after jeffrey refused to reimburse it for these expenditures,seabury sued jeffrey in diversity for breach of contract,seeking to recover the cost of repairing and replacing the defective chain.the case proceeded to trial in december.
seabury submitted extensive evidence of the chain failures,for which jeffrey presented the court with two explanations.first,jeffrey claimed that the dep own specifications called for chain that was too hard to withstand the corrosive effects of the wastewater.in support of this contention,jeffrey demonstrated that,subsequent to the hunts point failures,the dep lowered the maximum hardness for collector chain to rockwell b and discontinued the use of metallic chain.the court rejected this argument,finding that chain manufactured by hitachi to the same hardness specification had performed satisfactorily for many years.jeffrey second defense was that the chain failures were caused by seabury deliberately improper installation of the chain.the court also rejected this theory,finding that there was absolutely no evidence to support it.instead,the district court credited seabury argument that the links failed because they were manufactured to a hardness level beyond that specified in the purchase order.the court found that this theory had substantial support in the record,including the testimony of two independent metallurgists hearing,at hereinafter tr.further,the district court found that t he record shows that the chain in question failed in many tanks within a year of installation,the applicable warranty period.tr
