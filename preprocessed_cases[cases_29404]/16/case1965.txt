plaintiff,appeals the district court denial of its federal rule of civil procedure b motion for relief from an order,entered pursuant to a settlement,release,and license agreement the settlement agreement,dismissing infohold patent infringement action,brought under,against defendant,sound merchandising,smi,doing business as intellitouch communications.contends that relief is warranted because smi fraudulently induced to enter the settlement agreement,and smi committed a material breach of the settlement agreement.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of rule b motion.
background 
and smi are manufacturers of message players.message players are devices that can be connected to a business telephone system to play audio messages through that phone system so that a caller can hear the messages when he or she is placed on hold.has secured several patents to protect the technology used in its various messaging products.
on december,filed a patent infringement action against smi in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.as subsequently amended,infohold complaint alleged that smi had infringed upon patent and by making and selling its own message players.amended complaint,however,did not identify which of smi message players considered to be.
on january,the district court entered a case management and scheduling order which directed to identify by january,the name and model number of any allegedly products of smi,and ordered that all discovery be completed by september.by march,had still not specified which of smi products it found to be and the district court issued a second order directing to do so.on march,finally identified smi product as the allegedly device.
several months later,on august,sent smi its first set of discovery interrogatories,which included the following question 
please describe all products or services offered by defendant or any companies or business entities owned in whole or in part by defendant,michael sakakeeny,or any business associate of either,that relate to the messaging industry.
please produce any and all documents related to such products or services.
at.in its september,response to this first set of interrogatories,smi answered question as follows 
answer smi objects to this interrogatory for the reason that the phrase relate to the messaging industry and the term business associate are vague and ambiguous,and for the further reason that this interrogatory is overly broad,unduly burdensome and seeks the discovery of information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.michael sakakeeny is not a party in this action and does not control smi.without waiving and subject to the foregoing objections,and to the extent this interrogatory can be understood,smi offers business telephone units and message players.smi offers no services other than services in connection with assisting customers select products.
response smi objects to this request for the reason that it is vague,ambiguous,overly broad and unduly burdensome.as written,this request would literally require production of every document in smi possession concerning its business in some way,without regard to whether such business involves allegedly infringing activity in this action.without waiving and subject to the foregoing objections,see documents produced herewith bearing production nos.sm relating to smi and message players.
at.not satisfied with this response,on september,filed a motion to compel smi to answer question by producing all documents that relate to smi messaging products.the following day,the district court addressed this motion in a telephone conference with the parties counsel,but reserved judgment on it so as to give the parties time to work it out.at.despite the district court hope for a mutual resolution of the issue,and smi did not have any further discussions,either before or after the close of the discovery period,regarding request for documents concerning smi messaging products.moreover,as never sought to renew its motion to compel during the pendency of the suit,the district court never issued a ruling on it.
in the meantime,as the action proceeded,an essential component for production of the became unavailable and smi was forced to discontinue the product.in january of,smi replaced its product line with a new product line.as introduced to distributors,the came in two configurations,one which enabled the user to select only one message from among a plurality of messages on a disc to play later labeled as the,and another which allowed the user to create a selection of messages for repeated playback in order later labeled as the while the was available for purchase beginning in january of,appears not to have learned of the existence of the product until march of when it saw the product on display at a trade show.
on may,and smi took part in a settlement conference under the supervision of magistrate judge timothy black.after a full day of negotiation,the parties reached an agreement to settle and terminate the litigation.this agreement was subsequently memorialized in the written settlement agreement,signed by both parties on june.among other things,the settlement agreement granted smi a license to make,use,or sell message players incorporating the technology contained in patents,and provided that smi would pay royalties to with respect to certain defined categories of these message players.in particular,the settlement agreement classified smi message players as either type or type depending on their functionality smi was to pay a royalty for each type player sold and a royalty for each type player sold.in addition to this royalties arrangement,paragraph of the settlement agreement prohibited smi from providing any assistance,monetary or otherwise to other parties against whom might bring actions in the future 
on june,after both parties had signed the settlement agreement,the district court dismissed claims with prejudice,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,but retained jurisdiction over the case so as to enforce the terms of and resolve disputes concerning the settlement agreement.
on december,following a dispute with smi regarding royalty payments sent under the settlement agreement,filed a motion with the district court seeking interpretation of the settlement agreement or,in the alternative,relief from the district court dismissal order under rule b.specifically,requested that the district court interpret the settlement agreement as classifying all of smi products,including the,as type players for purposes of royalties collection.alternatively,argued that it was entitled to relief from the dismissal order under rule b because smi had fraudulently concealed information about its players during the settlement negotiations and because smi attorneys had breached the terms of paragraph of the settlement agreement.
on july,the district court entered an order denying motion.with respect to interpretation argument,the district court found that there was no dispute that smi was not a type player and refused to modify the settlement agreement language so as to bring the within the type definition.turning to rule b argument,the district court held that had failed to produce clear and convincing evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of smi.finally,the district court noted that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a breach of paragraph of the settlement agreement.accordingly,the district court concluded that was not entitled to relief under rule b and denied the motion.
on september,filed this timely appeal.on appeal,has abandoned its argument regarding the interpretation of the settlement agreement and has focused solely on the issue of whether the district court erred in failing to grant relief under rule b.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.browder,of corr.of illinois,d in re ferro.derivative litigation,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it commits a clear error of judgment,such as applying the incorrect legal standard,misapplying the correct legal standard,or relying upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.in re ferro,at.in other words,under this abuse of discretion standard,conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and factual findings are reviewed for clear error.jordan paccar,wl,at cir,unpublished accord united states pauley,cir,cert.denied,d.
rule b sets forth the criteria for determining whether relief from a federal court judgment or order is warranted.it provides 
on motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect newly discovered evidence that,with reasonable diligence,could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party the judgment is void the judgment has been satisfied,released or discharged it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable or any other reason that justifies relief.
b.r elief under rule b is circumscribed by public policy favoring finality of judgments and termination of litigation.blue diamond coal trs.of umwa combined benefit fund,cir internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the party seeking relief under rule b bears the burden of establishing the grounds for such relief by clear and convincing evidence.see crehore united states,cir unpublished citing jordan,wl,at ty softbelly,cir.
argues that it is entitled to relief under rule b for two separate reasons first and foremost,contends that the district court dismissal order should be set aside because smi engaged in fraud,misrepresentation,or misconduct during the settlement negotiations.second,claims that relief from the dismissal order is warranted because smi breached the terms of paragraph of the settlement agreement.we find neither of these arguments to have merit and accordingly hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying rule b motion.
smi alleged fraud in the settlement negotiations 
primary argument in support of rule b relief is that smi committed fraud during the settlement negotiations.in particular,contends that smi failed to fully disclose that it had two versions of its product,one of which was selectable.claims that the failure to disclose this information was fraudulent because smi was under a discovery obligation to disclose it,such information was material to the parties negotiation of the royalty arrangement,and reasonably relied upon this lack of information to its detriment.the district court found these contentions to be unsupported by clear and convincing evidence and denied request for relief.we are unable to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in reaching this result.
fraud argument relies on rule b as a basis for relief.as noted above,this provision allows a district court to grant relief in cases of fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party.b.however,while rule b clearly requires the moving party to show that the adverse party committed a deliberate act that adversely impacted the fairness of the relevant legal proceeding in question,jordan,wl,at,neither the rule itself nor its official commentary provide a specific definition of fraud.likewise,this court and the supreme court have never identified with precision what constitutes fraud for purposes of seeking relief under rule b.see id.at failing to define fraud for purposes of rule b,but indicating that fraud can be interpreted as reaching deliberate omissions when a response is required by law or when the nonmoving party has volunteered information that would be misleading without the omitted material.
following the lead of the district court,the parties seem to presume that the meaning of fraud as used in rule b should be determined by state law.see,at order denying motion for relief from settlement agreement citing ohio cases for the elements of fraud.we find this approach to be misguided the meaning of a federal statute or rule is generally not determined by state law unless the statute or rule so directs.see,taylor united states,d rejecting the notion that the meaning of burglary,for purposes of e,should depend on the definition adopted by the state of the defendant conviction,and instead finding that the term,as used in e,must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes.instead,when a federal statute or rule includes terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress mean t to incorporate the established meaning of those terms.neder united states,d quoting nationwide mut.ins.darden,d accord carter united states,d w e have not hesitated to turn to the common law for guidance when the relevant statutory text does contain a term with an established meaning at common law.standard oil of new jersey united states.w here words are employed in a statute which had at the time a meaning at common law or in the law of this country,they are presumed to have been used in that sense unless the context compels to the contrary.
in light of these considerations,we will,for the purpose of evaluating rule b motions,employ the following general definition of fraud fraud is the knowing misrepresentation of a material fact,or concealment of the same when there is a duty to disclose,done to induce another to act to his or her detriment.see blacks law dictionary ed d fraud and deceit the five traditional elements of fraud include a false representation in reference to a material fact made with knowledge of its falsity with the intent to deceive and on which an action is taken in justifiable reliance upon the representation.moore federal practice b ed.pursuant to rule b,judgments have been set aside on a wide variety of alleged frauds,such as allegations that adverse parties failed to properly respond to discovery requests,thus preventing opposing parties from adequately preparing for trial,to claims that evidence presented at trial itself consisted of perjured testimony or false documents.fraud thus includes deliberate omissions when a response is required by law or when the party has volunteered information that would be misleading without the omitted material.jordan,wl,at accord burger chef systems,cir general common law theories of fraud encompass both acts of commission,a false representation of an existing fact,and acts of omission,failure to disclose material facts when under a duty to do so.accordingly,to establish grounds for relief under rule b,the moving party need not demonstrate that the adverse party has committed all the elements of fraud specified in the law of the state where the federal court is sitting,but rather must simply show that the adverse party conduct was fraudulent under this general common law understanding.
applying this common law notion of fraud to the facts of the instant case demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying request for rule b relief.failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that smi either affirmatively misrepresented the features of its series products or deliberately breached a duty to disclose such information.while claims that smi indicated during the settlement negotiations that the was selectable,and thus a type message statement which would be only partially true given the two different configurations of the record is equivocal on this point.compare at declaration of joey hazenfield,president and chief executive officer during the conference,jim fallon chief financial officer of smi represented or acknowledged,on more than one occasion,that the player was programmable a type player during the conference,i spoke of the player as being programmable.jim fallon never objected or raised an issue about this characterization,with at declaration of jim fallon i did not make any statement that the was programmable or selec
