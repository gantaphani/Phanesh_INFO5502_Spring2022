in this case,we resolve a dispute between two insurance companies over coverage for liability to which ryland mortgage company became exposed.
on may,in los angeles,steve fallen fell down a damaged stairwell in a residential duplex owned by state street bank,seriously injuring himself.he filed suit in california state court against both state street bank and ryland,which state street had retained to manage the property,alleging that the defendants negligently failed to repair the stairway and to warn of its dangerous condition.ryland commenced this action against travelers indemnity company of illinois,its insurer,and against liberty mutual insurance company,state street insurer,to provide it the costs of defending the underlying action in los angeles.travelers thereafter agreed to provide a defense and filed a against liberty mutual for contribution to the costs because,it claimed,ryland was an additional insured under the policy liberty mutual issued to state street.
the district court,ruling on the insurance companies for summary judgment,entered judgment in favor of liberty mutual,concluding that ryland was not an additional insured under liberty mutual policy.the court also concluded that because the management contract between ryland and state street provided that ryland would indemnify state street for liability arising from ryland activities,state street has not undertaken any obligation to insure ryland actions and liberty mutual would thereby have no responsibility.
because ryland concededly managed the duplex for state street,we conclude that it was a real estate manager and therefore an additional insured under the terms of liberty mutual policy.accordingly,we reverse.we reject the district court argument that the contract between ryland and state street somehow abrogated liberty mutual independent contractual obligation to provide coverage to ryland.
in december,bruce stein and mark mintz purchased a residential building located at south holt avenue in los angeles,california.they financed the purchase with a loan from columbia savings and loan,which was secured by a deed of trust on the property.upon columbia savings and loan subsequent failure,its loans were taken over by the resolution trust corporation and thereafter assigned to state street bank as trustee to hold and manage columbia savings and loan loans and deeds of trust.
in an arrangement between the resolution trust corporation acting as conservator of columbia savings and loan association,state street,and ryland,ryland agreed to service the loans pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement referred to hereafter as the pooling agreement.under the pooling agreement,ryland agreed to collect payments from mortgagors and in all other respects to manage the loans for state street.when mortgagors defaulted on their loans,ryland agreed to foreclose on the securing properties,maintain and manage them,and to arrange for their prompt disposition through sale.the pooling agreement provided that ryland was required to arrange for the disposition of a foreclosed property within two years of its acquisition.
a vice president of ryland testified in deposition that when a property was foreclosed upon by ryland,it became owned by state street,and that during the period when state street owned a property through foreclosure,ryland was obligated to manage the property and maintain its value until final disposition.ryland responsibilities included inspecting and securing the property,preventing vandalism and the accumulation of hazardous materials,and hiring a realtor to assess the property and list it at fair market value.the vice president explained that ryland subcontracted some of these property management functions to phh asset management,but in doing so,remained ultimately responsible for the outcome of all those functions and managing that process of property disposition.
when stein and mintz defaulted on their note secured by their holt avenue property in los angeles,ryland as loan servicer foreclosed on the property in april and state street thus became the owner of the property.
on may,while state street was owner of the holt avenue property,steve fallen visited the property and fell down the back staircase,sustaining injuries.he alleged that the rear stairs of the property had been damaged as a result of the northridge earthquake in january and that,at the time of his fall,the damage had still not been repaired.he commenced an action against state street and ryland as state street manager in california state court,alleging a negligent failure to repair the staircase and a negligent failure to warn.
upon being sued by fallen,ryland submitted the lawsuit to its own insurer,travelers,and to state street insurer,liberty mutual,claiming that it was owed a defense as the named insured under the travelers policy and as an additional insured under the liberty mutual policy.when both companies denied coverage,ryland commenced this action in the district of maryland against both insurance companies.travelers shortly thereafter assumed ryland defense in the state proceeding and filed a against liberty mutual in this action to obtain contribution on the ground that ryland was an additional insured under liberty mutual policy.travelers claimed that the liberty mutual policy insured not only state street bank but also any real estate manager of state street bank and that ryland was state street real estate manager.liberty mutual responded by stating that ryland role was the servicing of mortgages,not real estate management.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted liberty mutual motion and denied travelers.applying the law of maryland,the court concluded that travelers had failed to produce evidence that ryland in fact performed as state street real estate manager,stating,
ryland appears to meet the initial threshold to be deemed a real estate manager because its alleged managerial actions appear to have been performed primarily for the benefit of others and not pursuant to a duty arising by operation of law.that,however,does not end the inquiry.this court must examine the particular facts of this case to determine if ryland was a real estate manager as a matter of law.
the court thereafter reasoned that even though the pooling agreement required ryland to manage the property,there was no evidence that ryland actually performed these authorized insurance and foreclosure actions.accordingly,it could not demonstrate that it was in fact a real estate manager for state street,for which state street insurance policy provided coverage.the district court also held that the indemnification provision in the pooling agreement,by which ryland agreed to indemnify state street,was sufficient to demonstrate that state street insurer,liberty mutual,never intended to provide ryland with insurance coverage.the court reasoned that to hold otherwise would require it to construe a contract in which the trustee state street is indemnified by the servicer ryland,who is then indemnified by the trust,as providing for the trustee insurer to cover the expenses of the servicer.the court concluded that interpreting the agreement in that way would yield an absurd or unreasonable result.
from the judgment in favor of liberty mutual,travelers filed this appeal.
the policy issued by liberty mutual,which is the policy at issue in this case,names state street as the named insured and,in a section identified as who is an insured,includes state street executive officers and directors as insureds with respect to their duties as officers and directors.that section also provides 
each of the following is also an insured 
a state street employees,other than state street executive officers,but only for acts within the scope of their employment by state street 
b any person other than state street employee s,or any organization while acting as state street real estate manager.
travelers as subrogee of ryland asserts that ryland is state street real estate manager and therefore is an insured under liberty mutual policy.it argues that the relationship between state street and ryland is defined by the pooling agreement
