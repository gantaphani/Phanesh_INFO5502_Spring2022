percent of west delta oil company shares were held by james ingersoll,and dkccb trust,in equal parts donald muller,president of west delta,held the remaining five percent.west delta hired as counsel ronald hof,who filed a petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on january.there was between muller and ingersoll.muller had accused ingersoll of various acts of mismanagement and,with a voting proxy from dkccb,voted him out of office president and chief operating officer eleven days before west delta filed for bankruptcy.ingersoll moved to dismiss the petition and,on april,west delta retained michael fenasci and perrin butler as special counsel to deal with that motion and other issues relating to ingersoll.butler and fenasci persuaded the bankruptcy court to deny the motion to dismiss 
west delta filed under chapter but made no effort to reorganize.a year later,on january,west delta filed a plan to liquidate.under the plan,all of its assets were to be transferred to crescent oil,an entity wholly owned by donald muller,in exchange for payments over a period by crescent oil to west delta creditors.on february,an outside bidder,petroleum,filed a competing liquidating plan to pay the creditors over four years in exchange for all of west delta assets.on february,a second outside bidder,source energy,filed a competing liquidating plan,but it was later withdrawn.
meanwhile,the chapter proceedings intensified on february,fenasci,as counsel for west delta and its board of directors,by letter to david waguespack,counsel for,threatened a rico suit and pursuit of rule sanctions for supposed allegations made in a motion to terminate use of property filed by fenasci claimed that the motion had misrepresented west delta operations and financial position to creditors and wrongfully implicated muller in mismanagement.on february and,butler,as counsel for west delta and its board of directors,sent letters threatening legal action to persons employed by texaco and conoco,and allegedly working on behalf of source energy.the letters also inquired as to whether texaco and conoco were involved in efforts to take over west delta,and whether these companies approved of their employees actions with respect to west delta.
on february,the bankruptcy court expanded fenasci scope of employment,authorizing him to handle certain matters pertaining to those matters included the plan filed by to take over west delta.subsequently,on march,west delta filed an amended plan providing for payment in full of all creditors and no payment to the equity holders.in its disclosure,west delta described the funding mechanism for its plan as follows 
in order to fund the plan,west delta has negotiated an agreement with crescent oil company,hereinafter crescent to take over operations of the west delta field and to provide funding to pay all creditor claims in full.crescent presently has a line of credit with hibernia national bank in the amount of to be used to pay all creditor claims except the claims of donald muller,who has agreed to subordinate his claims to all other claims.the line of credit is secured by certificates of deposit totaling,which have been pledged by a group of investors.the investors will receive a working interest in the west delta wells as consideration for the investment.debtor estimates the total amount of claims to be paid under the plan to be approximately.
on march,amended its plan to provide that it would pay all creditors in full and would pay in equity for west delta assets.
at a hearing on west delta disclosure statement held before the bankruptcy court on april,hof declined to disclose the identity of the investors who were investing money in the new plan.hof argued that such information was not necessary because the investors would not be officers of the reorganized company in the event that the plan was confirmed,and the creditors would all be paid in full.when pressed to point to some evidence that the line of credit at hibernia national bank was actually established and available,hof noted that he did not have a written document,but he could certainly have it and that the bank had agreed to it.
at a deposition taken on july,muller testified that he had been negotiating with burrwood oil to provide capital to crescent in the form of collateral that would be used to secure a loan from hibernia national bank.he stated that the negotiations were ongoing,that his contact at burrwood oil was a man named chris ezell,and that he had met no one else involved with burrwood.he averred that during the course of negotiations,he had contacted hibernia national bank and been informed that burrwood had a lmost a million dollars in an account there.when asked if burrwood had committed to put up the money for crescent,muller responded that the negotiations with burrwood were almost complete,and that a commitment would be available in time for confirmation of the plan.muller stated that the final detail to be negotiated was the amount of working interest the investors would receive in the west delta well.
on july,west delta withdrew its plan and filed an amended plan increasing the amount to be paid in equity from to.plan was confirmed on july.in connection with the withdrawal of the west delta plan,charles rohm,the treasurer for west delta,sent a letter to hof stating 
regarding our telephone conversation of this afternoon,be advised that the final negotiation of the terms and conditions attendant to our letter of credit have proven to be so egregious as to cause a impasse with no further chance of consummating this trade.also,our attempts to secure additional funding have proved less successful than anticipated.therefore,after careful study of third plan of reorganization,the board of directors of west delta has decided to withdraw its plan of reorganization and fully support plan.please advise counsel for and the court as soon as possible.
on september,butler submitted his first application for compensation,requesting total attorney fees in the amount of for services rendered to west delta from march,to june,fenasci filed his second application for compensation on the same day,requesting attorney fees in the amount of for services rendered from february,through july.fenasci had filed his first application for compensation on february,in which he claimed in attorney fees for services provided to west delta from march,through january.butler billing statement indicated that his work focused on opposing ingersoll motion to dismiss dealing with a creditor claim by marvin engine and opposing ingersoll motion to appoint a trustee in place of the debtor.fenasci billing statements indicated that his work centered on opposing a motion to terminate use of property of estate out of ordinary course of business opposing the motion to appoint trustee opposing the motion to dismiss and dealing with a creditor claim by marvin engine.
filed objections to the applications for compensation,grounding its argument in part on its discovery that butler and fenasci were two of the investors behind burrwood oil.at his deposition,which was introduced into evidence at the bankruptcy court september,hearing on the applications,butler claimed that sometime in may,april,or june of,he floated the idea of putting up money as a passive investor in order to help muller secure financing for crescent.he claimed that no documents were ever signed,and that he just wanted to be there as insurance if muller needed him in order to go forward with the plan.nonetheless,butler and fenasci hired robert haik,a lawyer,to negotiate with muller and then employed a second negotiator,chris ezell,who muller later said was his contact at burrwood oil,when haik fell ill.he also met with a hibernia national bank officer and inquired as to whether a pledge of an unencumbered piece of property worth would be sufficient as security for a proposed loan to crescent.he was informed that such a pledge would be sufficient.
in his deposition,also offered into evidence at the september hearing,fenasci denied the existence of any signed documents evidencing an agreement between burrwood and crescent.he alleged that no agreements were ever reached to post collateral or assist in the provision of financing.fenasci did state that he was part of a loose association of people who were merely waiting and ready should an offer to deal be extended.he asserted that he had no role in the negotiation of terms,as this was handled entirely by haik and ezell.he claimed that the negotiations were all talk and that no deal was ever made.he asserted that no certificates of deposit were pledged in conjunction with the west delta plan.he did concede that there was a bank account at hibernia national bank in the name of burrwood,which was the name used by the loose association of people,and that he had on deposit with the bank.he related that butler discussed pledging a piece of unencumbered property.however,no pledge was ever made because west delta never applied for the loan,and no agreement for financing was ever reached.
at the hearing on the applications held on september,before the bankruptcy court,hof claimed that he did not know who the burrwood investors were,at least not at the time the hearing on the disclosures was held.he testified that he included in the west delta disclosure the statement that crescent had a line of credit for based on information provided by west delta management.he also stated with respect to west delta plan to liquidate to crescent 
the only thing that had to be worked out was the terms and conditions with the burrwood investors.basically,there was sic investors putting up collateral to support the hibernia line of credit to crescent.and that agreement between the investors and crescent is what eventually broke down before confirmation and caused us to withdraw our plan and support the plan.
on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order holding that fenasci and butler failure to disclose their participation in burrwood did not warrant rejection of their fee applications.the court recounted that 
a t one time,burrwood oil company was negotiating to provide collateral to secure a loan to west delta.fenasci and butler agreed,at some time that can not be fixed with any degree of accuracy,to participate as passive investors with other investors in burrwood oil.if called upon to save the debtor from ceasing operations as a result of a failure to file a plan,burrwood oil would have posted collateral so that crescent oil could obtain a line of credit of to fund the debtor plan of reorganization as described in the debtor disclosure statement.these negotiations,however,never came to fruition.both fenasci and butler testified unequivocally that no agreement ever existed between them and burrwood oil,that they never signed anything,never pledged any collateral at the bank,and never acquired an interest in crescent oil.the disclosure statement probably should have disclosed the possible participation of fenasci and butler,and it certainly would have had to have been disclosed at any confirmation hearing on the debtor plan of reorganization 
the court concluded that this failure to disclose could be excused for three reasons 
the tentative plans by fenasci and butler were never reduced to any firm agreement 
the debtor plan and any participation by burrwood oil crescent oil never came on for confirmation and 
fenasci and butler are unfamiliar with bankruptcy law 
the court denied fenasci and butler applications for fees earned after march,because of their failure to disclose claims against west delta in a timely fashion.the court then granted fenasci first fee application in full and granted him on his second fee application.the court denied butler application without prejudice to allow him to attach a list sufficiently detailing the services and dates of those services that he provided.upon rehearing,the bankruptcy court granted butler application for fees incurred before march.
appealed,and the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana dismissed the appeal as premature after the bankruptcy court clarified that its order granting fees was final and appealable,the district court granted motion for reconsideration.on march,the district court held that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by granting untimely fee applications without applying the appropriate legal standard for deciding whether there was cause or excusable neglect.in addition,the district court held that the bankruptcy court failed to inquire properly as to whether butler and fenasci participation in burrwood gave rise to a possible adverse interest to west delta the court reversed and remanded for further consideration.
on remand,the bankruptcy court first applied the factors set forth by the supreme court in pioneer investment services brunswick associates limited and determined that butler and fenasci fee applications were granted properly under the excusable neglect standard the court then turned to examine whether butler and fenasci involvement with burrwood and failure to disclose that involvement warranted denial of their fees.the court first determined that butler and fenasci failure to disclose their involvement with burrwood constituted a violation of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a,requiring an attorney employed under to file a verified statement disclosing his connections with the debtor,creditors,and any other party in interest.the court found that this failure to disclose did not warrant denial of fees,however,because even if butler and fenasci had disclosed their involvement with burrwood,the court would have found that this involvement was not adverse to the west delta estate.
the court observed that under e,an attorney may represent the debtor in bankruptcy proceedings for a specified limited purpose,if it is in the best interest of the estate,and if such attorney does not represent or hold any interest adverse to the debtor or to the estate with respect to the matter on which such attorney is to be employed.the court then noted that great latitude is allowed in assessing conflict of interest qualifications under e and opined that for purposes of determining the qualification of an applicant under e,the court only considers whether an applicant interest is adverse with respect to the matter on which such attorney is to be employed.
turning to the scope of butler and fenasci representation of west delta,the court determined that their defense against ingersoll motion to dismiss was unrelated to their interest in burrwood.further,the court found that even if the matters were sufficiently related to merit a broader inquiry,there was little evidence connecting butler and fenasci to burrwood.finally,the court noted that butler and fenasci defense against the motion actually benefited the bankruptcy estate.the court next found that although fenasci representation of west delta in a matter relating to presented a potential conflict of interest,the contingent and preliminary nature of burrwood existence never gave rise to an actual conflict or an adverse interest.
the court concluded that any adverse interest generated by butler and fenasci involvement with burrwood was directed at,not the bankruptcy estate.based on these determinations,the court held that,in its discretion,the fee applications of butler and fenasci would be granted.appealed this order to the district court,which affirmed the court found that even if the burrwood negotiations were more than preliminary and an actual conflict existed,these facts would not have compelled the bankruptcy court to deny fees.accordingly,the district court held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it granted butler and fenasci fee applications.timely appealed this decision.
on appeal,argues that the bankruptcy and district courts abused their discretion in determining that butler and fenasci involvement with burrwood and failure to disclose such involvement did not warrant denial or reduction of t
