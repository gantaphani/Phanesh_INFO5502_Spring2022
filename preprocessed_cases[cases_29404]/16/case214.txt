tetra financial group,tetra appeals from a judgment granting house of flavors,house of flavors rescission,together with an adjustment payment,of a lease agreement between the parties.reserving further detail for discussion of the merits,the factual background and proceedings below can be briefly summarized.
house of flavors is a company,based in michigan but with its executive office in maine,that makes ice cream its president during the relevant period has been whit gallagher.tetra is a limited partnership that specializes in business equipment leasing.in,house of flavors decided to acquire and install an ice cream hardening system the system.by coincidence,about this time gregory emery,tetra national account executive,inquired whether house of flavors had any projects for which it needed financing.
tetra drafted a letter of intent,which contemplated that tetra would finance the acquisition of the system and its very expensive installation costs including further materials costs,that tetra would hold title to the assembled machine and reap the tax benefits of ownership,and that house of flavors would have an option at the end of a base period to buy the system or to extend or terminate the lease.during the negotiations with emery and with ryan secrist,tetra executive vice president and sales manager,gallagher insisted that he needed a guaranteed maximum price for the purchase.
tetra refused to put a fixed price or at least anything below percent of the total cost of the system as installed into the lease,saying that to do so could compromise its ability to reap the full tax benefits of ownership.on november,house of flavors purchased a suitable machine in a maryland auction for around although the full cost of the system as finally assembled and installed was expected to be much higher,and gallagher informed emery of the purchase on november,
in a conference call with gallagher on november,secrist and emery offered to provide gallagher with a side letter that would reflect a buyout value of percent of the cost of the system and its installation.secrist sent a side letter to gallagher on november,which stated in pertinent part 
pursuant to our conversation,we have reviewed the list of property expected to be purchased and have estimated an end of term value of ten percent of its original cost.please note that this end of term value estimation is not intended to represent a commitment by you,or an obligation by us,to buy or sell the equipment,as the case may be for that,or any other price at the conclusion of the base or extended,if applicable lease term.
shortly after receiving the side letter,gallagher signed the letter of intent and sent it to tetra.
in later conversations,secrist told gallagher that he could not get a deal approved at tetra with a ten percent buyout cap,but assured gallagher that he could get the deal approved at percent.on january,gallagher told secrist that he accepted tetra revised terms and requested that tetra begin preparing lease documents.that same day,tetra sent gallagher a revised side letter,substantively identical to the first except that it estimated an buyout price of percent.
in march,tetra and house of flavors executed a master lease agreement,dated january,which provided in pertinent part that ownership of the system as installed would transfer to tetra,and that at the end of the month lease term,house of flavors 
shall elect one of the following options i purchase the system and associated equipment for a price to be agreed upon by both tetra and house of flavors,ii extend the lease for twelve additional months or iii return the system to tetra at house of flavors expense 
no reference to a fixed price or the percent figure appears in the final agreement,but the agreement did provide for payments by house of flavors during the construction period as tetra was providing loan funds.
from march to august,tetra funded the installation of the system in the house of flavors plant,at a final cost of.on august,house of flavors executed a bill of sale of the system,transferring ownership to tetra.that same day,the parties executed a lease schedule that incorporated the conditions of the master lease agreement and provided that house of flavors would make monthly payments during the lease period.
two years later,in august,gallagher approached tetra about buying out the system early,and on august,tetra informed house of flavors that the price for acquiring the system would be around percent of the original cost of the equipment and installation.confronted with the side letter,tetra eventually lowered the price to percent and later to percent but gallagher would not agree to more than percent and in february house of flavors brought suit in federal district court.
the complaint asserted claims for breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the utah unfair practices act,promissory estoppel and fraud.in december,tetra secured partial summary judgment dismissing all claims save for the last two.while the district judge flatly rejected the claim that there was a contractual agreement for the percent figure,he pointed to the estimate in the final side letter as raising a fraud question,noting that fraud might void the lease 
the district court held a bench trial on april,and,on june,filed a decision finding against house of flavors on the promissory estoppel claim but for it on the fraud claim.on the former,the court rejected the claim that tetra had promised to sell the system back at the percent figure on the latter,the court held that tetra had fraudulently professed to have estimated percent as the price when in fact it had made no estimate whatever.
as an equitable remedy analogous to rescission,the district court sought to unwind the transaction by requiring tetra to transfer title of the system back to house of flavors.the court asked each side to make a further filing to help the court shape the rescission remedy,although given their responses the parties may not have fully understood just what was expected of them what both sides did understand was that the remedy would entail the transfer of the system back to house of flavors.
in all events,house of flavors projected a handsome recovery for itself over and above recapturing title to the system.tetra,by contrast,argued that a full restoration of benefits was an incalculable objective but it supplied some figures useful to the district court.in the end,the court devised its own remedy drawing on the filings and scattered figures appeared in a record that had been compiled primarily to decide the merits rather than the remedy.
ultimately,the court ordered tetra to convey the system to house of flavors and pay it.to arrive at this figure,the court calculated what it thought was the balance due between the parties,assuming that the system passed back to house of flavors based on the percent purchase price and taking account of what tetra had been promised,what it had received,and what was needed to compensate house of flavors for an extra cost it incurred due to tetra delaying the exercise of the purchase option.the court theory and calculation are described in more detail below.
tetra then filed a motion to reconsider,pointing out that the court calculations omitted certain payments that house of flavors had owed under the agreement.if taken into account,tetra said that these amounts meant that it was still due about even if all of the other calculations were accepted.house of flavors said it was too late for tetra to offer new evidence,and the district court agreed,denying the motion.this appeal followed.
the rescission remedy.in this court,tetra first argues that house of flavors switched theories in.it notes that house of flavors complaint,and initial efforts to litigate the case,urged that tetra was bound under contract,promissory estoppel,and related doctrines to sell the assets for percent.such a legal commitment was rejected by the district court in its grant of partial summary judgment for tetra.
therefore,tetra asserts,the complaint did not fairly give warning that rescission would be sought and that house of flav
