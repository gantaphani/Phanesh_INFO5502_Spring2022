exercising diversity jurisdiction under,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ketchings on jessup claims.jessup now appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises out of the sale of a triplex consisting of three residential apartments,units,and,located in the french quarter of new orleans,louisiana.in,ketchings listed the property for.the property,portions of which were over years old,was listed in mint,pristine,and perfect condition.the property disclosure addendum disclosure addendum,signed by ketchings on october,stated that the s eller elect s to sell property as is with full waiver of redhibition rights in act of sale on the disclosure addendum,ketchings checked yes in response to whether the property had ever had termites or other wood destroying organisms.
jessup visited the property on one occasion.thereafter,she negotiated a contract with ketchings to purchase the property,reserving the right to have various inspections performed.on december,she signed an agreement to purchase or sell,offering to purchase the triplex for.she also signed the disclosure addendum,acknowledging that she had read the seller disclosures.
after further negotiations,on december,the parties executed a second agreement to purchase or sell,in which jessup agreed to purchase the triplex for.an addendum to the second agreement explained that the purchase price had been reduced for replacement of the roof on the main building of the triplex and that jessup had ten working days to complete her property inspections.
jessup obtained several reports on the condition of the property.on december,edwin gary wehlen wehlen,the of pest control,inspected the property and prepared a termite inspection report for jessup.the report noted that it was made on the basis of what was visible and accessible at the time of the inspection and cautioned that i f visible evidence of active or previous infestation of listed wood destroying insects is on graph,it should be assumed that some degree of damage is present,visible or not.the report had a check mark next to the statement g et termite history on the home from whomever has the termite contract.this is your responsibility as a purchaser.
in the report,wehlen commented that floor termite damaged and broken tiles,recommended exposing this area for further termite damages.wehlen later explained in an affidavit that his handwritten statement on and tile damage was limited to the kitchen of unit.
on december,jessup also received a property inspection report from consulting engineer michael gurtler of gurtler brothers consultants,gurtler report.the gurtler report cautioned that it can only include visible elements and conditions and does not purport to cover inaccessible areas or hidden damage.it is not intended to replace,supersede or include the contents of a formal disclosure statement and we highly recommend that such a disclosure statement be obtained.the report also noted that b services had the contract for the control of termites on the property,and advised that jessup should contact them to determine the history of termite treatment and any previous infestation of the house.
the gurtler report identified problems with the following areas 
termite damages,identified by pest control in their report dated,were noted to the left front corner of the apartment living room,the wood base at the stairs of apartment,the left front corner of the ceiling in apartment bath,the flooring in apartment bath near the closet and the walls and floors of apartment of the utility area and kitchen.
it recommended that the damage to the walls in the living room of unit be further investigated by removing the effected sic sheetrock and checking the condition of the wood framing behind the sheetrock.it also mentioned damages to the wood and ceramic floors in unit,noting that the ceramic floors are cracked and uneven and that damage may exist to the framing below the ceramic and the framing above the ceiling materials.with respect to these problems,the report suggested that f loors and ceilings should be opened and repaired as necessary.finally,the report noted that d amages to the wood floor in apartment at the front of the refrigerator in the kitchen appear substantial and that t he ceramic floors are also cracked and uneven.it warned that d amages may exist to the framing below the ceramic and the framing.floors should be opened and repaired as necessary.
in the description next to unit which is located on the upper levels of the triplex,the gurtler report stated that t he stairwell plaster is considerably moisture deteriorated.this may be caused by leakage of the parapet walls above or by water wicking or rising from the ground below through the brick walls.the report noted moisture damage in unit on the ceilings of the rear bedroom and bathroom,as well as on the right wall of the breakfast room.the report also explained that much of the plumbing system is underground or behind the walls and is therefore not visible for inspection.
on december,jessup submitted to ketchings a property condition clause response,which identified the problems disclosed by the and gurtler reports,and asked ketchings to comply with an addendum prepared by dorian bennett,bennett addendum.the bennett addendum stated in relevant part 
apt,further investigate damages to walls as recommended.have interior inspected by gurtler and pest control when wall is opened,and repaired treated as per their specifications.
apt,further investigate damage to wood floors,have inspected by gurtler and when opened,and repaired treated as per their specifications.
apt,further investigate damages to the wood floor in kitchen,have inspected by gurtler and when opened,and repaired treated as per their specifications.
ketchings did not want to comply with the bennett addendum instead,he initially offered to reduce the purchase price of the triplex by an additional.on january,the parties agreed that ketchings would not be responsible for the work identified in the bennett addendum.in exchange,the parties negotiated that jessup would be credited toward the purchase price.
on january,b services,the company that had performed termite extermination on the property since may,and that had a termite contract on the property through october,provided jessup with a wood destroying insect report wdir.the wdir had a check mark next to the box stating v isible evidence of wood destroying insects was observed,and noted,in the space provided for e vidence found and its location that scaring sic on stud in closet of unit upstairs common wall.the report also stated that v isible evidence of damage due to sub termites has been observed in the following areas studs in closet of unit upstairs common wall front corner.the wdir cautioned that i f there is any evidence of wood destroying insects in the structure s inspected,it must be assumed that there is some damage.the terms and conditions section of the wdir further warned that 
i f there is evidence of active infestation or past infestation of termites other wood destroying insects it must be assumed that there is some damage to the building caused by this infestation,even if the damage is not visible to the inspector as of the date of the inspection.
jessup signed the wdir,indicating she had received an original copy.
on january,the parties executed the act of sale.the act of sale reflected a final purchase price of.it did not include the waiver of redhibition language contained in the disclosure addendum.
after taking possession of the property,jessup discovered extensive damage which she claims was not disclosed during her inspections.jessup found termite damage in units and to certain floors,walls,windows,and ceilings jessup also discovered a broken roof drain pipe located in the wall of unit,resulting in water leaking into and under that unit.the broken roof drain pipe resulted in damage to the foundation of the property and in erosion of soils under unit and the sidewalk and porch of the property 
on january,jessup brought an action in louisiana state court against ketchings to recover for the redhibitory defects,seeking quanti minoris damages for a reduction in the purchase price of the property based on the termite and broken roof drain pipe damage.ketchings removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction under.thereafter,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ketchings on both of jessup claims.the district court held that jessup could not recover for the termite damage to the property because the report placed jessup on notice of termite damage and the presence of active termites,and that such notice required jessup to further investigate the extent of the damage.the court also held that jessup could not recover for the water damage to the property resulting from the broken roof drain pipe because her complaint did not state a claim for the defect.
on february,jessup filed a motion for a new trial.jessup argued that the district court erred in finding that the report contained evidence of live termite activity because the report actually indicated that there were no active termites.jessup also maintained that the district court should have addressed her claim for damages caused by the broken roof drain pipe because that issue was preserved in the joint order signed by both parties and constituted a separate and independent basis for redhibitory relief.
on july,the district court granted in part jessup motion and amended its february,order and reasons.the district court,however,stood by its conclusion that summary judgment in favor of ketchings was appropriate.the district court held that although the report did not indicate active termites,jessup nevertheless was aware of past termite damage and had an obligation to further investigate.the district court also held that the water and moisture damage noted in the gurtler report placed jessup on notice that the possibility of the broken roof drain pipe existed,and that jessup failed to further investigate the problem.the district court concluded that because the inspection reports placed jessup on notice of the termite and roof drain pipe problems prior to the sale and because she failed to further investigate the problems,she waived her right to sue for a reduction in the purchase price based on the damage.
jessup filed this timely appeal,challenging the district court grant of summary judgment on both claims.this court has jurisdiction over the district court final judgment pursuant to.

iii.discussion 
louisiana law on redhibitory defects 
under louisiana law,the seller of a home impliedly warrants to the buyer that the property is free from redhibitory defects or vices.ann.a defect is redhibitory when it renders the property useless,or renders its use so inconvenient that it must be presumed that a buyer would not have purchased the property had she known of the defect.id.such a defect gives the buyer the right to obtain rescission of the sale.id.a defect also is redhibitory,entitling the buyer to recover quanti minoris damages for a reduction in the purchase price of the property,when,without rendering the property totally useless,the defect diminishes the property utility or its value so that it must be presumed that a buyer would still have purchased the property but for a lesser price.see lindy,lp shakertown,cir.
not all redhibitory defects justify a rescission of the sale or a reduction in the price.defects in the property that were known to the buyer at the time of the sale,or defects that should have been discovered through a simple inspection of the property,are excluded from the seller legal warranty.ann.see amend mccabe,so d.stated differently,when the defect complained of is partially apparent,the buyer who,nevertheless,purchases the thing without further investigation must be held to have waived his right to sue in quanti minoris.pursell kelly,so d.
simple inspection involves more than a casual observation.amend,so d at stating that a simple inspection is an examination of the article by the buyer with a view of ascertaining its soundness.rather,it requires the buyer who observes defects to conduct further investigation as would be conducted by a reasonably prudent buyer acting under similar circumstances.whether an inspection is reasonable depends upon the facts of the case.lemaire breaux,so d.
jessup redhibitory defect claims 
termite damage claim 
jessup argues that the termite damage in units and was concealed and none of the property inspectors discovered the extent of the damage prior to the sale.jessup contends that the district court erred in holding that she was required to further investigate based on the termite damage identified in the reports to other areas of the triplex.jessup also claims that ketchings is a bad faith seller in failing to disclose the termite damage.
ketchings responds that jessup acknowledged in her deposition that she received the reports and was aware of the termite damage listed in the reports,including the wdir.according to ketchings,if the buyer obtains information from an inspector evidencing some damage,the buyer decision to forego further inspection operates as a waiver of a more substantial problem that is later revealed.we agree.
louisiana law makes clear that when some of the damage is detectable by a simple inspection,the buyer has a duty to investigate further.amend,so d at.if the buyer chooses to purchase the property without further investigation,she waives the right to sue for rescission of the sale or a reduction in the purchase price based on later discovered damage.id.
in brandao mcmahon,so d,the louisiana appellate court faced a case with similar facts and issues.there,the buyers received a property disclosure form indicating that there was termite damage to the property.id.at.additionally,the buyers signed a wdir,disclosing that the property had visible evidence of wood destroying insects.id.after moving in and discovering extensive termite and water damage behind the walls,the buyers filed a redhibitory action against the sellers,seeking a reduction in the purchase price.id.the buyers contended that the property inspectors did not find any termite damage out of the ordinary and did not recommend an inspection behind the walls where the damage was eventually discovered.id.at.the buyers argued that their knowledge of some termite damage did not prohibit them from recovering in redhibition.id.at.
the louisiana court disagreed.it pointed out that all of the inspection reports revealed some type of damage to the property,including active termites and evidence of termite damage.id.at.the court determined that e vidence of shoddy work and reports of damage of any kind should have prompted a reasonably prudent buyer to further investigate the damage and perhaps conduct further inspections in order to obtain more professional opinions.id.at.according to the court,the buyers had a duty to perform further inspections once the home inspections revealed damage.their failure to do so indicates a tacit acceptance evidencing that they were willing to purchase the property as the inspections revealed without further investigation.id.at.
we find brandao on point and persuasive.here,similar to brandao,the termite damage was not entirely concealed.rather,all of the reports made available to je
