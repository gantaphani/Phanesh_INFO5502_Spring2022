rachel lambert mellon is the former owner of a large tract of land near both slater land and miss brennan foxmount farm.slater leased a portion of this property the mellon property with his cousin until early.
on october,maureen brennan called robert slater.there is no evidence that miss brennan and slater were acquaintances before this call took place.miss brennan asked slater if he would rent out to her a portion of his land adjoining miss brennan foxmount farm so she could use the extra space for her horses.slater told miss brennan that he was not interested in renting out his farmland.slater also told miss brennan that he was a real estate broker,that he was leasing as a tenant adjoining land on the mellon property,and that he believed the mellon property was about to go on the market.slater offered to show the land to miss brennan in his capacity as agent for slater son.
on october,miss brennan called slater and retained him to work on purchasing the mellon property.several days later,slater met miss brennan and her mother,patricia brennan,at his office at slater son,and took them to inspect the land.slater spent around one and a half hours showing miss brennan and her mother the property and providing them with details including the location of springs on the property.slater and the brennans returned to slater office,and miss brennan asked slater to provide comparable sales data and a tax plat showing the locations of other properties relative to the mellon land.miss brennan told slater she wanted the information because her father,donald brennan,wanted to review it.
on october,slater faxed to miss brennan the information she requested.the fax was on letterhead that stated slater son,real estate agency.slater also obtained and furnished to miss brennan and her family copies of soil and topographic maps,aerial photographs of the land,and copies of the deed,deed restrictions,and covenants on the property.
the following day,miss brennan asked slater if he would show her another piece of property adjoining the mellon property because,she explained,her boyfriend was interested in purchasing that property as well.after examining that property miss brennan told slater her boyfriend would not be interested.
about a week later,miss brennan contacted slater and arranged for slater to show her the mellon property again,this time with both her mother and father.when the group returned to slater office at slater son,they discussed making an offer to purchase the property.slater told miss brennan that the custom in virginia was for the buyer real estate agent to prepare the contract which is then reviewed by the buyer attorney.
at this point the mellon property was still not listed for sale,but slater knew that a real estate agent,babette scully,was working for miss mellon to finalize a listing.slater contacted miss scully several times to inquire about the status of the listing.on november,the mellon property was formally listed for sale on the multiple listing service.miss scully was identified as the listing agent.around the same time,slater spoke with miss scully and was told that miss mellon had identified the brennans as an exclusion to the listing agreement,meaning that if any of the brennans purchased the property,miss scully would not receive her commission.
slater then began trying to contact miss brennan but miss brennan never returned any of his calls.slater also faxed the listing to miss brennan with a letter seeking to arrange a meeting.shortly after these events,slater received a call from an attorney representing miss brennan.the attorney told slater that miss brennan was unavailable to talk with slater and that the attorney was now representing her in these matters.
