appellants collectively,distributors appeal the district court final judgment confirming and entering judgment on the arbitration award.appellants seek reversal of the district court judgment and vacatur of the arbitration award,reversal of the district court prior order compelling arbitration,and remand for a trial.they argue five issues on appeal the district court erred by not vacating the arbitration award due to the arbitrator evident partiality and bias the district court erred by compelling arbitration since the arbitration agreement was not valid and enforceable due to amway retention of a unilateral right to modify it the district court erred by compelling arbitration since the arbitration agreement was unconscionable the district court erred by compelling arbitration even if the agreement was valid and enforceable because the arbitration agreement did not cover all of the distributors asserted claims and the district judge lacked jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award.
context facts and proceedings 
the disputes comprising the core of this appeal have been in contention for more than ten years,and have been heard in several courts and other dispute resolution fora.distributors complaints center upon their relationships with appellee amway corporation and distributorships within amway corporation collectively,amway,a multinational seller of household products in existence since.amway distributes products by means of a vast network of independent distributors who,in turn,continuously recruit new distributors also called all distributors in this case were in the of the distributor appellee dexter yager.
based on their success selling products,distributors may earn entry into particular levels,with the diamond level being among the highest levels of success.many of the distributors worked as distributors,regarding amway as their sole source of income.distributors earn their income based on commissions from their own sales and those generated by their.in order to distribute amway products,every amway distributor signs amway standard distributorship agreement,which confer s a right to distribute amway products,and the right to receive sales commissions or bonuses on any products sold,for a period of one year.among other things,the distributor agrees to pay an annual fee and to abide by amway code of ethics and rules of conduct as amended and published from time to time in official amway literature.this agreement must be renewed annually,no later than december for the following calendar year.many distributors renew automatically while others submit a renewal form each year entitled notice of intent to continue.business support materials bsm complement the amway network,and consist of rallies,tapes,books,and functions designed to motivate distributors.
in june,according to the essentially undisputed showing in this respect of the distributors,the disputes at the heart of this case,which had been festering for some time,came to a head among other things,distributors complained about how profits were determined regarding sales of bsm materials.
in september,amway informed distributors it was amending the rules of conduct to include an arbitration program,communicating through publication in its official magazine,the amagram,and other media sent directly to distributors.the arbitration provision,added to the rules of conduct,provided for arbitration for any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to an amway distributorship,the amway sales and marketing plan,or the amway rules of conduct including any claim against another amway distributor,or any such distributor officers,directors,agents or employees,or against amway corporation,or any of its officers,directors,agents or employees.the acknowledgment form mailed to the automatic renewal distributors,containing information of the newly installed arbitration program,also stated,inter alia because of some recent changes to the intent to continue renewal form as well as the introduction of the new business support material arbitration agreement bsmaa,we need you to review the changes and sign the acknowledgment on the back of this letter.while these changes automatically become part of your agreement with amway,we wanted to make sure you are aware of them.the announcements also included a separate,optional bsm arbitration agreement.the parties disagree as to whether the distributors needed to sign and return an acknowledgment form before october,in order to be considered subject to the arbitration agreement.there is no dispute that all distributors renewed their distributorship agreements after amway gave notice of implementation of the arbitration program.
on january,a group of distributors the morrison group sued amway and other defendants including dexter yager in texas state court alleging a number of federal and state law claims,ranging from defamation to rico.amway and the other defendants on february,timely removed the case to the district court under b,and then filed a motion to stay the suit pending arbitration.distributors argued against the stay,contending,inter alia,that the arbitration agreement was not binding on them.on october,the district court granted amway motion and stayed the suit pending arbitration.morrison amway,d 
while all this transpired in federal district court,another group of distributors the hamilton group,shortly after removal of the morrison group state suit,filed a state court action against amway and other defendants with substantially similar state law claims as those of the morrison group but lacking all the federal causes of action.thereafter,on july,the morrison group joined the hamilton group in the second state suit.amway moved in the state court to stay the proceedings in that suit pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement.approximately one month after the federal district court stayed its proceedings,the state court stayed the state litigation pending arbitration of the hamilton group claims.the state court abated the morrison group claims because they were already sub judice in federal court,and the claims were subsequently dismissed for want of prosecution by the state court on october.
on may,the distributors requested arbitration under the arbitration agreement.on june,amway and other defendants filed counterclaims in the arbitration.on august,the distributors filed a motion for summary disposition in the arbitration,contending,inter alia,that there was no valid agreement to arbitrate,that if there were such an agreement it did not apply,or could not properly apply,to disputes,such as those involved in the instant proceeding,which arose and were and known to amway prior to the september amendment to amway rules of conduct which introduced the arbitration program and,further,that the arbitration program is inherently unfair because amway selected and trained the arbitrators and hold s the exclusive power to remove unwanted arbitrators.amway and the other defendants filed a response and their own motion for summary disposition.on october,the arbitrator anne gifford denied without explanation both motions for summary disposition.
jams,the arbitration services provider for amway,provided the parties with the names and biographical information of five neutrals who had completed the training course for arbitrators offered by,and conducted by amway and the amway distributors association,ada.from among those so listed,the parties ultimately selected anne gifford to arbitrate the dispute and she was appointed as arbitrator june.on october,gifford disclosed to the parties that she had attended a training session conducted by amway and had subsequently conducted mediation training of certain amway employees.gifford held a teleconference with the parties where she invited any questions about her training.following the teleconference,gifford and jams requested that any concerning gifford service as arbitrator be raised by october.however,none were forthcoming from any party.
after allowing discovery,a evidentiary hearing from january,in houston,texas,and briefs,gifford on january,ruled in favor of the distributors on all of amway claims and in amway favor on all of distributors claims fees and costs were awarded to each prevailing party,thereby resulting in an award of million to amway offset by an award to distributors of million the ruling in common with all others in this arbitration contains no analysis and states no reasons.distributors on january,moved in the district court to vacate the award alleging,inter alia,gifford evident partiality and corruption as well as the unenforceability of the arbitration agreement.on march,amway and the other defendants moved the district court to confirm the award and enter judgment on it.the district court,after a largely hearing on may,allowed discovery on the matter of gifford alleged partiality,but on september,after filings by the parties as to the discovery results,ultimately denied the motion to vacate and confirmed the award.distributors moved for rehearing on september,which the district court denied without a hearing on october.distributors thereafter timely filed their notice of appeal to this court.
discussion 
the distributors assert,among other complaints on appeal,that the district court erred in its october,order staying their suit pending arbitration.the parties do not dispute the applicability of the federal arbitration act.this court reviews de novo the grant or denial of a motion to compel arbitration.fleetwood enterprises,gaskamp,cir 
in this respect,the distributors contend,among other things,that the district court erred by compelling arbitration because an enforceable arbitration agreement never existed.there is no disagreement that there was a written arbitration policy in effect between the distributors and amway at the time the suit was filed.however,distributors claim the arbitration agreement was not valid and enforceable for several reasons including the following.distributors argue that the provision in the distributorship agreement that the distributor agreed to comply with the amway sales and marketing plan,code of ethics,and rules of conduct as they are amended and published from time to time in official amway literature,by virtue of which amway in september amended its rules of conduct to for the first time include provisions for arbitration which provisions amway claims are applicable to disputes,such as those alleged in the instant lawsuit,which arose out of events occurring before the referenced september rules of conduct amendment,renders the arbitration agreement contained in the distributorship agreements illusory,lacking in consideration,and unenforceable.this,the distributors assert,is because amway,by virtue of its power to thus amend the rules of conduct,could unilaterally repeal or amend the arbitration provisions so that they were inapplicable even as to disputes,such as those here involved,of which amway was aware and that arose out of events occurring prior to such an amendment.
the federal policy favoring arbitration does not apply to the determination of whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.fleetwood enterprises,at.that determination is generally made on the basis of ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.id.quoting first options of chicago kaplan,d.as did the district court,d at,we make that determination based on texas law,which is the law of the forum,there having been no showing that the law of any other arguably more appropriate state materially differs in respect to the present issue.
every distributor in entering his or her annual contract with amway agreed 
to conduct his or her business according to the amway code of ethics and rules of conduct,as they are amended and published from time to time in official amway literature 
i agree i will give notice in writing of any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to my amway distributorship,or the amway sales and marketing plan or rules of conduct to the other party or parties i will then try in good faith to resolve the dispute using the amway conciliation and enforcement procedures contained in the rules of conduct for amway distributors.if the claim or dispute is not resolved to his or her satisfaction within days,or after the amway conciliation process is complete,whichever is later,i agree to submit any remaining claim or dispute arising out of or relating to any amway distributorship,the amway sales and marketing plan,or the amway rules of conduct to binding arbitration in accordance with the amway arbitration rules,which are set forth in the amway business compendium.
there is no express exemption of the arbitration provisions from amway ability to unilaterally modify all rules,and the only express limitation on that unilateral right is published notice.while it is inferable that an amendment thus unilaterally made by amway to the arbitration provision would not become effective until published,there is nothing to suggest that once published the amendment would be inapplicable to disputes arising,or arising out of events occurring,before such publication.
in in re halliburton,an employee sued his employer in claiming that his demotion during was based on race and age discrimination.in november the employer had sent all employees written notice that if they continued their employment after january,they would be governed by the arbitration program included with the notice.the texas supreme court held that the employee,who had continued his employment past january,after receiving the notice in,was required to arbitrate his claim against his employer.the employee asserted that the arbitration program was illusory because the company retained the right to modify or discontinue it.the supreme court rejected that contention stating 
but the program also provided that no amendment shall apply to a dispute of which the sponsor halliburton had actual notice on the date of amendment.as to termination,the plan stated that termination shall not be effective until days after reasonable notice of termination is given to employees or as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.therefore,halliburton can not avoid its promise to arbitrate by amending the provision or terminating it altogether.accordingly,the provision is not illusory.id.at emphasis added.
the texas supreme court again addressed a similar issue in davidson webster.there,the employee,webster,was injured on the job in november,filed a worker compensation claim and shortly thereafter was terminated.he then sued his employer,davidson,claiming his discharge was wrongful as being in retaliation for his filing the worker compensation claim.davidson claimed it was entitled to arbitrate pursuant to a written agreement webster signed when he was hired by davidson in december.the first paragraph of the agreement dealt with arbitration the second and longer paragraph largely dealt with a number of other employment related matters and stated in its next to last sentence that the company reserves the right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.id.at.the supreme court held that the contract was ambiguous with respect to whether the above quoted sentence of the second paragraph applied to the arbitration agreement contained in the first paragraph,and thus remanded the case to the trial court to resolve that ambiguity.id.at.the court plainly held that if the retained the right to unilaterally abolish or modify the arbitration program,then the agreement to arbitrate was illusory and not binding on the the court expressly distinguished halliburton by noting that the contract there stated that any such amendment to the arbitration program would apply prospectively only and that t he termination provision in this case does not contain similar limitations.id.at.the court also stated that most courts that have considered this issue have held that if a party retains the unilateral,unrestricted right to terminate the arbitration agreement,it is illusory.id.at citing numerous cases 
other texas authorities are in accord.in re news,christi,no writ,involved an employee one page agreement stating he and the employer have agreed to submit all claims or disputes between us to binding a
