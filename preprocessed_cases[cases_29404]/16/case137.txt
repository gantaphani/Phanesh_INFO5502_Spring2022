jeremy weiss was a rising star at dhl express,dhl until his termination in september,ostensibly for his failure to properly investigate,document,and ameliorate the misconduct of an employee under his supervision.the termination occurred just months before weiss was to receive a bonus.weiss filed suit in massachusetts state court to recover the bonus on the grounds that he was terminated without good cause,which under the terms of the bonus plan entitled him to a full payout.he asserted breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,detrimental reliance,unjust enrichment,and violation of the massachusetts wage act.dhl removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds.the court allowed a single cause of action to go to the jury a straightforward claim.the jury found for weiss.dhl main claim on appeal is that the court erroneously allowed the jury to independently determine whether good cause existed for weiss termination because the bonus plan reserved this determination for a committee of the company.in his,weiss challenges the grant of summary judgment to dhl on his wage act claim and the denial of his attorney fees.we reverse the jury verdict and affirm the summary judgment order.
the relevant facts are undisputed.in,dhl,an international express mail services company,acquired airborne express,a package delivery company operating in the united states.weiss,who had been employed at airborne express since,continued his employment at dhl as district sales manager for downtown boston.he was promoted within a year to the post of regional sales director in charge of overseeing a number of sales districts in the northeast,including brooklyn,new york.the following year,dhl named him regional sales director of the year.weiss was then elevated to the position of director of national accounts in august.he remained in that position until his termination two years later.
a.the bonus plan 
in december,dhl informed weiss that it had selected him to participate in the company commitment to success bonus plan the plan.under the plan,weiss became eligible for a bonus if he remained with the company through the end of,and a bonus if dhl met its performance objectives in.the employment benefits committee the committee of the company was given broad authority to administer the plan 
the committee shall have full power and discretionary authority to interpret the plan,make factual determinations,and to prescribe,amend and rescind any rules and to make any other determinations and take such other actions as the committee deems necessary or advisable in carrying out its duties under the plan.any action required of the committee under the plan shall be made in the committee sole discretion and not in a fiduciary capacity and need not be uniform as to similarly situated individuals.the committee administration of the plan,including all such rules and regulations,interpretations,selections,determinations,approvals,decisions,delegations,amendments,terminations and other actions,shall be final,conclusive and binding on the company,the participant,and any other persons having or claiming an interest hereunder.
the committee could delegate its functions to a subcommittee or to one or more individuals.it also reserved the right to amend or terminate the plan.
in october,weiss received notice that some adjustments to the plan were made in order to better reflect our changing work environment.under the amended plan,weiss was still eligible to receive,but no portion of it was tied to the company performance.instead,the entire bonus was now contingent on continued employment through the end of,with weiss performance remaining in good standing.the first installation of was payable in january and the remaining in january.in the event that dhl terminated him without cause and eliminated his position,weiss would receive the full payout upon termination.if he voluntarily left dhl or if terminated for good cause prior to the payment dates,he would be ineligible for the bonus.
dhl paid weiss the first installment of the bonus in january.when he was terminated in september,dhl refused to pay the remaining on the basis that his termination was for good cause.
b.the termination 
in,while weiss was still regional sales director,dhl shifted the brooklyn district to another regional sales director,christopher cadigan.following the organizational change,cadigan informed weiss that sergio garcia,a sales representative in brooklyn,had incorrectly set up rates on a customer account.weiss and cadigan discussed the billing issue with their boss,vice president of sales david katz,and garcia supervisor,district sales manager michael gargiles.they agreed that cadigan would work with garcia to fix the issue.although he no longer had oversight over garcia,weiss was in the brooklyn area on other business and offered to speak to him.
at that meeting,which gargiles also attended,weiss warned garcia that his conduct could result in disciplinary action,including termination.he also instructed garcia to work with the pricing team to correct the billing issue.weiss followed up with katz and cadigan,informing them of his warning to garcia.although the company handbook for managers provided that verbal warnings must be documented,weiss was unaware of the policy.neither he nor gargiles documented the warning to garcia,nor did they inform the human resources department of the warning.
several months later,cadigan received a customer complaint regarding one of its competitors receiving shockingly low dhl rates.cadigan conducted an investigation and found that several sales representatives in brooklyn had extended unauthorized rates to certain customers by circumventing company procedures.he reported this to vice president of sales jonathan routledge apparently katz successor.routledge and cadigan interviewed a group of six representatives,including garcia,about using rogue rates.three representatives resigned rather than face disciplinary action.as there was no concrete evidence linking garcia to the dishonest activities,he only received a suspension which the human resources department apparently rescinded as unauthorized and then was transferred to the sales district in long island.weiss,who at this time was director of national accounts,was involved neither in cadigan investigation nor in the decision to discipline garcia.
the unauthorized practice of selling rogue rates continued in the new york area.in october,the company loss prevention department launched an investigation into the matter and discovered that the scheme had resulted in a loss to dhl in alone.during the course of the investigation,fraud manager scott kamlet interviewed cadigan and routledge and learned about their investigation of the very same issue.he then gathered information implicating garcia in the unauthorized practice and attempted to interview him.after garcia refused to cooperate,kamlet recommended that he be terminated.in his recommendation,kamlet stated that garcia had received a verbal warning from weiss in for similar unauthorized actions and that it was kamlet belief that garcia supervisors did not know the extent of garcia misconduct at the time of this warning.
kamlet recommendation apparently was not enough for garcia to lose his job.in april,weiss received a customer complaint alleging that garcia was asking customers to pay kickbacks in exchange for receiving preferential shipping rates.the customer threatened to go public with the information.weiss immediately forwarded the complaint to his superiors.a few days later,garcia resigned.
dhl responded to the allegation by retaining attorney kenneth thompson to conduct an investigation.in addition to confirming the kickbacks allegation,thompson also found that garcia and several other representatives in brooklyn had engaged in various improper sales practices during the preceding years,including while weiss was in charge of the district.specifically,thompson reported that the billing issue that precipitated weiss verbal warning to garcia involved an unauthorized shipping rate extension.thompson informed dhl of weiss management failures relating to his
