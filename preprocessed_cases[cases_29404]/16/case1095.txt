opinion of the court 
before us are arising from the reduction of a million punitive damages verdict to million.the district court ordered the reduction on the ground that the verdict was constitutionally excessive.defendants sunrise assisted living management,and sunrise assisted living,collectively,sunrise contend that the reduced verdict is still unconstitutional and seek a further reduction.in a,plaintiff cgb occupational therapy,cgb challenges the district court reduction of the verdict and seeks either reinstatement of the original verdict or some enhancement of the reduced verdict.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the district court remittitur order and remand the case with instructions to enter a new judgment for punitive damages in the amount of.cgb will be dismissed.
this case is before us for the second time,following a second jury trial.it is,as we said on the first,a case that has been characterized by its contentious history.cgb occupational therapy,rha health,cir cgb i.since we have previously set forth the facts in detail,the following factual recitation is limited to the background necessary for our ruling.
cgb is a provider of rehabilitation therapy services in care and facilities.beginning in,cgb contracted with a company known as rha pennsylvania nursing homes rha to provide physical,occupational,and speech therapy to residents at two nursing home facilities owned by rha,the pembrooke facility and the prospect park facility.cgb agreements with rha contained an clause providing that,in the event cgb was terminated as the provider of therapy services,the pembrooke and prospect park facilities would not,for a period of twelve months,seek to hire or contract with therapists employed by cgb.
at all times relevant to this case,sunrise managed rha pembrooke and prospect park facilities.in,the federal medicare program altered its process for reimbursing care facilities for therapy services provided to residents.under the revised process,rha claimed that it was more difficult to pay cgb,and,on june,at rha direction,sunrise notified cgb in writing that rha intended to terminate its contracts with cgb,effective september.almost immediately after giving that notice,sunrise,again acting on behalf of rha,executed agreements with another provider of therapy services,symphony health services,symphony,to retain symphony as the new therapy provider at both the pembrooke and prospect park facilities,effective october.
what followed is central to this bitter legal contest.sunrise prospect park administrator,marjorie tomes,met with certain cgb therapists at the end of july.she did so despite the clause in rha contracts with cgb and despite direct admonitions by both rha and cgb that no such meeting should occur.during that meeting,tomes informed the therapists that cgb contracts with rha had been terminated because cgb could not comply with medicare changes.she made that representation even though cgb owner,cindy brillman,had repeatedly told her that cgb could comply with the medicare requirements and could continue to be competitive in providing therapy services.tomes also told the therapists that symphony would replace cgb as the therapy contractor,and that they might have employment opportunities with symphony.she polled the therapists for their interest in pursuing employment with symphony,wrote down the names of those who replied in the affirmative,and proceeded to facilitate symphony hiring of cgb therapists.
in september,cgb brought this action against sunrise and other defendants,alleging claims under pennsylvania law for,among other things,tortious interference with cgb contractual relationships both with its therapists and with rha.the jury in the first trial found that sunrise had indeed tortiously interfered with cgb contractual relationship with its therapists,and returned a compensatory damages verdict in the amount of on that claim.the jury also found that sunrise had tortiously interfered with cgb contractual relationship with rha,and returned compensatory damages in the amount of on that claim.the jury awarded punitive damages to cgb in the amount of million,but the verdict did not specify how the punitive damages award was allocated between the two claims of interference.
on the first appeal,we affirmed the jury verdict against sunrise for tortious interference with cgb contractual relationship with its therapists,but we reversed the verdict of tortious interference with cgb contractual relationship with rha.see cgb i,at because the jury had awarded million in punitive damages without differentiating between the two acts of interference by sunrise,we noted that it is impossible to determine how punitive damages should be allocated in light of our determination that sunrise could not have interfered with the contract between cgb and rha.id.at.consequently,we reversed the punitive damages determination and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial on the question of punitive damages.id.at.
sunrise evidently had a watch what you wish for experience when,at the second trial,the jury awarded cgb million in punitive damages on the claim that sunrise had tortiously interfered with cgb contractual relationship with its therapists.sunrise thereafter moved to reduce the punitive damages award,arguing that the million penalty was constitutionally excessive.after considering the guideposts for judicial review of punitive damages as articulated in bmw of,gore,d,and as amplified by state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d,the district court reduced the award to million.these followed.the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the final judgment pursuant to.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.campbell,at.in determining whether a punitive damages award comports with due process courts must consider three guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.id.at.citing gore,at.we review the constitutionality of the punitive damages award de novo,but we must accept any findings of fact made by the district court,unless they are clearly erroneous.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.we conclude that the million award remains constitutionally excessive and must be further reduced.because we agree with the district court that the third guidepost set forth in the gore and campbell cases,the disparity between the punitive damages award and comparable civil penalties,is not instructive here,see inter med.supplies,ebi med,cir finding third guidepost unhelpful in case involving tortious interference and related common law tort claims,our discussion is confined to the first two guideposts,namely the degree of reprehensibility and the disparity between the harm and the award.
degree of reprehensibility 
the supreme court has recognized that the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct is t he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.campbell,at.quoting gore,at.in evaluating the degree of sunrise reprehensibility in this case,we must consider whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.id.
the district court found that three of the five reprehensibility subfactors were present in this case cgb was financially vulnerable sunrise actions involved repeated misconduct and sunrise acted intentionally.we agree with the district court that the financial vulnerability subfactor weighs in favor of finding sunrise conduct reprehensible.cgb was a small company which operated out of brillman home and only employed approximately twenty therapists.at the time tomes met with cgb therapists,she knew that cgb was in a financially vulnerable position because rha owed cgb in back payments.she also knew that her successful recruitment of cgb therapists would further decimate cgb business.
we also agree with the district court that sunrise intentionally inflicted harm on cgb,which further increases the culpability of sunrise conduct.the evidence shows that tomes met with cgb therapists despite express warnings from both brillman and sunrise own principal,rha,not to do so.at the meeting,tomes told the therapists that cgb contracts with rha had been terminated because cgb was unable to comply with medicare changes and that cgb could not compete with symphony,even though brillman had told tomes several times that cgb could,in fact,comply with the medicare changes and tomes otherwise had no reason to believe that cgb could not compete with symphony.as a result of tomes misstatements,cgb therapists began to fear for their jobs and distrust their employer,and they were thus more inclined to respond favorably to tomes recruitment efforts.although brillman quickly confronted tomes about her misconduct,tomes continued to assist symphony in its recruitment of cgb therapists,even providing symphony with access to a conference room at the prospect park facility for the purpose of interviewing cgb therapists.in sum,the evidence amply supports a finding that sunrise conduct was intentionally harmful,rather than merely accidental.
in considering the repeated conduct subfactor of the reprehensibility analysis,the district court observed that sunrise tortious conduct involved repeated stalling and dishonesty ja at,and that sunrise continually refused to be held responsible for its actions,ignoring and rebuffing plaintiff ja at.sunrise argues that the district court applied this factor wrongly.relying on our statement in willow inn,pub.serv.mut.ins,cir that t he repeated conduct cited in gore involved not merely a pattern of contemptible conduct within one extended transaction,but rather specific instances of similar conduct by the defendant in relation to other parties,id.at,sunrise contends that the repeated conduct subfactor is not satisfied here because there is no evidence that it committed similar tortious acts against other entities.
contrary to sunrise suggestion,we did not hold in willow inn that the repeated conduct inquiry is so limited in scope.we instead recognized that,while the repeated conduct subfactor will necessarily have less force where the defendant misconduct did not extend beyond his dealings with the plaintiff,id.at,it may still be relevant in measuring the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,based on the particular facts and circumstances presented id.at.
e vidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that it was unlawful is highly indicative of reprehensibility.gore,at.in this case,within days of meeting with cgb therapists over the protestations of both rha and cgb,tomes received a letter from cgb counsel suggesting that her actions appear ed to constitute tortious interference.ja at.despite thereby having reason to believe that her previous contact with cgb therapists may have been unlawful,tomes nevertheless continued to assist symphony in recruiting the therapists.she thus evinced not only an intent to damage cgb but a willingness to act repeatedly on that intent,with utter contempt for cgb interests and disregard for the law.we therefore believe that the repeated conduct subfactor applies to this case in a way not captured in the intent subfactor.willow inn,at.
while three of the five reprehensibility subfactors support,to varying degrees,the award of substantial punitive damages in this case,our consideration of the remaining two subfactors counsels against the need for such a high award.the harm suffered by cgb was economic,not physical,and sunrise tortious conduct did not demonstrate an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others.we have previously recognized that economic torts are less worthy of large punitive damages awards than torts inflicting injuries to health or safety.inter,at citation omitted.based on our consideration of the reprehensibility guidepost,it appears that sunrise conduct was not sufficiently egregious to warrant a punitive damages award of million.that conclusion is reinforced by our analysis of the second guidepost,the disparity between the punitive damages award and the harm suffered by the plaintiff.
ratio of punitive damages to harm 
the second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff.gore,at.the supreme court has been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio,instead emphasizing that t he precise award in any case must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.campbell,at.it has cautioned,however,that in practice,few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process.id.at.
measuring the million punitive damages award against the compensatory award in this case yields a ratio of over,which immediately alerts the court to the need for special justification.williams conagra poultry,cir.the district court opined that the ratio it permitted,which it characterized as roughly,was not constitutionally excessive because of the facts of this case including the wealth of defendant and the state interest in punishment and deterrence.ja at.the district court also sought to justify the high ratio by saying it suspect ed that given the hardships defendant imposed on plaintiff in its treatment of plaintiff after the interference took place,and given defendant antics leading up to the first trial,the true ratio,could the full extent of the harm caused by defendant be expressed as a simple dollar value,would be closer to three to one.id.
the district court true ratio justification can not withstand scrutiny.the court effectively lowered the ratio by inflating the denominator based on suspicions of unquantified harm.we do not doubt that the district court had reason to believe that some unquantified harm inflicted by sunrise supports a substantial punitive damages award to cgb.but suspicions and speculation alone will not suffice.we need not reach the question of whether unquantified harm can ever affect the denominator in a punitive harm ratio.it is enough to say that it does not affect it in this case.the district court did not point to evidence in the record,nor did it articulate its reasoning for concluding that the denominator ought to be something other than what the first jury expressly held in its compensatory damages verdict was the actual harm.with no evidence or articulated reason to support the framing of a different denominator,the compensatory award is the appropriate denominator under the ratio analysis 
heeding the supreme court admonition that few awards exceeding the threshold will satisfy due process,we conclude that the ratio in this case crosses the line into constitutional impropriety.pacific mut.life ins.haslip,d.while the reprehensibility of sunrise conduct and the harm it inflicted on cgb should not be minimized,there are no special circumstances justifying the enormous disparity between the punitive damages award and the compensatory damages recovered by cgb in this case.the supreme court has suggested that greater ratios may comport with due process in cases where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages,or where the injury is hard to detect or monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine.campbell,at.quoting gore,at.see deters equifax credit info,cir w here the injury is primarily personal,a greater ratio may be appropriate.but this is not such a case.in short,a further reduction of the million award is required,in light of our consideration of the guideposts.
as we stand in the role as gatekeeper in reviewing an award of punitive damages,inter,at,we turn next to our responsibility for determining the constitutional limit on the award in this case.see id.a n appellate panel,convinced that it must reduce an award of punitive damages,must rely on its combined experience and judgment.in making this determination,we must accord a measure of deference to the jury award.willow inn,at.we are obliged to decrease the award to an amount the evidence will bear,which amount must necessarily be as may well be the level the court would have deemed appropriate if working on a clean slate.id.citing dunn hovic,cir en banc.after carefully reviewing the record and the parties arguments,we conclude that a punitive damages award in the amount of represents the constitutional upper limit in this case.
a punitive award of bears a reasonable relationship to the reprehensibility of sunrise tortious conduct and results in a punitive ratio of less than,within the range,as counseled by the supreme court.in arriving at this figure,we have also considered the evidence of sunrise financial strength,which the jury was appropriately permitted to take into consideration,recognizing that what may be awesome punishment for an impecunious individual defendant may be wholly insufficient to influence the behavior of a prosperous corporation.continental trend,at see campbell,at.observing that consideration of defendant wealth is not unlawful or inappropriate so long as it is not used to make up for the failure of other factors,such as reprehensibility,to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendant conduct citation omitted.
wealth is also relevant because a rich defendant may act oppressively and force or prolong litigation simply because it can afford to do so and a plaintiff may not be able to bear the costs and the delay.continental trend,at accord mathias accor economy lodging,cir posner,w ealth in the sense of resources enable s the defendant to mount an extremely aggressive defense against suits such as this and by doing so to make litigating against it very costly in other words,the defendant is investing in developing a reputation intended to deter plaintiffs.informed by many decades of experience as a trial judge and by the specific experience of presiding over several years of pretrial proceedings and two trials in this matter,the district court judge described sunrise litigation conduct as tell ing a tale of repeated stalling and dishonesty ja at,which included the imposition of countless obstacles to rapid resolution of plaintiff claims id.at,among other antics.id.at.brillman testified about sunrise abusive and dilatory litigation tactics ja at,including sunrise initiation of meritless collateral proceedings against cgb in rha bankruptcy case and constant threats from sunrise to keep litigation going forever.ja at.brillman demonstrated tremendous fortitude.she took out a second mortgage on her home and vowed to litigate cgb claims to final resolution ja at,but litigants should not have to face something akin to medieval trial by combat to resolve a basic business dispute.the mounting costs of this,litigation might have forced many a small business to accept an undervalued settlement or to abandon its claims altogether.indeed,the case history here strongly implies that sunrise had exactly that outcome in mind.
this was not,it should be emphasized,simply a case.no litigant,whether its resources are great or small,is required to make nice by giving up legitimate legal positions.what sets this case apart and makes it,we hope,truly unusual is the repeated use of procedural devices to grind an opponent down,without regard for whether those devices advanced any legitimate interest.the district court judge,the bankruptcy judge who waded through the meritless adversary action,and a previous panel of this court have all,to one degree or another,commented negatively on sunrise litigation tactics under these literally remarkable circumstances,a substantial punitive damages award is warranted to prevent sunrise from gaining the unfair advantage of a reputation for bleeding legal adversaries to death before they can vindicate their rights.mathias,at.there is a cost to abusive litigation tactics,and sunrise will pay it,at least to a degree.while the punitive damages award here represents far more than litigation misconduct,that misconduct is relevant to our analysis.
in further considering the reasonableness of a reduced award in the amount of,we find it significant that sunrise,in its first appeal,did not challenge the constitutionality of the million punitive damages verdict that the first jury returned.even considering that the million punitive award was based on two verdicts for tortious interference,one of which was subsequently overturned on appeal,we think sunrise past silence leaves it to argue that the imposition of a penalty on the surviving claim of tortious interference is grossly excessive.
in sum,we conclude that the maximum constitutionally permissible punitive award in this case is.
punitive damages awards are the product of numerous,and sometimes intangible,factors because no two cases are truly identical,meaningful comparisons of such awards are difficult to make.txo production alliance resources,d plurality opinion.we expect that will remain true of this abnormally contentious case.for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the district court punitive damages award and remand this case with instructions to enter a new judgment for punitive damages in the amount of.cgb is dismissed.

this case was botched on remand.a litigant appealed to our court and won a partial reversal,and yet the judicial system left that litigant worse off on remand than it had been before it appealed.the proceedings before the district court simply did not comport with the mandate we had issued.for that reason alone,the judgment of the district court should be vacated,and this case should be remanded for proceedings consistent with our original mandate.we need not,and therefore should not,reach the constitutional question of whether the remitted punitive award was so excessive as to violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.i therefore do not join my colleagues in answering a question that should not be before us,and so i respectfully dissent.
the first jury found in favor of cgb occupational therapy,having determined that the defendants,sunrise assisted living management,and sunrise assisted living,collectively,sunrise,tortiously interfered with cgb contracts with two nursing home facilities and its own therapists.the jury awarded cgb in compensatory damages for sunrise interference with the nursing home contracts,in compensatory damages for sunrise interference with cgb therapist contracts,and million in punitive damages.it was not clear how the jury allocated the punitive damages award between the two acts of interference,because the verdict form did not specify.see cgb occupational therapy,rha health,cir.
