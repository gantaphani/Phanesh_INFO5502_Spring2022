in this case we are asked to review a determination by the district court that an employee challenge to a denial of disability benefits under a plan adopted by an employer pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,is subject to the grievance procedure,including arbitration,contained in a separate collective bargaining agreement the cba negotiated between the employer and its workers under the national labor relations act,et.while we recognize the strong policy considerations favoring arbitration of labor disputes,there is no right to arbitration of erisa benefits under a cba unless the erisa benefits sought are either i derived directly from an erisa plan established and maintained by or incorporated into a cba whose grievance procedure contains an arbitration clause,or ii created by a separate erisa plan and that plan the cba provide that adverse benefit determinations by a plan administrator are subject to the cba grievance procedure that includes arbitration.because we hold that the benefits sought in this case are neither created by or incorporated into the cba nor made subject to the cba grievance procedure,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment to the union and those workers seeking disability benefits and denying summary judgment to the employer.we remand for further proceedings on the remaining claim consistent with this opinion.
united steelworkers of america,the union,lewis griffin,george hemmert,george keddie,and janice scott the individual plaintiffs,filed a two count complaint in the eastern district of pennsylvania against rohm and haas company the company and rohm and haas company health and welfare plan the plan.the individual plaintiffs are employees at the company bristol,pennsylvania facility and members of the union,which represents the hourly production and mechanical employees at this facility.count i of the complaint sought to compel arbitration of four grievances filed by the individual plaintiffs to challenge the denial of disability benefits under the plan,pursuant to the cba between the company and the union covering the bristol facility the bristol cba count ii,in the alternative,alleged violations of section of erisa,a b and a.at the inception of the case,the district court ordered that the two counts be litigated separately and that discovery proceed initially on count i only.upon the filing of the parties crossmotions for summary judgment as to count i only,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants motion for summary judgment,thus disposing of the case and rendering count ii of the complaint moot.the company and the plan now appeal the district court decision in its entirety.
each of the four individual plaintiffs sought to obtain either disability retirement or long term disability benefits from the plan,and these benefits were denied by the plan administrator.following these denials,the union submitted grievances pursuant to the bristol cba on behalf of the four individual plaintiffs,to which the company failed to respond.the grievances of the four individual plaintiffs were filed between august,and october.the union contends that each of the individual plaintiffs fully exhausted the grievance procedures or that any additional attempts to exhaust such procedures would have been futile.the union demanded that these grievances be arbitrated in accordance with the bristol cba however,the company refused to arbitrate these grievances,arguing that any challenge to a denial of benefits under the plan had to be made pursuant to the appeal procedure contained in the plan itself.
on january,prior to the filing of the grievances on behalf of the four individual plaintiffs,the union filed a grievance pursuant to the bristol cba the grievance complaining that the disability case management process resulted in the termination or denial of disability benefits in a manner inconsistent with the plan the company has never responded to the grievance,and the union has never demanded arbitration of this grievance.
article of the bristol cba,effective may,to may,provides that t he provisions of this agreement hereafter pertain only to the wages,hours,and working conditions of the employees.article v then establishes a grievance procedure covering s uch questions arising under this agreement as involve wages other than general adjustments,individual base rates,hours of employment and working conditions which any employee may desire to discuss with the company.the final step of the grievance procedure states should agreement not be reached during the previous steps then either party may submit the matter to arbitration as described in article vi.
article vi on arbitration provides that t he sole responsibility of said arbitrator shall be to interpret the meaning of the articles of this contract,and it in no way shall be construed that the arbitrator shall have the power to add to,subtract from,or modify in any way the terms of this agreement.
the bristol cba also contains an article addressing the medical examinations of union members 
article examinations 
all new employees must pass a company medical examination.
company medical examinations of employees or groups of employees shall be made from time to time.should any examination disclose that a transfer to another department would be beneficial from a health standpoint,the employee will be consulted and the transfer considered.a transfer for this reason shall be with the concurrence of the company and the union and shall not be held in violation of the seniority provisions.such exceptions are subject to periodic medical examinations.
before any employee status is changed due to physical incapacity,he shall be entitled to a medical examination by an impartial physician should there be disagreement between the company physician and the employee personal physician.when the company physician and the employee personal physician disagree,and prior to the receipt of an impartial physician opinion,the employee will be placed on disability absence and be provided benefits under the provisions of the sickness and accident plan,provided no suitable reassignment is available.it shall be the company and the union goal to have such situations resolved as soon as possible.
when an employee feels he needs a medical examination,he will receive same upon a written request to the labor relations manager.an employee physician may obtain from the plant physician a written statement of medical findings.
should it be determined by a medical examination that an employee is no longer able to do his regular work,then this employee shall be eligible for such other regular work that may be available and which he can perform satisfactorily.it in no way is understood that the company must provide such work.said employee shall receive the rate of the job to which he is transferred but may be eligible for wage rate protection as provided for under the provisions of the disability rate protection policy 
with the exception of the mention of the sickness and accident plan in article xix,the bristol cba does not contain any other reference to disability benefits.
the plan,as amended and restated effective january,provides for disability income benefits and other benefits for eligible employees of the company,including employees,and is not limited to company locations covered by the bristol cba.the plan is governed by erisa and exists outside of and is independent from the bristol cba.the union is not a signatory to the plan,and there is no reference to the bristol cba or the union throughout the plan.
the plan vests the rohm and haas benefits administrative committee with the sole discretion to interpret the plan and decide any matters arising hereunder and states that a ny final determination by the rohm and haas benefits administrative committee shall be binding on all parties.final determinations by the rohm and haas benefits administrative committee shall not be subject to de novo review and shall not be overturned unless proven to be arbitrary and capricious 
the plan establishes a detailed claims procedure by which an employee may seek to claim benefits and to appeal a denial of benefits.the claims procedure provides 
any claim for benefits under any of the benefit programs shall be made in accordance with the procedures as set forth in the applicable contracts or summary plan description and in accordance with the procedure set forth below.should there be a conflict between the procedures set forth in any applicable contract or summary plan description and the procedures set forth below,the procedures set forth below shall control.
pursuant to the claims procedure,a claimant seeking benefits under the plan initially files a claim with the claims administrator.if a claimant receives an adverse benefit determination,he may then file an appeal with the appeals administrator,who is vested with final determination of adverse disability claims.the plan requires the final notice of an adverse benefit determination to include a statement of the claimant right to bring an action under section a a of erisa the plan further provides that any claimant seeking to file a lawsuit must do so within ninety days of receipt of the adverse benefit determination or the commencement of the action will be barred.the plan does not provide for arbitration at any step of the claims procedure.
upon examining these documents,the district court found that the relevant provisions created an ambiguity as to whether the individual plaintiffs grievances were subject to arbitration under the bristol cba.the district court then looked to the summaries of the collective bargaining negotiations for evidence of the parties intent,and found that,because disability benefits were the subject of negotiations between the union and the company over the past forty years,such benefits were encompassed under the agreement as wages and working conditions.despite the fact that the bristol cba did not reference the plan or provide any details regarding disability benefits,the district court held that sufficient extrinsic evidence existed to show that the parties intended to incorporate the plan into the bristol cba.
our court has plenary review over the district court order granting summary judgment as a matter of law local,int l of workers verizon,cir hereinafter verizon see also harris green tree financial,cir holding standard of review is plenary where appeal presents a legal question concerning the applicability and scope of an arbitration agreement.
we first recognize the strong federal policies that favor arbitration of labor disputes,which are largely premised upon the arbitrator superior expertise in the mechanics of collective bargaining and collective bargaining agreements,greater understanding of the law of the shop,and greater efficiency in resolving labor disputes.laborers int l union foster wheeler,cir.the key principles governing whether a dispute is arbitrable are well established 
first,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.second,in deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration,a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.third,where the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that,an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
lukens steel united steelworkers,cir quoting at t,commc ns workers of,d internal citations omitted.where parties have agreed to submit all questions of the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement to an arbitrator,the court is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.united steelworkers american,d.our circuit has articulated three questions to consider when assessing whether a dispute is arbitrable does the present dispute come within the scope of the arbitration clause does any other provision of the contract expressly exclude this kind of dispute from arbitration and is there any other forceful evidence indicating that the parties intended such an exclusion diagnostic,local,int l of teamsters,cir.
the parties devote much of their briefing to the issue of whether the arbitration clause is narrow or broad,and consequently whether the presumption of arbitrability arises.relying on verizon and trap rock industries,local,international union of operating engineers,cir hereinafter trap rock,the company and the plan argue that the presumption of arbitrability only applies where the arbitration clause is broad,and thus does not apply where the arbitration clause is narrow.
cases holding that the arbitration clauses at issue are narrow have generally relied on language expressly limiting the scope of the clause to specific subject matter.for example,because the arbitration clause in verizon specifically enumerated certain articles within the collective bargaining agreement that were subject to arbitration,the court held that the arbitration provision was narrow as it clearly forecloses the possibility that other issues could be arbitrated by providing that the list is exclusive.at.likewise,the trap rock court held that an arbitration clause was narrow where the employer reserved its right to determine its employees qualifications and discharge or demote its employees based on such qualifications and also expressly excluded the right of the arbitrator to make such determinations.trap rock,at.
we do not believe that the arbitration clause here explicitly forecloses the range of arbitrable subject matter.although the arbitration clause limits the arbitrator power to interpreting the articles of the bristol cba,such a limitation on power is not an exclusion from arbitration of subject matter that is addressed in the bristol cba.further,while the terms of the bristol cba and its grievance procedure apply to wages,hours,and working conditions,such terms are themselves fairly expansive and encompass a variety of types of claims within their definitions.read in its entirety,the bristol cba neither specifically excludes nor provides evidence of a purpose or intent to exclude categories of grievances from arbitration.
as such,the arbitration clause here is more akin to those arbitration clauses held to be broad.see,lukens steel,at cir holding that an arbitration provision was broad where it called for arbitration s hould any differences arise as to the meaning and application of,or compliance with,the provisions of this agreement and further noting that the parties express exclusion of other categories of subject matter from the arbitration clause indicated that the parties knew how to limit the categories of arbitrable subject matter diagnostic,at clause was broad where it called for arbitration of any dispute arising out of a claimed violation of this agreement.because there is neither an express provision excluding issues concerning disability benefits from arbitration nor forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude such benefits from the bristol cba grievance procedure,we hold that the arbitration clause is broad and thus the presumption of arbitrability applies.
regardless of whether the arbitration clause is broad or narrow,however,arbitration is still a creature of contract and a court can not call for arbitration of matters outside of the scope of the arbitration clause.see at t,at.w hether or not the company was bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbitrate,is a matter to be determined by the court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties.quoting john wiley sons,livingston,d diagnostic,at.
here,the scope of the bristol cba grievance procedure is limited to s uch questions arising under this agreement as involve wages other than general adjustments,individual base rates,hours of employment and working conditions which any employee may desire to discuss with the company shall be subject to adjus
