plaintiff appellant fidelity bank fidelity,individually and as assignee of matthew and sondra knowles the knowles,appeals the granting of summary judgment to defendant appellee nova casualty company nova,after the district court determined that an insurance policy neither covered water damage caused to an apartment building during a tropical storm nor any resulting business interruption losses.fidelity challenges the district court interpretation of the policy under its rain limitation provision,arguing that the policy coverage extended to both damage caused by or resulting from rain as well as damage resulting from the entry of surface water.since we agree that the water damage was covered under the policy at issue,we reverse the district court summary judgment order and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
the knowles owned a rental property at high street in clinton,massachusetts,which was approximately years old.the building had a masonry exterior and a flat,roof which had been installed by the previous owner one to two years before the knowles purchased the building.the drainage system on the roof consisted of a single drain located at the center of the roof with an internal diameter of inches covered by a strainer made from lead flashing.the roof also contained two glass skylights directly above the building stairwell.
the high street property was mortgaged with fidelity.the property was insured by nova through an policy the policy covering direct physical loss or damage to the building subject to any specific exclusion stating otherwise.while the original policy contained an exclusion for water damage,including damage resulting from w ater or material,that backs up or overflows from a sewer,drain or sump,an amendatory endorsement to the policy explicitly deleted that exclusion.an additional endorsement modifying the policy added flood coverage for loss attributable to f lood,meaning a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas due to t he unusual or rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
on september,a tropical storm brought heavy rains to clinton which resulted in the accumulation of a significant amount of water on the roof of the covered property.the high volume of water overwhelmed the rooftop drain,causing the water to pool on the roof and eventually leak through the building two skylights.the water caused substantial damage to the interior of the building,and as a result of that damage,the town of clinton ordered the building to be closed,causing the forced evacuation of all tenants.the town would not permit reentry into the building until a structural engineer provided an inspection report indicating that the structure was sound.the building was fully rented,and the closure resulted in an additional loss of rental income to the knowles.because the knowles could not afford to make repairs to the building,it remained vacant.
the knowles filed a claim for reimbursement for the interior water damage with nova.nova investigated the damage resulting from the storm by dispatching two engineers to the property on september and.one engineer concluded that the building flooded because rainwater backed up on the roof and ponded to a depth that was above two,aged and porous,metal and glass,roof skylights,which leaked significantly when submerged under water.the engineer noted the roof was not the path for water entry and concluded that the drain failed to drain the rapidly accumulated volume of water on the roof,opining that the single drain and strainer were inadequate.the other engineer concluded that the obstruction of the roof drain caused the ponding of water to such a height that it flowed over the skylight curbs and entered the building.
on october,nova denied the knowles claim.in its denial,it cited to the rain limitation provision,or limitation.of the knowles policy,as well as the faulty workmanship exclusion,or exclusion.the rain limitation is a listed exclusion from policy coverage if the loss suffered is to t he interior of the building caused by or resulting from rain,whether driven by wind or not,unless t he building first sustains damage by a covered cause of loss to its roof or walls through which the rain enters.the faulty workmanship exclusion excludes damage resulting from f aulty,inadequate or defective d esign,specifications,workmanship,repair,construction,renovation,remodeling,grading,compaction materials used in repair,construction,renovation or remodeling or maintenance of part or all of any property on or off your covered locations.in denying coverage,nova claimed that the rainwater entered the interior of the building because of the roof drain and not through damage to the roof or walls.it also maintained,pertaining to the faulty workmanship exclusion,that the roof drain strainer and the single inch diameter roof drain were inadequate to handle the water deposited from the rain storm.
on december,after the knowles claim was denied,the building was vandalized and much of its copper piping was cut out,causing further damage to the property.the knowles filed a separate claim for reimbursement for this damage,but nova denied that claim under the vacancy exclusion,or loss conditions.b,of the policy,which states in pertinent part 
if the building where the loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs,w e will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following even if they are covered causes of loss 
a vandalism 
nova claimed that,since the building had been vacant for over sixty days,policy coverage did not extend to the losses or damage suffered by the vandalism and theft.
due to these financial losses,the knowles defaulted on their mortgage and fidelity took title to the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure around the beginning of.
procedural history 
on february,fidelity,individually and as assignee of the knowles,filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court against nova.the complaint sought a declaration that the physical losses suffered by the property were covered by the policy count,and that the loss of business income to the knowles was likewise covered count.fidelity also sought monetary damage from nova for breach of contract count,negligence count,and violations of massachusetts consumer protection statute,ch.chapter count.nova removed the case to the massachusetts federal district court on diversity grounds.following discovery,nova moved for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint,and fidelity for summary judgment only as to the first two counts involving nova denial of coverage under the policy.
the district court granted summary judgment to nova on all five counts,denying fidelity.it construed the issues before it as whether the rain limitation the faulty workmanship exclusion applied to the loss suffered to the property.the court concluded that the rain limitation exclusion excluded coverage because,as the court stated,the water pooled on the roof,thus becoming surface water which entered the building through the eroded metal and glass skylights.that the water pooled due to a faulty or inadequate drain does not trump the surface water exclusion which bars coverage.fid.coop.bank nova cas,dist.lexis,emphasis added.regarding the applicability of the faulty workmanship exclusion,however,the court strictly construed the exclusion against the insurer and held that the language did not exclude coverage here.specifically,it found that the undisputed fact that the single roof drain was inadequate to remove the rainwater did not,on its own,trigger the faulty workmanship exclusion.finally,it held that the vacancy exclusion of the policy excluded coverage for the knowles second claim for the vandalism and theft that occurred in december.the court explicitly rejected fidelity argument that an insurer was prevented from invoking the vacancy exclusion if its wrongful denial of the claim is the reason for the vacancy.instead,since it had found that the denial of coverage was not wrongful under the rain limitation provision of the policy,fidelity could not attribute the reason for the vacancy to nova 
fidelity moved for reconsideration,arguing,inter alia,that any water damage resulting from surface waters was covered under the amendatory endorsement to the policy.the district court issued an electronic line order denying that motion without providing a reason.fidelity timely appealed both the district court summary judgment order and its denial of the motion for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
a.the rain limitation and surface water coverage 
on appeal,fidelity asks this court to make sharp distinctions between rain,water damage caused by rain,and water damage caused by surface water.it first requests that we narrowly construe the caused by rain provision in the policy rain limitation exclusion,as required under massachusetts law,to only exclude coverage for damage whose efficient proximate cause was rainfall.fidelity argues that,since the efficient proximate cause in this case was not the direct entry of rainfall into the building interior but was rather the blocked or inadequate roof drain,as nova own investigation found,the damage was not caused by rain and did not fall within the rain limitation exclusion of the policy.
further,fidelity requests that we draw a sharp line between rain and surface water as mutually exclusive terms.while the district court found that the rain limitation excluded coverage because the water that pooled on the roof became surface water that was caused by rain,fidelity insists that the court reasoning conflated two legally distinct terms.instead,fidelity invites us to find that,if the water on the roof was in fact surface water as characterized by the district court,it was no longer rain,and the rain limitation could not bar coverage.it cites two recent decisions of the massachusetts supreme judicial court boazova safety ins,and surabian realty ngm ins,both issued after the district court opinion,to support its contention that,while surface water is derived from falling rain,it is starkly distinguished from rain for the purposes of rain limitation exclusions under insurance policies.fidelity goes on to conclude that,if the rain were to be characterized as surface water as it should under massachusetts law,it would not be excluded from coverage because the amendatory endorsement to the policy covers damage resulting from surface water.
nova,for its part,argues that the district court properly determined,under the plain language of the policy,that the rain limitation excluded coverage of the water damage.since the rain entered the interior of the building without prior damage to the roof or walls,it was caused by or resulted from rain.according to nova,automatically categorizing rain as surface water merely because it touches some surface,ground or not,constitutes a tortured reading of an otherwise clear exception,according to nova,and is contrary to the rule that insurance policies be given their plain and ordinary meaning.nova relies on wider heritage maintenance,wherein the court determined that water damage was caused by rain and did not constitute surface water since it had resulted from water that had accumulated in tarps hanging from a scaffold.nova rejects fidelity reliance on boazova and surabian realty,arguing that those cases did not in fact deal with rain limitation exclusions,but rather anticoncurrent causes they did not set out any new law in the area of surface water dispositive for this case.
this court reviews the entry of summary judgment de novo.rockwood skf usa,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.a.that this matter was resolved on cross motions does not change this standard of review,wightman springfield terminal,cir,but where a was made,we must decide whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed,barnes fleet bank,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
under massachusetts law,the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law for the court.bos.gas century indem.the court construes the terms of the policy de novo under the general rules of contract interpretation.valley forge ins.field,cir quoting brazas sporting arms,am.empire surplus lines ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.first,we look to the actual language of the policies,given its plain and ordinary meaning.id.the burden of demonstrating that an exclusion exists that precludes coverage is on the insurer,and any ambiguities in the exclusion provision are strictly construed against said insurer.id.where the relevant policy provisions are plainly expressed,those provisions must be enforced according to their terms and interpreted in a manner consistent with what an objectively reasonable insured would expect to be covered.vicor vigilant ins,cir citing city fuel fire ins.of hartford.
the facts of this case are unusual relative to the cases cited by the parties in that the policy at issue had broad,coverage as well as flood coverage under an amendatory endorsement.the policy thus clearly covers water damage caused by surface water,but it excludes from coverage water damage caused by or resulting from rain.while nova argues that the damage to the building interior was caused by rain that entered the building through skylights on the roof,and was not covered unless the building first sustain ed damage by a covered cause of loss to its roof through which the rain enter ed,we can not agree.
massachusetts courts have long used the efficient proximate cause test to resolve coverage controversies in chain causation cases.jussim.bay ins.the test requires courts to determine the efficient proximate cause of a given loss,and i f that cause is an insured risk,there will be coverage even though the final form of the property damage,produced by a series of related events,appears to take the loss outside the terms of the policy.id.the touchstone decision defining efficient proximate cause under massachusetts law is lynn gas meridien fire ins,which clarifies that the active efficient cause that sets in motion a train of events which brings about a result without the intervention of any force started and working actively from a new and independent source is the direct and proximate cause.
we are required to perform an efficient cause analysis under these facts due the terms of the policy at issue.while the terms of the original policy would appear to preclude such an analysis,those terms were explicitly amended and must now be strictly construed against the insurer.specifically,section exclusions of the original policy states 
we will not pay for loss or damage directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss or damage.
flood,surface water,waves,tides,tidal waves,overflow of any body of water,or their spray,all whether driven by wind or not 
mudslide or mudflow 
water or material,that backs up or overflows from a sewer,drain or sump.
however,along with a separate flood coverage amendatory endorsement modifying the policy as discussed infra,the policy also contains an endorsement entitled amendatory endorsement habitational program,drafted by nova,which states in paragraph that paragraph water items and of exclusions are deleted.therefore,the policy can no longer be read to exclude coverage for damage,directly or indirectly,by water that backs up or overflows from a drain regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss or damage.under such circumstance,massachusetts law as a default kicks in to require an efficient cause analysis in interpreting the scope of coverage under the policy.jussim,at.
in this case,nova own experts determined that the blocked or inadequate roof drain caused the water to accumulate on the flat roof trapped at the perimeter by parapet walls.nova engineers found that the water damage occurred because rainwater had backed up on the roof and po
