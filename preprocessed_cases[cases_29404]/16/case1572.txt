this case involves the recovery of funds under a fire insurance policy.the jury found in favor of appellees and awarded them in excess of.we find that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted evidence that a grand jury did not indict appellee luis muñoz for arson.therefore,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
appellant state farm lloyds state farm provided a homeowners insurance policy,including fire insurance coverage,to appellees carmella known as carmella luis muñoz collectively,the muñozes.on january,the muñozes sought coverage for loss to their home and its contents,that resulted from an undisputedly intentionally set fire.there was evidence to suggest that the muñozes intentionally set the fire.the muñozes claimed that the fire was set by their neighbors,the cavazoses.the police regarded both muñoz and the cavazoses as suspects.
state farm investigated the claim and believed that the muñozes might have had a financial incentive to set the fire.pursuant to the policy condition precedent that an insured provide requested documents,on january,state farm requested that the muñozes fill out a personal property inventory form,which the muñozes returned on january.on january,tom reed,an adjuster from state farm special investigation unit,told muñoz that an additional investigation was necessary,including reviewing the muñozes financial condition.on march,reed sent a letter requesting records that would show muñoz income for through.the muñozes delivered some financial documents in april and june.however,state farm claimed that it never received all the necessary financial documents,so it was unable to grant or deny coverage.thus,the claim remained open and the muñozes did not receive money under the policy,except for a monthly stipend for living expenses.
the muñozes filed suit in texas state court on may,alleging breach of contract,violations of the insurance code,and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.state farm removed the case to federal court,asserting the muñozes had not complied with the policy condition precedent of providing requested documents and the muñozes could not recover because they had set fire to their house.before trial,the parties stipulated that the fire was intentionally set.during trial,state farm presented evidence that muñoz failed a polygraph exam.subsequently,the muñozes presented evidence that a grand jury did not indict muñoz for arson state farm timely objected to the evidence under federal rules of evidence and.at the close of evidence,the district court orally granted state farm motion for directed verdict on the issue of malice and punitive damages.
on february,the jury found that the muñozes had complied with the condition precedent state farm breached the policy the muñozes were not responsible for starting the fire the muñozes sustained in damages for repairs to their home and for the contents state farm breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it failed to conduct a reasonable investigation,failed to provide a reasonable explanation of the factual or legal bases for denying the claim,and failed to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time the muñozes were entitled to each in mental anguish damages and state farm engaged in the conduct the jury did not award extra damages based on this finding.
state farm filed a rule motion for new trial,arguing that the admission of evidence regarding the grand jury no bill of muñoz was an erroneous ruling which substantially prejudiced state farm,and was so prejudicial that it was not curable by instruction or otherwise.the district court denied state farm motion for new trial,and state farm timely appeals.the muñozes the district court grant of state farm motion for directed verdict on the issue of malice and punitive damages.
we will reverse the trial court denial of a motion for new trial only when there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.dawsey olin,cir.an abuse of discretion exists if we are firmly convinced that the district court made a mistake in admitting challenged evidence.stockman oakcrest dental,cir.
evidence of a grand jury decision not to indict muñoz 
state farm argues that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted evidence of a grand jury decision not to indict muñoz for arson.we agree.
several of our sister circuits have considered the issue of introducing evidence of or acquittal of arson in a civil case regarding insurance proceeds.they have uniformly held that such evidence is impermissible because it is highly prejudicial.as the fourth circuit stated we adopt and apply here the rule that a federal trial court commits reversible error when it permits the plaintiff in a suit for fire insurance proceeds to present evidence of his nonprosecution or acquittal on related criminal arson charges.rabon great sw.fire ins,cir see also kelly auto parts,boughton,cir am.home assurance sunshine supermarket,cir galbraith hartford fire ins,cir.the sixth circuit found that j ury instructions are inadequate to cure the inherent prejudice involved in improperly admitted evidence of for arson.kelly auto parts,at.these holdings rely upon the fact that such evidence goes directly to the principal issue before the jury and is highly prejudicial.rabon,at.furthermore,t he inadmissibility of evidence of comports with the general rule that evidence of an acquittal in a criminal arson case is inadmissible in a civil arson case.am.home assurance,at.we agree with our sister circuits and find that the court below committed reversible error.
the muñozes present two theories under which they if the evidence was improperly remand is unnecessary.first,the muñozes argue that state farm opened the door to evidence of muñoz because state farm presented inadmissible evidence that muñoz failed a polygraph exam.second,the muñozes argue that state farm waived any error under the invited error doctrine.both arguments lack merit.
the muñozes first argument fails because this court has denounced the per se rule that polygraph examinations are inadmissible.gibbs gibbs,cir see also united states posado,cir.rather,the standards announced in daubert control the admissibility of such results.gibbs,at.neither party alleges that the polygraph results were improperly admitted under daubert,and the muñozes did not even object to the introduction of such evidence at trial.therefore,there is no support for the contention that the polygraph evidence was inadmissible,and the door was not opened to evidence of muñoz.
the muñozes second argument stems from the district court judge acknowledgment that she made a mistake in admitting the evidence.specifically,the muñozes rely upon the following colloquy,which occurred at the close of evidence before sending the case to the jury 
the court now,are you going to mention the no bill in your closing 
garza counsel for the muñozes i intended to.
the court okay.what is the language of the instruction that you would ask me to give to the jury 
state farm counsel first of all,i would ask that garza be instructed not to mention it.if he does mention it,i would ask the court at that time to instruct the jury not to consider the absence of prosecution or the no bill for any purpose.
the district court judge then ordered garza not to mention the evidence in his closing argument,and he complied.the muñozes argue that state farm received the exact relief it order not to mention the evidence during closing thereby waived any error under the invited error doctrine.the invited error doctrine provides that a party may not complain on appeal of errors that he himself invited or provoked the court to commit.united states sharpe,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted united states green,cir the doctrine of invited error provides that when injection of inadmissible evidence is attributable to the actions of the defense,the defense can not later object to such invited error.internal quotation marks omitted.
we find that the invited error doctrine does not apply to state farm because it did not invite the error below,and it has not other
