appellants maverick tube corporation,tubos del caribe,ltda,and maverick tube lp collectively maverick appeal the declaratory judgment ruling that appellee westchester surplus lines insurance company westchester had no duty to indemnify maverick in an accident resulting from defective piping.this dispute involves the application of missouri state law in determining if an insurance occurrence and the duty to indemnify exists.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand.
factual and procedural background 
tubos manufactures drilling casing sold by maverick to both distributors and end users.maverick purchased a commercial general liability insurance policy cgl policy and an umbrella insurance policy umbrella policy from westchester.the cgl policy provides indemnification for property damage resulting from an occurrence.an occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.
in,maverick sold a specific casing,to dominion exploration and production company dominion for use and operation in its gas wells.in september,dominion experienced catastrophic failure in four gas wells that were using the casing.maverick opened an investigation on this matter,quarantined all casing,and notified other customers of the potential problems.maverick informed dominion that its warranty covered the cost of the casing,and it sent westchester notice of this incident and requested indemnification.
on november,dominion sent a written demand letter advising maverick that dominion considered the failed casing to be,among other things,a breach of warranty and sought in damages for i completion costs,ii lost production,iii plugging costs,and iv costs for new wells in exchange for releasing all claims against maverick.investigations by maverick,tubos,and the independent party hired by maverick determined that tubos production process had a flaw in the heat treatment process and chain conveyance system,in which the casing would cool off outside the furnace and,upon the furnace,the conveyance chain would touch the casing causing it to cool more quickly than the rest of the surface.this defect resulted in brittle points on the pipe.these investigations and reports showed that maverick and tubos were responsible for dominion damages.maverick forwarded these reports and documents to westchester,who relied on the investigations performed by maverick and tubos without independent investigation or study per the cgl policy terms 
maverick settled with dominion in march for.the settlement was several million less than the amount originally sought by dominion because the breach of warranty limit for replacing the casing and loss of production revenues were both excluded from the settlement total.
westchester denied maverick claim on january.westchester then filed this declaratory judgment action in february on the same day as maverick response to westchester denial of coverage.maverick filed its lawsuit in the eastern district of missouri,which was consolidated in december with westchester action filed in the southern district of texas.both parties agree that missouri law controls this case.
maverick claim against westchester excluded the retention limit and the cost of the casing sold,as maverick warranty covered the replacement product cost and the cgl policy excluded the cost to replace a defective product.westchester moved for summary judgment and argued that maverick entire claim was a breach of warranty claim,which does not constitute an occurrence under missouri law,based on dominion november letter sent to maverick.maverick filed a cross motion for summary judgment and argued that dominion letter was not dispositive of the coverage issue and that westchester was vexatious in its refusal to pay maverick claim.
the district court granted westchester request for summary judgment,holding that dominion advanced only a breach of warranty claim against maverick and that a warranty claim is not within the meaning of the word occurrence in a cgl policy or umbrella policy under missouri law.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court,hirras passenger,cir.summary judgment is proper if the record reflects that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
discussion 
the insured bears the burden of showing that the damages alleged are covered by the insurance policy.am.states ins.mathis.but an insurer may not merely rest upon the allegations found in the petition instead,the insurer must consider the facts it knew or could have reasonably ascertained and show there is no possibility of coverage.stark liquidation florists mut.ins,quoting truck ins.exch.prairie framing,llc.the unsettled state of missouri breach of warranty law stems from cases that fail to specify whether the underlying facts or the cause brought by the disputing party has been the basis for determining whether an occurrence exists that triggers the duty to indemnify under insurance policies.
the letter,settlement,and cause of action 
maverick contends that the district court erred in finding that westchester did not need to provide coverage for the settlement with dominion.maverick argues that the text and context of the november letter refers not only to maverick published warranty but also discusses the release of all claims.further,maverick argues that because the letter identified the four components of recovery and because investigations were still ongoing when the letter was written,the claim was not limited solely to the breach of warranty claim.maverick stresses that had dominion wanted to recover on the sole ground of maverick warranty,the letter would have only had one component of cost of the the warranty only covered the purchase price of a product and not additional damages.moreover,no formal list of causes of actions by dominion in the form of a complaint or petition was advanced.westchester asserts that the letter only discusses recovery under a breach of warranty theory and that because dominion never asserted a claim for negligence or another tort,westchester correctly denied coverage.in essence,westchester argues that maverick only evidence of a claim is dominion letter,and the letter only mention of legal recovery theories used the word warranty however,westchester cites to no authority suggesting that a demand letter can or should be used as the sole indicator of whether a claim is covered.
concerning the settlement,maverick argues that the settlement agreement language is the evidence that provides additional facts that initiates westchester duty to indemnify.the agreement itself excludes the purchase price of the casing and mentions that all matters relating to the incident are resolved the settlement language mirrors the warranty agreement language that strictly limit s the damages to the purchase price of the g oods paid.westchester disagrees that the settlement agreement should be considered.
westchester reasoning suggests that had dominion filed a lawsuit that used the word negligence or products liability it would pay for the damages because the facts support this claim.but one important difference should be formal complaint by dominion was ever filed.thus,the resolution by the eighth circuit in spirco environmental,american international specialty lines insurance,cir is helpful in interpreting the facts of the instant case.
in spirco,american refused to reimburse the arbitration fee paid by spirco because the recovering party had characterized the settlement as a breach of contract claim.id.at.but spirco attorney advanced the nature of the claim from the beginning of the arbitration due to the findings made by the arbitrator and the positions of the parties.id.at.because the damage occurred after spirco had finished its contract,the claim was not limited to the completion of the contract instead,the claim focused on the property damages that occurred later.id.the court determined that a
