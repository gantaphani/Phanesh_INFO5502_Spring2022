if a period and a period start on the same day,which one ends first most sane people would suggest the period.but,under the federal rules of civil procedure,time is relative.fourteen days usually lasts fourteen days.ten days,however,never lasts just ten days ten days always lasts at least fourteen days.eight times per year ten days can last fifteen days.and,once per year,ten days can last sixteen days.and this does not even take into account inclement weather.as we sometimes say in kentucky,there eight ways to sunday.
this case presents sort of an issue of first impression for this court regarding the timeliness of motions for attorney fees under federal rule of civil procedure d b.after considering federal rules of civil procedure,and a sprinkle of federal rule of appellate procedure,we reverse.
the merits of the underlying contract dispute are not relevant to our consideration of the attorney fees dispute.in sum,however,the plaintiff,miltimore sales,sued the defendant,international rectifier,for breach of contract.the jury found in favor of miltimore sales,and awarded some two million dollars in damages.on appeal,the jury verdict was affirmed by a different panel of this court.miltimore sales,int l rectifier,fed.appx.cir unpublished.
after the jury verdict,on december,the district court entered judgment in favor of miltimore sales.on january,international rectifier,timely filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,for a new trial remittitur pursuant to frcp rules and.the filing was construed as a rule e motion,and more than a year later,on february,the district court denied the rule motion.on february,fourteen days later,miltimore sales,filed its one and only petition for attorney fees and costs including all fees associated with the trial and defense of the motion.the matter was referred to a magistrate who recommended dismissing miltimore sales,motion for fees as untimely.on march,the district court issued an order accepting the magistrate report and recommendation.on april,miltimore sales,filed its timely notice of appeal to this court.
the question in this case is simple is a motion for attorney fees under rule d b timely if filed within fourteen days of the district court denial of a timely filed rule e motion the answer is also relatively simple yes.what this result means for litigants,however,and for their attorneys,who so desperately need compensation,is a bit more convoluted.the first part of this opinion explains why we conclude that miltimore sales,fee application was timely.the remainder of the opinion discusses why our answer and the federal rules create inefficiency uncertainty for litigants in this context.
federal rule of civil procedure addresses petitions for attorney fees and the time within which a motion for fees must be filed.section d b provides the time for filing and states that u nless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court,the motion for attorney fees must be filed no later than days after entry of judgment.d b.rule a defines the term judgment and states that a judgment includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.a.
the first step in ascertaining whether a fee application is timely is determining when to start the clock.international rectifier,argues that the judgment in this case was entered on december,when the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict.thus,international rectifier,asserts that any motion for fees must have been filed within fourteen days of december,is,by january.miltimore sales,argues conversely that while the judgment was entered on december,the judgment did not become an order from which an appeal lies under rule a,and was not the final judgment as described in rule advisory committee notes,until february,when the district court denied international rectifier,timely filed rule e motion.in support of its argument,miltimore sales,points to federal rule of appellate procedure and this court decision in brown local international brotherhood of electrical workers,cir.federal rule of appellate procedure addresses the effect of the filing of motions on the time for appeal.rule a a provides that if certain motions,including a rule e motion,are filed following the entry of judgment,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.thus,says miltimore sales,if a timely filed rule e motion prevents an appeal of the underlying judgment until the rule e motion is disposed of,then logically,the judgment can not be an order from which an appeal lies until the disposition of the rule e motion.we agree.
our decision in brown is clearly applicable.brown dealt with a eastern district of michigan local rule,but the analysis is logically indistinguishable.in brown,the losing party,local,filed a rule e motion following the entry of judgment.brown,at.brown did not file his fee application until after the district court disposed of the rule e motion,but filed it within the period prescribed by the local rule.id.at.the district court concluded that the motion was timely and this court affirmed,stating that the district court properly focused on whether an appeal could have been taken from the order,and that local motion for an alternative order,a rule e motion,prevented either party from appealing until the motion was ruled upon.id.at.thus,this court held that final judgment for purposes of brown fee application was the court denial of local motion for entry of an alternative order.id.the clear holding from brown is that a fee application is timely if filed within the applicable limitations period following the disposition of a rule e motion.
we note some possible confusion from the fact that rule itself uses the term judgment while the advisory committee notes to the amendments use the term final judgment.despite the inconsistency in language,the outcome is the same.a judgment is said to be final if it conclusively determines the rights of the parties to the litigation and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the order.weyant okst,cir citing coopers lybrand livesay,d.a jury verdict and the entry of judgment does just this.however,a timely petition for rehearing,a rule e motion tolls the running of the appeal period because it operates to suspend the finality of the court judgment,pending the court further determination whether the judgment should be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the parties.browder,of,d see also osterneck ernst whinney,d stating that the time for appeal does not begin to run until the district court has had an opportunity to dispose of all motions that seek to amend or alter what otherwise might appear to be a final judgment.moore federal practice,at ed a timely motion under rule destroys the finality of the judgment.thus,when a rule e motion is filed and finality is suspended,the judgment is neither final nor an order from which an appeal lies.a.when the district court disposes of the rule e motion,that order itself is not the final judgment,nor is it itself an order from which an appeal lies instead,the disposition of the rule e motions is an order or ruling that reinstates the finality of the original entry of judgment and a ruling that makes the underlying judgment appealable.
we now join the second and eleventh circuits in holding that a fee application is timely in these circumstances.in weyant okst,the district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on april.at.on april,the defendant filed motions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and the motions were denied in an order docketed on october.id.on april,the plaintiff filed an initial application for fees and expenses,the merits of which were decided in the district court october order.id.on october,the plaintiff filed a supplemental fee application for the costs incurred in successfully opposing the defendant motions.id.the district court dismissed the supplemental application as untimely finding that judgment was entered on april.id.the second circuit reversed,holding that the supplemental application was timely and that the prevailing part
