bridas bridas appeals the district court vacatur of an arbitration award against the government of turkmenistan government,a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement between bridas and a oil and gas company.because the totality of the record demonstrates that the government should be bound as an alter ego of state concern turkmenneft turkmenneft,we reverse and render for enforcement of the award.
this dispute has been in litigation longer than the agreement that spawned it.bridas has pursued recovery against the government for an oil and gas development deal gone awry.the catch has been that the government was never a signatory to the relevant contractual documents.bridas has borne the burden,before an arbitration panel and in federal court,of holding the government liable.this appeal,after remand to the district court,represents the final refinement of numerous theories bridas advanced against the government.we review the district court conclusion on remand that the government was not an alter ego of turkmenneft.
background 
in february,bridas,an argentine corporation,entered into a joint venture agreement jva to exploit oil and gas resources with an entity designated by the government of turkmenistan,then recently liberated from the soviet union.turkmenistan was rich in resources,but poor in technical expertise.bridas was designated as the foreign party in the joint venture keimir named for the region in which exploration would be conducted.the turkmenian party to the agreement has been an entity wholly owned by the government,whose identity was designated and at will by the president of turkmenistan and has changed a number of times during the life of the joint venture turkmenneft is the last entity to step into the role of turkmenian party.under the jva,the turkmenian party was entitled to receive hydrocarbon production up to the november levels,while the parties would split any subsequent increase in production.the jva secured an unlimited export license for hydrocarbons 
notwithstanding that the jva was intended to last years,the relationship among bridas,the turkmenian party,and the government soured quickly.the government insisted,among other things,on raising its share of future proceeds.to force bridas submission,the government ordered bridas in november to halt operations in keimir and cease making imports into and exports from turkmenistan.
six months later,bridas commenced an arbitration proceeding,as provided in the jva,against the government and turkmenneft under the auspices of the international chamber of commerce.after bridas filed its arbitration complaint,the government dissolved the turkmenian party in the jva,replacing it with turkmenneft.the government further abolished its ministry of oil and gas.more importantly,the government decreed that all proceeds from oil and gas exports in the country were to be directed to a special state oil and gas development fund the fund assets were declared immune from seizure 
the arbitration was held by agreement in houston,texas,and covered nineteen days of trial proceedings plus the introduction of voluminous documentary evidence.a series of arbitration decisions was issued during the next several years by a panel majority.pertinent here,the panel held that the government was a proper party to the arbitration and that the tribunal had the authority to adjudicate bridas dispute with the government.the tribunal held both turkmenneft and the government liable for repudiating the jva.in early,the tribunal issued its final award of million in damages to bridas.
the dispute then moved to federal court in houston as the parties filed cross motions to confirm,modify,or reject the arbitration award.the district court initially upheld the award,concluding that the government was bound by the jva under principles of agency and estoppel.this court,in bridas government of turkmenistan bridas i,cir,considered several theories that could bind a to an arbitration agreement agency,alter ego,estoppel,and beneficiary rejecting all but one of those theories,bridas i remanded for further consideration of the alter ego doctrine,as it found the district court analysis of this highly issue incomplete and insufficient.the district court was instructed to take into account all of the aspects of the relationship between the government and turkmenneft.id.at.because this court resolved other issues concerning the award in bridas favor,the sole issue on remand was reconsideration of the alter ego theory.
the district court on remand reviewed many of the factors identified by this court as pertinent and held that there was an insufficient showing of complete domination or extensive control so as to warrant a finding that turkmenneft was the alter ego of the government of turkmenistan.bridas has appealed from the district court resulting decision to vacate the award against the government.
ii.discussion 
as was noted in bridas i,federal courts are not bound by the arbitration panel findings holding the government liable to bridas bridas i,at.we review the district court alter ego determination only for clear error.zahra spiritual trust united states,cir.any errors of law are not entitled to such deference and are reviewed de novo.scott construction company city of jackson,cir.
a bedrock principle of corporate law is that a parent corporation is not liable for actions taken by its subsidiaries.united states bestfoods,d.the same concepts of corporate separateness have been applied to business entities owned by foreign governments.first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba bancec,d.however,courts will apply the alter ego doctrine and hold a parent liable for the actions of its instrumentality in the name of equity when the corporate form is used as a sham to perpetrate a fraud.pan eastern exploration hufo oils,cir.in making an alter ego determination,a court is concerned with reality and not form,and with how the corporation operated.united states chemicals,cir.unlike the theory of agency,which interprets a contractual relationship,bridas i,at,alter ego examines the actual conduct of the parent its subsidiary.
the alter ego doctrine,like all variations of piercing the corporate veil doctrine,is reserved for exceptional cases.in re multiponics,cir.the doctrine applies only if the owner exercised complete control over the corporation with respect to the transaction at issue and such control was used to commit a fraud or wrong that injured the party seeking to pierce the veil.bridas i,at.given the difficulty of analyzing the control factors in this case,we first address the fraud or injustice prong.
fraud or injustice 
to prevail,bridas had to demonstrate that the government used its control over turkmenneft to commit a fraud or injustice against bridas.see banco,at.at edwards monogram,cir.the government asserts that only no other type of this prong of the alter ego test.edwards and other cases plainly envision a broader scope that includes the misuse of the corporate form to promote injustice.see edwards,at.in both and subway equip.leasing sims in re sims,cir,this court explained that fraud may be required to pierce the corporate veil in contract cases,because the party seeking to utilize the doctrine has had the opportunity,during negotiations with a subsidiary,to obtain assurances of payment from its parent.even there,however,the decisions acknowledge that the test may be met through an illegal act or misuse of the corporate form.sims,at.in this contract dispute,bridas thus had to connect the government misuse of its subsidiary turkmenneft to the fraud or injustice against it.
in this case,the act of injustice on which the district court focused was the government export ban,which was accomplished through the government exercise of sovereign control of turkmenistan borders,not through governmental control of turkmenneft.the government exercise of its sovereign powers may have constituted a wrong to bridas,but it was not a wrong based on misuse of the corporate organizational form.contrary to the court conclusion,the export ban is not a fraud or injustice for alter ego purposes.
