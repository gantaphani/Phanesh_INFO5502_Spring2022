factual background 
the following facts are described in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.on november,as roger owensby left a sunoco gas station convenience store,he was stopped by three cincinnati police jorg,patrick caton and david suspected him to be an individual who had fled from officer hunter in the same area in a incident on september.at least at the beginning of this encounter,owensby fully cooperated with the officers,truthfully answering their questions and consenting to a thorough search that yielded no sign of any weapon or contraband.at some point,however,the encounter became contentious,and officer hunter accused owensby of being the individual who had previously fled from him.owensby then attempted to slip past the officers,but was immediately tackled by jorg and caton and landed face down in the parking lot.jorg pinned owensby in a prone position with his arms under his chest while caton rested on owensby legs.caton issued an officer needs assistance call,and the officers began struggling with owensby in an attempt to handcuff him.during the course of this struggle,caton struck owensby in the lower back and right arm and used his baton to strike his legs at the same time,jorg placed owensby in a head wrap,employed a mandibular angle pressure point pain compliance technique and placed his knee on owensby left shoulder.
by way of background,the city of cincinnati and the village of golf manor are signatories to a hamilton county local government mutual aid agreement for law enforcement,which provides for reciprocal police services across jurisdictional lines.as a result,when caton called for assistance,officers from both the city of cincinnati and the village of golf manor responded.cincinnati police officer darren sellers,who had been in a nearby parking lot,was one of the first to arrive on the scene.he testified that upon his arrival,owensby was not moving and that it was impossible to discern whether the difficulty the officers were experiencing in extracting owensby arms from underneath him was because owensby was resisting or because of the combined weight of the officers and owensby.sellers eventually was able to handcuff owensby,at which point he announced,he cuffed.
allegedly after owensby was handcuffed,however,caton demanded that hunter spray mace at him.hunter instructed jorg to lift owensby head so that he could mace him directly in the face.jorg pulled owensby head up,turned his own head away,and drove his knees into owensby back.despite a police policy directing officers to spray chemical irritants five to ten feet from an individual,hunter proceeded to spray mace directly into owensby eyes and nose from a distance of six inches,and he did this twice.owensby reacted only by grimacing he did not cough or make a sound.furthermore,despite owensby lack of resistance,sellers and hunter saw caton repeatedly strike owensby in the back,only ceasing after hunter exclaimed,what the hell is he doing at this point,owensby face was cut and bleeding,and jorg and caton had owensby blood on the sleeves of their shirts.
meanwhile,two golf manor police officers,robert heiland and chris campbell,had arrived on the scene.because the golf manor police cruiser was the nearest to the arrest scene,jorg and caton asked heiland permission to place owensby in the back seat of that cruiser,and heiland agreed.the cincinnati officers picked up the prone owensby,carried him to the golf manor cruiser and placed and possibly the back seat.caton went to the other side of the cruiser,dragged owensby headfirst into the seat and appeared to continue to beat owensby.after the beating stopped,owensby was left in the back seat of the cruiser with the doors locked.
cincinnati police officer brian brazile soon arrived on the scene and peered into the golf manor cruiser with his flashlight.noting that owensby was bleeding and appeared unable to breathe,he said to heiland and campbell,who were standing near the back door of the cruiser,this looks f ed up.can he breathe it do look like he can from the way he laying.nevertheless,heiland,campbell and brazile failed to investigate owensby condition any further and did not attempt to provide him with any medical care.
cincinnati police officer victor spellen also arrived on the scene,and his cruiser video camera recorded all of the subsequent activity around the golf manor cruiser.at this point,at least eleven cincinnati police officers and two golf manor officers were either on the scene or in the immediate of whom were trained emergency medical no officer attempted to provide any medical care to owensby.instead,the uncontroverted testimony indicates that the officers greeted each other,secured items that might have been dropped,prepared for the arrival of their supervisors and made sure that their uniforms were intact.only spellen and brazile looked at owensby,and both commented that he appeared to be hurting a great deal.
approximately six minutes after owensby was placed in the golf manor cruiser,cincinnati police sergeant watts arrived and asked heiland to roll down the window so that he could check on him.watts promptly discovered that owensby was not breathing.owensby was removed from the cruiser and given cpr,and emergency medical technicians from a local fire rescue department were summoned.the first responding unit arrived four minutes later,but was unable to resuscitate owensby.owensby was pronounced dead at at the university of cincinnati hospital.the coroner ruled his death a homicide resulting from police intervention asphyxiation during restraint attempts.
