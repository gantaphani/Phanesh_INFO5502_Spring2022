this interlocutory appeal raises a discrete and important question can an agency,for purposes of the age discrimination in employment act adea,be regarded as the employer of those whom it licenses and regulates the court below answered this question in the affirmative and,accordingly,ruled that the puerto rico ports authority the authority was,for adea purposes,the de facto employer of the harbor pilots whom it licenses and regulates.see camacho ports,d,camacho i.
whatever the theoretical possibilities,we do not agree that,in the circumstances of this case,a de facto employment relationship exists.the sockdolager here is that the statutory power to license and regulate harbor pilots does not imbue the authority with the level of control necessary to make it their employer for adea purposes.consequently,we reverse.
background 
oscar camacho worked for over eighteen years as a harbor pilot in the port of san juan.all harbor pilots are required to be licensed,laws ann,and at all times relevant hereto the government instrumentality and public corporation whose prerogatives include the regulation of pilotage in puerto rico ports and harbors,id,as the licensing agency.in that capacity,the authority licensed camacho to serve as a harbor pilot.
on june,the authority reversed course and summarily revoked the license.at that time,camacho had celebrated his seventieth birthday,and the authority acted pursuant to a statute providing that e very license shall automatically expire on the date in which the pilot reaches seventy years of age.id.
camacho did not take the revocation lightly.after exhausting his administrative remedies,he sued the authority in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.in pertinent part,his complaint alleged that the authority had discriminated against him on account of his age in violation of the adea,specifically,a 
section a of the adea imposes liability only on employers.see kimel.bd.of regents,d.seizing upon this limitation,the authority moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was not camacho employer.camacho objected and the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.see c.
the magistrate judge rejected the authority position.examining the relationship between the authority and the harbor pilots through the prism of common law agency,he concluded that although harbor pilots are not employees in the typical sense,the statutory scheme gives the authority such wide latitude to control the daily activities of harbor pilots as to make the authority the pilots employer for adea purposes.camacho i,d at see also id.at.
moving to the next issue,the magistrate judge declared that compulsory retirement of harbor pilots at age seventy would violate the adea unless age was shown to be a bona fide occupational qualification within the ambit of f.id.at.since that entailed a disputed question of material fact,he denied the authority motion for summary judgment on the adea claim.id.at.
dismayed with the denial of its motion and with the reasoning upon which that denial rested,the authority asked the magistrate judge to certify various aspects of his ruling for immediate appeal.see b allowing,subject to certain conditions,interlocutory review of an order that involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion if its resolution may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.section b is meant to be used sparingly,and appeals under it are,accordingly,hen teeth rare.they require,among other things,leave of both the trial and appellate courts.see see generally in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir heddendorf goldfine in re heddendorf,cir.
in this case,the magistrate judge granted the request,noting that the authority status qua adea employer constitutes an open question and that the litigation would benefit from prompt resolution of that question.camacho ports,d.sharing this appraisal,we agreed to consider whether the harbor pilots could be considered employees of the authority for purposes of the adea.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court rulings on summary judgment de novo.plumley container,cir garside osco drug,cir.the facts that bear upon the certified question are,for all intents and purposes,undisputed.thus,we may decide the employment status issue as a matter of law to the extent that the undisputed facts point so favorably in one direction that a factfinder could not reasonably reach the opposite conclusion.corporacion de para la difusion publica,cir.this is such a case.
the relevant section of the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual age.a.the statute defines an employer as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees.id.b.for this purpose,the word person includes state agencies and instrumentalities id.absent a covered employment relationship,adea liability does not attach.see generally speen crown clothing,cir explaining that the prophylaxis of the adea does not reach independent contractors frankel bally,cir same.
the authority does not dispute that it could be considered an adea employer of those persons it hires and fires.it insists,however,that it is not an employer of harbor pilots.accordingly,the question in this case reduces to whether harbor pilots,who lack a conventional employment relationship with the authority,properly may be regarded as the authority employees for adea purposes.the statutory definition of an employee as an individual employed by any employer,id.f,is circular and,thus,affords us scant guidance in our attempt to answer this question.
given the opacity of the statutory text,courts have been forced to develop their own approaches to determining whether an entity is acting as an employer within the purview of the adea.some courts attempt to answer that question by a hybrid test that marries traditional common law agency principles with the economic realities of a particular relationship.see,mangram motors,cir oestman farmers union ins,cir fields hallsville indep.sch,cir per curiam.this court has rejected that approach and chosen instead to apply common law agency principles simpliciter in determining when an employment relationship exists for purposes of the adea.see speen,at,at adopting the same test to determine whether an employment relationship exists for purposes of title vii.we are not alone several other circuits have made the same choice.see,shah deaconess,cir barnhart life ins,cir frankel,at.we adhere to that test here.
the common law agency test is familiar.the supreme court restated the baseline formulation in nationwide mutual insurance darden,d.there,the court posited that,i n determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency,an inquiring court should consider the hiring party right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished.id.at.the court then elaborated 
among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required the source of the instrumentalities and tools the location of the work the duration of the relationship between the parties whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party the extent of the hired party discretion over when and how long to work the method of payment the hired party role in hiring and paying assistants whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party whether the hiring party is in business the provision of employee benefits and the tax treatment of the hired party.
id.at.quoting cmty.for creative reid,d.no one factor is outcome determinative rather,all the incidents of a given relationship must be weighed in order to reach a conclusion as to whether that relationship fits within the confines of the taxonomy.id.at.
of course,this case presents an unusual twist.as a general matter,liability under section a depends upon the existence of a direct relationship,and none exists here.but there is what some have called an exception to this general rule for an entity that so extensively controls an aggrieved party employm
