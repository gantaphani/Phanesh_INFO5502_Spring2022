on june,kimberly and lawrence schroder suffered every parent worst nightmare.their son,stephen,was struck and killed by a car traveling miles per hour in a zone on the street in front of their house.while no law provides true recourse for such a loss,the schroders and local prosecutors sought some relief under the traditional civil and criminal causes of action authorized by state law,then the schroders sought relief under a civil cause of action under federal law.in this claim,the schroders submit that the city of fort thomas and some of its municipal officers violated their son substantive due process rights by failing to act upon their request and the requests of others to lower the speed limit on the street from miles per hour to miles per hour and by failing to enforce the speed limit on the street.the district court rejected this claim as a matter of law.because the due process clause establishes a limitation on the state power to act,not a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security,deshaney winnebago county dep t of social,d,we must affirm.
the city of fort thomas,kentucky opened garrison avenue on june.more than years later,on april,the city restricted traffic on garrison to southeasterly travel and set the speed limit at miles per hour,ten miles per hour below the state of kentucky permitted maximum speed limit of miles per hour on residential streets.see.
despite periodic complaints from the residents of garrison avenue,the speed limit remained in effect for the next years.among the garrison avenue residents who complained to city officials about the speed limit was kimberly schroder.in may,schroder moved with her family,including two children,to garrison avenue,and shortly thereafter she began to complain about the speed of traffic and the amount of traffic on the street.on several occasions between and,schroder told the police that garrison was being used as a between two busier streets and that drivers routinely exceeded the speed limit.the police advised her to report license plate numbers of suspected traffic violators,though they did not take or promise to take any further action against those violators or any actions regarding the conditions on garrison avenue.the police also removed signs posted by residents indicating that drivers should adhere to a speed limit because children in the area were playing.according to city administrative officers,none of schroder requests was approved by the city.
on june,just over years after its creation,garrison avenue became the scene of a tragic accident.at that evening,a car traveling at an estimated speed of miles per hour struck and killed stephen schroder,the schroders son,as he attempted to cross the street in front of his home.the driver of the car,phillip bridges,pleaded guilty to manslaughter for stephen schroder death and ultimately settled a civil tort suit with the schroders arising from the accident.in august of,in response to the accident,the city lowered the speed limit on garrison avenue to miles per hour.
on june,the schroders filed this action against the city and several of its mary brown,city manager jeff earlywine,building services director ron dill,public works foreman marvin dawson and chief of police steven schmidt.in their complaint,the schroders alleged that the city failure to maintain safe conditions on garrison avenue violated their son substantive due process rights.the city creation of garrison avenue in,its management of the road since that date and its adoption and inadequate enforcement of a speed limit,the schroders argued,established a danger under deshaney and kallstrom city of columbus,cir.the schroders also brought claims for negligence,wrongful death and loss of consortium under state law against the same defendants.while acknowledging that the dips and rises on garrison made it one of the more hazardous streets in the city,ja testimony of officer michael lehkamp,the city argued that the due process clause does not regulate a local municipality enforcement of its own traffic laws.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment on the and federal claims in the city favor on january.on appeal,the schroders have challenged only the district court resolution of their federal constitutional claims.
the claims against the city and the individual defendants,as an initial matter,implicate different theories of liability.under monell department of social services,d,a local government may be held liable under only for the adoption of a policy or custom that violates federally protected rights.id.at.under saucier katz,d,government officials sued in their individual capacities may be held liable under only when they violate federally protected rights that are clearly established.id.at.we need not address the and issues in this case,however,because both theories share an initial violation of a federally protected has not been satisfied.neither need we address the schroders procedural due process argument because it was not presented in their complaint,or their argument that the district court abused its discretion in striking a late affidavit explaining the dangers of a speed limit because including the affidavit in the record would not alter our constitutional analysis.
in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d,the supreme court held that the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.id.at.in that case,a child named joshua deshaney was beaten and permanently injured by his father,with whom he lived and about whom county social workers had received several abuse complaints.id.at.despite the fact that county officials had reason to believe that the abuse was ongoing and despite the fact that they did not act to remove joshua from his father custody,the court held that the county actions did not violate the due process clause.n othing in the language of the due process clause itself,the court reasoned,requires the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors,because t he clause is phrased as a limitation of the state power to act,not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.id.at.see also town of castle rock gonzales,d.
there are two exceptions to the deshaney rule,one established by deshaney itself,the other by decisions of this court.under the first exception,when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general.deshaney,at.having incarcerated persons with demonstrated proclivities for antisocial criminal,and often violent,conduct,having stripped them of virtually every means of and foreclosed their access to outside aid,the government and its officials are not free to let the state of nature take its course.farmer brennan,d citations,brackets and quotations omitted.under the second exception,where a state creates a perilous situation that renders citizens more vulnerable to danger at the hands of private actors,a plaintiff may bring a substantive due process claim by establishing an affirmative act by the state that either created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be exposed to private acts of violence,see kallstrom city of columbus,cir a special danger to the plaintiff created by state action,as distinguished from a risk that affects the public at large,see and the requisite state culpability to establish a substantive due process violation,ewolski city of brunswick,cir.we have described the requisite culpability factor as requiring deliberate indifference by the government entity when the entity had time to deliberate on what to do.bukowski city of akron,cir.
the schroders claim implicates the deshaney prohibition,and they can not bring themselves within either of its exceptions.deshaney holding that the constitution does not guarantee cer
