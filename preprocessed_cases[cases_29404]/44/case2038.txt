dean kinney and david hall brought suit against seven law enforcement officials,the seven cities or counties that employ these officials,and the east texas police chiefs association,asserting four claims a claim alleging conspiracy against kinney and hall because of their testimony in judicial proceedings,a claim alleging violations of their rights to freedom of speech under the first amendment,a claim alleging violations of their fourteenth amendment rights to due process of law,and a state law claim alleging tortious interference with business relations.the law enforcement officials now bring an interlocutory appeal of the district court order denying their motion for summary judgment,in which they asserted qualified immunity against the federal claims and state official immunity against the tort claim.a panel of this court affirmed in part and reversed in part.kinney weaver,cir,vacated and reh g en banc granted,cir.on rehearing en banc,we now affirm the district court order denying the officials claim of immunity from the claim,the first amendment claim,and the state law claim given material factual disputes,these claims can not be disposed of on summary judgment.we reverse the district court order denying immunity from the plaintiffs due process claim.
factual and procedural background 
while many of the basic facts in this case are uncontested,a number of the legally relevant facts are still disputed at this stage.in parts ii and iii of this opinion,we elaborate the appellate prism through which we must view the facts in this interlocutory appeal from the district court decision denying qualified immunity.as we explain there,we are required to accept the truth of the plaintiffs summary judgment evidence,and we lack jurisdiction to review the genuineness of those factual disputes that precluded summary judgment in the district court.nonetheless,for ease of understanding and later discussion,our recitation of the facts will note both sides assertions with respect to the material points of disagreement.
at the time of the events giving rise to this case,kinney and hall were instructors at the east texas police academy etpa,a division of kilgore college in kilgore,texas.founded by the east texas police chiefs association in,the etpa provides basic and advanced training for law enforcement officers in the greater east texas area.kinney and hall had been working at the etpa for seventeen years and six years,respectively,under renewable employment contracts.the seven law enforcement officials collectively the police officials asserting qualified immunity in this case are police chiefs or sheriffs who possess final authority over the training of the officers employed by their respective agencies before the fall of,the police officials enrolled their officers in etpa courses on a regular basis,including courses taught by kinney and hall.the police officials were not contractually bound to continue using either the etpa services or the services of kinney and hall in particular.
in august,kinney and hall testified as expert witnesses for the family of edward gonzales,a teenager who was fatally shot by a police sniper employed by the city of kerrville,texas.the kerrville case did not involve officers who had trained at the etpa or police agencies that sent trainees to the etpa,as kerrville lies several hundred miles from kilgore,outside the region from which the etpa draws its students kinney and hall had never before testified as expert witnesses against police officers,though kinney had previously testified as an expert in defense of the police.the lawyer for the victim family in the kerrville case approached the two instructors because he had experienced difficulty finding local experts who were willing to testify against the police.
based on their knowledge and experience as law enforcement instructors specializing in the use of force and firearms,kinney and hall testified that the kerrville police officer had used excessive force and that the kerrville police department had failed to implement the proper policies necessary to direct the conduct of officers acting as snipers.kinney and hall were technically under subpoena in the kerrville case,but they testified voluntarily.although kinney and hall originally planned to receive payment for their services,they decided,shortly after their depositions and before trial,that they would decline payment.kinney explanation for this decision,confirmed by hall,is that the two felt so strongly about the incident and what had happened to eddie gonzales that they concluded that it would be right to charge.
soon after kinney and hall testified in the kerrville case,william holda,the president of kilgore college,received letters from some of the police officials threatening to stop using the etpa for officer training.in a letter dated september,kilgore director of public safety ronnie moore told holda that he was concerned about the instructors recent inquiries regarding a gun confiscated by the kilgore police,because i t is a well known fact within this agency that these instructors had previously testified in another matter,against other officers.moore said that testimony offered in support of the police was acceptable and reasonable,but kinney and hall testimony is in direct conflict with the basic fundamentals and expectations that we have come to enjoy from academy instructors.moore informed holda that d ue to these circumstances,our agency will be exploring other options to provide the professional training necessary for our officers.
in a letter dated september,charles williams,the chief of the city of marshall police department,also complained to holda about the instructors expert testimony.he wrote,i think it is deplorable that instructors for our police academy hire themselves out as an expert witness against law enforcement agencies.williams stated further that t he marshall police department will not attend any courses taught by david hall or dean kinney due to the liability they place on this police department.williams attached three newspaper articles that mentioned kinney and hall roles as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs in the kerrville case.
the summary judgment evidence submitted by kinney and hall includes williams deposition,in which he testified that he learned of kinney and hall involvement in the kerrville case when he received,probably in august,an anonymous package containing the three newspaper articles that he attached to his letter to holda.in addition to the articles,the package contained a note telling williams to contact moore for more information,which williams did shortly after receiving the package.
williams forwarded copies of his september,letter and the attached articles to moore and four of the other police officials,namely,bill young,the chief of police for the city of tyler bob green,the sheriff of harrison county bobby weaver,the sheriff of gregg county and smith,the sheriff of smith county.the set of documents that williams forwarded to young,which is in the summary judgment record,also included a copy of moore september letter to holda.
young sent a letter to holda on september,the day after he received the letters and articles from williams.young wrote that he was greatly disturbed by the recent news that hall and kinney have acted in the capacity of expert witnesses to testify against another law enforcement agency and it sic officers.he emphasized he was writing not only as chief of police of an agency that is one of your largest customers,but also as president of the east texas police chief sic association.noting that i t is not our preference to have these two instructors teach our officers and also engage in legal combat with them in the judicial system,young stated that t his matter will force us to consider alternative methods to achieve our training needs if not resolved as soon as possible.
in an attempt to address the defendants complaints,holda met with moore,williams,and young on september.also in attendance were three other law enforcement officers to whom williams had forwarded copies of his letter to holda,including defendant green.in his affidavit,holda gave an account of this meeting that was largely confirmed by moore,williams,young,and green in their depositions.according to holda,all four men made it clear that they wanted hall and kinney removed from the etpa faculty because their testimony in the kerrville trial created a conflict of interest with their etpa responsibilities and that they would no longer send officers and recruits to the etpa for training if hall and kinney remained on the academy faculty.
defendants moore,williams,and green later agreed to send students to the etpa on the condition that their officers not be instructed by kinney and hall,but holda affidavit reports that young continued to insist that kinney and hall also be removed from the etpa faculty completely.according to holda,the stated reason for the attendees refusals to send their officers and recruits for training by hall and kinney was that their testimony in the kerrville trial criticized the law enforcement officer on trial.testifying in kerrville had,in the view of the defendants,created a conflict of interest between the plaintiffs and law enforcement officers and the law enforcement community.
the defendants repeatedly expressed a concern that kinney and hall testimony created conflicts of interest and violated principles of cooperative responsibility,but their letters and affidavits do not elaborate upon the import of those phrases.in their depositions,some of the police officials admitted that,in their view,an unacceptable conflict of interest exists whenever a police instructor testifies against a police officer,regardless of location and regardless of whether the instructor had trained the officer.such a conflict does not exist,in their view,when an instructor testifies for police officers.
shortly after the september meeting,holda met with kinney and hall to apprise them of the situation.kinney and hall assured holda that they would never testify as experts against any officer who had been trained at the etpa or any agency that had sent officers to the etpa for training kinney further promised that he would not accept payment for any future work on behalf of plaintiffs in police misconduct cases.in a letter dated october,holda conveyed kinney and hall assurances to the attendees of the september meeting and invited them to attend another meeting along with other east texas law enforcement officials for the purpose of discussing their concerns directly with kinney and hall.none of the invitees indicated an interest in such a meeting or came to the etpa on the date suggested by holda.hall states in his affidavit that one of the defendants told him,on october,that the instructors had committed a sin for which they could get no forgiveness.
on october,the east texas police chiefs association held its quarterly meeting in kilgore.the attendance was unusually large.all of the police officials were present,except for smith,who later spoke to a deputy who had attended the meeting.the minutes of this meeting reflect that kinney and hall involvement in the kerrville case was prominent on the agenda.defendants young who was president of the east texas police chiefs association at the time,williams,moore,gibson,and weaver voiced their disapproval of kinney and hall work on behalf of the plaintiffs in the kerrville case,and all five officials stated their intention to ensure that kinney and hall did not train their officers.subsequently,the minutes state that it was agreed that none of the chiefs or sheriffs present would send their officers to any classes taught by either kinney or hall.the minutes do not reflect discussion of any other complaints concerning kinney and hall,nor do they reflect any mention of the substance of the instructors testimony in kerrville.some of the defendants admitted in their depositions that they did not know what kinney and hall had said in the kerrville trial,only that they had testified against the police.
several local media organizations reported on the controversy that had arisen between the etpa and some of the area police agencies.on television and in print,several defendants are documented announcing their intention either to use a training institution other than the etpa or to bar their officers from taking kinney and hall courses.smith was quoted as stating that kinney and hall had prostituted themselves by testifying against another officer.young was shown on television stating that he would not send officers to the etpa until kinney and hall were reassigned or fired.a newspaper article quoted holda as saying that young was asking me to do something he would do.according to holda,the instructors had received excellent evaluations and their testimony was freedom of speech.weaver told a television reporter that kinney and hall had violated an unwritten code.
the police officials followed through on their threats both by cancelling enrollments in the plaintiffs classes and by barring their officers from enrolling in the plaintiffs courses in the future.the summary judgment evidence indicates that this boycott was quite effective.holda stated that kinney and hall courses were boycotted by a sufficient number of law enforcement agencies so that enrollment was insufficient to make their classes and,therefore,could not be economically continued.the boycott began in october,and by november,all of kinney and hall basic classes had been dropped from the etpa schedule,and many of their classes had been cancelled.
aware that the enrollment in his courses was down and concerned that he would not be able to withstand a cut in pay,hall resigned from the etpa effective january,because he anticipated that his etpa contract would not be renewed.he was hired as a patrol officer at the carrollton police department,the job he had left to work at the etpa six years earlier.
kinney etpa teaching contract extended through the academic year,and he continued to teach during that time.the boycott remained in effect,however,and the etpa provided alternate instructors for all of kinney classes to ensure that the law enforcement agencies that refused to enroll their officers in kinney courses could still send trainees to the etpa.kinney stated in his affidavit that he had minimal class time during the first few months of the calendar year specifically,he had no time in the basic police academy and very little in the classes.in their depositions taken in august,the police officials stated that they continued to prohibit enrollment either in kinney courses or in all etpa courses because kinney remained on the etpa faculty.
kilgore college did not renew kinney contract for his position as an etpa instructor,but rather offered him a contract as a lecturer in the criminal justice department of kilgore college for the following academic year.the salary for this position was less than kinney earned as an etpa instructor.he had not taught in the criminal justice department previously,but rather had been an etpa instructor for the entire period that he had been working for kilgore college.according to holda,kilgore college did not anticipate a change in the teaching assignment for either kinney or hall prior to the decisions by certain law enforcement agencies to boycott classes taught by hall and kinney.
on april,kinney and hall filed a complaint in federal district court against the seven police officials,their respective cities or counties of employment,and the east texas police chiefs association,alleging that the defendants had blackballed kinney and hall in retaliation for their truthful testimony on behalf of the victim of a police shooting.kinney and hall claimed violations of their rights to testify freely under,their rights to free speech under the first and fourteenth amendments,their rights to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment,and texas tort law.the defendants both the police officials and the entities moved for summary judgment on the merits of all four claims,and the police officials also asserted qualified immunity from the plaintiffs federal claims and state official immunity from the state tort claim.the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on all grounds.kinney,d at.
the police officials brought an interlocutory appeal of the district court order denying summary judgment on their immunity defenses.a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court order denying immunity with respect to the plaintiffs claims under,the first amendment,and state law,but we reversed the district court with respect to the due process claim.kinney,at.the en banc court granted rehearing in an order dated july,cir,and we heard oral argument on september.
ii.jurisdiction 
we must first address our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.this court has jurisdiction over appeals of final decisions of the district courts.see.although a denial of a defendant motion for summary judgment is ordinarily not immediately appealable,the supreme court has held that the denial of a motion for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review.see mitchell forsyth,d our jurisdiction is significantly limited,however,for it extends to such appeals only to the extent that the denial of summary judgment turns on an issue of law.id.
as will be explained in greater detail below,officials enjoy qualified immunity to the extent that their conduct is objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.see harlow fitzgerald,d.whenever the district court denies an official motion for summary judgment predicated upon qualified immunity,the district court can be thought of as making two distinct determinations,even if only implicitly.first,the district court decides that a certain course of conduct would,as a matter of law,be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.second,the court decides that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendant s did,in fact,engage in such conduct.according to the supreme court,as well as our own precedents,we lack jurisdiction to review conclusions of the second type on interlocutory appeal.see johnson jones,d lemoine new horizons ranch,cir stated differently,in an interlocutory appeal we can not challenge the district court assessments regarding the sufficiency of the is,the question whether there is enough evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true 
we do,however,have jurisdiction to the review the first type of determination,the purely legal question whether a given course of conduct would be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.see behrens pelletier,d stating that johnson permits a defendant official to claim on appeal that all of the conduct which the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the harlow standard of objective legal reasonableness.that is,we have jurisdiction only to decide whether the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that officials are not entitled to qualified immunity on a given set of facts.as one of our cases succinctly puts it,we can review the materiality of any factual disputes,but not their genuineness.wagner bay city,cir.
given the above,the plaintiffs suggestion before the panel that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal is incorrect.we do have jurisdiction,but only to the extent that the appeal concerns the purely legal question whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the facts that the district court found sufficiently supported in the summary judgment record.see behrens,at.
iii.standard of review 
the standard of review that we apply in an interlocutory appeal asserting qualified immunity differs from the standard employed in most appeals of summary judgment rulings.ordinarily,we would review the district court denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.see vela city of houston,cir.the district court,of course,applies the standard of rule,according to which summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.on appeal,we would ordinarily apply that same rule standard,and we would reverse the district court denial of summary judgment if we concluded that the district court found a genuine factual dispute when,on our own review of the record,no such genuine dispute exists.but,as explained above,in an interlocutory appeal we lack the power to review the district court decision that a genuine factual dispute exists.therefore,we do not apply the standard of rule but instead consider only whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.see behrens,at.jones,at.
where factual disputes exist in an interlocutory appeal asserting qualified immunity,we accept the plaintiffs version of the facts as true.wagner,at even where,as here,the district court has determined that there are genuine disputes raised by the evidence,we assume plaintiff version of the facts is true see also gonzales dallas county,cir o n interlocutory appeal the public official must be prepared to concede the best view of the facts to the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues raised by the appeal.when the district court fails to set forth the factual disputes that preclude granting summary judgment,we may be required to review the record in order to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.johnson,at.in this case,however,the district court wrote a detailed opinion that carefully identified those factual disputes that prevented summary judgment in so doing,the district court also assessed the factual import of the plaintiffs summary judgment evidence.given the nature of our jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal asserting qualified immunity,these factual disputes,together with the district court concomitant assessment of what facts are supported by the plaintiffs summary judgment evidence,necessarily play a critical role in our decision.we therefore set them forth at length 
the plaintiffs contend that the record reflects that the defendants blackballed or boycotted the plaintiffs classes at the academy because the plaintiffs broke the code of silence.
the defendants,on the other hand,have maintained that they refused to send their officers to classes taught by kinney and hall because of potential conflicts of interests 
the record is full of evidence,both circumstantial and direct,backing each of the respective party positions.after reviewing the record and the arguments of the parties,the court concludes that summary judgment is not appropriate and this case may proceed to trial.
kinney,d at.
there is ample evidence currently in the record for a jury to conclude that the defendants actions were intended to suppress the plaintiffs rights to free speech.
there is ample evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that the defendants conspired to deter the plaintiffs from testifying in court by boycotting their business.
there are genuine issues of fact remaining in this case as to whether the plaintiffs expert testimony could legitimately cause any disruptions in the defendants operations.moreover,it must be determined whether these disruptions,if any,were the result of a perceived conflict of interest or the blackballing of plaintiffs for turning against one of their own.
plaintiffs evidence reflects a dogged determination by the defendants to rid kilgore college of the plaintiffs as instructors in retaliation for speaking out about excessive force by police officers.the court concludes that the acts alleged in the complaint and found in the record,if proven at trial,would violate clearly established law.
in reviewing the district court conclusions concerning the legal the facts,our review is of course de novo.see lemoine,at.
iv.qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity seeks to strike a balance between competing social objectives,providing breathing space for the vigorous exercise of official authority while at the same time allowing a possibility of redress for victims of officials abuses.see butz economou,d.therefore,as against claims under federal law government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow,at.the supreme court noted in harlow that in most cases,the of which a reasonable person would have known language in the qualified immunity standard does not add anything to the clearly established law requirement because a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.id.at.not long after harlow,the court refined the qualified immunity standard by defining clearly established in a way that encompasses the objective reasonableness inquiry to be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.thus,as this court has recognized,in light of the anderson definition of clearly established,the question whether the right was clearly established at the time the defendant acted requires an assessment of whether the official conduct would have been objectively reasonable at the time of the incident.conroe creosoting montgomery county,cir.
the supreme court has recently provided us with additional guidance regarding the nature of clearly established law.it had already been known since anderson that the clearly established standard does not mean that officials conduct is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.at.in the court latest pronouncement on the subject,hope pelzer,d,the court held that one of our sister circuits had erred in defining clearly established law in such a way that qualified immunity was mandated unless the facts of past cases were materially similar to the conduct then being challenged.the requirement of materially similar facts,the court determined,was not consistent with our cases.id.
yet,at the same time,an official does not lose qualified immunity merely because a certain right is clearly established in the abstract.it is clearly established that the government may not deny due process or inflict cruel and unusual punishments,for example,but those abstract rules give officials little practical guidance as to the legality of particular conduct.qualified immunity should not be denied unless the law is clear in the more particularized sense that reasonable officials should be on notice that their conduct is unlawful.saucier katz,d.the central concept is that of fair warning the law can be clearly established despite notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and the cases then before the court,so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights.hope,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
a necessary concomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is clearly established at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all.siegert gilley,d.therefore,before engaging in the inquiry into whether the official unreasonably violated clearly established law,we should first determine whether the challenged conduct,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,would actually amount to a violation of federal law in the first place.saucier,at.in conducting this initial inquiry,we employ currently applicable constitutional standards.mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc per curiam.
claim under 
section provides,in relevant part 
if two or more persons in any state or territory conspire to deter,by force,intimidation,or threat,any party or witness in any court of the united states from attending such court,or from testifying to any matter pending therein,freely,fully,and truthfully,or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified 
in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section,if one or more persons engaged therein do,or cause to be done,any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy,whereby another is injured in his person or property,or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the united states,the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation,against any one or more of the conspirators.
according to kinney and hall,the police officials violated the statute by conspiring to mount a campaign of economic took the form of boycotting kinney and hall classes and attempting to have them account of the instructors testimony against a police officer in the kerrville case.the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that the plaintiffs had produced sufficient evidence of an illegal conspiracy and that the plaintiffs rights under were clearly established at the time.kinney,d at.
much of the argument in the district court concerned the issue of whether the plaintiffs adduced sufficient evidence of a conspiracy.the district court determination that there was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy is not at issue in this interlocutory appeal.instead,the police officials main argument on appeal has been the legal argument that offers no protection to expert witnesses,but instead reaches only fact witnesses.this argument faces an immediate textual impediment,inasmuch as the statute says any party or witness.nonetheless,the defendants would draw a distinction between the two kinds of witnesses based upon the assertion that expert testimony,unlike fact testimony,is readily accessible and can easily be replaced with the testimony of another expert.expert witnesses,in the defendants view,therefore need less protection from intimidation.the police officials contend,moreover,that the enacting congress could not have meant to protect expert witnesses because the practice of calling expert witnesses did not exist at the time that was enacted,in the aftermath of the civil war.
based upon the statute plain language,we have little difficulty in concluding that any party or witness includes expert witnesses.since the language is clear on this point,there is little room for the defendants arguments for excluding experts.in any case,to the extent that their arguments are relevant,they fail to persuade.the defendants are simply incorrect when they claim that the enacting congress could not have been familiar with expert witnesses.expert witnesses have been known for hundreds of years.see learned hand,historical and practical considerations regarding expert testimony,harv.leaving that to one side,the defendants are also incorrect in assuming that the statute reach is restricted to those factual scenarios that the enacting legislature could have specifically contemplated.on the contrary,the supreme court has instructed that civil rights statutes are to be given a sweep as broad as their language,griffin breckenridge,d alteration in original quoting united states price,d,ensuring that their protections remain relevant to modern circumstances 
in answer to the defendants argument that expert testimony is easily replaceable and therefore less worthy of protection than fact testimony,we would point out that expert testimony on police procedures will not be readily accessible if,as happened here,police officials can prevent the persons with the relevant expertise from testifying,even in cases hundreds of miles away this court cases involving sixth amendment claims of witness intimidation have not suggested that experts need less protection than fact witnesses.see,united states bieganowski,cir united states dupre,cir.in any case,the defendants unsupported conjectures about experts relative need for protection can not displace the text plain words any party or witness.we therefore hold that protects expert witnesses.
we further conclude that the statute coverage of expert witnesses was clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity.no reasonable official would find the terms any witness ambiguous on this point.although a body of cases is typically required in order to give clear shape to vague constitutional provisions referring to due process of law or cruel and unusual punishments,we believe that the text is itself sufficient to put reasonable officials on notice that the word witness includes expert witnesses no case of which we are aware has even remotely suggested that does not apply to experts.on the contrary,the only case addressing the issue treats it as obvious that the statute encompasses experts.see chahal paine webber,cir.given the clarity of the phrase any witness,the absence of more cases like chahal is hardly surprising.nor would an official find a basis for excluding experts if he or she happened to be familiar with the law in related contexts.as we have just mentioned,no distinction between fact witnesses and expert witnesses exists in our sixth amendment witness intimidation cases,nor is any such distinction drawn in cases involving the absolute immunity that protects witnesses from civil liability arising from their testimony 
the defendants make a more plausible argument when they assert that their conduct did not injure kinney and hall in their person s or property within the meaning of the statute.pointing out that they were not contractually obligated to continue sending their officers to the etpa or to any particular instructor for training,the police officials argue that kinney and hall lacked a property interest in the police officials enrollment of their officers in kinney and hall courses.the police officials further contend that kinney and hall were employees of the etpa thus,under precedents interpreting the due process clause,the instructors lacked any property interest in continued employment at the etpa consequently,the police officials argue,it would have been reasonable for them to believe that their conduct did not injure a witness in his person or property for purposes of the statute.
regarding the question whether the plaintiffs have set forth a violation of the statute under current law,the police officials argument is foreclosed by haddle garrison,d,in which the supreme court held that interference with employment relationships states a claim for relief under.id.at.in haddle,the court reasoned that because t he gist of the wrong at which is directed is not deprivation of property,but intimidation or retaliation against witnesses in proceedings,the loss of employment can injure a plaintiff for purposes of the statute even though he or she lacks a property interest for purposes of the due process clause.id.at.the police officials certainly interfered with kinney and hall employment within the meaning of haddle.not only did they avowedly act in concert to pull their students from the plaintiffs classes,but,according to the district court,they also tried to have the plaintiffs fired from their jobs.see kinney,d at referring to evidence of a dogged determination by the defendants to rid kilgore college of the plaintiffs see also supra at,recounting the police officials demands that kinney and hall be fired.the plaintiffs suffered economic injury as a result of the defendants actions kinney etpa contract was not renewed,and hall left the etpa in apprehension of suffering the same fate.holda affidavit confirms that,before the defendants began their campaign,the etpa anticipated renewing the plaintiffs contracts.coercing an employer into firing an employee is the classic case of interfering with employment relations 
although a precedent so commanding as haddle is not necessary to establish that a reasonably competent official would have understood that certain conduct was unlawful,we agree with the police officials that it was not clearly established before haddle that the property contemplated by included employment.the supreme court granted certiorari in haddle to resolve a split among the circuits with regard to the status of employment,at,and this circuit had not clearly announced its view on the subject.thus,given the absence of a definitive judicial interpretation of property for purposes of,coupled with the fact that employment is not property for purposes of the due process clause,we can not conclude that by its terms clearly established that interference with employment was injury to property.on this point,the law became clearly established only after haddle 
the police officials and judge barksdale argue that haddle is irrelevant to this case because it was issued on december,after the events of september and october,when the conspiracy began.they are mistaken in believing that the conduct that forms the basis of the plaintiffs statutory claim took place solely in or before october.subsection cause of action specifically extends liability to any persons who do,or cause to be done,any act in furtherance of the object of a conspiracy to injure a witness in retaliation for his or her testimony.emphasis added kinney and hall provided evidence that the police officials affirmatively committed act s in furtherance of their conspiracy to have kinney and hall removed from their etpa positions long after haddle,not just before.in particular,kinney and hall claim and the police officials conceded in their depositions that the police officials continued to prohibit their officers from enrolling in kinney or hall classes for the entire time that they were working as instructors at the etpa at least one of the defendants continued to boycott the entire etpa during that time.hall resignation from the etpa became effective on january,and kinney etpa contract did not expire until september.viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to kinney and hall,it is reasonable to infer that if the police officials had ceased their boycott in the wake of haddle,holda may have reconsidered his conclusion that it was no longer economically viable for kilgore college to offer kinney and hall courses,and thus kinney and hall might not have been injured.in the end,it may be that much of the damage was done while the police officials still enjoyed qualified immunity nonetheless,kinney and hall are entitled to pursue their claims for any damages traceable to act s in furtherance that occurred after the illegality of the police officials actions become clear.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to kinney and hall,the conduct at issue in this case falls within the core of meaning.there was sufficient evidence to show that the defendants agreed to retaliate against kinney and hall on account of the instructors testimony against police officers in a federal case,and,as in haddle,the retaliation took the form of interference with the instructors employment relationship,namely by boycotting their classes and pressuring the etpa to fire them.we thus conclude that the police officials conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law,and the district court properly denied their motion for summary judgment with respect to the claim.
we emphasize that the statute does not create liability for every adverse action taken against a witness after the witness testifies in a federal case.in addition to the requirement that there be a cognizable injury to the witness or his property discussed above,the statute itself contains another limiting principle the conspirator must threaten or injure the witness on account of his having so attended or testified that is,because of,and by reason of,a person participation as a witness.see webster third new international dictionary defining the phrase on account of to mean for the sake of by reason of because of the defendants have said that they had concerns about the instructors abilities and ethics.the district court found,however,that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the defendants acted to punish the plaintiffs because they had testified against the police.in further proceedings in this case,the defendants may be able to resolve this factual dispute in their favor.
vi.first amendment claim 
kinney and hall claim that the defendants unlawfully retaliated against them for exercising their rights to free speech guaranteed by the first amendment and made applicable to state actors by the fourteenth amendment.the district court evaluated the plaintiffs claim according to the law governing first amendment retaliation claims brought by public employees.see kinney,d at.acknowledging that kinney and hall were not employees of the police officials,the district court noted that in board of county commissioners umbehr,d,the supreme court held that the first amendment analysis applicable to claims by public employees also applies to first amendment claims brought by the government independent contractors.having considered the relationship between kinney and hall and the police agencies that have long used their services,the district court concluded that kinney and hall are the equivalent of governmental independent contractor s.kinney,d at citing umbehr,at.
as the district court recognized,a first amendment retaliation claim in the employment context has four elements the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment decision,the plaintiff speech involved a matter of public concern,the plaintiff interest in speaking outweighed the governmental defendant interest in promoting efficiency,and the protected speech motivated the defendant conduct.see lukan forest isd,cir.the district court determined that kinney and hall had proffered sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on those elements.first,the district court found that both instructors presented evidence that they had suffered adverse employment actions by being forced to accept lower paying jobs as a result of the police officials boycott.kinney,d at.second,the court determined that the plaintiffs testimony regarding the use of excessive force by police officers was unquestionably a matter of public concern.id.third,applying the balancing test set forth in pickering board of education,d,the district court determined that the balance weighed in favor of kinney and hall that is,the instructors interest in commenting on a matter of public concern outweighed the police officials interest in promoting the efficient delivery of public services.kinney,d at fourth,the district court found that the instructors speech motivated the police officials actions.id.then,turning specifically to the question of qualified immunity,the court determined that the relevant law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation and that the police officials conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of that clearly established law.see id.at.
as we noted in our analysis of the plaintiffs claims,the threshold issue in a qualified immunity inquiry is whether,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,kinney and hall have shown that the police officials conduct violated their constitutional rights.see saucier,at.only if we determine that the plaintiffs evidence shows a constitutional violation do we address the question whether t he contours of the right were sufficiently clear at the time of the alleged violation that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson,at.we begin,then,by asking whether the police officials conduct amounts to a violation of the plaintiffs right to free speech.this requires us first to identify the proper first amendment analysis.
a.what is the applicable first amendment analysis 
the first amendment shields speech not only from direct limitations but also from adverse government action against individual s because of their speech,including the denial of public benefits to punish individuals for their speech.colson grohman,cir.
at the outset,the police officials contend that their conduct is not actionable under the first amendment because their decisions on whether and where to enroll officers are discretionary in the sense that no contract required them to enroll their officers in kinney and hall courses.this assertion overlooks the fundamental point that governmental discretion is always constrained by the constitution.as the supreme court stated in perry sindermann,the locus classicus of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine 
for at least a,this court has made clear that even though a person has no right to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.it may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected,his interest in freedom of speech.
d.the county officials in umbehr were under no duty to place contracts with the plaintiff business,nor did the plaintiff have a right to those contracts it was an relationship.see umbehr,at.the point of such cases,as we have long made plain,is the government duty not to punish protected speech,not the citizen supposed right to government patronage in the instant case,the district court found sufficient evidence not only that the defendants deprived kinney and hall of the benefit of continued enrollment in their form of public also that at least some of the defendants sought to have the instructors removed from the academy altogether.that no contract forbade this is irrelevant.
the police officials also suggest that their relationship with kinney and hall was too attenuated to create the requisite governmental power over the instructors.specifically,the police officials argue that their conduct did not deny kinney and hall the benefit of employment because kilgore college,and not the police officials,held the authority to refuse to renew kinney and hall contracts.we reject this line of argument.the supreme court has made it clear that first amendment protection does not depend on whether the governmental action at issue is direct or indirect.to hold that the police officials conduct can not constitute a first amendment violation because they did not directly deprive kinney and hall of their jobs,but instead used governmental power to exert economic pressure on the instructors employer in order to achieve that same result,would allow the government to produce a result which it could not command directly.perry,at.quoting speiser randall,d alteration in original.the defendants attenuation argument is fundamentally misguided,for the situation in which the economic relationship between the government and the speaker is the most attenuated would be the case in which the speaker is an ordinary citizen with no ties to the government.in this limiting case for the defendants attenuation argument,the first amendment would plainly forbid the government from pressuring the citizen employer to fire the citizen as punishment for trial testimony that the government disliked.the degree of attenuation present in a given case may well bear on is,it may be easier for a government official to fire his own employee than to persuade a contractor to fire one of its this does not change the official first amendment duty.we thus reject the defendants initial arguments that the first amendment has no bearing on this case.
while all citizens enjoy the protections of the first amendment,the appropriate analytical framework for applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to a given first amendment claim depends on the context in which the claim arose.as the supreme court explained in umbehr,the cases form a spectrum ranging from,at one end,cases involving government employees,whose close relationship with the government requires a balancing of important free speech and government interests and,on the other end,cases involving ordinary citizens whose viewpoints on matters of public concern the government has no legitimate interest in repressing.at.
because the government has no legitimate interest in denying a benefit to ordinary citizens on account of their speech on matters of public concern,there is no interest balancing involved in the first amendment analysis for ordinary citizen cases.rather,the first amendment is violated in ordinary citizen cases if the individual engaged in conduct protected by the first amendment and the government took action against the person because of that protected conduct.see,rolf city of san antonio,cir.in governmental employee cases,by contrast,courts must be attentive to the t he government interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible,which interest is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.waters churchill,d plurality opinion.
the supreme court set out the basic analytical structure for governmental employee balancing cases in pickering board of education,at.in that case,the court held that a board of education violated a teacher first amendment rights by discharging him in retaliation for his criticism of the board budget decisions.id.at.in so holding,the court emphasized that government employees may not constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the first amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public institutions in which they work.id.at.the court also recognized,however,that the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.id.thus,explained the court,it is necessary to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at.
in umbehr and its companion case,truck service,city of northlake,d,the supreme court held that the governmental employee version of the unconstitutional conditions is,the pickering balancing also appropriate where an independent contractor alleges a first amendment violation against the government.see truck,at.umbehr,at.the court reasoned that i ndependent government contractors are similar in most relevant respects to government employees.umbehr,at.specifically,the court noted 
the government needs to be free to terminate both employees and contractors for poor performance,to improve the efficiency,efficacy,and responsiveness of service to the public,and to prevent the appearance of corruption.and,absent contractual,statutory,or constitutional restriction,the government is entitled to terminate them for no reason at all.but either type of relationship provides a valuable financial benefit,the threat of the loss of which in retaliation for speech may chill speech on matters of public concern by those who,because of their dealings with the government,are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work.
id.at.quoting waters,at.
as we have explained in past cases,the determination whether the relationship between the government and an individual falls on the governmental employee end of the umbehr spectrum turns on whether the relationship is sufficiently analogous to an employment relationship.see blackburn city of marshall,cir.applying this standard in blackburn,we held that the pickering balancing test was not applicable to a wrecker service owner first amendment retaliation claim against police officials for revoking his permission to use the police radio frequency after he criticized the police department contracting procedures.id.at.the revocation of radio privileges rendered the service unable to participate in a rotation system for removing damaged vehicles from the scenes of accidents.id.at.we reasoned in blackburn that the business relationship between the wrecker service owner and the police department did not implicate ties but was instead similar to the relationship between the parties in north mississippi communications,another case in which we applied the ordinary citizen version of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.see blackburn,at.north mississippi communications involved a newspaper first amendment claim alleging that county officials had ceased placing legal notices in the newspaper in retaliation for the newspaper publication of editorials that criticized the board and its members.at.we did not apply a pickering balancing test to the newspaper first amendment claim,but rather held that it would violate the constitution for the board to withhold public patronage,in the form of its advertising,in retaliation for that newspaper exercise of first amendment rights.id.
the parties in this case disagree over which first amendment balancing on the one hand or the ordinary citizen framework on the apply to this case.earlier,in arguing that their actions did not deny kinney and hall any actionable benefits for purposes of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,the police officials emphasized their lack of ties to kinney and hall.in support of their argument regarding the appropriate first amendment analysis,however,the police officials now characterize their relationship with the etpa and etpa instructors as sufficiently akin to employment to warrant a balancing of the police officials interests against the free speech interests at stake in this case.relying on north mississippi communications and worrell henry,cir,kinney and hall respond that the ordinary citizen analysis is better suited to the circumstances of the instant case than is the governmental employee test.in worrell,the tenth circuit declined to apply a pickering balancing test to a first amendment claim alleging that the law enforcement defendant pressured the plaintiff employer to rescind the plaintiff job offer in retaliation for the plaintiff having testified as an expert witness on behalf of a criminal defendant.see at.rather,the worrell court determined that the appropriate first amendment analysis for evaluating the plaintiff claim was the ordinary citizen version of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.see id.at.
we agree with the district court and the police officials that a pickering balancing analysis is appropriate in this case.the relationship between the police officials and etpa instructors such as kinney and hall implicates governmental interests similar to those involved in the public employment context.law enforcement agencies have a legitimate interest in exercising discretion over the choice of the instructors who train the officers who will,in turn,carry out the agencies public duties.those interests include,for example,ensuring that the instructors are competent and knowledgeable,that they are adept at conveying that knowledge to,and that they maintain a good working relationship with law enforcement agency officials so that those officials can monitor the training that their officers receive.these interests are all relevant to the ultimate governmental interest that the pickering balancing analysis is meant to protect,namely the interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services a law enforcement agency performs.pickering,at.
the defendants do not dispute that the instructors spoke on a matter of public concern,nor can they question in this interlocutory appeal the district court factual determinations regarding causation.accordingly,we now consider whether,under pickering,the district court correctly balanced the first amendment interest in protecting kinney and hall speech against the police officials interests in suppressing it.
was there a first amendment violation 
the pickering test requires us to balance the speaker first amendment interests against the government legitimate interests in the efficient provision of public services.in performing this balance,we must take care not to exceed the scope of our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction.as explained earlier,see supra parts,we must accept the existence of those genuine issues of fact identified by the district court and the district court concomitant characterization of the plaintiffs summary judgment evidence.the question for us is whether the district court committed legal error in balancing the interests supported by the summary judgment record,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the.
starting first with the plaintiffs side of the scales,we conclude that kinney and hall present an extremely strong first amendment interest.the weight of the first amendment interest is,of course,not measured solely by the instructors own personal gain,if any,from speaking it is,rather,a function of the social value of that speech.see,connick myers,d s peech concerning public affairs is more than it is the essence of.alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted brawner city of richardson,cir discussing,in the course of a pickering balancing case,the public interest in the disclosure of misconduct or malfeasance emphasis added.this court has emphasized the great first amendment significance of speech bearing on official misconduct,especially when it concerns the operation of a police department.brawner,at.indeed,because individuals working in law enforcement are often in the best position to know about the occurrence of official misconduct,umbehr,at,it is essential that such individuals be able to speak out freely about official misconduct,pickering,at.kinney and hall,two experienced law enforcement trainers with expertise in weapons and the use of force,are ideally placed to offer valuable public comment about excessive force and the adequacy of police training and supervision,the key issues in the kerrville trial moreover,as the district court pointed out,i ndividuals will have a hard time succeeding in an excessive force case without the assistance of experts who are intimately acquainted with police procedures.kinney,d at.expert testimony is thus essential both in providing victims with the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees,harlow,at,as well as in serving parallel deterrent function,see owen city of independence,d.we thus conclude that kinney and hall have a particularly weighty first amendment interest on their side of the pickering scales 
we turn next to the police officials side of the pickering balance.stated in its most general terms,the government has an interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services that the governmental agency performs.pickering,at.in the instant case,given the police officials objective of providing effective law enforcement,all sides recognize that they have a strong interest in assuring the effective training of their law enforcement personnel.as the supreme court has made clear,however,the relevant issue is not the weight of the governmental interest considered in abstract terms we look instead to how the speech at issue affects the government interest in providing services efficiently.it is the speech detrimental effect on the efficient delivery of public services that gives the government a legitimate interest in suppressing it.this is illustrated,for example,by rankin mcpherson,d,a case in which an employee in a constable office remarked,upon hearing about the attempted assassination of president reagan,i f they go for him again,i hope they get him.the rankin court did not consider the defendant constable generalized interest in maintaining an important the court instead asked whether the speech at issue,given the context and the employee duties,actually impaired office operations.in performing the pickering balancing,the statement will not be considered in a vacuum the manner,time,and place of the employee expression are relevant,as is the context in which the dispute arose.id.at.thus,the question in this case is not whether the police have an interest in effective training no one would deny rather whether,on this record,they could reasonably think that interest threatened by the plaintiffs protected speech such that the police officials may legitimately suppress that speech.
in recognizing that the governmental interests at stake in a particular case necessarily depend upon the facts of the case,we most certainly do not,as the dissent asserts,pervert the first amendment analysis by changing the pickering balancing inquiry into a question for the jury.it is for the court to determine the importance of a plaintiff speech interest,to determine the importance of a governmental interest in efficient operations,and to balance the relative weight of each.but the governmental interests that are at stake in a particular case necessarily depend on the facts of the case.as a matter of law,the police officials surely have an array of weighty interests in various matters,but those interests are only relevant to this case if,as a matter of fact,a certain interest is threatened.in this interlocutory appeal of a denial of summary are not permitted to indulge in our own preferred view as to the true facts of the case,much less can we simply accept the defendant version of the disputed facts as true.instead,we must accept the genuine factual disputes identified by the district court and conduct the inquiry as if the plaintiffs version is true.that is how this circuit,like other circuits,handles the substantive law of pickering balancing in the procedural posture of summary judgment when the material facts are disputed.see,victor mcelveen,cir explaining that a sheriff was unable to show that his interests in efficient functioning of the department outweighed a deputy speech interests,given that it was disputed whether the comment was disruptive the dissent is thus incorrect if it suggests that first amendment cases present an exception to the general rule that we do not resolve genuine factual disputes at the summary judgment stage.put differently,engaging in pickering balancing is not like performing rational basis review,where we uphold government action as long as there is some imaginable legitimate basis for it.gustafson,at see boddie city of columbus,cir there was no interest to balance in the pickering inquiry when this potential reason was rejected factually.we do not let the governmental defendant prevail,on summary judgment,by relying on interests that,viewing the record in the favor,are not reasonably threatened in the case.
with these principles in mind,we now turn to the police officials asserted grounds for taking action against kinney and hall.in canvassing the possible harms caused by the plaintiffs kerrville testimony,we note first that some of the workplace disruptions cited by the police officials are simply irrelevant to the pickering calculus.it is of course true,as the defendants point out,that the boycott strained the relationship between the etpa and the local police agencies.in addition,the boycott may have caused tension between holda and the plaintiffs,although holda did defend kinney and hall in the media and attempt to resolve the boycott amicably.those types of disruptions might have given the etpa a sound reason for taking action against kinney and hall,but they can not be counted in the police officials favor.the disruptions just noted were caused by the police officials boycott,so the police officials can hardly rely on those disruptions as a justification for their boycott.the question is whether the plaintiffs testimony posed a threat to the police officials ability to deliver police services,not whether the police officials caused a disruption in response to it 
with regard to the question whether the plaintiffs speech impaired the police officials training operations,the district court concluded,based upon its review of the record before it,that the defendants had not identified any damage to the efficiency of their operations brought about by kinney and hall testimony in kerrville.kinney,d at.this finding is not itself determinative,for we like those in dissent are mindful of the fact that a prudent administrator will often wish to take action before a risk ripens into an actual workplace disruption.the key limitation on preemptive action,however,is that the officials predictions of disruption must be reasonable.see waters,at.connick,at.brawner,at asking whether speech was likely to disrupt police department operations see also gustafson,at denying police officials request for qualified immunity and remarking that mere incantation of the phrase internal harmony in the workplace is not enough to carry the day internal quotation marks omitted.even in situations where courts have recognized the special expertise and special needs of certain decisionmakers,the deference to their conclusions has never been complete.waters,at.the reason for this rule should be obvious disruption is always possible,but to give deference to unfounded predictions of harm would allow the government arbitrarily to punish speech under the guise of preempting disruption.that is,it would permit the government to silence discourse,not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees speech,rankin,at.the district court addressed the issue of whether disruption was a reasonable prospect,and its conclusion was that t here are genuine issues of fact remaining in this case as to whether the plaintiffs expert testimony could legitimately cause any disruptions in the defendants operations.kinney,d at we are not free to disregard that conclusion in this appeal.
the police officials claim that kinney and hall testimony damaged training by creating a conflict of interest and violat ing principles of cooperative responsibility and trust.needless to say,reasonable officials should be concerned about conflicts of interest,and they can rightfully demand that their employees and contractors not abuse the trust the government places in them.based upon the summary judgment record,however,the district court was unable to determine whether the police officials had concerns about genuine conflicts of interest or were instead,as kinney and hall contend,merely interested in enforcing a code of silence against the plaintiffs.id.at,one of the main reasons for the district court conclusion was that the police officials have asserted an interest in suppressing testimony that involved a police agency hundreds of miles away,well outside of the etpa service area.the record shows that the police officials see a conflict of interest whenever and wherever a police trainer testifies against police officers.regardless of whether one uses the label code of silence,we believe that,on this record,the defendants asserted notion of conflicts of interest sweeps so broadly as to undermine its status as a legitimate government interest that can properly weigh in the pickering balance the persuasiveness of the police officials asserted concern sinks further still when one considers that they not only refused to send students to kinney and hall might be a proper response to concerns about an the police officials also tried to have the instructors fired,which tends to imply that the defendants were trying to do more than prevent a conflict of interest.if anything,the police officials sweeping yet notion of conflicts of interest tends to impair the efficient provision of public services,inasmuch as it thwarts the important public objective of preventing police misconduct as the supreme court counseled in rankin,another case that arose in the law enforcement context,v igilance is necessary to ensure that public employers do not use authority over employees to silence discourse,not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees speech.at.
similar comments are in order regarding the police officials asserted interests in loyalty and esprit de corps,heavily relied upon by the dissent.no one would doubt but that those are important considerations,especially in a police department.even within a police department,however,the mere assertion of interests in preserving loyalty and close working relationships does not end the debate as it would if this were a rational basis inquiry.see branton city of dallas,cir.when the dissent trumpets the need for institutional loyalty,jones dissent at,one must ask what institution the plaintiffs have wronged by testifying against distant officers that they have never met.the police officials charge of disloyalty makes sense only if kinney and hall owe fealty to law enforcement universally.indeed,the police officials stated view is that one is has committed an unforgivable sin whenever one testifies against law enforcement officers anywhere.a concept of loyalty that sweeps so broadly is not one that may legitimately trump compelling interests in speaking on matters of public concern.
the district court conclusions with respect to the question of workplace rather,the absence the instant case from a case like tedder norman,cir.in tedder,the deputy director of a police academy testified as an expert witness against one of the agencies that sent trainees to the academy.it is quite understandable how this could raise real concerns,including concerns about conflicts of interest.accordingly,the tedder court found that the actual disruption and potential further disruption caused by the plaintiff testimony justified the academy decision to demote him.id.at.here,in contrast,the district court concluded that there was a genuine dispute over whether the plaintiffs activities did in fact,and reasonably could be expected to,impair proper training.
when we accept the factual disputes identified by the district court and view the disputed facts in the light most favorable to kinney and hall,we find that the police officials have not articulated any relevant,cognizable interests in suppressing the plaintiffs speech,while kinney and hall have presented a strong first amendment interest in testifying about police brutality and inadequate supervision and training.therefore,we conclude that,at the summary judgment stage,the instructors interest in testifying easily outweighs the police officials interest in suppressing their speech,given that the speech involved unrelated police agencies hundreds of miles away.
our decision should not be taken to mean that police agencies do not enjoy broad latitude in managing the training of their officers,including significant discretion over the choice of instructors.there are any number of legitimate reasons why police officials can stop using a particular instructor or academy barring contractual commitments,they can do so for no good reason at all.in order to do so on a basis that penalizes protected speech,however,they must explain why their need to suppress the speech outweighs the countervailing first amendment interest in free expression.at this early stage of the proceedings,there is a genuine dispute as to whether the police officials had any legitimate interests that could justify their decision to boycott and seek the termination of instructors who had testified in a distant trial against unrelated police agencies.
to summarize kinney and hall spoke on a matter of public concern,and the value of their speech prevails,at the summary judgment stage,over the opposing governmental interests in the pickering balance.since the district court also found that kinney and hall established a genuine factual issue regarding whether the police officials boycotted kinney and hall courses and sought to have them removed from the etpa faculty because of their testimony,kinney,d at,the facts set forth by kinney and hall are sufficient to state a first amendment violation.the first step of the qualified immunity analysis is thus complete.we next turn to the question of clearly established is,whether it would have been apparent to a reasonable officer at the time of the alleged violation that the police officials conduct violated the first amendment.
are the police officials entitled to qualified immunity 
the first amendment right to free speech was of course clearly established in general terms long before the events giving rise to this case.in order to defeat the police officials claim of qualified immunity,however,kinney and hall must show that t he contours of the right were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson,at.qualified immunity should not be denied unless the law is such that reasonable officials should be on notice that their conduct is unlawful.saucier,at.it bears repeating once more that our factual guide is the district court view of the record,and the legal question is whether the defendants conduct violated clearly established law measured against the facts that the district court believed the plaintiffs could prove at trial.see behrens,at.
there is no question that it was clearly established well before october that kinney and hall testimony was of public concern and thus was speech protected by the first amendment the police officials do not attempt to argue otherwise,but rather suggest that it was not clear that the first amendment imposed any restrictions on their conduct kinney and hall as their training instructors.this,of course,is the same argument we rejected earlier,in discussing whether kinney and hall had set forth evidence of conduct that would amount to a constitutional violation at all.in arguing for qualified immunity,the police officials contend that there was at least a reasonable legal basis for their view,even if it was ultimately wrong.more specifically,the police officials say that their duties with respect to kinney and hall were unclear because the instructors were employees of a disappointed bidder,kilgore college.the police officials apparently base this contention in part on the umbehr court admonishment that b ecause this suit concerns the termination of a commercial relationship with the government,we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts who can not rely on such a relationship.at.
initially,we reject the defendants attempt to characterize kinney and hall as employees of a disappointed bidder.neither kilgore college nor etpa instructors such as kinney and hall were mere bidders in the sense that they lacked a commercial relationship of the sort that the court was concerned about in,a relationship that the police officials could use to inhibit speech.see id.at.reasoning that a pickering balancing analysis is appropriate in cases involving the government independent contractors or providers of regular services as well as its employees because both type s of relationship provide a valuable financial benefit,the threat of the loss of which in retaliation for speech may chill speech on matters of public concern.the police officials had the power to deny kinney and hall significant benefits as etpa instructors,and it is the existence of that sort of not mere labels describing governmental is relevant for purposes of the first amendment.see truck,at.umbehr,at.
more fundamentally,we reject the police officials suggestion that it would have been reasonable for officers in their positions to believe that they were unfettered by the first amendment merely because their economic relationship with kinney and hall was and.both the supreme court and this court have explicitly rejected such reasoning.in truck service,the court rejected the proposition that those who perform the government work outside the formal employment relationship are subject to what we conclude is the direct and specific abridgment of first amendment rights.at.similarly,in blackburn,we stated that the assumption that only public employees enjoy the protections of the first amendment rested on inverted reasoning because e very citizen enjoys the first amendment protections against governmental interference with free speech.at.as we explained in blackburn,the supreme court did not formulate the governmental employee version of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in order to limit the first amendment to the public employment context,but rather in order to take into account that the first amendment rights of public employees are restricted by the nature of the relationship.id.indeed,the supreme court decisions in pickering,umbehr,and truck service are predicated on the assumption that although the government may have other relationships with individuals in addition to the relationship,individuals do not,as a result of such relationships,cease to be citizens with first amendment rights that the government is obligated to respect.thus,we have little difficulty concluding that the police officials would be unreasonable in failing to recognize that they had first amendment obligations toward kinney and hall.
part of this opinion determined that the police officials were entitled to have the plaintiffs first amendment claim analyzed under a pickering balancing inquiry,a framework that recognizes the police officials legitimate interests in suppressing some speech that interferes with the provision of public services.to the extent that there was any uncertainty about the proper analytical framework,the uncertainty could not redound to the defendants benefit,as the alternative would have been to hold the police officials to the higher standards that they must observe with respect to ordinary citizens.it is plain that the government can not harry the employer of an ordinary citizen who gave unwelcome testimony,seeking to have the employee fired in retaliation.giving the police officials the benefit of the pickering balancing test,we must ask whether it was clearly established at the time of the police officials conduct that the first amendment forbade them from retaliating against kinney and hall,the employees of their contractor,on account of the instructors kerrville testimony.we conclude that it was.
given that it is in the jurisprudence of both the supreme court and this court that official misconduct is of great first amendment significance,and that this court has repeatedly emphasized the need to protect speech regarding police misconduct in particular,see,brawner,at,it would have been objectively unreasonable for an officer to conclude that kinney and hall testimony was anything other than highly valuable speech suppressing that speech could be justified,they should have realized,only by a weighty governmental interest.see matherne wilson,cir explaining that a greater disruption must be shown when the speech is of greater public concern.
as explained earlier,at this stage of the case it is disputed whether the police officials legitimate interests were threatened by kinney and hall.the district court found that it was disputed whether the instructors testimony in kerrville disrupted,and even legitimately could disrupt,the police officials training objectives.kinney,d at.on this record,the police officials asserted interest in loyalty is unreasonable given the events at issue certainly such interests can not justify an attempt to force the instructors out of the academy altogether.viewing the summary judgment facts in the light most favorable to the,the police officials pursued kinney and hall not because of genuine conflicts of interest but instead merely because kinney and hall had testified against a police officer.id.at.when the disputed facts are viewed from the perspective of the plaintiffs that is the only perspective allowed on this interlocutory appeal,see behrens,at.illegality of the police officials actions is readily apparent.summary judgment is therefore inappropriate.
the police officials contend that their conduct was reasonable in light of the fact that,when the boycott started in october,the texas legislature and texas university had enacted policies that effectively prohibited state employees from serving as expert witnesses against the state,ostensibly because of inherent conflicts of interest.see hoover morales,cir describing the policies.but the police officials could hardly have reasonably relied on these state policies as support for their own stand against purported conflicts of interest the state policies had been challenged as violative of free speech,and a federal judge had preliminarily enjoined their enforcement on august,over a year before the boycott.this court affirmed that decision in an opinion issued july,it would therefore have been unreasonable to rely on these state policies for guidance on the meaning of the first amendment.
in any event,we had spoken to such issues long before the controversy over the policies at issue in hoover.for example,we held in rainey jackson state college that a teacher stated a claim under the first amendment when a state college denied him employment in retaliation for his expert testimony for the defendant in a criminal obscenity case.see at rainey i.in a later appeal of the same case,we noted that a college trustee had admitted that the plaintiff was denied the teaching position because of his testimony and the publicity surrounding the same we observed that t hese facts make out what appear to us to be a clear case of impermissibly freighting plaintiff contract with a deprivation of the first amendment right to free speech,and we ultimately held that the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.rainey jackson state,cir rainey ii the rainey decisions are themselves part of a long series of first amendment cases in which we have condemned retaliation against court testimony,including retaliation against employees who gave testimony adverse to their employers interests.see johnston,at county employee fired for testifying on behalf in an administrative hearing reeves,at school employee demoted for her civil testimony in favor of her against their employer.
judge jones dissent discusses in some detail three cases from other circuits that,in her estimation,show that the defendants did not violate the first amendment and should in any event be entitled to qualified immunity.only one of these,the third circuit decision in green,was on the books when the police officials began their activities the plaintiff in green,a police officer on a drug task force,agreed to testify as a character witness at the bail hearing of the son of a longtime friend.at.the plaintiff left the hearing without testifying after he learned that the son was associated with organized crime.id.the police agency demoted the officer anyway,citing their interest in avoiding the appearance of an association with organized crime.id.at.surely it would cast a police agency into disrepute if its vice officers were thought to consort with mob figures,but the police officials in this appeal can not seriously claim that their agencies will be exposed to public obloquy if a police instructor they patronize testifies for the plaintiff in an excessive force case,just as he has before testified in favor of the police green in no way supports the police officials actions.
while some of the relevant first amendment retaliation precedents in place in the fall of involved schools like the rainey cases and reeves,and others of them such as brawner and victor have involved police departments,we concede that our past cases do not include one that has specifically addressed retaliation against instructors at a police academy.we do not see the absence of such a case as an embarrassment to our conclusion that the police officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.if we accepted the defendants view of what it means for the law to be clearly established,qualified immunity would be available in almost every case,even those cases in which in the light of law the unlawfulness was apparent,anderson,at.as the supreme court has recently admonished,officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.hope,at.
although we are sensitive to the fact that reasonable officials might not always be able to predict the outcome of a balancing test such as that used in pickering cases,see noyola.dep t of human,cir we believe that in this case the illegality of the police officials conduct is sufficiently clear that they can fairly be said to have been on notice of the impropriety of their actions.indeed,given the factual disputes identified by the district court and taking the plaintiffs side of those disputes,this case does not require any real balancing at all,for the police officials do not have any relevant,legitimate interests to put on their side of the pickering scales.our cases show that it is entirely appropriate to deny qualified immunity when the balance of cognizable interests weighs so starkly in the plaintiff favor.see,boddie,at frazier,at.this means that summary judgment must sometimes be denied in pickering cases because of genuine factual disputes concerning whether admittedly legally important government interests are implicated on a given record.see,branton,at kennedy,at victor,at see also supra note citing cases from other circuits.of course,the ultimate resolution of those factual disputes may show that the police officials are entitled to qualified immunity from liability.see supra note.
we close our discussion of qualified immunity by noting that,contrary to the position asserted by the police officials,the district court review of the reasons for the police officials boycott does not mean that the lower court,or this court,has engaged in a subjective analysis of the type condemned in harlow.the police officials position,apparently,is that they are entitled to qualified immunity as long as there exists some conceivable set of reasons that would have made their actions appropriate.such factual scenarios doubtless exist.it would have been permissible for the police officials to pull their students out of kinney and hall classes if for instance the police officials learned that the instructors were unskilled.therefore,the police officials suggest,we necessarily engage in a forbidden subjective inquiry if we take cognizance of a genuine dispute over the reasons for their actions against the instructors.what the defendants approach would mean,of course,is that there can never be liability for any violation for which the elements include the official intent or reasons for action.most claims do not include such an element,but first amendment retaliation claims do the first amendment protects employees only from termination because of their speech on matters of public concern,umbehr,at,not from termination simpliciter.similarly,the constitution forbids officials from discriminating on the basis of race only when their discrimination is intentional.see washington davis,d.in such cases,reading harlow as forbidding all discussion of intent would allow the qualified immunity defense to preclude recovery even when the law was clearly established,for plaintiffs would be barred from proving an essential legal element of their case 
when an official intent or the reasons for his or her actions are an essential element of the underlying violation,we have treated factual disputes over intent just like any other factual dispute that can justify a denial of qualified immunity.see tompkins vickers,cir holding that the existence of a retaliatory motive was a factual issue that precluded summary judgment on qualified immunity in a first amendment case in which a teacher claimed that he had been transferred in retaliation for criticizing the school superintendent see also coleman houston indep.sch,cir stating that the court lacks jurisdiction on interlocutory appeal to review whether there is a genuine issue of fact as to intentional discrimination.other circuits take the same view 
as we have said,accepting the police officials position would mean that every claim of qualified immunity would necessarily be upheld in those categories of cases that require proof of intent or motive.the proper approach,which treats intent as one fact issue among others,does not lead to the opposite extreme,namely that qualified immunity is never available in such cases.that too would be an intolerable result.fortunately,in no area of the law can bare accusations of malice or evil intent withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment.see celotex catrett,d krim banctexas group,cir stating that unsupported assertions of bad faith can not create a genuine issue of fact in such a case,summary judgment is proper even if intent is an essential element of the nonmoving party case.insubstantial suits against public officials can be handled through the firm application of the federal rules of civil procedure,butz,at,including the restrictions on discovery available in rule the case before us is not a case in which a plaintiff seeks to impugn an otherwise legitimate official action by casting bare accusations of malice,bad faith,and retaliatory animus.kinney and hall showed the district court sufficient evidence,both direct and circumstantial,and much of which came from the defendants own words,to raise a genuine issue of fact as to their claims.
the police officials conduct,as presented in the summary judgment record and viewed in the plaintiffs favor,was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established first amendment law.the district court therefore correctly determined that the police officials are not entitled,at least at this point,to qualified immunity from kinney and hall claims alleging violations of their rights to freedom of speech under the first and fourteenth amendments.
vii.due process and state law claims 
in addition to their and first amendment claims,kinney and hall also alleged a denial of due process and a state law claim for tortious interference with business relations.the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on these claims.the panel of this court that initially heard the police officials interlocutory appeal reversed the district court on the due process claim,finding that kinney and hall had not stated a violation.the panel affirmed the district court denial of summary judgment on the state law claim.as the issues on rehearing centered upon the and first amendment claims,we now reinstate those portions of the panel opinion that rule on the due process and state law claims,namely parts and 
viii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court denial of the police officials motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs and first amendment claims.we reinstate part of the panel opinion,which reversed the district court denial of summary judgment on the due process claim,and we reinstate part v of the panel opinion,which affirmed the district court denial of summary judgment on the state law claim.we dismiss the appeal of the cities,counties,and east texas police chiefs association for the reasons set forth in note supra.finally,we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.the police officials shall bear the costs of this appeal.
the privilege of absurdity to which no living creature is subject but man only.
thomas hobbes,leviathan pt.i,ch.
primarily at issue is qualified immunity vel non against first amendment and claims.i respectfully dissent from its being denied,as well as official immunity being denied,as a result,against the state law claim.i concur,of course,in immunity being granted against the fourteenth amendment due process claim.because i join judge jones splendid dissent concerning the first amendment claim,i address only.
though well intended as always,the majority has lost sight of the proverbial forest for the proverbial trees as did the majority for the divided panel.first,the majority reading of has stretched that statute beyond all recognition the new law it has confected leads to an absurd result.second,it has turned its back on the fundamental,compelling reasons for qualified immunity it ignores the discretionary element that lies at the heart of that doctrine.
with all due respect to my esteemed colleagues in the majority,it is simply nothing short of absurd to hold that the police chiefs and sheriffs are not vested with discretion in choosing which teachers to use and pay for training the police chiefs and sheriffs own very persons the police chiefs and sheriffs are responsible for training.this can not be the law.
recitation of the material facts brings the ultimate issue into sharp focus.in,while instructors at the east texas police academy etpa,part of kilgore college in tyler,kinney and hall testified voluntarily in a federal court action as expert witnesses supporting an excessive force claim against the kerrville,texas,police department.the police chiefs and sheriffs officers who sent paid for their to etpa for training were concerned about a conflict of interest evidenced by kinney and hall testimony discussed that conflict with etpa and decided in not to send pay for their to kinney and hall classes.as a result,etpa discontinued those classes because they were no longer economically feasible.
kinney and hall had contracts with etpa.thinking that his contract might not be renewed,hall resigned from etpa to find other employment.kinney stayed until his contract expired and then accepted a new contract in a different position with the college.
in,kinney and hall filed this action against officers,their respective cities and counties,and the east texas police chiefs association,claiming violation of free speech under the first amendment and due process under the fourteenth and texas law.among other rulings on motions for summary judgment,qualified immunity was denied officers.a divided panel of our court reversed the qualified immunity denial for the due process claim but it affirmed the denial for the remainder against my dissent.kinney weaver,cir,vacated and reh g en banc granted,cir.
at issue is qualified immunity interlocutory appeal,not the merits appeal from final judgment.restated,this appeal concerns only whether now,or when officers acted in,their alleged conduct was proscribed by law.the answer is no qualified immunity must be granted.
our standard of review for qualified immunity interlocutory appeals requires us to accept the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.but,of course,that standard does not require us to accept plaintiffs contentions on points of law.for an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity,we have jurisdiction to accept the facts as assumed by the district court and determine whether,as a matter of law,they preclude qualified immunity,aucoin haney,cir quoting nerren livingston police dep t,cir.applying that standard to this record,we must hold,as a matter of law,that officers are entitled to qualified immunity.
section makes it unlawful to,inter alia,injure a party or witness in his property on account of having testified freely and truthfully in a court of the united states.in denying qualified immunity for the claim,the majority holds the statute applies to expert witnesses and officers choosing to send pay for their to teachers other than plaintiffs is a requisite injury to property under the statute.in so doing,the majority has lost sight of the purpose for qualified protect government officials in their discretionary actions,the illegality of which is not apparent.accordingly,government officials are liable individually for their conduct only if they reasonably can anticipate when it may give rise to liability for damages.davis scherer,d.again,the ultimate issue for this interlocutory appeal is whether officers could reasonably anticipate in that their alleged conduct could give rise to liability.in straying from the proper inquiry,the majority has undercut the very reason for qualified discretion that lies at its heart.
under the,inquiry for deciding such immunity,the first asks whether,under current law,a valid claim has been a right has been violated,siegert gilley,d.i f no such right has been violated,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.saucier katz,d see,hare city of corinth,cir.
only if a valid claim has been asserted is the second step taken was defendants conduct objectively unreasonable under then existing clearly established law.hare,at.of course,for this interlocutory appeal,as discussed supra,the issue of fact on whether officers conduct in was objectively unreasonable under then existing law is not at issue for this second step we can consider only an issue of the law underlying the claimed violation of was clearly established at the time of that conduct in.plaintiffs fail the first step they do not assert a claim under several reasons,it does not apply to expert witnesses claims of the type made in this action concerning officers conduct.that ends the inquiry.in the alternative,the law underlying the claimed violation of was not clearly established when officers acted in.for purposes of demonstrating why qualified immunity is compelled,this analysis will be applied twice first,for examining why the statute does not apply to plaintiffs qua expert witnesses part second,for examining why officers conduct is not subject to the statute part.
in holding against qualified immunity,the majority improperly expands by holding that expert witnesses may bring the claim at issue here if they are injured on account of their testimony.we can not read so broadly plaintiffs qua expert witnesses can not assert this claim.in the alternative,we can not hold that this right for expert newly created by our court for this case year was clearly established when officers acted in.
first,plaintiffs do not assert a valid claim under does not apply to the economic claim made concerning their expert testimony.it is true that expert witnesses have been used for hundreds of years on the other hand,the professional expert witness who profits considerably from such testimony is a recent development,timothy perrin,expert witness testimony back to the future,rich,discussing growing industry of individuals who spend substantial portions of their time testifying or consulting with litigants and even advertise their services.congress could never have envisioned protecting against loss of income for this type of testimony when it enacted in.even assuming,arguendo,the majority is correct in holding that plain meaning encompasses the claim by these expert witnesses,opn.at,this is not necessarily determinative.even where a statute meaning is plain,we may depart from its meaning to avoid a result so bizarre that congress could not have intended it.moosa ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is just such an instance.
by enacting,congress intended,inter alia,to protect those who testified in federal court and were integral to the proper functioning of those courts,not to provide a,economic loss claim of the type at issue here for expert witnesses.even allowing for the salutary broad sweep of civil rights statutes,opn.at,the majority has stretched much too far.the reading it accords leads to an absurd result,as evidenced by the following examples.
expert witnesses are quite necessary to litigate certain claims including,in some instances,those for excessive force but such experts are readily say the least.for example,for an excessive force claim,there may be only a few fact witnesses who can testify about the force used,but there are countless experts who can opine on whether it was excessive.such fact witnesses are of the utmost importance they may be able to offer the only independent evidence about what force was employed.moreover,a fact witness is usually under subpoena and,therefore,has no choice about whether to testify.accordingly,there are compelling reasons to give fact witnesses a high level of protection against an injury to them or their property on account of their federal court testimony.
obviously,the same policy considerations are not in play in protecting expert witnesses.given their abundance and other factors bearing on their status,they are not obligated to testify in a particular case.an expert should not be given the additional protection of a private right of action if adverse economic consequences flow from his testimony.
it is true,for example,that we do not distinguish between fact and expert witnesses for claims that witnesses were intimidated in a criminal trial.as another example,we do not distinguish between fact and expert witnesses in cases involving the absolute immunity that protects them from civil liability arising from their testimony.those matters involve the integrity of the underlying action accordingly,we can not permit expert witnesses to be intimidated into changing their testimony any more than we can permit that for fact witnesses all must testify freely and truthfully.
on the other hand,a claim of the type at issue concerns providing a remedy for an expert witness who suffers economic injury.in other words,the claim protects an expert witness interests after he has freely and truthfully given his testimony.in many respects,however,testifying as an expert is a business such witnesses are able to weigh the economic benefits and risks of their testimony before agreeing to testify.therefore,expert witnesses who choose to testify in a case and are usually paid to do so,often quite handsomely should not be able to avail themselves of later,if adverse economic consequences flow from their testimony.
consider the,truly absurd results arising out of extending to cover economic injury to expert witnesses of the type claimed here.arguably,every person who testifies as an expert and is later denied employment could file an action under against the employer.for example,assume an urban planner routinely testifies in litigation against cities.is a city now subject to liability if it refuses to hire that person if he applies for a job in its planning department the majority permitting expert witnesses to bring claims under this statute for such injury opens the door perhaps the proverbial floodgates for this type claim.
as noted,even if an expert witness is protected under the statute for the claim at hand,a claim could be asserted only if it arose from conduct occurring after the date we render our decision for this appeal in other words,the majority has confected a new claim.accordingly,for the second step of the qualified immunity analysis,it was not clearly established at the time of officers conduct in that expert witnesses are protected under through a claim of the type at issue here.
in fact,as the majority admits,opn.at,it appears that only one opinion second circuit had ever applied the statute to experts this was done without analysis and concerned a claim for preventing far cry from this case.chahal paine webber,cir.chahal failure to specifically address expert witnesses does not imply that obviously applies to them.on the contrary,the fact that there is only one opinion involving expert witnesses in the long history of this statute compels concluding that expert witnesses simply do not present claims under it,precisely because it does not apply to them.
moreover,one second circuit opinion about preventing testimony could not have clearly established in tyler,texas,in that officers actions with respect to these expert witnesses could violate.it is true that,even without judicial interpretation,violation of a statute can be clearly established for qualified immunity purposes.this is not such an instance the very questions at issue about application of to economic injury for expert witnesses compel holding,for qualified immunity purposes,that,when officers in tyler,texas,acted in,it was not clearly established that their conduct could violate.
assuming,arguendo,that covers expert witnesses for the claim presented in this action,officers are still entitled to qualified immunity because the requisite injury to property by officers for liability is lacking.therefore,plaintiffs still fail to assert a claim in the alternative,when officers acted in,this law was not clearly established.
officers actions underlying the claim are not the kind proscribed by the statute.for the majority to hold otherwise is to stretch beyond all recognition.
regardless of officers reasons for doing so,electing in not to enroll pay for their in a class can not be the requisite injury to property violative of.haddle garrison,d,is not to the contrary.the fact that,under haddle,a plaintiff has a claim for interference with employment does not compel holding that officers choice in not to enroll in plaintiffs classes is an injury under the statute.plaintiffs status as employees is irrelevant,because sending to teachers at etpa other than plaintiffs is not a cognizable injury under.
in haddle,the supreme court analogized to tort law claims concerning interference with economic relationships and held that interference with employment can constitute an injury under.id.at.the court defined tortious interference with economic relations as maliciously and without justifiable cause induc ing an employer to discharge an employee,by means of false statements,threats or putting in fear.id.quoting cooley,law of torts ed.emphasis added.the majority states that,according to the district court,officers tried to have the plaintiffs fired from their jobs,opn.at emphasis added but,in the next breath and quite contrary to our limited standard of review,the majority greatly overstates officers trying conduct by equating it with coercing an employer into firing an employee,id.trying to coerce an employer into firing an employee is not tortious interference with employment.rather,as the majority concedes,the classic case for such interference as evidenced by all cases cited both by the majority and this dissent,including haddle concerns a plaintiff being actually discharged.kinney was not discharged hall resigned of his own volition and neither claims he was constructively discharged.therefore,officers conduct does not constitute an injury to property under tort law or.
for qualified immunity purposes here,and if we analogize to tort law,refusing to enroll pay for in a class does not equate with maliciously inducing an employer to discharge an employee.a typical case of such tortious interference with economic relations would involve a defendant demanding that a plaintiff be fired,or telling lies about him in order to have him fired,followed by the employee being fired,ahrens perot systems,cir.discussing in judicial estoppel context plaintiff earlier claim that she had been fired because defendants tortiously interfered with her employment by revealing confidential and disparaging information about her,cert.denied,d sterner marathon oil,upholding finding tortious interference because defendant directed plaintiff employer to fire him.
it is simply not the law that the refusal to enroll pay for regardless of officers motive is the kind of interference actionable under tort law,especially for.
while the analogy to tort law is instructive,the purpose and history of also compel holding that plaintiffs do not assert a claim.the supreme court noted in kush rutledge,d,that p rotection of the processes of the federal courts was an essential component of congress solution via enacted in to disorder and anarchy in the southern states.when it enacted in an effort to protect such processes,congress can not possibly have intended a scenario akin to compelling officers to enroll pay for their in plaintiffs classes.allowing officers to decide who teaches their,even if motivated by plaintiffs expert testimony,is hardly the type of disorder and anarchy that congress was addressing in.although the statutory language of is broad,it can not be read so broadly as to encompass officers where,as here,the issue is qualified immunity,not the merits.to so read is,again,to give it an absurd result and to create new law.the majority comments concerning kush rejection of a racial animus requirement for certain claims,opn.at,are irrelevant to our conclusion that plaintiff injury is not cognizable under the statute.instead,kush elucidates that allowing a claim based on officers choice not to enroll their students in classes produces an absurd result in the light of the congressional goal for protecting the processes of the federal courts.
the majority tries to limit its holding by stating that the statute does not create liability for every adverse action taken against a witness after the witness testifies in a federal case,because of the limiting principle in that the injury must be on account of his having so attended or testified.opn.at.the majority pays lip service to the other important limiting principle contained in the adverse action taken against the witness be an injury to property.even assuming that officers acted on account of plaintiffs testimony,officers choice to enroll pay for their in other instructors classes is not the requisite injury to property.
the majority would allow any reaction to a witness testimony to be actionable if it were in response to that testimony.this is too broad.the statute limits actionable responses to those that injure the witness property.although interference with employment is such an injury,choosing not to enroll pay for in a particular class,is not.plaintiffs do not assert a claim.accordingly,our inquiry should stop at step one.
in the alternative,taking the second step for qualified immunity analysis only makes it more evident that officers are entitled to qualified immunity.surely,this step compels awarding it.again,this step involves deciding whether officers conduct in was objectively unreasonable in the light of then clearly established law.hare,at.as discussed,and for this interlocutory appeal,we are concerned only with an issue of the law was clearly established when officers acted in we are not concerned with an issue of officers conduct in was objectively unreasonable in the light of then existing clearly established law.
officers stopped sending paying for their to plaintiffs classes in october.despite the majority take on this,opn.at,haddle being decided two months later in december did not clearly establish that officers were then or later violating.moreover,haddle was decided after kinney and hall classes were removed in november from the schedule.the majority contends that officers acted in furtherance of the conspiracy after december because they continued to prohibit their officers from enrolling in kinney or hall classes,opn.at but officers could not have prohibited enrollment in classes that were not on the schedule.the majority continuing conspiracy theory attempts to obscure the was not clearly established when officers acted in that their actions violated the statute.in addition,haddle gave no indication,nor has any other case,that an act as benign as officers sending paying for their to different teachers at a police academy is an injury to property under.
the ultimate issues for this interlocutory appeal are whether plaintiffs assert a valid claim and,only if so,whether that law was clearly established when officers acted in.plaintiffs do not assert a claim moreover,given the majority extreme extensions of existing law needed in order to hold against qualified immunity,it is obvious that the law now confected by the majority was not clearly established when officers acted in.
therefore,qualified immunity must be awarded against the claim.for the reasons stated by judge jones,it must also be awarded against the first amendment claim.finally,as a result and for the reasons stated in my dissent from the panel opinion,at,official immunity must be awarded against the state law claim.
accordingly,i respectfully dissent from not granting immunity against those claims.
with all due respect to our colleagues,one of judge barksdale opening statements puts this case in perspective 
i t is simply nothing short of absurd to hold that the police chiefs and sheriffs are not vested with discretion in choosing which teachers to use and pay for training the police chiefs and sheriffs own very persons the police chiefs and sheriffs are responsible for training.this can not be the law.
in holding otherwise,as he says,the majority has turned its back on the fundamental,compelling reasons for qualified immunity it ignores the discretionary element that lies at the heart of that doctrine.the majority has rendered a very analysis of the balancing tests required in this case.this portion of our dissent will address the qualified immunity claim of the police officials as it relates to the teachers claims for first amendment retaliation.judge barksdale portion of the dissent discusses the police officials potential liability for violating and their corresponding immunity claim.
background 
to set the stage for the police officials actions against kinney and hall,it is useful to recount undisputed facts concerning their expert testimony and the officials concerns.they agreed,without following etpa instructions to obtain prior approval,to become paid experts in on behalf of the plaintiffs in gonzales city of kerrville.a year later,at trial,the kerrville newspaper reported that eyewitnesses testified the suspect had fired in excess of forty shots while standing on the guadalupe river dam hitting objects including an apartment window,a garbage can and a patrol car window.the defendant police sniper testified that he first told the suspect to drop his rifle,and when the suspect lifted the rifle and pointed it at him,the officer killed the suspect in.kinney and hall expert conclusions were that the sniper failure to apply his training and defendant,city of kerrville lack of a proper policy were proximate causes of the tragic shooting and that the sniper use of deadly force amounted to excessive force.
rejecting these expert opinions,the jury found in favor of the kerrville police officer,and the federal district judge overturned the award against the city.after kinney and hall opinion was rejected,the judgment was affirmed by this court on appeal.see gonzales city of kerrville,cir.
the police officials have deposed or attested,inter alia,that appellees expert testimony hurt the close working relationship required between academy instructors and representatives of the cities and counties damaged teamwork required among those involved in training officers threatened the confidentiality of information city and county officers share with kinney and hall about their procedures and practices undermined feelings of loyalty and confidence and represented an improper use of the instructors affiliation with etpa.
ii.standard of review 
while the majority correctly cites the general standards of review for summary judgment and qualified immunity appeals,they repeatedly mischaracterize the court function in free speech cases and thus would send to the jury issues that it is our obligation to decide.this case is,we are agreed,governed by the balancing test framed by the supreme court in pickering bd.of,d,and refined and extended by connick myers,d,and board of county commissioners umbehr,d.the relevant issues are whether an employee or contractor speech constituted a matter of public concern whether the public employer legitimate countervailing government interests outweigh the value of the protected speech whether the protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the discipline or termination and whether the employer would have acted against the employee for some other conduct regardless of the speech.see umbehr,at.at.the first two issues are matters for the court to decide de novo while the last two may comprise jury issues.see williams seniff,cir melton city of oklahoma city,cir.courts,not juries,determine the extent of protection accorded to first amendment conduct as matters of policy and uniformity.melton,at concluding that the trial court improperly submitted to the jury the question of whether the plaintiff speech was constitutionally protected.
the majority,unfortunately,appears to have confused the second and third issues and thus would leave to the jury the fundamental question of first amendment protection that is ours to decide.the majority holds that because a fact dispute exists as to whether kinney and hall were blackballed or boycotted to enforce a code of silence the third pickering issue,this court may not take into account the police officials proffered institutional reasons for disenrolling their officers from appellees classes the second issue.the majority reasons because it must give kinney and hall the benefit of drawing all inferences in their favor on summary judgment review,a trial is required to determine the legitimacy of the governmental interests.the weight those interests receive in the pickering balance is,however,for this court to decide.accordingly,sending to the jury issues crucial to the pickering balance would be improper.
that this court alone decides the pickering balance is reinforced by several facts.first,all discovery is complete,and there is no real dispute about the operative facts.second,whether one characterizes the police officials actions as merely disenrolling students from appellees classes or as blackballing or boycotting the instructors is a matter of semantics,not motive.third,there is no evidence that the officials themselves used the term blackball or boycott to describe their actions those pejoratives were used by etpa president holda and pervade the appellees complaint and the district court opinion.finally,the majority opinion itself concludes that the police officials advanced no legitimate interests to place in the pickering balance,and it freely evaluates the disputed evidence.see,kinney weaver,cir en banc.in other words,while purporting to rest on the existence of disputed fact issues,the majority has rendered its conclusion on the first and second pickering issues listed above.the majority de facto balancing is additionally undermined,not only by its failure to take the entire record into account,but by its erroneous requirement that the police officials prove actual disruption,to the exclusion of potential disruption,caused in their departments by the protected speech.the supreme court has held,to the contrary,that an employer legitimate concern about potential disruption arising from protected speech is entitled to deference.umbehr,at.at recognizing that the court has consistently given greater deference to government predictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee speech citations and quotations omitted.
the majority miscalculation of pickering balancing necessarily affects its conclusion on qualified immunity,as the majority reiterates that there are no legitimate governmental interests on the police officials side of the balance.
unlike the majority,we neither wash our hands of the crucial responsibility to determine the extent of protection owed to kinney and hall voluntary expert testimony,nor obscure the pickering determination with erroneous or unsupported fact issues.thus,while deferring balancing at this point,we must acknowledge the existence of legitimate governmental interests on the police officials side.
iii.qualified immunity 
the doctrine that confers qualified immunity from suit on public officials performing discretionary functions is not an insignificant aberration.see pierce smith,cir.for over twenty years,the supreme court has explained that qualified immunity strikes a balance between providing redress to individuals for abuses of public office and protecting society against claims that frequently run against the innocent as well as the guilty.harlow fitzgerald,d.society bears the cost of unfounded lawsuits in the expenses of litigation,the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues,and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office.id.there is also the danger that fear of being sued will dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute,or the most irresponsible public officials,in the unflinching discharge of their duties.id.citation and quotation omitted.
for these reasons,qualified immunity shields discretionary official conduct to prevent lawsuits that do not allege violations of clearly established constitutional law of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow,at.at.the standard of conduct embodies objective legal reasonableness.so measured,qualified immunity affords ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.to disentitle public officials to qualified immunity,the unlawfulness of their conduct must be apparent,anderson creighton,d,and all reasonable officials would have realized the particular challenged conduct violated the constitutional provision sued on.pierce,at citations omitted.indeed,if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on th e issue,immunity should be recognized.malley,at.at.the law is clearly established only where it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d emphasis added.
no doubt,the test of objective legal reasonableness does not always require immunity in the absence of an identical or even materially similar case to guide official conduct.see hope pelzer,d.in hope,the court held that alabama prison officials could have readily inferred from authority that it was unconstitutional to chain recalcitrant prisoners painfully and long to a hitching post.id.as a denial of qualified immunity,hope does not spring eternal for kinney and hall.the contrasts between the two cases are plain.
first,the eighth amendment proscribes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain on prisoners,whitley albers,d.with only two paragraphs of discussion,the court in hope found in the prisoner allegations an obvious eighth amendment violation.hope,at.at.in this case,however,rather than dealing with an obviously cruel practice compare hope,at.at,the court confronts a first amendment protection of free speech that is not unequivocal courts must accommodate the public interest in effective provision of government services when the speaker works for or on behalf of the government.no rigid rule of liability exists.see pickering,at.at.thus,the majority requires well over pages of legal reasoning to explain why the police officials could not constitutionally disenroll their students from kinney and hall classes.
just as the governing constitutional standard in hope was simpler,so was the determination that the law was clearly established.an earlier circuit court case had specifically held unconstitutional,inter alia,the practice of handcuffing prisoners to the fence and to cells for long periods of time gates collier,cir another case had held it unconstitutional to deny water to a prisoner as punishment for his refusal to work,explaining that conduct which jeopardizes the prisoner health or inflicts physical abuse after he stops resisting authority is actionable.ort white,cir.finally,a department of justice report to alabama authorities condemned exactly the corporal punishment at issue in hope.
despite the majority creative review of fifth circuit government employee free speech precedents,none of our cases had remotely conducted the free speech balancing inherent in the relation between law enforcement departments and police academy instructors.as will be seen,the only related authorities were decided outside this circuit and uniformly denied liability or granted immunity.
thus,that fair warning could be given to the prison officials in hope does not modify the general test for qualified immunity applicable in this case.as the court acknowledged,in some circumstances,as when an earlier case expressly leaves open whether a general rule applies to the particular type of conduct at issue,a very high degree of prior factual particularity may be necessary.hope,at.at quoting united states lanier,d internal citations and quotations omitted.nor did hope cast doubt on the court decision that to determine whether the law is clearly established,public officials should consider controlling cases in their own jurisdiction or,alternatively,refer to a consensus of persuasive authority outside it.wilson layne,d.
only recently,this court expressed en banc our caution toward denying qualified immunity in novel factual cases.in mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc,the author of today majority opinion found it compelling that no court in had applied the danger theory of liability to a similar factual context.this court held that qualified immunity should be granted if a reasonable official would be left uncertain of the law application to the facts confronting him.id.at quoting salas carpenter,cir other citation omitted further,despite the adoption of the danger theory of liability by nearly all other circuit courts at the time of the conduct in question,this court denied that they comprised a consensus of cases of persuasive authority sufficient to provide fair warning,because the constitutional right was not defined with sufficient clarity to enable a reasonable official to assess the lawfulness of his conduct.id.at.this court concluded that 
the fact that the danger theory was recognized at a general level in other courts precedents did not necessarily provide officer carney with notice that his specific actions created such a danger t his is not a situation where a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law appl ied with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.
id.internal citation and quotation omitted.mcclendon then states indeed,general principles of the law are less likely to provide fair warning where,as here,applicability of the doctrine is highly.id.at citation omitted.
as the foregoing authorities suggest,for immunity purposes,the question is not whether other reasonable or more reasonable courses of action were available to public officials.see pierce,at.immunity shields officials so long as their conduct is reasonable,even though wrong in hindsight.saucier,at.at.the question here is whether,among police chiefs and sheriffs similarly situated to the appellants,all but the plainly incompetent would have realized at the time that what they did violated kinney and hall first amendment rights to testify voluntarily as expert witnesses.pierce,at citing hunter bryant,d.
to apply these principles of qualified immunity,the supreme court test normally begins by considering whether,on the facts alleged by the plaintiffs,any constitutional violation occurred if a violation could be made out,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established,whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier,at.at.
the majority errors become evident by inverting the process here.consequently,let us assume arguendo that the police chiefs and sheriffs violated the first amendment by disenrolling their students from kinney and hall classes.assume,that is,that the appellees engaged in some level of protected speech,and balancing applies.the qualified immunity question is as framed by the majority 
we must ask whether it was clearly established at the time of the police officials conduct that the first amendment forbade them from retaliating against kinney and hall,the employees of their contractor,on account of the instructors kerrville testimony.
opn.at.our answer is resoundingly that the law was not clearly established.
the law was not clearly established for three reasons.first,this court and seven other circuits have recognized that public officials are more likely entitled to qualified immunity when the underlying constitutional law depends on balancing tests enforced by the judiciary,and no factually similar case exists.second,the fifth circuit cases relied on by the majority are critically different from this case,while other circuits more relevant precedents either found no liability or qualified immunity for law enforcement officials.third,in an unprecedented approach to balancing,the majority inflates the value of the appellees speech,while discounting from the balancing test the police officials legitimate interests no clearly established law supports the majority approach.
qualified immunity and constitutional balancing.
at the heart of kinney and hall first amendment claim is the balancing test.in pickering and its progeny,the supreme court has balanced the interest of each plaintiff as a citizen in commenting on matters of public concern against the interests of the state,as an employer or contractor,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.id.at.at see also connick,at.at.pickering emphasized,however,that in view of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by public employees may be thought by their superiors to furnish grounds for dismissal,it was not appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard for resolving claims of public employees and that it could only indicate some of the general lines along which an analysis of the controlling interests should run.pickering,at.at.subsequently,the court acknowledged that the particularized balancing required by pickering is difficult even for judges to accomplish.see connick,at.at.in short,while it may have been clear since that a citizen does not forfeit first amendment rights entirely when he becomes a public employee or contractor,the scope of those rights in any given factual situation has not been well defined.benson allphin,cir.
for immunity determinations,the implications of this constitutional standard seem obvious.the supreme court has alluded to the enhanced likelihood of granting qualified immunity in first amendment cases 
even when the general rule has long been clearly established for instance,the first amendment bars retaliation for protected speech,the substantive legal doctrine on which the plaintiff relies may facilitate summary judgment t here may be doubt as to the illegality of the defendant particular conduct for instance,whether a plaintiff speech was on a matter of public concern.
britton,d.fifteen years ago,this court explained that 
one consequence of balancing is its implication for the qualified immunity of public officials whose actions are alleged to have violated an employee first amendment rights.there will rarely be a basis for a priori judgment that the termination or discipline of a public employee violated clearly established constitutional rights.
noyola texas dep t of human,cir.noyola tenet of qualified immunity jurisprudence,see moran washington,cir,has been embraced by at least seven other circuits even before noyola,the seventh circuit held that when a constitutional rule involves the balancing of competing interests,the standard may be clearly established,but its application is so fact dependent that the law can rarely be considered clearly established.benson,at.in such cases,the facts of the existing case law must closely correspond to the contested action before the defendant official is subject to liability under harlow fitzgerald.id.noyola,moran and benson express the consensus view among circuit courts.
while the majority relegates noyola to a footnote,that case remains the law of this circuit.judge higginbotham,for instance,cited noyola when observing that,the balancing test of pickering complicates the question of whether an act violated clear law.this is because the question is not only the clarity of the standard but its clarity in application.boddie city of columbus,cir.judge garwood added that qualified immunity 
principles have particular force where,as here,resolution of whether the defendant conduct violated the constitutional provision sued on is heavily dependent on a balancing or weighing against each other of different factors according to the degree they are present in the matrix of facts constituting the particular context in which the asserted violation occurred.
pierce,at.noyola has been frequently cited in our court 
noyola counsels judicial reticence toward abrogating qualified immunity in government employee first amendment cases,but it does not act as a dispensation of the duty to examine each case carefully.in several cases,after citing noyola,this court has denied the defense when,as here,the first amendment case law is dissimilar from the precedents,we must echo the caution expressed in noyola,boddie,pierce,and among the circuits that balancing of the matrix of factors constituting the particular context in which the asserted violation occurred gives particular force to an immunity defense.in such cases,a very high degree of prior factual particularity may be necessary.hope,at.at see also mcclendon,at.
finding similar cases for immunity comparison.
against the backdrop of noyola and the first amendment balancing standards,we conclude that no reasonable police chiefs and sheriffs could have clearly understood in october,that they were violating the first amendment by refusing to enroll their recruits in kinney and hall classes.no compelling or compellingly analogous fifth circuit case law gave the officials fair warning in this balancing area of constitutional law.cases from other circuits uniformly granted extra deference to law enforcement officials decisions.
the majority apparently overlooks the requirement that there be a higher degree of similarity between cases to satisfy the clearly established law prong of qualified immunity.the majority concedes that our past cases do not include one that has specifically addressed retaliation against instructors at a police academy.instead,the majority relies exclusively on ordinary whistleblower and one case brought by a college professor who testified as an expert witness such cases entail,however,a significantly different mix of interests for balancing purposes than the one before us.
consider first the ordinary whistleblower cases.this court has consistently held that a public employee is speaking out on a matter of public concern when he becomes a whistleblower and thus complains of,or testifies against,fellow employees misconduct or against his employer practices.this court has protected a wide variety of whistleblower conduct,some of it emanating from within law enforcement agencies.all of these cases,however,concerned fact witnesses,employees who had personal knowledge of misconduct within their own governmental units.
in holding that ordinary whistleblower cases afford clearly established law for this case,the majority elides several critical distinctions.foremost,kinney and hall testimony did not equate with whistleblower conduct.their opinions were valuable only insofar as they correspond with someone else account of the underlying facts.but it is the eyewitness who blows the whistle,not the expert who simply synthesizes and interprets the factual testimony.qualified expert testimony is fungible,not irreplaceable.the majority implies,nevertheless,that without kinney and hall expert testimony,the plaintiff in the kerrville case would have been unable to pursue his claim.thus the public has a special interest in receiving expert opinions.this suggestion blinks reality.our litigious culture affords experts in every conceivable specialty,including law enforcement practices and training.if the majority intends,not so subtly,to hint that these experts had unique credibility because of their affiliation with etpa,their implication proves the police officials contention kinney and hall created a conflict of interest by taking advantage of their job titles in the courtroom.
not only is the speech in whistleblower cases generically different from appellees expert testimony,but the corresponding interests of public employers are different.this court has been unsympathetic to employer retaliation against government whistleblowers,since their unorthodox conduct may furnish the public only protection against internal misconduct.a public employer has little,if any,legitimate interest in hiding dirty linen from the taxpaying public.the case before us is not,however,so easily pigeonholed.the police officials are not concealing misdeeds within their departments.indeed,since the kerrville plaintiff on whose behalf kinney and hall testified left court,the police officials retaliation did not ultimately stifle the exposure of wrongdoing.the majority facile analogy with ordinary whistleblower cases is simply wrong.we have here assumed that the police officials actions would not satisfy the pickering connick balancing test after careful analysis,but such a legal conclusion does not so ineluctably follow from a few citations to whistleblower cases as to clearly establish the guiding law.
the majority analogy to cases involving educators is also weak.in rainey,this court concluded that a college teacher contracts were unconstitutionally breached because of his testimony as a defense expert witness in a pornography case.rainey jackson state,cir.holding that the breach violated rainey first amendment rights,this court did not engage in pickering balancing.id.at.by its nature,rainey testimony could not have conflicted with the interests of his employer.no countervailing employer interests were advanced by the college against rainey right to testify.legally and factually,rainey is a poor fit with this case.
closer factually to the instant case is the policy of texas university and a state legislative appropriation provision,implemented before the police officials took action directed at kinney and hall,that broadly forbade university employees from testifying as expert witnesses for parties adverse to the state interests.see hoover morales,cir.the police officials cite the policy as reflecting clearly established law in the fifth circuit.the majority discounts appellants reliance,because the policies were under federal court challenge,and ultimately did not survive.we agree that hoover context is sufficiently different as not to furnish controlling authority in support of the police officials.
by the same token,however,the majority ought to concede that hoover reinforces the principle that in this balancing area of constitutional law,what is clearly established must be closely related factually and legally to a case at hand.significantly,this court in hoover assumed that there will be occasions when the state interests in efficient delivery of public services will be hindered by a state employee acting as an expert witness or consultant at emphasis added.hoover concludes by stating 
but our task in this case requires us to apply a pickering analysis,and in doing so we conclude that the expert witness rider and tamus policy are impermissibly overbroad.our opinion does not foreclose consideration of rules and regulations aimed at limiting expert testimony of faculty members or other state employees which adhere to our first amendment jurisprudence.
at.unlike the majority opinion,hoover does not oversimplify pickering balancing and in its way lends powerful support to the officials plea that no clearly established fifth circuit law condemned their actions regarding kinney and hall.
while the majority has strained to find that clearly established fifth circuit law was contrary to the police officials conduct,they ignore or minimize,in the immunity discussion,three circuit court cases involving alleged retaliation by law enforcement agencies for testimony.
the case most closely on point is tedder norman,cir,decided only a few months after the events at issue here.tedder was the deputy director of the arkansas law enforcement training academy.after voluntarily testifying as an expert for the plaintiff in an excessive use of force case,tedder was demoted.the eight circuit affirmed a summary judgment in tedder first amendment lawsuit against his supervisor.the court held that 
testimony concerning possible misconduct of public officials is speech on a matter of public concern that warrants constitutional protection,but,as the district court stated,it is not the place for an employee of aleta,let alone its deputy director to volunteer to give such testimony without a subpoena.
at.further,the court found a significant threat of disruption to the relationships between the academy and the law enforcement agencies that it trains.id.at.on balancing the relevant interests,the court ruled for the defendant against tedder claim of unconstitutional retaliation.id.
the majority would distinguish tedder because the defendant there testified against an officer employed by a law enforcement agency actually trained by the arkansas academy.the tedder court never specifically emphasizes this fact,however,and it found that the testimony caused actual disruption and potential further disruption to the academy.id.tedder not only undercuts the majority first amendment analysis,but clearly supports a finding of qualified immunity.it would be a strange constitutional rule indeed that protects a public employer adverse action against an employee for expert testimony,but punishes the for concerns over the very same activity.even stranger would be the denial of qualified immunity to the whose internal relations are most affected by the expert testimony,while tedder supervisor was granted qualified immunity.id.
the majority also ignores a third circuit case,decided well before the events here,which exonerated a law enforcement agency that demoted one of its officers for voluntarily appearing as a character witness for a friend son at a bail bond hearing.green philadelphia hous,cir.in green,the officer left the hearing,declining to take the stand,when he learned that the son was charged with involvement in a drug ring.the court found that the officer decision to testify constituted first amendment protected activity,but also that the public interest in his voluntary court appearance is somewhat more limited than it would be if his appearance were subpoenaed.at citing cases.
ultimately,the balancing test weighed in the department favor,as an employer,because of its significant interests in protecting the department reputation and in successfully fighting drugs and crime.the court held that any risk of departmental injury or disruption weighs heavily under the pickering balancing test.id.green thus found for the police department even though green supervisor had previously approved his court appearance.
for immunity purposes,green is closely related contextually to the present case.green attributed significant weight to the police department justification for its disciplinary action,and it carefully explains why not all court testimony is equivalent for first amendment purposes.in these ways,green furnishes a backdrop for the police officials conduct just the opposite of the synthetic clearly established law concocted by the majority.
the third case relevant for immunity purposes was brought against an oklahoma district attorney and agents for the oklahoma bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs,alleging that the rescission of an offer of employment to coordinate the da drug task force was based on the plaintiff previous expert witness testimony for a murder defendant.worrell henry,cir.the murder trial in which the employee testified involved the killing of one of the narcotics bureau agents.the court granted summary judgment for the district attorney,who was the prospective employer,but it denied summary judgment and qualified immunity to the chief narcotics bureau agent.the tenth circuit held that balancing was appropriate to evaluate the first amendment consequences of the district attorney refusal to hire worrell,but it did not find pickering appropriate to analyze the alleged retaliation by the,agents of the narcotics bureau.in reaching the latter conclusion,the court acknowledged that there may be instances in which the operations of a third party agency are so intertwined with the operations of the employing agency that the pickering balancing should be applied.worrell,at.
worrell demonstrates that if the police officials role is viewed through the lens,their claim to immunity should be ironclad.even if their position more closely resembles that of the narcotics bureau agents,however,they could argue that they fall under worrell caveat because their operations are closely intertwined with etpa.
we may end this section where we began.because this case involves constitutional balancing,the clearly established law must have existed at a higher level of specificity than might be required in other types of immunity cases.this is hardly an extraordinary conclusion.it follows as a negative implication from this court en banc holding in mcclendon that,absent controlling circuit authority,a consensus of cases of persuasive authority might,under some circumstances,be sufficient to compel the conclusion that no reasonable officer could have believed that his or her actions were lawful.mcclendon,at.in this case,the fifth circuit precedents cited by the majority involve fundamental distinctions in the nature of the speech as well as the public employer interests.while useful,such cases hardly compel the conclusion that the police officials could not properly disenroll their officers from kinney and hall classes.the majority overlooked other circuits cases that discussed pickering balancing in the specific context of law enforcement agencies and various types of testimony.whether or not the majority would agree with the outcome of those cases,two of them predate the police officials conduct here,and they should be regarded as constituting a consensus of persuasive authority arrayed against the majority conclusion.at best,one must conclude that there was no clearly established law that gave the police officials fair warning of the unconstitutionality of their conduct.see mcclendon,at no consensus of cases from other jurisdictions where those cases applied the constitutional rule differently and facts were insufficiently similar qualified immunity granted to police officer.
novelty in the majority balancing exercise.
the third proof of error in the majority qualified immunity analysis arises from the way it strikes the balance.in october,no court had held that a law enforcement employee right to testify voluntarily as an expert witness outweighed the interests of the agency.see worrell,at discussing prior circuit court cases and noting that even where pickering balancing favored the employee,a different result might be reached where an agency could show a disruption in its operations.and to this day,no cases have,in the law enforcement context,elevated testimony so high,or rated the department interests so low,as the majority does here.this is not to say at this point that the majority is incorrect,but the novelty of this balance cuts against any conclusion that clearly established law proscribed the police officials conduct.the appellants position thus resembles that of the county supervisors in umbehr,whose qualified immunity was upheld on appeal while the supreme court approved the application of balancing to the relations between independent contractors and government entities.see generally,umbehr.
because the majority has exaggerated the analogy between voluntary expert testimony and whistleblower testimony,it elevated kinney and hall interests in testifying as voluntary expert witnesses to almost absolutely protected status.the majority has thus extended or partially overruled hoover morales,which rejected such an absolutist approach.see hoover,at.from the perspective of other circuits,too,the majority conclusion is unprecedented.the tenth circuit has specifically held otherwise first amendment protection of public employees testimony is not absolute.there are instances in which government entities interests as employers outweigh employees interests in free expression and the policy of encouraging truthful and uninhibited testimony.worrell,at.worrell then described with approval the way in which the courts in green and tedder evaluated the clash between law enforcement officers rights to testify and their agency significant interests.worrell,at.in green,as noted above,the third circuit held that the officer voluntary appearance at a bail hearing,although constitutionally significant,was entitled to less weight.green,at.the eighth circuit in tedder also decided that the voluntariness of the deputy director expert testimony in a police brutality case lessened its first amendment protection.tedder,at.no other case has ascribed to voluntary expert witness testimony like that of kinney and hall such elevated first amendment status.
likewise,in unprecedented fashion,the majority holds for naught the police officials description of their institutional interests in controlling the education of department officers the majority hostility toward the police officials position is contrary to waters churchill,which described the government significant interest as an employer as follows 
when someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to an agency effective operation begins to do or say things that detract from the agency effective operation,the government employer must have some power to restrain her.
d.waters further noted 
w e have consistently given greater deference to government predictions of harm used to justify restrictions of employee speech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on the speech of the public at large.few of the examples we have discussed involve tangible,present interference with the agency operation.the danger in them is mostly speculative.
at.at.in umbehr,too,the court reminded that,pickering requires a and deferential weighing of the government legitimate interests.umbehr,at.at.
as was previously explained,the expert testimony caused an uproar because police officials and feared kinney and hall might use information gleaned in their classes to testify against the sponsoring agencies that their testimony interfered with unfettered classroom discussions and that they misused their affiliation with etpa to enhance their testimony.one can certainly understand the sensitivity of the police officials about kinney and hall testimony.far from exhibiting wanton police brutality,the gonzales case portrayed an officer life endangered by a deranged shooter.such situations are the stuff of law officers nightmares and domestic tragedies.there is no evidence that kinney and hall were lawyers,and they are entitled to their professional opinions as law enforcement instructors.nevertheless,feelings of loyalty,confidence and teamwork between the agencies and the instructors were understandably strained by this testimony.further,it is evident that the instructors enhanced their credibility because of their association with etpa,and that the police officials might legitimately question whether the instructors impartiality was undermined because they initially agreed to be paid experts.
the majority might refuse to defer and throw all these institutional concerns to the winds in its first amendment analysis.but in doing so,not only does it abuse the general cautions expressed by the supreme court,but it contradicts authorities from several circuits.in green,the third circuit described as very significant the interests of the housing authority police department as an employer where the officer voluntary testimony created a risk of departmental injury based on the potential disruptiveness of the speech.green,at,quoting waters,at.at.
in tedder,the court concluded that tedder testimony caused actual disruption and potential further disruption between aleta and the law enforcement agencies that it was charged with training.tedder,at.the court was concerned that students loss of faith in the aleta deputy director,who had the authority to approve or veto lesson plans,could spread to every class taught there.see id.the eighth circuit has elsewhere recognized in emphatic terms the heightened interests of law enforcement agencies.see,shands city of kennett,cir tindle caudell,cir.
in worrell,the tenth circuit reiterated that personal loyalty and confidence among employees are especially important in law enforcement and noted that t hese concerns are heightened in smaller offices and departments,where relatively minor disturbances in morale may create significant problems.worrell,at.the court adds that the district attorney was not obliged to wait for an actual breakdown in the functioning of his taskforce before taking action.id.at.he was entitled to rely on reasonable predictions of workplace disruption.see also waters,at.at noting the substantial weight afforded to government employers reasonable predictions of disruptions.
the seventh circuit has repeatedly held that d eference to the employer judgment regarding the disruptive nature of an employee speech is especially important in the context of law enforcement.williams seniff,cir quoting kokkinis ivkovich,cir.
finally,the sixth circuit has held that police officials are entitled to qualified immunity for taking reasonable administrative action to preclude one of their officers from exploiting his uniform and his position in the police department to advocate on behalf of the national rifle association.see generally,thomas whalen,cir.while acknowledging the protected status of the officer political speech,the court pointed out that no court has recognized a right to exploit one rank in public employment solely for the purpose of enhancing credibility for personal or political gain.whalen,at.
in addition,the majority wholly overlooks that public employers are entitled to deference in dealing with employees whose trust and loyalty are essential to the functioning of a public office.see,connick,supra,at.at when close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities,a wide degree of deference to the employer judgment is appropriate.kinsey salado indep.sch,cir en banc.there can hardly be any dispute that law enforcement instructors occupy a sensitive and extremely important position with respect to the agencies mission.if training fails because the trainees have lost confidence in their instructors and are unwilling to discuss issues frankly with them,the consequences can be disastrous.the cases specifically refer to institutional loyalty as a quality especially required in law enforcement agencies,yet the majority ignores it.
at this point,we have assumed the correctness of the majority final conclusion that a first amendment violation occurred.but in its novel approach to balancing the instructors interests against those of the law enforcement agencies,the majority is making new law,not simply expounding clearly established law.kinney and hall may choose to pursue their suits against the municipal entities,but the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
iv.was there a violation of the first amendment 
although we have demonstrated that the police officials were entitled to qualified immunity regardless of whether their conduct violated the first amendment,we would also hold that their actions were not,under the balancing test,unconstitutional.
pickering requires a and deferential weighing of the government legitimate interests.umbehr,at.at.in holding that pickering balancing applies to cases in which a governmental entity appears to condition the provision of contracts on a third party constitutionally protected expression,the supreme court observed that the nuanced pickering approach,which recognizes that a variety of interests may arise in independent contractor cases,is superior to a rule distinguishing independent contractors from employees.id.at.the court also found it far from clear,as a general matter,whether the balance of interests at stake is more favorable to the government in independent contractor cases than in employee cases.id.at.at.
whether kinney and hall are classified as independent contractors or as employees is not as significant as how their overall function,and their voluntary expert testimony,affected the law enforcement agencies performance of a public mission.compare umbehr,id.at.at noting that a rule that would leave first amendment rights unduly dependent on whether a state law labels a government service provider contract as one of employment or a contract for services is a very poor proxy for the interests at stake.to the extent the majority opinion depends on labeling kinney and hall as independent contractors rather than employees,its analysis is oversimplified and inconsistent with umbehr further,the majority reliance on this court cases involving government contractors is hollow,since neither the speech at issue in those cases nor the governmental interests at stake is comparable to the present case 
balancing the interests in this case on a clean slate,the appellees testimony constituted speech on a matter of public concern and was entitled to some level of constitutional protection.for reasons previously discussed,we,unlike the majority,do not characterize the protection as extremely strong.other circuits opinions have properly distinguished voluntary testimony from testimony under subpoena.see green,at tedder,at.further,voluntary expert witness testimony is distinct from standard whistleblower conduct,and on the facts of this case,kinney and hall expert opinions were not essential to exposing wrongdoing by a policeman or a police department.
the interests of the law enforcement agencies have been in other cases,where it has been held that there is a special need for deference to the employment decisions of those responsible for insuring public safety.kokkinis,at.law enforcement agencies have a more significant interest than the typical government employer in regulating the speech activities of their employees in order to promote efficiency,foster loyalty and obedience to superior officers,maintain morale,and instill public confidence.tyler city of mountain home,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the police officials here deposed or attested that appellees expert testimony hurt the close working relationship required between academy instructors and representatives of the cities and counties damaged teamwork required among those involved in training officers threatened the confidentiality of information officers share with their instructors about procedures and practices undermined feelings of loyalty and confidence and represented an improper use of the instructors affiliation with etpa.the police officials offered evidence of actual and potential disruption to their training programs and departments.
two factors detract,in the majority view,from the strength of these articulated interests and the deference they are due.first,it is contended that because appellees testified miles away from etpa and in a case not involving a trainee or department sponsor of the etpa program,the police officials concerns are misplaced.the distance between kerrville and kilgore,texas,is a red herring.both cities are in texas,both are governed by the same regime of state and federal law,and there is no showing that police officers trained in east texas rarely or never migrate to other areas of the state,or that etpa influence spreads no further than the boundaries of its sponsoring department.the mile argument is disingenuous 
that the expert testimony posed a conflict of interest with kinney and hall status as instructors,despite its taking place outside etpa formal jurisdiction,is a conclusion entitled to deference.as the majority notes,the police officials did not,in events leading up to this case,explain how they used the term conflict of interest,but the officials ineloquence does not mean their judgment is entitled to no weight.moreover,it is evident that in testifying before a kerrville jury,the appellees status as instructors at a texas police academy would enhance their credibility and lend the prestige of etpa to their words.by their status,the instructors necessarily implicated the sponsoring departments despite any professional disclaimers in the legitimacy of their expert opinions.even if other possible standards for conflicts of interest,detracting from their time available to prepare for and conduct etpa classes or on salary and witness fees,are excluded,a conflict existed in this sense.see,thomas whalen,at discussing a government entity interest in preserving the appearance of impartiality.
more consequential is the majority criticism that the police officials could not legitimately discipline kinney and hall to enforce an unwritten code of silence,whereby police officers do not testify against each other.we agree that enforcing the code of silence to stifle speech concerning police misconduct is not a legitimate governmental interest.the evidence shows,however,that this was not a contemporaneous justification formally offered for the police officials conduct,and,in fact,reference to an unwritten code was made by only one of the appellants,during a television interview.as can be seen from the wealth of detail in the majority opinion,this case contained an abundance of contemporary oral and documentary evidence as well as depositions that explored the police officials reasons for their action.that only one reference appears throughout the record to an unwritten code is significant.this stray remark should not be blown out of proportion.
the dominant theme in cases that have considered the pickering balance in the context of law enforcement is the need for a high degree of personal loyalty and confidence,esprit de corps,harmony and good morale within departments and between instructors and trainees.tedder,for instance,relied on the interests of the actual employer,the police training academy,which has only an indirect stake in the results of training.tedder,at.tedder reflects the even stronger interests of the officials in this case,whose departments and officers rely on the academy training for the sake of the public.in worrell,the tenth circuit held that a district attorney interest in preventing disruption with other agencies outweighed the applicant interest in avoiding retaliation for his testimony as an expert witness against a police officer.worrell,at.in green,the reputation and law enforcement capacity of the housing authority police were held to prevail over an officer decision to testify voluntarily.green,at.the seventh circuit has on several occasions held that protected speech was subordinate to the institutional interests of agencies.see seniff,at kokkinis,at.
in stark contrast to those cases,the majority here ignores the paramilitary interests of the agencies and reduces their legitimate concerns to the instructors competence and teaching ability.as a matter of law,and based on this record,those interests are too narrowly defined.
we conclude that this is a closer case under pickering balancing than others in the law enforcement area.while kinney and hall engaged in protected conduct,their voluntary expert testimony did not carry such a high degree of public importance,in general or in the facts of this case,as ordinary whistleblower testimony.further,we owe special deference to the law enforcement agencies legitimate interests in maintaining discipline,harmony,confidentiality and morale in their departments and training programs.we also note that while the police officials opined that kinney and hall should be fired,they succeeded only in disenrolling their students from the instructors classes.they did not and could not directly terminate appellees employment.
on balance,we conclude that the police officials did not violate the first amendment by disenrolling their students from appellees classes.the officials have the discretion to decide,consistent with the first amendment,by whom their officers will be taught.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,i respectfully dissent from the denial of qualified immunity on the appellees first amendment claims,and i join judge barksdale dissent.
i respectfully dissent and agree with judges jones and barksdale that the defendant law enforcement officers are entitled to qualified immunity and should be released from personal liability.it seems disingenuous to hold that the law is clearly established when it takes words to explain,and when six united states court of appeals judges sharply disagree about it.to my way of reasoning,the majority has turned the words,and the doctrine,of clearly established on its head when it denies immunity in this novel case.
the police officials are nacogdoches police chief ted gibson,harrison county sheriff bob green,kilgore director of public safety ronnie moore,smith county sheriff smith,gregg county sheriff bobby weaver,marshall police chief charles chuck williams,and tyler police chief bill young.
the driving distance between the two cities is approximately miles.as the district court noted by way of comparison,that figure is roughly the same as the driving distance between boston,massachusetts,and washington.as the crow flies,the distance between kilgore and kerrville is miles.
kinney and hall offered an innocent explanation for their inquiries about the seized gun,saying that they hoped to shoot the gun for their own enjoyment and local police had let them do on other because they were gathering information in order to testify as expert witnesses in defense of the gun owner.the defendants briefs have highlighted the gun incident,but the plaintiffs evidence suggests that it was not a motivating factor in the boycott.as described below,the other police officials who wrote to holda did not mention the gun incident kinney and hall kerrville testimony was the only stated reason for threatening to boycott the etpa.the kerrville testimony was,moreover,the only complaint reflected in the minutes of the meeting at which the local police agencies decided to boycott the plaintiffs.the district court found that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the plaintiffs testimony was the reason for the boycott.kinney weaver,d.
the defendants have suggested that kinney and hall told their students that the students might someday face kinney and hall in court.in their affidavits and depositions,kinney and hall concede that,if subpoenaed to testify against one of their students,they would testify truthfully as to what they taught the student kinney and hall also state,however,that they do not tell their students that they would testify against them as experts.regarding the defendants assertion that kinney once said in class that he would go to the highest bidder and could face the students as an expert witness,kinney responds that he might have made such a remark as a obvious joke.the students apparently took the comment that way,as the only piece of evidence relating to a student reaction to the comment says that i never gave much thought to what he said and believed in my mind that he was just talking.
the defendants admitted either in their pleadings,depositions,or during the hearing in the district court to making the statements recounted in this paragraph,and the defendants admissions are proper summary judgment evidence.the record also contains a great many other newspaper clippings quoting both holda and the defendants those reports are relevant,without regard to the truth of the matter asserted,to the defendants argument that the plaintiffs testimony created a public rift between the etpa and the local police agencies.
the suit originally named an eighth police chief and his agency of employment as additional defendants,but the district court granted an agreed motion to dismiss the claims against those parties.
this court has held that orders denying official immunity under texas law are immediately appealable to the same extent as denials of qualified immunity under federal law.see cantu rocha,cir.
since we lack jurisdiction to review a denial of summary judgment based on the district court conclusion that fact questions exist regarding whether the defendants engaged in conduct that would violate clearly established law,officials may sometimes be required to proceed to trial even though the ultimate resolution of those factual disputes may show that they are entitled to qualified immunity from liability.the supreme court recognizes that this threatens to undercut the policy of affording immunity from trial,but the court has said that countervailing considerations nonetheless support this limitation on interlocutory jurisdiction.see johnson,at.
the johnson court provided three reasons for its conclusion that arguments relating to the sufficiency of the evidence are not immediately appealable mitchell had said that interlocutory appeal was appropriate only for reviewing the district court purely legal rulings,questions regarding sufficiency of the evidence are not separable from the underlying merits of the case for purposes of the collateral order doctrine,and reviewing factual disputes on interlocutory appeal was undesirable as a matter of judicial administration.see johnson,at.
although the briefs submitted by both parties in this case address only the issue whether the district court properly denied the police officials claims of qualified immunity,the notices of appeal filed with this court name not only the police officials,but also the cities,counties,and the east texas police chiefs association.the doctrine of qualified immunity applies only to government officials,and thus the portion of the motion for summary judgment addressing the plaintiffs claims against the cities,counties,and the east texas police chiefs association attacked those claims on grounds apart from qualified immunity.because the district court order denying summary judgment to the entities is not a final decision within the meaning of,we do not have jurisdiction over an appeal of such an order.accordingly,we dismiss the appeal of the district court summary judgment order brought by the cities,counties,and the east texas police chiefs association.
the defendants recognize this point and conceded in their reply brief before the panel that they must accept the material facts reasonably suggested by kinney and hall proof.
to be sure,the district court opinion did not and could not be expected to discuss every aspect of the conflicting evidence.the police officials briefs have,at times,discussed aspects of the facts that the district court did not explicitly address.in responding to those arguments,we do not,as the dissent alleges freely evaluate the disputed evidence,jones dissent at.we do not purport to resolve any factual disputes,as this case is at the summary judgment stage.rather,we seek only to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed,for purposes of summary judgment.see johnson,at.
with respect to the plaintiffs state law claim,we must apply the texas law of official immunity,which differs slightly from the federal standard.since we reinstate the portion of the panel opinion that dealt with the state law claim,we do not discuss official immunity under texas law in today opinion.
in calling for a narrow construction of that departs from the text,judge barksdale dissent cites kush rutledge,d.but kush is notable because it rejected a limiting construction that certain circuits,including this one,had erroneously embraced.id.at.
as described earlier,the defendants position is that no testimony against the police is too distant to warrant condemnation.the plaintiffs in the kerrville case sought help from kinney and hall because they had experienced difficulty finding an expert from their local area.
we find untenable any general proposition that cases are necessarily required in order to create clearly established law.as the supreme court explained in a case involving the criminal counterpart to,the civil doctrine of qualified immunity has the same objective as the rule that due process requires fair warning before criminal liability may be imposed.see united states lanier,d.t he touchstone is whether the statute,either standing alone or as construed,made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant conduct was criminal.id.at.emphasis added.we doubt that the police officials would be willing to agree that the contents of the texas penal code or title of the code are inherently incapable of giving notice of their own meaning,even as to phrases as transparent as any witness.
see briscoe lahue,d storck suffolk county dep t of soc,d,the absolute immunity extends to all persons,whether governmental,expert,or lay witnesses,integral to the trial process.citing briscoe.
kinney and hall had contracts for the academic year,so they were not employees for that term.the relationship was in the sense that kinney and hall had no contract for continued employment beyond the contract period,no right to automatic renewal.
given the facts of this case,it is incorrect to say,as judge barksdale dissent repeatedly does,that the only thing that the police officials did was to benignly decline to enroll their officers in the plaintiffs classes.the defendants interfered with the plaintiffs employment,and if that is an absurd result,then the dissent quarrel is with haddle,not with us.
hall left the etpa before the expiration of his contract for the academic year,assertedly because of fears over job security.to the extent that the police officials interfered with hall rights under this contract,as opposed to hall prospects of continued employment beyond the contract,the police officials did more than merely interfere with employment.however,the plaintiffs have not argued that the defendants interference with hall contract violated law that was clearly established even before haddle,and thus we need not decide that question.
in their petition for rehearing,the defendants raised for the first time an argument that the plaintiffs do not have statutory standing to sue under.the argument is that even though prohibits the intimidation of part ies or witness es as well as many other categories of persons,the remedy described in the last clause of uses the phrase party so injured to mean litigant so injured rather than person so injured.there is a split of authority with respect to the point raised by the defendants.compare chavis clayton county sch,cir,heffernan hunter,cir,and brever rockwell int l,cir all holding that witnesses have standing,with blankenship mcdonald,cir,and rylewicz beaton,cir both holding that witnesses lack standing.we note that there is a question as to our jurisdiction to entertain an argument relating to statutory standing as opposed to constitutional standing in the context of an interlocutory appeal.see summit med,pryor,cir triad robinson,cir.we need not resolve the question,however,as the defendants did not raise this issue in the district court or before the panel.they are of course free to raise the argument in further proceedings below.
our reading of the on account of his having so attended or testified language in parallels the supreme court interpretation of similar language in,the criminal counterpart to.section criminalizes,inter alia,conspiracies to injure or intimidate a citizen in the free exercise and enjoyment of federal rights because of the citizen having so exercised the same.interpreting this language in united states guest,d,the court stated that would not reach every conspiracy that affected a federal right,but only a conspiracy whose predominant purpose was to deter or punish the exercise of the federal right.id.at.
this balancing was of course informed by the district court evaluation of the summary judgment evidence.specifically,regarding the police officials assertions that the instructors speech threatened to disrupt the efficient provision of public services,the district court remarked as follows there are genuine issues of fact remaining in this case as to whether the plaintiffs expert testimony could legitimately cause any disruptions in the defendants operations.moreover,it must be determined whether these disruptions,if any,were the result of a perceived conflict of interest or the blackballing of plaintiffs for turning against one of their own d at.
see.communications,jones,cir although the plaintiff newspaper may have had no right to receive certain legal advertising from the county board of supervisors,it would violate the constitution for the board to withhold public patronage,in the form of its advertising,from the newspaper in retaliation for that newspaper exercise of first amendment rights,or,in similar reprisal to threaten commercial advertisers with a loss of county business should they continue to advertise in the newspaper.
based on reasoning similar to that of the supreme court in umbehr and truck service,this court has also applied a pickering balancing test in first amendment retaliation cases arising outside the public employment context.see,copsey swearingen,cir holding that a pickering balancing analysis was the appropriate framework for evaluating a vending stand operator first amendment claim based on a state agency revocation of his license after he publicly criticized the licensing program caine hardy,cir en banc treating an anesthesiologist with clinical privileges at a public hospital as a public employee for purposes of his first amendment claim based on the hospital permanent suspension of his clinical privileges after he opposed a proposal made by the chief of anesthesiology.
contrary to some of the police officials intimations,the plaintiffs interests in speaking can not be reduced to a mere pecuniary interest in,as the defendants put it,moonlighting as.the plaintiffs originally planned to be paid for their work in the kerrville shooting as kinney had been paid in the past when he had testified as an expert in support of police they later decided that it would be right to charge because they felt so strongly about the incident.as we explain in the text,the speech in this case is uncommonly valuable because of the public interest in identifying,preventing,and remedying official misconduct,not because of any personal advantage to kinney and hall.
the fact that kinney and hall spoke as expert witnesses does not mean that their speech was less valuable than other forms of speech that reveals official misconduct.by virtue of their experience and expertise,witnesses like kinney and hall play an essential role in identifying police misconduct.there was no secret about the fact that eddie gonzales had been shot by the police in kerrville the public did not need an expert witness to reveal that.the public does need experts like kinney and hall,however,to reveal whether the shooting was an unjustified use of force or the result of inadequate training or supervision.
judge jones would minimize the importance of the free speech interest at stake here on the ground that kinney a
