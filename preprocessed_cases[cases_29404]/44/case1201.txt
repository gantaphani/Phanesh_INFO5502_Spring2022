factual background and procedural history 
smith was born in tortola,british virgin islands,and spent much of her childhood in thomas,virgin islands.she became a naturalized united states citizen in after high school,smith attended college in hampton,virginia,and thereafter moved to miami.in,smith returned to the where she married and had a son.her marriage ended in,and smith moved to atlanta and then to miami.in,smith moved back to the where she worked for the virgin islands department of education as a teacher.on august,a light fixture,installed by the vanterpools,fell on smith while she was working at charlotte amalie high school in the smith stated in her affidavit that she traveled to florida in december of for treatment related to her injuries and it was then that she considered florida her home,intending to remain there.smith then returned to the in,but may have spent part of the year in florida.in december of,smith moved to tortola,to live with her brother.she filed this lawsuit against the vanterpools on may,while living in tortola.
smith filed suit in the district court of the virgin islands.she asserted that there was alienage jurisdiction under a and alleged that she was a citizen and resident of tortola,and that the vanterpools were citizens and residents of the.the district court thereby exercised jurisdiction over the action.according to their brief submitted to this court,the vanterpools moved prior to trial to preclude smith expert economist from testifying.counsel grounded his objection on the fact that the economist was basing his life expectancy calculations on the life expectancy chart.the vanterpools contended that this table could not be used respecting smith,as she was a citizen of the.in response to the motion,smith stated that she was a citizen of the united states residing in the.the case proceeded to trial and a jury returned a verdict in smith favor in an amount exceeding million,and the district court entered judgment on april.
on the basis of this new information regarding smith citizenship,the vanterpools filed a timely motion to vacate the jury verdict and dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in their supporting memorandum,the vanterpools argued that because smith was a united states citizen living abroad in the,she was not entitled to utilize a,even if she was also a citizen of that foreign nation.in response,smith contended that even if the vanterpools position was correct,the district court possessed diversity jurisdiction pursuant to a because she was a citizen of florida when she filed the complaint see,yancoskie.river port,cir acknowledging that an alternate basis for federal jurisdiction may be considered if there is a defect in the initial basis for jurisdiction.the district court ordered smith to identify and produce objective facts tending to show that she had established domicile in florida prior to and up to the time the action was filed.ultimately,the district court concluded that these facts were insufficient to prove domicile in florida and found that smith was either a resident of tortola,or a domiciliary of the at the time the complaint was filed,and granted the vanterpools motion.
ii.standard of review 
we exercise jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to and our review of a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is plenary.see gould,united states,cir.however,h istorical or chronological data which underline a court determination of diversity jurisdiction are factual in nature,and,on review,are subject to the clearly erroneous rule.krasnov dinan,cir internal citations omitted.thus,this court will not disturb the judgment of the district court unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed in the district court factfinding namely,the finding that smith was not domiciled in florida when she commenced her negligence action.see korn korn,cir citing united states gypsum.
iii.merits 
the first issue we address on appeal is whether smith can invoke alienage jurisdiction under a if she in fact possesses dual citizenship this issue is one of first impression for our court.
a number of our sister courts of appeals have already held that for a dual national citizen,only the american nationality is relevant for purposes of diversity under.these courts agree that diversity jurisdiction may be properly invoked only when a dual citizen domicile,and thus his citizenship,is in a state diverse from that of adverse parties.coury prot,cir citing action marc rich,cir sadat mertes,cir mutuelles unies kroll linstrom,cir las vistas villas,petersen,aff,cir.thus,an american national,living abroad,can not sue or be sued in federal court under a.the only way that an american national,living abroad,can sue under is under a if that national is a citizen,domiciled,in one of the fifty states.coury,at we find the fifth circuit reasoning in coury prot particularly persuasive 
the dual citizen should not be allowed to invoke alienage jurisdiction because this would give him an advantage not enjoyed by american citizens t he major purpose of alienage jurisdiction is to promote international relations by assuring other countries that litigation involving their nationals will be treated at the national level,and alienage jurisdiction is intended to allow foreign subjects to avoid real or perceived bias in the state justification that should not be available to the dual citizen who is an american.
id.at citing moore federal practice internal citations omitted.
we agree with the courts that have already decided this issue and hold that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,only the american nationality of a dual national is recognized.because smith is a united states citizen,her initial reliance on alienage jurisdiction was in error.furthermore,if smith was domiciled abroad at the time her complaint was filed,she would not be a citizen of any state and diversity jurisdiction under a would also fail.only if smith was domiciled in a particular state of the united states at the time the suit was filed,and that state was diverse from that of the vanterpools,would subject matter jurisdiction be present.
the second issue presented by this appeal,then,is whether the district court committed clear error when it found that smith was not a domiciliary of florida for purposes of invoking diversity jurisdiction under a.we accept the ultimate factual determination of the unless that determination is either completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility,or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.krasnov dinan,cir.our independent review of the record reveals that the district court finding that smith was not a domiciliary of florida when she commenced her action was not clearly erroneous.thus,the parties were not diverse for purposes of a.
smith argues that she changed her domicile from the to florida in december of when she traveled to florida for treatment related to her injury.in the alternative,smith claims that she never abandoned her florida domicile in.a party citizenship for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction is synonymous with domicile.mccann newman irrevocable trust,cir.domicile is an individual true,fixed and permanent home and place of habitation.it is the place to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning.id.citing vlandis kline,d.therefore,the district court correctly recognized that domicile is established by a party physical presence in a state with an intent to remain there indefinitely.see juvelis snider,cir.it looked to several factors that our court has enunciated to determine a party
