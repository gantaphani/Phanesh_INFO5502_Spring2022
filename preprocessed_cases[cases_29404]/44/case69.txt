jury selection is a fundamental step in our legal process,and when mechanisms do not function as they are meant to,we end up faced with situations such as the one in this case a discovery that an individual served as a juror when he should not have cleared preliminary procedural hurdles due to a prior felony conviction prompted a motion challenging the jury verdict.but even though this individual slipped through the qualification cracks,his inclusion is not fatal to the jury verdict.we conclude that the district court properly denied the motion.
in march,brian faria was injured in a car accident,which he claimed was caused by a reckless highway driver who cut him off.eventually,faria and his wife collectively,the farias brought a lawsuit against their insurance carrier,harleysville worcester insurance company harleysville,claiming that harleysville had incorrectly denied coverage under the uninsured motorist provision of his automobile insurance policy.litigation proceeded in the normal course,and,ultimately,the case was slated for a jury trial.
a prospective juror by the name of john rieger rieger was randomly selected for jury service,and he received a juror qualification form by mail when completing his form,rieger selected yes in response to a question asking whether he had ever been convicted of a crime for which punishment could have been more than one year in prison following the form instructions,rieger elaborated in the remarks section he represented that the date of the offense was,the date of the conviction was,and he served eighteen months of the sentence imposed.he also selected yes in response to the question were your civil rights restored and specifically wrote voting rights.as per the qualification form instructions,he returned it to the clerk of court,however,he did not sign under penalty of perjury and date the form as required.
to voir dire on august,at which point counsel for the farias asked the summoned panel,amongst other things,whether anyone had served as a juror in another case,whether it be criminal or civil he also asked them questions designed to ferret out their knowledge of personal injury claims,such as whether any of them,or anyone they personally knew,had made such a claim.and continuing with questioning centered on civil litigation,he asked whether anyone,any relative,children,husbands,uncle,aunts that are very close to you,any of them been a plaintiff or a defendant in a case rieger remained silent in response to these questions.
when the jury was empaneled on august,it included rieger.trial began on august,and the jury unanimous verdict,announced yes by foreperson rieger,was for harleysville.
but twelve days later,the farias filed a motion for a new trial after learning that rieger had been convicted in rhode island state court of assault with a dangerous weapon in,and he had been sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment,with four years to serve,as well as an suspended sentence that would run concurrently with probation and due to his state court appeal,his sentence was not executed until march,meaning he was on a suspended sentence and probation at the time he served on the jury.the farias contended that rieger was not qualified to serve on the jury under b.
ruling on the motion,the district court found that following his conviction,rieger civil rights had not been fully restored and,therefore,he was not qualified to serve.but it also found that the farias arguably waived their right to challenge rieger service because they did not follow the proper procedure for contesting his service,nor did they seek to obtain a copy of the qualification forms which disclosed rieger conviction,despite having ample time to learn something about the members of the jury either through the questionnaires or otherwise.reluctant,however,to dispose of the case on waiver,the district court turned to the fairness of the trial and whether any prejudice resulted from rieger inclusion.the district court concluded that the questions asked during voir dire focused on the potential jurors experiences in civil matters,and there were no questions about anything to do with the criminal justice system.from this,the district court concluded that rieger silence in response to the questions during voir dire was appropriate and did not amount to a dishonest nondisclosure.the district court went on,rieger told the truth about his record in his questionnaire,and saw no reason to believe that rieger representation was anything other than a mistaken belief that because his voting rights were restored upon his release from prison that all of his civil rights were restored at that time.
the district court denied the motion,concluding that the farias had not shown that rieger service deprived them of a fundamentally fair trial,and that the jury was impartial and the farias had a fair trial.the farias timely appealed and we take the arguments in turn.
standard of review 
generally,motions for a new trial are committed to the discretion of the district court.mcdonough power,greenwood,quoting montgomery ward duncan.abuse of discretion occurs when our appellate review reveals that the district court erred in its legal rulings or clearly erred in its factual findings.sampson united states,cir.see also united states bater,cir.explaining that abuse of discretion is used as well to embrace mistakes on abstract issues of law reviewed de novo and errors of fact for which clear error is the customary test.elaborating on that standard,we have noted that w here the motion rests on a challenge to the qualification of a juror,our standard of review is highly deferential because the district court is closer to the action and has a better feel for the likelihood that prejudice sprouted.united states nickens,cir.quoting united states uribe,cir.further,a trial court findings on issues of juror credibility and honesty are determinations peculiarly within a trial judge province and are accorded great deference.amirault fair,cir.quoting wainwright witt.
the system jury selection and service act,jury selection plan,and juror qualification forms 
before we address the parties arguments,a general primer on the jury selection system in place at the time of the farias trial would be useful.to put matters in context the farias tell us the system broke down when the clerk,on the basis of rieger juror qualification form,allowed the statutorily ineligible to slip through the cracks onto this jury.here how the system works.
the jury selection and service act,jssa directs the district court of rhode island to create a jury selection plan the jury plan see,jury selection plan hereinafter jury plan.in accordance with the jury plan,a master jury wheel is created by selecting names at random from the voter registration lists as maintained by the secretary of state of rhode island.id.a c.names are randomly drawn from the master jury wheel,and the individuals selected receive juror qualification forms.id.a,b.
the qualification forms are designed to screen prospective jurors to ensure that every juror summoned meets the requirements of b of the jssa,which,in pertinent part,explains that any person is qualified to serve on a jury unless he has a charge pending against him for the commission of,or has been convicted in a state or federal court of record of,a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and his civil rights have not been restored.jury plan,e.in this way,the forms serve as a tool.
the jury plan explains 
a judicial officer,upon his or her own initiative or upon recommendation of the clerk,or the clerk under supervision of the court,shall determine solely on the basis of the information provided on the juror qualification form,and other competent evidence,whether a person is unqualified for,or exempt,or to be excused from jury service.
jury plan,qualification phase.and t he clerk shall enter by electronic means or manually such determination in the space provided on the juror qualification form.id.so,under the jury plan,the clerk or a judicial officer reviews the completed forms and determines on the basis of the information provided on those forms whether a prospective juror is qualified to serve.a person determined to be unqualified is not placed on the qualified jury wheel and is,therefore,not subject to summons.
section of the jssa addresses deficient juror qualification forms 
in any case in which it appears that there is an omission,ambiguity,or error in a form,the clerk or jury commission shall return the form with instructions to the person to make such additions or corrections as may be necessary and to return the form to the clerk or jury commission within ten days.
had the clerk scrutinized rieger qualification form more carefully,he or she would have observed the gaps in information omissions of conviction date,nature of offense,the name of the court where rieger was convicted,the parameters of the sentence imposed,the status of the full restoration of rieger civil rights,and rieger failure to sign the form,and returned the form to rieger to be corrected and returned.
meanwhile,as for challenging the jury selection process,the jssa provides guidance 
in civil cases,before the voir dire examination begins,or within seven days after the party discovered or could have discovered,by the exercise of diligence,the grounds therefor,whichever is earlier,any party may move to stay the proceedings on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the petit jury.
id.c.and,with respect to how qualification forms may be requested,the jssa provides 
the contents of records or papers used by the jury commission or clerk in connection with the jury selection process shall not be disclosed,except pursuant to the district court plan or as may be necessary in the preparation or presentation of a motion under subsection a,b,or c of this section the parties in a case shall be allowed to inspect,reproduce,and copy such records or papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.
for its own part,the jury plan explains that t he contents of records or papers used by the clerk in connection with the jury selection process shall not be disclosed,except pursuant to this plan or upon order of the court.jury plan,b.therefore,under certain circumstances,the jssa and the jury plan provide litigants a mechanism a motion to the court for seeking the release of the juror qualification forms.the farias did not file such a motion.
with this statutory scheme in mind,we move on to our discussion.
before addressing the farias challenge to the district court ruling,we must first determine whether,as harleysville has contended here and below,it has been waived.in arguing waiver,harleysville points out that in uribe,a case involving a allegation of juror bias arising out of a felon service on a jury,we noted that,although convicted felons may be statutorily barred from serving as jurors,the jssa does not present a constitutional bar to their service.at.instead,we found that the right to exclude felons must be affirmatively invoked the jssa establishes strict procedural requirements for challenging ineligible jurors.id.we also said that a party must assert his rights before the voir dire examination begins,or within seven days after a party discovered or could have discovered,by the exercise of diligence,the grounds therefor,whichever is earlier.id.quoting a see also e stating that procedures prescribed by statute comprise exclusive means for challenging jurors not selected in conformity with the provisions of the jssa.in uribe,we reasoned that because a divulged his prior conviction on his qualification form,and because the forms are available to counsel upon motion,prior to empanelment,the litigant seemingly waived the point.at see also f explaining that records used by the clerk in connection with jury selection may be released for the parties to use in preparing a motion under subsection a,b,or c.
harleysville says the same goes for the farias,who arguably committed the same procedural misstep as did the uribe litigant.although rieger disclosed his conviction on his juror qualification form,the farias did not try to get a copy of that form before empanelment began or between the completion of voir dire august and the trial start date august.and because they failed to follow the procedures prescribed in the jssa and jury plan,the farias,harleysville contends,waived any challenge to rieger inclusion on this jury.
the farias see things differently on the waiver front.relying on united states schneider,cir,they maintain that our court has clearly backed away from the strict rule we seemingly announced in uribe.in schneider,we observed that uribe stopped just short of a definitive finding that the rhode island federal juror selection plan permitted such unfettered litigant access to jury questionnaires.schneider,at citing uribe,at.we went on,n either the statute nor the rhode island plan are crystal clear about access to questionnaires,and we questioned whether such forms could be used solely to aid in the voir dire process.id.citing jewell arctic,cir.given the uncertainty of their access to the forms,the farias tell us that,absent some reason to believe the clerk had completely failed in his or her duty to properly screen prospective jurors,they had no reason to suspect a potential problem with rieger.see id.noting that the complaining party may have moved to gain access to a juror questionnaire,but before trial he had no basis for such a motion.
the district court found harleysville waiver argument persuasive,but given our pronouncements,opted not to decide the motion on that basis.for that same reason,we likewise do the same.because,even assuming the farias could have accessed rieger qualification form at some point prior or subsequent to his selection on their jury panel their claims nonetheless fail on the merits.we therefore turn our attention to the remainder of the arguments.
the parties analytical frameworks 
the parties take very different views of the analytical lenses through which the remaining issues should be assessed,and we set forth their arguments in some detail.in advancing their claims,the farias implore us to be guided by what they contend is the supreme court analysis in mcdonough.there,after a district court denied a motion for a new trial in a product liability case,the tenth circuit reversed,reasoning that the failure of a juror to respond affirmatively to a voir dire question about a family member injury from an exploding tire,had prejudiced the defendants right of peremptory challenge,and a new trial was necessary.id.at.subsequently,the supreme court reversed the tenth circuit,holding that a party is not entitled to a new trial unless the juror failure to disclose denied the other side its right to an impartial jury.id.but in so ruling,the court announced a binary test that the filer of a motion based on juror dishonesty must satisfy a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,and the party must then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.id.at.
the farias maintain that once they satisfy this binary test and they claim they have done so they have met their mcdonough burden for obtaining a new trial.initially,they do acknowledge that mcdonough dealt with juror misinformation given during voir dire rather than during the juror qualification process,but they say it is a difference without a distinction since juror qualification forms serve the same purpose as collecting information from voir dire to dismiss unqualified jurors.part and parcel of screening,they say.as such,the farias assert they have met mcdonough first prong juror answered a material question dishonestly given that rieger lied on his qualification form about the circumstances of his conviction and about the restoration of his civil rights,and further lied through his silence at voir dire when asked if he had ever been a defendant in a case.as the farias see it,rieger is a man who made a concerted effort to conceal his criminal history because he was bound and determined for whatever reason to sit on this jury,and he deceitfully lied in an
