in,respondent worked for one of the petitioners,providing logistical services to the united states military in iraq.he subsequently filed a qui tam complaint carter i,alleging that petitioners,who are defense contractors and related entities,had fraudulently billed the government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.in,shortly before trial,the government informed the parties that an qui tam suit thorpe had similar claims,leading the district court to dismiss carter i without prejudice under the bar.while respondent appeal was pending,thorpe was dismissed for failure to prosecute.respondent quickly filed a new complaint carter ii,but the court dismissed it under the rule because carter i appeal was pending.respondent then dismissed that appeal,and in june,more than six years after the alleged fraud,filed the instant complaint carter iii.the district court dismissed this complaint with prejudice under the rule because of a pending maryland suit.further,because the wsla applies only to criminal charges,the court reasoned,all but one of respondent civil actions were untimely.reversing,the fourth circuit concluded that the wsla applied to civil claims and that the bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed.since any pending suits had by then been dismissed,the court held,respondent had the right to refile his case.it thus remanded carter iii with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
as shown by the wsla text,structure,and history,the act applies only to criminal offenses,not to civil claims like those in this case.
a the and versions of the wsla were enacted to address fraud during,respectively,the first and second world wars.both extended the statute of limitations for fraud offenses now indictable under any existing statutes.since only crimes are indictable,these provisions quite clearly were limited to criminal charges.in,congress made the wsla prospectively applicable to future wartime frauds rather than merely applicable to past frauds as earlier versions had been.in doing so,it deleted the phrase now indictable under any statute,so that the wsla now applied to any offense against the laws of the united states.congress made additional changes in and codified the wsla in title.
b section text supports limiting the wsla to criminal charges.the term offense is most commonly used to refer to crimes,especially given the wsla location in title,titled crimes and criminal procedure,where no provision appears to employ offense to denote a civil violation rather than a civil penalty attached to a criminal offense.and when title was enacted in,its very first provision classified all offenses as crimes.in similar circumstances,this court has regarded a provision placement as relevant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal.kansas hendricks.the wsla history provides further support for this reading.the term offenses in the and statutes,the parties agree,applied only to crimes.and it is improbable that the act removal of the phrase now indictable under any statute had the effect of sweeping in civil claims,a fundamental change in scope not typically accomplished with so subtle a move.the more plausible explanation is that congress removed that phrase in order to change the wsla from a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a permanent measure applicable to future fraud as well.if there were any ambiguity in the wsla use of the term offense,that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of a narrower definition.see bridges united states.
the fca bar keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive,not in perpetuity.thus,dismissal with prejudice was not called for in this case.this reading of b is in accordance with the ordinary dictionary meaning of the term pending.contrary to petitioners reading,the term pending can not be seen as a sort of for,which is neither a lengthy nor a complex term.petitioners reading would also bar even a suit dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with the merits,such as thorpe,which was dismissed for failure to prosecute.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
wars have often provided exceptional opportunities for fraud on the united states government.see united states smith.the false claims act was adopted in and signed into law by president abraham lincoln in order to combat rampant fraud in civil war defense contracts.predecessors of the wartime suspension of limitations act were enacted to address similar problems that arose during the first and second world wars.see smith,supra,at.
in this case,we must decide two questions regarding those laws first,whether the wartime suspension of limitations act applies only to criminal charges or also to civil claims second,whether the false claims act bar keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive or whether it may bar those claims in perpetuity.
the false claims act fca imposes liability on any person who knowingly presents a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,a a,to an officer or employee of the united states,b a i.the fca may be enforced not just through litigation brought by the government itself,but also through civil qui tam actions that are filed by private parties,called relators,in the name of the government.b.
in a qui tam suit under the fca,the relator files a complaint under seal and serves the united states with a copy of the complaint and a disclosure of all material evidence.b.after reviewing these materials,the united states may proceed with the action,in which case the action shall be conducted by the government,or it may notify the court that it declines to take over the action,in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.b.regardless of the option that the united states selects,it retains the right at any time to dismiss the action entirely,c a,or to settle the case,c b.
the fca imposes two restrictions on qui tam suits that are relevant here.one,the bar,precludes a qui tam suit based on the facts underlying a pending action.b emphasis added.the other,the fca statute of limitations provision,states that a qui tam action must be brought within six years of a violation or within three years of the date by which the united states should have known about a violation.in no circumstances,however,may a suit be brought more than years after the date of a violation.b.
the wartime suspension of limitations act wsla suspends the statute of limitations for any offense involving fraud against the federal government.before,this provision was activated only w hen the united states was at war.ibid.ed.in,however,this provision was made to apply as well whenever congress has enacted a specific authorization for the use of the armed forces,as described in section b of the war powers resolution b.ibid.ed.
petitioners are defense contractors and related entities that provided logistical services to the united states military during the armed conflict in iraq.from january to april,respondent worked in iraq for one of the petitioners as a water purification operator.he subsequently filed a qui tam complaint against petitioners carter i,alleging that they had fraudulently billed the government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.the government declined to intervene.
in,shortly before trial,the government informed the parties about an earlier filed qui tam lawsuit,united states ex rel.thorpe halliburton,cd,filed,that arguably contained similar claims.this initiated a remarkable sequence of dismissals and filings.
the district court held that respondent suit was related to thorpe and thus dismissed his case without prejudice under the bar.respondent appealed,and while his appeal was pending,thorpe was dismissed for failure to prosecute.respondent quickly filed a new complaint carter ii,but the district court dismissed this second complaint under the rule because respondent own earlier case was still pending on appeal.respondent then voluntarily dismissed this appeal,and in june,more than six years after the alleged fraud,he filed yet another complaint carter iii,and it is this complaint that is now at issue.
petitioners sought dismissal of this third complaint under the rule,pointing to two allegedly related cases,one in maryland and one in texas,that had been filed in the interim between the filing of carter i and carter iii.this time,the court dismissed respondent complaint with prejudice.the court held that the latest complaint was barred under the rule because the maryland suit was already pending when that complaint was filed.the court also ruled that the wsla applies only to criminal charges and thus did not suspend the time for filing respondent civil claims.as a result,the court concluded,all but one of those claims were untimely because they were filed more than six years after the alleged wrongdoing.
the fourth circuit reversed,rejecting the district court analysis of both the wsla and issues.united states ex rel.carter halliburton.concluding that the wsla applies to civil claims based on fraud committed during the conflict in iraq the court of appeals held that respondent claims had been filed on time.the court of appeals also held that the bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed.since the maryland and texas cases had been dismissed by the time of the fourth circuit decision,the court held that respondent had the right to refile his case.the court of appeals thus remanded carter iii with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
after this was done,respondent filed carter iv,but the district court dismissed carter iv on the ground that the petition for a writ of certiorari in carter iii the case now before us was still pending.
we granted that petition,and we now reverse in part and affirm in part.
the text,structure,and history of the wsla show that the act applies only to criminal offenses.
the wsla roots extend back to the time after the end of world war concerned about frauds,congress in enacted a statute that extended the statute of limitations for such offenses.the new law provided as follows i n offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the united states or any agency thereof and now indictable under any existing statutes,the period of limitations shall be six years.act of,ch,stat.emphasis added.since only crimes are indictable,this provision quite clearly was limited to the filing of criminal charges.
in,after the united states entered world war ii,congress enacted a similar suspension statute.this law,like its predecessor,applied to fraud offenses now indictable under any existing statutes,but this time the law suspended any existing statute of limitations until the fixed date of june.act of,ch,stat.
as that date approached,congress decided to adopt a suspension statute which would remain in force for the duration of the war.congress amended the wsla in three important ways.first,congress deleted the phrase now indictable under any statute,so that the wsla was made to apply simply to any offense against the laws of the united states.stat.second,although previous versions of the wsla were of definite duration,congress now suspended the limitations period for the timeframe of three years after the termination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed by the president or by a concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress.ibid.third,congress expanded the statute coverage beyond offenses involving defrauding or attempts to defraud the united states to include other offenses pertaining to government contracts and the handling and disposal of government property,and,stat.
congress made more changes in.from then until,the wsla relevant language was as follows 
when the united states is at war the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense involving fraud or attempted fraud against the united states or any agency thereof in any manner,whether by conspiracy or not shall be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed by the president or by a concurrent resolution of congress.act of june,stat.
in addition,congress codified the wsla in title of the united states code,titled crimes and criminal procedure.
finally,in,congress once again amended the wsla,this time in two relevant ways.first,as noted,congress changed the act triggering event,providing that tolling is available not only w hen the united states is at war,but also when congress has enacted a specific authorization for the use of military force.second,congress extended the suspension period from three to five years,stat.
with this background in mind,we turn to the question whether the wsla applies to civil claims as well as criminal charges.we hold that the act applies only to the latter.
we begin with the wsla text.the wsla suspends the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense involving fraud or attempted fraud against the united states or any agency thereof.emphasis added.the term offense is most commonly used to refer to crimes.at the time of both the and amendments to the act,the primary definition of offense in black law dictionary referred to crime.black law dictionary ed.black a violation of the law a crime,often a minor one.see crime at ed.a crime or misdemeanor a breach of the criminal laws at ed.same.the edition of webster similarly states that offense has no technical legal meaning but it is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime and sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable only by fine or penalty.webster new international dictionary ed.see also webster third new international dictionary webster third an infraction of law crime,misdemeanor american heritage dictionary ed.a transgression of law a crime 
it is true that the term offense is sometimes used more broadly.for instance,the edition of ballentine law dictionary cautions the words crime and offense are not necessarily synonymous.all crimes are offenses,but some offenses are not crimes.ballentine law dictionary.
but while the term offense is sometimes used in this way,that is not how the word is used in title.although the term appears hundreds of times in title,neither respondent nor the solicitor general,appearing as an amicus in support of respondent,has been able to find a single provision of that title in which offense is employed to denote a civil violation.the solicitor general cites eight provisions but not one actually labels a civil wrong as an offense.instead,they all simply attach civil penalties to criminal offenses as the deputy solicitor general acknowledged at oral argument.see tr.of oral arg.
not only is this pattern of usage telling,but when title was enacted in,the very first provision,what was then,classified all offenses as crimes.that provision read in pertinent part as follows 
offenses classified.
notwithstanding any act of congress to the contrary 
any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year is a felony.
any other offense is a misdemeanor.stat.repealed.
