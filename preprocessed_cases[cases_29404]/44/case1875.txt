these consolidated appeals arise out of the violent collapse of the texas university bonfire stack on november,which killed students and injured others.in these appeals,plaintiffs seek to overturn the district court grant of summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure dismissing their claims against university officials for damages resulting from that tragic event.in previous appeals,a panel of this court,in scanlan texas university,cir,reversed the district court dismissal of those claims under rule b.upon remand after that decision,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,holding that the university officials were entitled to qualified immunity from suit.see breen southerland,slip op.may.this second group of appeals followed.
procedural background 
in the wake of the texas bonfire collapse,the plaintiffs,including the estates of deceased victims,injured survivors,and relatives of affected students,filed suits against texas university and certain university officials in the united states district court for the southern district of texas plaintiffs asserted,inter alia,that the university and its officials were liable to plaintiffs under for violating the students substantive due process rights to bodily integrity.plaintiffs section claims were predicated on a danger,that the university and its officials created a dangerous environment for students and were deliberately indifferent to their safety by encouraging the unqualified and inexperienced students to build the enormous bonfire stack without adequate supervision by university personnel.plaintiffs also asserted several state law causes of action against the various defendants.
defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs actions for failure to state a claim,and,in the alternative,for summary judgment.for reasons assigned in an opinion dated july,the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed plaintiffs complaints in their entirety.see kimmel texas,d.first,the district court held that plaintiffs claims against texas university were suits against the state and were therefore barred by sovereign immunity.id.at.no appeal was taken from that holding.second,as to plaintiffs section claims against the university officials,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to state a cognizable substantive due process claim because plaintiffs allegations were insufficient to establish that the officials acted with deliberate indifference.id.at.in analyzing the sufficiency of plaintiffs section claims,the district court considered not only the allegations of plaintiffs complaints,but also the findings of the final report of the special commission on the texas bonfire although that document was not incorporated by or otherwise made part of plaintiffs complaints.kimmel,d at.finally,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.id.at.
upon plaintiffs first appeal in this case,a panel of this court reversed the district court rule b dismissal of plaintiffs section claims against the university officials.scanlan,at.the court first held that the district court erred by considering,for purposes of the defendants rule b motions to dismiss,the facts stated in the final report the scanlan court then considered whether the plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to state a claim under.the court noted that,although this circuit had never adopted the danger theory,it had previously recognized that a plaintiff seeking to recover under such a theory must show that the defendants used their authority to create a dangerous environment for the plaintiff and the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the plight of the plaintiff.id.at.the court found that,construing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the complaints stated a cause of action under the danger theory because they averred that the bonfire construction environment was dangerous the university officials knew that it was dangerous and would create an opportunity for the resulting harm to occur and the officials were deliberately indifferent to the students safety because they delegated the construction of the bonfire stack to students,whom they knew were not qualified to handle such a dangerous project,failed to provide adequate supervision,and ignored the danger that the stack posed to the students working on it.id.at.accordingly,the scanlan court reversed the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiffs section claims and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.
on remand,the university officials renewed their motions for summary judgment.the district court granted the motions on the ground that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from suit.see breen,slip op.at.the district court found that,although the summary judgment record contained material factual disputes concerning both whether defendants conduct created or increased the danger to the students involved in construction of the bonfire stack and whether defendants acted with deliberate indifference,the defendants were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was not objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established fifth circuit law at the time of their actions,slip op.at.
ii.standard of review 
summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as those applicable in the district court.baton rouge oil chem.workers union exxonmobil,cir.ordinarily,on summary judgment,the moving party has the initial burden of establishing that there are no issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law.see rivera houston indep.sch,cir.if the moving party meets this burden,the burden then shifts to the party to point to evidence showing that an issue of material fact exists.id.at.when a defendant invokes qualified immunity,however,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut the applicability of the defense.see mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc citing bazan ex rel.bazan hidalgo county,cir.in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate,we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see coleman sch.bd.of richland parish,cir.
iii.section and qualified immunity 
section provides a private right of action for damages to individuals who are deprived of any rights,privileges,or immunities protected by the constitution or federal law by any person acting under the color of state law.notwithstanding section broad language,state officials performing discretionary functions are often protected from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity,which shields such officials from suit insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.mcclendon,at quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.
to determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity from a suit alleging a constitutional violation,we conduct a familiar inquiry.first,we must ask whether the plaintiff has alleged facts to establish that the official violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.hope pelzer,d the threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a qualified immunity analysis is whether plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation.saucier katz,d a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.whether the facts establish a violation of a constitutional right is determined with reference to current law.see atteberry nocona,cir mcclendon,at.if the facts do not establish that the defendant violated the plaintiff constitutional rights,we need not inquire further.see saucier,at.if they do,the defendant is still entitled to qualified immunity unless the court finds that the defendant conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the state actions at issue.see mcclendon,at.
violation of a constitutional right 
plaintiffs here assert that defendants violated the students rights to bodily integrity under the substantive component of the fourteenth amendment due process clause by creating or exacerbating the dangerous situation that ultimately injured the students.specifically,plaintiffs assert that defendants knew that building the bonfire stack,a recognized and sanctioned university activity,was a dangerous activity and that the student leaders were not qualified to design and supervise its construction.plaintiffs allege that,notwithstanding that knowledge,defendants deliberately delegated the design and construction process to the students and deliberately decided not to provide the students with or require that they have adequate supervision.plaintiffs argue that defendants actions give rise to a cognizable substantive due process claim under the danger theory.
substantive due process and danger 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.the supreme court has long recognized that the due process clause is more than a guarantee of procedural fairness and cover s a substantive sphere as well,barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.county of sacramento lewis,d quoting daniels williams,d.the reach of substantive due process is limited,however,and it protects against only the most serious of governmental wrongs.the court has emphasized that because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and,courts should be reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process.collins city of harker heights,d.
when a plaintiff complains of abusive executive action,substantive due process is violated only when the conduct can properly be characterized as arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.lewis,at.quoting collins,at.though the meaning of the term conscience shocking is necessarily indeterminate,the lewis court provided some guidance for lower courts to follow.negligent acts,for example,are insufficient to trigger a substantive due process violation.id.at.l iability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.conversely,conduct intended to cause injury is,of course,most likely to violate due process.id.for conduct within the middle range of something more than negligence but less than intentional conduct,such as recklessness or gross negligence,the inquiry is more difficult and requires a searching inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the particular case in light of the right asserted.id.at.quoting daniels,at.see also id.at.deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another.
while it is clear that individuals have a substantive due process right to be free from bodily harm,it is equally clear that the constitution does not,as a general matter,impose upon state officials a duty of care to protect individuals from any and all private harms.deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d as a general matter,then,we conclude that a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.the deshaney court recognized two possible exceptions to this general rule,however.first,the court stated that the constitution imposes upon the state a duty of care towards individuals who are in the custody of the state.id.at.w hen the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and.second,some language from deshaney has been read to suggest that state officials also have a duty to protect individuals from harm when their actions created or exacerbated a danger to the individual.see id.at.noting that,although the state may have been aware of the dangers faced by the plaintiff,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him more vulnerable to them.
this latter exception mentioned in deshaney is often recognized as the primary for what has been termed the danger theory.a number of courts,including the majority of the federal circuits,have adopted the danger theory of section liability in one form or another prior to the scanlan decision in the present group of cases,this court had often expressed reluctance to embrace the danger theory,while noting its adoption by other courts.although this court discussed the theory in no fewer than published decisions prior to scanlan it had not formally approved of the theory or applied it to uphold a plaintiff complaint against pretrial motions or affirm an award of damages.see,morin,at noting that fifth circuit had neither adopted nor rejected the state created danger theory mckinney,at same.this court had,however,recognized and described the essential elements of such a claim for the purpose of demonstrating that the plaintiffs complaints in particular cases failed to state claims under the theory.in doing so,this court explained that to recover on a danger claim,the plaintiff must show that the harm to the plaintiff resulted because the defendant actions created or increased the danger to the plaintiff and the defendant acted with deliberate indifference toward the plaintiff.see,morin,at mckinney,at.this court had also stated that the danger theory requires an identifiable victim.see morin,at saenz,at.
scanlan recognition of the danger theory 
in most of the cases in which panels of this court had discussed the danger theory,the panel,in effect,pretermitted whether to embrace or reject the theory,but held simply that the facts of the particular case were insufficient to state a claim under such a theory because the plaintiff did not adequately allege that the defendants created the danger that the defendants acted with the requisite culpability that the plaintiff was an identifiable victim or some combination thereof.in scanlan,however,the panel reversed the district court dismissal of plaintiffs section claims in the present group of cases on the ground that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged all of the elements of a danger claim.see scanlan,at.
given that disposition,the question naturally arises whether scanlan constitutes recognition,approval,and adoption for use by this court of the danger theory.although the scanlan opinion did not expressly announce that it was adopting the danger theory,it explicitly recited the previously recognized essential elements of a danger claim,applied them to the pleadings,and decided that the plaintiffs had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted under the theory.see id.unlike the earlier cases discussed above,in which this court declined to pass upon the validity of the danger theory because the plaintiff allegations did not establish the necessary elements of such a claim,the scanlan court explicitly found that plaintiffs had alleged facts sufficient to show both that the defendants created or increased the danger to the students and that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference.see id.at t he district court should have determined that the plaintiffs had pleaded sufficient factual allegations to show the bonfire construction environment was dangerous,the university officials knew it was dangerous,and the university officials used their authority to create an opportunity for the resulting harm to occur.
thus,the scanlan panel,unlike earlier panels of this court,was squarely faced with complaints that sufficiently alleged the elements of a danger claim,and,therefore,stated claims under that theory.consequently,the scanlan court,by holding that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs section claims,necessarily recognized that the danger theory is a valid legal theory.were that not the case,the scanlan court would have been required to affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs complaints,notwithstanding the fact that they sufficiently alleged the elements of a danger claim.under rule b,federal courts are required to dismiss claims based upon invalid legal theories even though they might otherwise be 
since the scanlan decision,the panels in three subsequent,unrelated cases have issued opinions that contained statements suggesting that scanlan did not adopt the danger theory.see rios city of del rio,cir suggesting that scanlan did not adopt danger theory because nowhere in the opinion does the court expressly purport to approve that theory beltran city of el paso,cir citing scanlan for the proposition that t his court has consistently refused to recognize a danger theory of liability even where the question of the theory viability has been squarely presented rivera houston indep.sch,cir noting of scanlan that d espite remanding that case to the district court for further proceedings,we did not recognize the state created danger theory.in each of those cases,however,as in so many of this court other danger cases,the court found that,assuming,arguendo,the validity of the danger theory,the plaintiff allegations did not establish the elements of such a claim.see rios,at beltran,at rivera,at.thus,nothing in those cases turned on whether the danger theory is or is not valid in this circuit.accordingly,the statements in those cases pertaining to scanlan were unnecessary to their holdings and,as such,constituted only dicta 
the scanlan panel clearly implied recognition of danger as a valid legal theory applicable to the case is the law of the case with respect to these further appeals in these same cases now before this panel.under the law of the case doctrine,the factual findings and legal conclusions of a panel of this court continue to govern throughout that case we will not ordinarily revisit those findings or conclusions on subsequent appeals.see free abbott,cir.the doctrine applies not only to issues decided explicitly,but also to everything decided by necessary implication.office of thrift supervision felt in re felt,cir citing browning navarro,cir.although the law of the case does not absolutely bind later panels,we will generally apply it unless the evidence is materially different on the later appeal there has been a change in controlling law on the applicable issues or the initial decision was clearly erroneous and adhering to it would result in manifest injustice.free,at.
because the necessary implication of the scanlan court decision is that the danger theory is,indeed,a valid basis for a claim on the set of facts alleged in the complaints in these cases,that clear implied holding is the law of the case in the present group of appeals.moreover,as none of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine even arguably applies here,this panel can not justifiably revisit that conclusion.
did the university officials conduct violate the students substantive due process rights in this case 
because scanlan established that plaintiffs have a substantive due process right to be free from bodily injuries caused by dangers on the facts alleged in plaintiffs complaints,we next must determine whether,viewing the summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,there is an issue of material fact as to whether the defendants conduct violated that right.see porter ascension parish sch,cir when reviewing a grant of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we must first determine whether a plaintiff successfully alleged facts showing the violation of a constitutional right by state officials,and whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that the violation occurred.the district court held that issues of fact precluding summary judgment existed on both prongs of plaintiffs danger claims.as to the first defendants created or increased the danger to the district court found as follows 
plaintiffs ultimately allege that the university officials increased the danger to the victims by affirmatively delegating technical and complex bonfire responsibilities to unqualified students without adequate supervision or guidelines.defendants maintain that they passively continued the status quo and merely permitted students to do what they wanted.the resolution of these polar viewpoints requires examination of literally hundreds of facts.it would be inappropriate and virtually impossible for the court to decide as a matter of law and based on the record now before the court whether the state actors increased the danger to the bonfire victims.
breen,slip op.at.with respect to deliberate indifference,the district court took its guidance from scanlan 
in its opinion in this case,the fifth circuit stated whether deliberately delegating the construction of the bonfire stack to students the university officials allegedly knew were not qualified to handle such a dangerous project,and whether deliberately providing no supervision to students building the bonfire even though they knew the students were not qualified to build the stack,constituted deliberate indifference presents fundamental questions of material fact.scanlan,at.though this statement was made in an opinion disposing of defendants motion to dismiss,the summary judgment evidence submitted since then has only muddied the waters further.at this stage in the proceedings,there remain multiple questions of fact as to whether defendants acted with deliberate indifference.
slip op.at.
we agree with the district court that scanlan essentially disposes of this first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry.scanlan quite clearly held that plaintiffs allegations,if proven,would state a section claim under the danger theory.scanlan,at.the scanlan court also,however,went on to state that the conflicting summary judgment evidence submitted by the parties in the district court presented material fact issues concerning plaintiffs danger claims.see id.had the district court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment,the court would have been faced with the questions of fact the evidence presents.id.noting existence of fundamental questions of material fact id.if all of the summary judgment evidence presents genuine issues of material fact,those roles should be decided by a trier of fact,not the defendants themselves.the scanlan court statements about the summary judgment evidence are technically dicta and thus not the law of the case,but its view of the summary judgment evidence in the record at the time of its decision is nevertheless instructive.although the parties supplemented the summary judgment record with some additional evidence on remand,as the district court noted,the material factual disputes identified in scanlan remain concerning both whether defendants actions increased the danger to the students and whether defendants acted with deliberate indifference.we therefore conclude that plaintiffs successfully alleged facts showing the violation of a constitutional right by state officials under the danger theory,and that there is a genuine issue of material fact that the violation occurred.
clearly established law 
defendants in section cases are nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity from a plaintiff claims unless their conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of their actions.mcclendon,at.the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment because it found that the danger theory was not clearly established law in the fifth circuit as of november,the date on which the bonfire stack collapsed.
whether a right is clearly established depends,to a large extent,on the level of generality at which the right in question is defined.mcclendon,at.in the qualified immunity context,a constitutional right is clearly established only if,at the time of an official challenged conduct,the contours of the right in question are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.hope,at.quoting anderson creighton,d.the ess
