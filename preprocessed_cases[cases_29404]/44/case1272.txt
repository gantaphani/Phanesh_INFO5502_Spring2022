plaintiff derryen cudjoe filed a complaint,by and through his natural guardians and next friends barbarette and derry cudjoe,alleging the department of veterans affairs and landlord roger robert violated federal law by failing to disclose information concerning lead contamination when his family leased an apartment in at east street,chester,pennsylvania cudjoe asserts federal causes of action under the residential paint hazard reduction act and the toxic substances control act count i,as well as common law claims of negligence count ii,against the department of veterans affairs and robert.the complaint also includes common law claims of negligent misrepresentation and omission count iii,and intentional misrepresentation and omission count iv,against robert alone.
after residing in the apartment for several months,cudjoe,then two years old,tested positive for high concentrations of lead in his blood.the family vacated the apartment.the bureau of health of the city of chester examined the property in november,and found dangerous levels of lead paint and dust throughout the premises.nevertheless,the complaint was not filed until september.
robert answered the complaint,that cudjoe injuries were caused by his parents,and brought against the department of veterans affairs for liability,indemnification contribution.without filing an answer,the department of veterans affairs moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that neither the residential paint hazard reduction act nor the toxic substances control act,alone or in conjunction,waived the government sovereign immunity against private suits for money damages.the department of veterans affairs argued cudjoe should have proceeded instead under the federal tort claims act,et.cudjoe,however,failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the federal tort claims act,and his claim is now barred by its statute of limitations,b.cudjoe argued in response that he was not required to proceed under the federal tort claims act because the residential paint hazard reduction act and the toxic substances control act,in conjunction with one another,waive sovereign immunity and provide an independent cause of action.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,cudjoe ex rel.cudjoe dep t of veterans affairs,wl,and cudjoe filed this timely appeal.
we have jurisdiction under over the appeal from the order granting the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in this facial attack under federal rule of civil procedure b challenging the court subject matter jurisdiction,we treat the allegations in the complaint as true,making the disposition of the motion a purely legal determination.haydo amerikohl mining,cir.our review is plenary.id.
cudjoe contention that the united states has waived sovereign immunity to private suits claiming money damages for failure to disclose contamination draws on separate provisions in the toxic substances control act and the residential paint hazard reduction act specifically,he claims the waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to lead paint in exposes the united states not only to the toxic substances control act penalties,but also to the private cause of action for treble damages under the residential paint hazard reduction act,b.cudjoe argues these provisions provide him with a right to sue the department of veterans affairs directly,without using the procedures set forth in the federal tort claims act.
we reproduce and summarize the provisions at issue.the waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to lead paint in the toxic substances control act states in part that 
each department,agency,and instrumentality of executive,legislative,and judicial branches of the federal government having jurisdiction over any property or facility,or engaged in any activity resulting,or which may result,in a paint hazard,and each officer,agent,or employee thereof,shall be subject to,and comply with,all federal,state,interstate,and local requirements,both substantive and procedural including any requirement for certification,licensing,recordkeeping,or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief respecting paint,paint activities,and paint hazards in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity is subject to such requirements,including the payment of reasonable service charges.the federal,state,interstate,and local substantive and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection include,but are not limited to,all administrative orders and all civil and administrative penalties and fines regardless of whether such penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in nature,or whether imposed for isolated,intermittent or continuing violations.the united states hereby expressly waives any immunity otherwise applicable to the united states with respect to any such substantive or procedural requirement including,but not limited to,any injunctive relief,administrative order,or civil or administrative penalty or fine referred to in the preceding sentence,or reasonable service charge.the reasonable service charges referred to in this section include,but are not limited to,fees or charges assessed for certification and licensing,as well as any other nondiscriminatory charges that are assessed in connection with a federal,state,interstate,or local paint,paint activities,or paint hazard activities program.
the provision submits entities of the federal government to any federal,state or local substantive and procedural requirement regarding lead paint hazards,waiving the united states sovereign immunity to such requirements.
the residential paint hazard reduction act is a disclosure statute requiring a seller or lessor of residential target housing to provide the purchaser or lessee with a lead hazard information pamphlet as described in to disclose the known or possible presence of paint or other lead hazards to provide information about lead hazards and to allow the purchaser or lessee a risk assessment period a.a seller or lessor who knowingly violates these requirements is subject to the following penalties

b.subsections and provide the secretary of housing and urban development with the power to impose monetary penalties and seek injunctions in federal court for violations of a disclosure requirements.subsections and create a private right of action for treble damages and costs against any person who violates the disclosure requirements.subsection defines of hazards as a prohibited act under the toxic substances control act,making it subject to enforcement by the environmental protection agency.
the crux of cudjoe appeal is that b private suit for money damages constitutes a substantive and procedural requirement to which the united states has waived immunity under.in support of this view,cudjoe points out that,though codified in the toxic substances control act,grew out of the same resolution in the house of representatives,public law and section of the public law title x as the residential paint hazard reduction act.cudjoe contends that the statute as enacted indicates that congress intended to subject federal agencies to direct liability.cudjoe also relies on the environmental protection agency assertion in its rule enforcement policy handbook that it can enforce the residential paint hazard reduction act against federal agencies that fail to comply with the disclosure requirements of a while acting as seller or lessor.
a waiver of sovereign immunity must be express and unambiguous in order to confer federal courts with subject matter jurisdiction.united states bein,cir see also united states fid.guar.consent alone gives jurisdiction to adjudge against a sovereign.absent that consent,the attempted exercise of judicial power is void.a waiver must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and will not be implied.lane pena,d.with respect to its scope,any waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.orff united states,d.the terms of the waiver define the extent of the court jurisdiction.united states mottaz,d.
in interpreting the scope of a waiver of sovereign immunity,we begin with the plain language of the statute.see new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir.as noted,the plain text of section of the toxic substances control act expressly waives sovereign immunity with respect to any federal,state,interstate and local substantive and procedural requirements with respect to paint.the statute lists several examples of substantive and procedural requirements,including,any requirement for certification,licensing,recordkeeping,or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief.id.the statute further states that such requirements include,but are not limited to,any injunctive relief,administrative order,or civil or administrative penalty or fine or reasonable service charge.id.
at issue is whether the private right of action for treble money damages under the residential paint hazard reduction act is one of the substantive and procedural requirements to which the government has waived immunity in.because a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unambiguously expressed and may not be implied,pena,at,and must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign,orff.at,we will not interpret substantive and procedural requirements to include a private suit under b.
notably absent from the listed examples of substantive and procedural requirements is any explicit reference to a private right of action for money damages.the only language in that perhaps comes close is the submission to any civil penalty imposed.but a civil penalty is defined as a fine assessed for a violation of a statute or regulation.black law dictionary ed.the example given in the dictionary is the epa levied a civil penalty of on the manufacturer for exceeding pollution limits.id.similarly,the residential paint hazard reduction act itself distinguishes between monetary penalties as enforced by hud under f on the one hand,and civil liability on the other.compare b with b.because an express,unambiguous waiver is required to waive sovereign immunity,we will not construe civil penalty under broadly to include the private suit for money damages available under b.
cudjoe contends nonetheless that because the substantive and procedural requirements referred to in are not limited to the examples listed,the action for treble damages under constitutes such a requirement.cudjoe reads too much into these three words,which provide only that the united states may be subject to federal,state,interstate,and local substantive and procedural requirements beyond the examples given in the text of the statute.in our view,these words can not be interpreted to provide that a private suit for money damages is a substantive and procedural requirement.
cudjoe call for a broad reading of the waiver in runs counter to applicable law on waivers of sovereign immunity.the required standard for finding statutory waivers to actions for tort damages is that the waiver be unambiguous.language subject to varying interpretations will not be construed as a waiver.united states nordic village,d the foregoing are assuredly not the only readings of the statute,but they are plausible is enough to establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on the government is not unambiguous and therefore should not be adopted.finding no waiver of sovereign immunity in section of the bankruptcy code see also lane,at.to sustain a claim that the government is liable for awards of monetary damages,the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.congress is aware of this standard,and had it intended to waive immunity to suits for damages,it would have used more explicit language to do so.the united states shall be liable,respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances 
we believe the scope of is more narrow.construing the waiver in favor of the sovereign,its plain language subjects the united states to requirements and related penalties,such as fines imposed by the epa or state or local regulators.it does not expressly permit private suits for money damages against the government outside of the procedures of the federal tort claims act.
cudjoe bolsters his broad reading of with an argument based on the statute enactment.specifically,he argues the codification of the relevant statutory provisions under different sections of the united states code should not be dispositive on whether waives sovereign immunity to the private cause of action under b.that the two provisions were enacted in the same title title paint hazard reduction act of of the same public law,he contends,compels the conclusion that waiver applies to the civil remedy provided in b.our reading of the statute as originally enacted does not yield the same interpretation.
title x of.is divided into five subtitles,of which two are relevant here subtitle paint hazard reduction,which contains the disclosure requirement and penalty provisions a and b,and subtitle exposure reduction,which contains the limited waiver of sovereign immunity titled control of paint hazards at federal facilities.subtitle b,unlike subtitle a,is not a statute but an amendment to the toxic substances control act.
congress decision to include the waiver of sovereign immunity as an amendment to the toxic substances control statute which notably provides only for epa enforcement of fines and penalties and not for money emphasis.cudjoe would have a stronger argument if congress had decided to place the waiver in subtitle at least contains a provision allowing suits for money damages against private parties.instead,it chose to place the immunity provision in subtitle b,which does not the placement of the waiver within the statutory scheme and its plain language fall short of meeting the requirement that a waiver be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.lane,at.
cudjoe cites the environmental protection agency own interpretation of the statutes in support of his contention that the united
