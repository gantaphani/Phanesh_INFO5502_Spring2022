melba irvin,et the irvins,appeal the granting of summary judgment by the district court for,and the subsequent denial of the irvins rule e motion to alter,amend,and reconsider in a toxic tort action arising from a chemical release from defendants facility.
background and procedural history 
this case arises out of claims brought in state court relating to the release of a mustard gas agent at the georgia gulf corporation facility in plaquemine,louisiana,that occurred on or about september.on november,suit was filed in state district court,asserting claims against multiple defendants,including georgia gulf corporation,insurance company,primex,hydrochem industrial services,payne keller company,master maintenance construction,amoco energy trading corporation,louisiana intrastate gas company,and lig liquids company,collectively,the defendants.
on march,insurance company and primex,removed the case to federal court,asserting jurisdiction under the convention of the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards pursuant to et.insurance company and primex,are foreign insurance companies who were named as defendants in this action pursuant to the louisiana direct action statute.stat.the irvins filed a motion to remand on april,that was denied by the district court on june.
the irvins,who were added as additional plaintiffs to the original state court proceeding in march and september,maintain that they sustained injuries as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the defendants.since joining as plaintiffs,the irvins have been represented by four separate sets of attorneys.on january,the irvins second set of counsel,albert bensabat and daniel edwards,filed a motion to establish discovery cutoff and trial dates a status conference.on march,the magistrate held a status conference where she set discovery deadlines,ordering the irvins to provide the defendants with all medical reports by march,list all treating physicians and identify all experts by july,and submit all expert reports by august.on march,one day before the irvins were ordered to provide the defendants all medical reports,bensabat and edwards filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for the irvins.the following day the magistrate granted the motion to withdraw.thereafter,the irvins failed to identify any experts or produce any medical or expert reports in compliance with the court deadlines.
on august,george tucker enrolled as counsel for the irvins.the district court held a status conference on august,that was attended by tucker,appearing on behalf of the irvins.the district court judge entered an order the following day referring the matter to the magistrate for entry of scheduling orders and trial preparation anticipating a trial date in march or april.on august,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment dismissal,asserting that the irvins had failed to satisfy the elements of their claim.specifically,the defendants maintained that the irvins could not,through the requisite expert evidence,establish negligence on the part of the defendants,nor could they establish causation and damages.in the alternative,the defendants sought the dismissal of the irvins claims for their failure to adhere to the deadlines.the irvins did not file any opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment.
on october,the district court issued its ruling granting the defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court stated 
in this case,plaintiffs have alleged that they suffered harm by exposure to the mustard gas release but have failed to produce any evidence whatsoever of such injury.in a toxic tort case such as this medical evidence is essential to establish harm to plaintiffs.without having produced any medical evidence,plaintiffs can not establish that they suffered damages,an essential element of their case.
subsequently,on november,george tucker,the irvins counsel,filed a motion to withdraw from the case.the district court granted the withdrawal on november,and entered judgment dismissing the irvins case the following day.
on december,the irvins obtained new counsel,who immediately filed a.e motion to alter,amend,and reconsider the judgment.specifically,the irvins requested that the district court reconsider and vacate the november,judgment to prevent manifest injustice.on february,the district court denied the rule e motion,stating that the motion for summary judgment was filed while the irvins were represented by counsel,who neither requested a continuance nor sought a rescheduling of deadlines.the irvins filed a timely notice of appeal on march.

standard of review 
i.the irvins rule e motion to reconsider 
the applicable standard of review of the denial of the irvins motion to alter,amend,and reconsider is dependent on whether the district court considered the materials attached to the irvins motion,which were not previously provided to the court ford motor credit bright,cir.if the materials were considered by the district court,and the district court still grants summary judgment,the appropriate appellate standard of review is de novo.id.however,if the district court refuses to consider the materials,the reviewing court applies the abuse of discretion standard.id.under this standard of review,the district court decision and process need only be reasonable.id.
based on a review of the district court ruling on the motion for reconsideration,it is unclear whether the additional materials submitted by the irvins were considered by the district court.the district court does not expressly or impliedly refer to the additional materials in its ruling.therefore,in the absence of any specific reference to these materials,we review the district court denial of the irvins rule e motion for abuse of discretion,as if the district court did not consider the additional materials.

discussion 
whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the irvins motion to alter,amend,and reconsider its ruling granting the defendants motion for summary judgment.
the irvins suggest that the proper method for evaluating a motion for reconsideration of a summary judgment where the movant submits evidentiary materials in support of its motion that were not considered by the court in its summary judgment ruling involves the consideration of the factors enumerated in lavespere niagara machine tool works,cir,overruled on other grounds,little liquid air,cir.the lavespere factors include the reasons for the moving party default the importance of the omitted evidence to the moving party case whether the evidence was available to the before it responded to the summary judgment motion and the likelihood that the party will suffer unfair prejudice if the case is reopened.id.at.
taking these factors in turn,the irvins argue that their failure to provide the court with the requisite medical reports,lists of treating physicians and all other experts,as well as the irvins medical expert reports was a direct result of the lapse in legal representation that occurred between march,and august.the irvins contend that the withdrawal by bensabat and edwards on march,constituted client abandonment.in response,defendants simply argue that any delays in submitting additional materials to the court begin and end with the irvins.
second,the irvins claim that the additional materials included in their motion for reconsideration are critical to their case.specifically,they argue that the materials include medical evidence linking their ongoing physical and psychological sufferings to the exposure to mustard gas at the georgia gulf plant.this evidence,the irvins contend,would have established their entitlement to damages and defeated the defendants motion for summary judgment.the defendants respond by arguing that the omitted material is not important to the irvins case because it does not change the fact that the irvins failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment and,in the alternative,inclusion of the materials still does not establish the damages element of their claim.
third,the irvins argue that although the information they included in their motion for reconsideration was available to them when the defendants motion for summary judgment was filed,the irvins were precluded from producing such evidence because the court march,scheduling order had established an august,deadline for providing expert information.therefore,the irvins contend,because the deadline had already passed,they were unable to produce the relevant expert information without violating the court scheduling order.the defendants simply state that the additional evidence is not new because it was available to the irvins at the time the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment.
finally,the irvins maintain that the defendants will not be prejudiced if the case is reopened.the irvins argue that the defendants were provided medical reports in the irvins responses to the defendants discovery requests.in addition,the irvins suggest that because there are at least similar cases that have been filed in relation to the same chemical release at issue here,the defendants are imparted with knowledge of evidence on damages,causation,and liability,and therefore can not claim prejudice if the case is reopened.defendants respond by arguing that reopening the case would unfairly prejudice them as they have already expended substantial judicial resources in defending the matter pursuant to the court march,scheduling order.
a rule e motion calls into question the correctness of a judgment.in re transtexas gas,cir.this court has held that such a motion is not the proper vehicle for rehashing evidence,legal theories,or arguments that could have been offered or raised before the entry of judgment.simon united states,cir.rather,rule e serve s the narrow purpose of allowing a party to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.waltman int l paper,cir internal quotations omitted.reconsideration of a judgment after its entry is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.clancy employers health ins,d,citing charles wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.
in lavespere,this court recognized that while a district court has considerable discretion in deciding whether to reopen a case in response to a motion for reconsideration,such discretion is not limitless.at.this court has identified two important judicial imperatives relating to such a motion the need to bring litigation to an end and the need to render just decisions on the basis of all the facts.id.citations omitted.the task for the district court is to strike the proper balance between these competing interests.id.
in this case,the district court stated that a motion for new trial in a nonjury case or a petition for rehearing pursuant to a rule e motion should be based upon manifest error of law or mistake of fact,and a judgment should not be set aside except for substantial reasons.the district found that the defendants motion for summary judgment was filed while the irvins were represented by counsel,who did not request a continuance of the motion or a rescheduling of the deadlines.the district court also noted that it ruled on the unopposed motion more than sixty days after it was filed,and then issued judgment nearly three weeks later.in denying the irvins motion for reconsideration,the district court stated 
the irvins had ample time prior to the ruling to express some form of opposition to the disposition of their claims or to request additional time to respond.the irvins have been parties to this matter for nearly six years they have had more than enough opportunities for a day in court.
we have held that an unexcused failure to present evidence available at the time of summary judgment provides a valid basis for denying a subsequent motion for reconsideration.russ int l paper,cir.in this case,the underlying facts were well within the irvins knowledge prior to the district court entry of judgment.however,the irvins failed to include these materials in any form of opposition or response to the defendants motion for summary judgment.although the irvins correctly point out that they were not represented by counsel for approximately five months between march and august,they were represented by counsel,george tucker,before the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment and after the district court subsequently granted the motion 
by denying the irvins motion for reconsideration,the district court decision is not manifestly unjust in law or fact,nor does it ignore newly discovered evidence.the district court reasonably determined that the facts in this case do not warrant the extraordinary relief associated with the granting of a motion for reconsideration.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the irvins rule e motion.
ii.whether the defendants motion for summary judgment was based upon factual misrepresentations.
the irvins maintain that the judgment dismissing their case was premised on representations of material facts that defendants knew to be false.specifically,the irvins point to two alleged misrepresentations made by defendants that the irvins had not identified any expert witnesses on issues of liability,causation,or damages to support their claims and that the irvins had not submitted any expert reports.the irvins refute these statements,arguing that even though the irvins had not complied with the deadlines established by the court scheduling order,the defendants were still in possession of a wealth of expert information and reports establishing causation and damages in the form of responses to interrogatories and requests for production.in addition,the irvins contend that their interrogatory responses identified experts they intended to use at trial.
conversely,the defendants argue that they have accurately reported all the facts and circumstances supporting their motion for summary judgment,including the irvins failure to identify any expert witnesses or provide expert reports on the issues of liability,causation,and damages.
summary judgment is appropriate where the underlying facts are undisputed,and the record reveals no evidence from which reasonable persons might draw conflicting inferences about the facts.prinzi keydril,cir.the district court based its ruling on the finding that the irvins had not produced any medical evidence,and therefore could not establish that they suffered damages,an essential element of their case.the district court cites celotex,at,for the rule that a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.in addition.mandates that summary judgment shall be entered against a who fails to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
the irvins did not deny or controvert the defendants statement of undisputed facts,including the representations made by the defendants that the irvins had not identified any expert witnesses on issues of liability,causation,or damages or submitted any expert reports to support their claim.for that reason,those facts as stated were deemed admitted.uniform local rule.however,in the event the moving party relates facts in its summary judgment motion that are untrue or inaccurate,and the court subsequently relies on those misstatements in making its decision,it would be improper to allow the moving party to benefit in such a situation.
after reviewing the record,it seems clear that the irvins indeed failed to provide either of the two items as detailed by the defendants.in its ruling granting the defendants summary judgment,the district court appears to have inadvertently broadened what the defendants related in their summary judgment motion.specifically,the court states that the irvins failed to produce any medical evidence.emphasis added.the irvins did in fact respond to written interrogatories as well as provide opposing counsel copies of treating physician reports however,while these discovery responses may have constituted medical evidence,the defendants did not state that the irvins failed to provide evidence,but rather that the irvins had not produced expert witness lists or expert reports the real problem facing the irvins is their basic failure to include this evidence in any form of opposition to the defendants summary judgment motion.as such,the district court granting of the defendants motion was properly based on true and correct statements of fact.
iii.whether the district court ever reached the issue of the defendants motion for involuntary dismissal,and if so,whether the granting of the motion was an abuse of discretion.
the irvins insist that the district court based its ruling on the irvins failure to comply with the court scheduling order.they argue that although the district court characterized its dismissal of the irvins case as a grant of summary judgment,the court rationale for its decision is more properly viewed as an involuntary sanction dismissal under.f,b,and b for a party failure to appear at a pretrial conference,obey discovery orders,or prosecute an action.in response,the defendants argue that the district court never ruled on their motion to dismiss,but if the court had,involuntary dismissal would be appropriate.
based on a review of the district court ruling,it appears clear from the reasons the district court articulates that its decision was premised solely on the failure of the irvins to respond to or oppose the defendants motion for summary judgment.the summary judgment ruling states that because the irvins could not establish that they suffered damages,an essential element of their case,defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.in addition,the district court specifically states that it found it unnecessary to consider the alternative motion to dismiss.therefore,the irvins third and final issue on appeal is without merit.
conclusion 
having carefully reviewed the record of this case,the parties respective briefing and arguments,and for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the district court granting of the defendants motion for summary judgment and its subsequent denial of the irvins rule e motion to alter,amend,or reconsider.
rule gives the trial judge ample power to prevent what he considers to be a miscarriage of justice.when a party moves to alter or amend a judgment under rule e,a district court is obligated to balance carefully the need for finality with the need to render a just decision on the basis of all the facts that obligation is increased when the judgment,absent amendment,creates or results in a manifest injustice.in this case,the need to render a just decision outweighed the need for finality,but the court did not render a just decision.
instead,the district court provided no indication that it even considered the additional evidence that plaintiffs submitted with their rule motion the district court,however,for the reasons discussed below,was obligated to consider the additional evidence.accordingly,we should remand this case to the district court with orders to consider plaintiffs additional evidence and reconsider the summary judgment in light of that evidence.because the majority opinion does not require such a reconsideration,i respectfully dissent.
the irvins submitted a rule e motion to the district court that contained evidence that had not been presented to the district court previously.specifically,it contained reports from irvin treating physicians that had been submitted in response to defendants interrogatories and requests for productions of documents as well as an affidavit from irvin.
the majority reviews the district court decision as if the district court did not consider the additional materials,implicitly holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to consider the materials considering the unique and extraordinary history of this case,however,i believe that the district court failure to consider this information was a misuse of judicial discretion.
as this court has explained in lavespere niagara machine tool works,when a party seeks to upset a summary judgment on the basis of evidence that the party failed to introduce on time,the district court is obligated to weigh,inter alia,several factors in deciding whether to admit the evidence the reasons for the moving party default,the importance of the omitted evidence to the moving party case,whether the evidence was available to the movant before the filed the summary judgment motion,and the likelihood that the nonmoving party will suffer unfair prejudice if the case is reopened 
these factors,it should be noted,are simply illustrative and not exhaustive in particular,the lavespere court utilized this framework,not to limit the scope of rule e,but to explain that rule e motions provide the district court with considerable discretion and that they are not controlled by the same exacting substantive requirements as rule b motions.because rule e motions are subject to much more stringent time requirements than rule b motions,rule e motions provide relief for the movant on grounds at least as broad as rule motions rule e,therefore,provides district courts with the power to consider equitable factors and provide relief for any reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
the equitable considerations under rule e weigh in plaintiffs favor when one considers the unique facts of this case.specifically,the irvin default resulted,not through any fault of their own but because of egregious lawyer misconduct causing them virtually total deprivation of representation and the benefits of the adversary system of justice the omitted evidence was essential to the irvin case the evidence was made available to before they filed their motion for summary judgment and defendants in this case would not have been prejudiced by an introduction of the evidence because plaintiffs had already provided them with the evidence.
first,the plaintiffs did not present the evidence to the district court initially,through no fault of their own,but because they were subjected to attorney conduct and inaction so egregious that it amounted to nothing short of leaving them unrepresented.while it is true that a district court has the discretion to refuse to use rule to rescue a plaintiff from simple negligence,or a blunder by his attorney the facts of this case go far beyond a simple blunder by a plaintiff attorney.the conduct of the irvins attorneys in this case constitutes neglect so gross that it is inexcusable.
the district court imposed five discovery deadlines between march,and august,on which plaintiffs were obligated to act.they were required to produce current medical reports and releases by march.they were required to obtain all existing discovery f
