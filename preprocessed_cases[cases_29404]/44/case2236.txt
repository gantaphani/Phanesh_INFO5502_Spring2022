plaintiff james szekeres szekeres appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment to defendant csx transportation,csx in this action brought under the federal employers liability act fela,et,and the locomotive inspection act lia.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse.
the district court summarized the facts 
szekeres was hired as a brakeman for csx on june.in july,szekeres regularly worked on a local csx freight operation that runs from cleveland,ohio to valley city,ohio and back.the operation includes multiple stops along the route.szekeres was working this route on the date of his injury.
on january,szekeres reported to csx clark avenue office in cleveland.the outdoor conditions were cold with a misting rain,but not cold enough for snow and ice.engineer matthew ashby,conductor larry ashby,and trainmaster john whittenberger whittenberger joined szekeres as crew members for part of that day run.although a restroom was available at csx clark avenue office,szekeres does not remember using the restroom at that location.the train departed cleveland with two locomotives,each of which was equipped with a restroom,including a retention tank toilet.from cleveland to the first stop in parma,ohio,szekeres rode on the second locomotive while the rest of the crew rode on the lead locomotive.szekeres did not use the restroom located on the second locomotive.
once the train arrived in parma,the crew removed the second locomotive from the train,and whittenberger departed with the removed locomotive.a csx office building with a restroom was available to employees at the parma stop,but szekeres does not recall using the restroom at that location.the train left parma bound for valley city with szekeres riding on the lead locomotive,which was the only remaining locomotive.during the trip from parma to valley city,szekeres did not need to use the restroom and did not inspect the locomotive restroom.
once the train arrived in valley view,the crew had to turn the train around to return north to cleveland.this process required a member of the crew,here szekeres,to exit the locomotive and throw the switch to get the train back on the main line tracks.at some point between arriving in valley view and exiting the locomotive to switch the track,szekeres visually inspected the restroom on the locomotive.szekeres claims the restroom was unsanitary because of an unspecified chemical odor and a dirty toilet seat,both of which prevented him from using the restroom onboard the locomotive.szekeres claims that he alerted ashby and ashby as to the restroom condition,but there is no evidence that either party checked the restroom.
after visually inspecting the locomotive restroom,szekeres exited the locomotive and walked to the switch.the walkway behind the switch,where szekeres stood to operate the switch,was muddy,and szekeres accumulated mud on his boots.he threw the switch and turned to walk up an inclined embankment to privately relieve himself among trees at the top.like the walkway,the embankment was also muddy.szekeres slipped while ascending the embankment and twisted his knee,allegedly injuring it.he claims that he slipped as a result of the mud that had accumulated on his boot from the muddy walkway behind the switch.he returned to the locomotive where he relieved himself next to the tracks.szekeres boarded the train,returned to the clark avenue office,and reported the incident to a supervisor.he wrote a statement on the date of the incident and filed an official incident report six days later.

contributory negligence of an injured employee under fela does not preclude a judgment for the employee,but the damages are to be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee,but no such employee shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence in any case where the common carrier shall have violated any statute enacted for the safety of employees that contributed to the injury or death of such employee.similarly,assumption of risk is not a bar to recovery where the injury resulted in whole or in part from the carrier negligence or where the injury or death resulted from the violation of a safety statute by the carrier 
in several cases the supreme court decided that violations of the safety appliance acts,boiler inspection act now the lia,and other statutes intended to promote safety were actionable under fela,in some cases without any proof of negligence,and application of those acts operated to prevent the defense of contributory negligence in fela actions
