on august,around,smathers was driving his motorcycle on route in west mead township,crawford county,pennsylvania.at the same time,old jeffrey southworth was backing out of a driveway onto route.southworth admitted that he saw the lights of smathers motorcycle coming down the road,but thought that he had the necessary time to back out.southworth backed out of the driveway across one lane and into the lane down which smathers was traveling.once he had backed into the roadway,southworth saw smathers bike in his rearview mirror,but as he attempted to put the car into gear,it stalled.he then heard tires squealing and smathers smashed into the side bumper of the car.smathers explained that in response to coming upon the stalled car he hit both his front and rear brakes which caused his rear wheel to begin spinning to the left.afraid that he would lose control of the bike if he continued to brake,smathers attempted to drive around the car.he explained 
b ecause of the skid caused by the braking,i had to try to drive around the car to the right,which meant going off the road surface because the southworth vehicle was all the way to the edge of the road surface.as i attempted to drive around the southworth vehicle to the right,my left leg struck it sic bumper and i believe it caused me to fly off the motorcycle.at that point i lost consciousness 
after investigating the scene,the police provided a similar description of the accident,reporting that it appeared that smathers had attempted to steer to the right of the car,but was unsuccessful and struck the car.a foot skidmark was found leading to the site of the impact.smathers was seriously injured in the accident,necessitating the amputation of his leg.
both smathers and southworth were charged with violations arising from the accident.southworth was charged with illegal backing pursuant to pennsylvania vehicle code,which provides no driver shall back a vehicle unless the movement can be made with safety and without interfering with other traffic and then only after yielding the to moving traffic and pedestrians.southworth pled guilty and paid the accompanying fine.after smathers blood alcohol content bac was found to be he was charged with driving under the influence in violation of.a smathers was admitted into an accelerated rehabilitative disposition ard program overseen by the crawford county department.his completion of the program resulted in a dismissal of the charges against him 
refused to pay smathers medical expenses arising from the accident under a provision which excludes coverage for any charge for care,supplies,or services which are.caused or contributed to by the covered person commission or attempted commission of a felony,misdemeanor,or being engaged in an illegal occupation or activity.refused smathers claims because the accident occurred while he was driving while admittedly illegal activity.in february,while the claim was pending,amended its plan to incorporate a provision giving the administrator discretionary authority in making benefits determinations.smathers subsequently brought suit under the employees retirement income security act erisa,in an effort to collect benefits which he argued were due to him under the plan filed a motion to dismiss,which was treated by the court as a motion for summary judgment because relied on material outside the pleadings.smathers filed a provisional motion for summary judgment 
the district court determined that the administrator decision not to provide smathers benefits was governed by the discretionary authority provided under the plan,and,accordingly,considered only whether that decision was arbitrary and capricious.applying that deferential standard,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of finding that the determination by,as plan administrator,was not,as a matter of law,arbitrary and capricious,and that there were no issues of material fact remaining to be considered.
as smathers claim for recovery of plan benefits rests on the rights provided by erisa,the district court had jurisdiction under and e.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.we subject the district court grant of summary judgment to plenary review,and we apply the same standard that the lower court should have applied.farrell planters lifesavers,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
smathers raises two interrelated issues on appeal,one procedural and one substantive.he first urges that the district court improperly subjected the administrator decision to an arbitrary and capricious standard of review instead of the de novo standard applicable under the plan in effect when the claim arose and was filed.second,he claims that even if the correct standard was employed by the district court,it wrongly determined that the administrator consideration of the claim satisfied that standard.we will address these claims in order.
determining the standard of review 
arbitrary and capricious or de novo 
before we can evaluate the propriety of the administrator determination,we must decide whether the district court properly applied the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.the supreme court has instructed us to review the determinations of a plan administrator de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in that event,an arbitrary and capricious standard is to be applied.because plan was amended on february,to give discretion to the administrator we need to determine whether that provision,or the earlier version,should apply,as it impacts our standard of review the amendment was implemented after the injury occurred august,and after the initial claims were made prior to january,but before the administrator made its determination january.the district court explained its decision to rely on the later plan this plan document was in effect when considered and then denied the plaintiff claim for benefits.
smathers argues that he had a vested right to have his claim reviewed based on the earlier plan,and therefore,in accordance with our jurisprudence,that right could not be retroactively denied.we disagree.along with our sister circuits,we have spoken of the retroactive denial of rights only in a narrow factual setting where the occurrence of an accident or other event resulted in the vesting of coverage or benefits prior to an amendment affecting the person substantive rights under the plan.see confer custom eng g,cir concluding that coverage had vested because the exclusion was not in force at the time of the accident see also wheeler dynamic eng g,cir determining whether coverage vested member svcs.life ins.amer.bank trust of sapulpa,cir considering whether benefits had vested.this is not the situation before us.
smathers relies heavily on our statement in confer that the change in the plan by means of a formal amendment could operate only prospectively.at.in confer we found that the employer could not apply a motorcycle exclusion after the fact to deny coverage for injuries previously sustained in a motorcycle accident such a substantive change should not be applied retroactively,and the coverage in effect at the time of the accident governed.id.although the case before us also involves an insured who was involved in a motorcycle accident and was subsequently denied benefits,the similarity ends there.
here,the plan amendment at issue did not change the coverage under the plan or substance of smathers benefits or his entitlement to them.indeed,it is very likely that the company would have denied him benefits before the amendment,just as it did after.all that was changed was the scope of the administrator discretion and authority.the relevant language inserted into the plan was 
it is the express intent of this plan that the plan administrator shall have maximum legal discretionary authority to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the plan,to make determinations regarding issues which relate to eligibility for benefits,to decide disputes which may arise relative to a plan participant rights and to decide questions of plan interpretation and those of fact relating to the plan.the decisions of the plan administrator as to the facts related to any claim for benefits and the meaning and intent of any provision of the plan or its application to any claim will be final and binding on all interested parties.
this language does not in any way direct the administrator to decide smathers claim one way or the other.it sets forth the extent of the administrator authority,which,in turn,happens to be a signal to the district court,as dictated by the supreme court firestone opinion,as to how it is to review the administrator decision.
as the issue involved here is the administrator discretionary authority to make the benefits determination,we conclude that the better approach is to look at the plan in effect on the date the administrator actually made that determination.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit adopted that approach in the recent case of paul revere life insurance,cir,involving similar facts and the same type of plan amendment.the court there noted no circuit has yet addressed which policy dictates the standard of review when an insured files her claim under a policy but is subsequently denied benefits under an amended regime.id.at.there,the claim was initially accepted,but after the company conducted an investigation into the employee disability,it determined that she should not continue to receive benefits.the new discretionary language was added to the plan after she filed her claim,but before the administrator accepted the claim and conducted the investigation.the court relied on two district court cases that focused on when the plan administrator denied the claim rather than on when the claimant filed it,or when the event triggering coverage occurred.id.at citing blessing deere.and podolan aetna life ins.the court then concluded that the fact she became permanently disabled and filed her disability claim while the first policy was in effect is irrelevant it does not entitle her to invoke that plan provisions in perpetuity t his court must look to the revised plan to determine the appropriate standard of review,at.
we find this reasoning to be persuasive.here,there was no right that vested,nor is there any issue of retroactivity since the administrator discretionary authority was in place when that discretion was exercised we also note that this reasoning is consistent with our view that the concept of vesting under benefit plans is to be narrowly applied,and that there is a presumption against vesting with respect to most aspects of such plans.see int l union,skinner engine,cir.smathers cites no relevant authority that stands for the proposition that the administrator authority and as a result our scope of review should be based on provisions that were in place prior to the administrator authority being exercised.procedural provisions of a plan such as this,containing a grant of discretionary authority to the administrators,are not implicated until the administrator actually exercises that authority.see blessing.at.we therefore look to the plan in effect at the time benefits were denied,the plan,and,as a result,we will examine the administrator determination using the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
conflict of interest a heightened standard of review 
our consideration of the proper standard of review does not end there,however,because the supreme court has instructed that if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber,at.the potential for a conflict of interest arises because both funds and administers the welfare benefits plan in pinto reliance standard life insurance,cir,we set forth a sliding scale method,intensifying the degree of scrutiny to match the degree of the conflict.id.at.the insured in pinto brought a claim against the insurance company who funded and administered his benefits plan,and the court found the insurance company had a significant conflict of interest.id.at.however,we have explained that the risk of a conflict of interest is decreased where the administrator and funder of the plan is the employer,rather than an insurance company,because the employer has incentives to avoid the loss of morale and higher wage demands that could result from denials of benefits suggesting that there is at least some counter to the incentive not to pay claims.nazay miller,cir.however,our decisions also make clear that a conflict of interest can still exist in a situation where an employer is the administrator.
here,had purchased excess loss insurance through the life insurance company of north america lina to pay any amount in excess of deductible.thus,although smathers claims arising from this accident totaled approximately,was only responsible for the first the specific deductible which it paid provisionally to diversified group administrators dga,the plan third party administrator on january,normally,this would then be paid to smathers if he was successful,or if benefits were ultimately denied,it would be returned to.however,if is required to pay benefits here,it would be over the maximum aggregate specific deductibles it would be required to pay under the excess loss plan,and so it would get back of the it paid toward smathers specific deductible.therefore,would actually be out of pocket if required to pay smathers claims.
the district court found that these facts dictated the conclusion that there was no conflict of interest present in this case.it explained that while administers,sponsors and a portion of plan benefits,the balance of benefits are covered by excess loss insurance,and benefits are paid from the plan through a third party claims administrator.however,the court failed to note that will be out if it has to pay smathers claims.appellees urge that has already paid the but,clearly,it would receive that entire sum back into its coffers if the denial is upheld.either way,the outcome of this litigation will result in the payment back to of either or,resulting in the expenditure of either or.we also note that smathers ceased to be employed at in july,while the payment of his claim was still under consideration.since smathers was no longer an employee when made its decision to deny his claims,the counterbalancing of its monetary by possible concerns about the impact of its decision on morale and wage demands would thereby be lessened.the employer would still have the incentives discussed in nazay in regards to its current employees,however,the incentives would not be as strong as they would if smathers were still a employee.
our decisions in similar factual settings,even those in which we ultimately determined that there was no conflict of interest,lead us to conclude that the facts of this case do present a conflict of interest.in pinto,we took the opportunity to clarify that our previous cases findi
