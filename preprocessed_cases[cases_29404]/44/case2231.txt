this is a public nuisance action brought against deutsche bank trust company and affiliated companies deutsche bank,in relation to vacant properties in and around cleveland owned by deutsche bank.plaintiff cleveland housing renewal project,chrp,filed the action in the cleveland municipal housing court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.deutsche bank removed the action to federal court based on the parties diversity of citizenship.however,the district court granted chrp motion to remand.the court concluded that subject matter jurisdiction was established by virtue of the parties diversity of citizenship and that chrp had standing to proceed in federal court.the court nonetheless remanded the action to state court based on burford abstention,to avoid federal disruption of a coherent state policy regarding a matter of substantial public concern.deutsche bank timely appealed.finding that abstention is not warranted,we vacate the abstention order and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on chrp complaint.
background 
plaintiff chrp is a private corporation whose principal goal is the improvement and renewal of housing and economic conditions in the city of cleveland.we accept that the four affiliated deutsche bank entities named as defendants comprise a national banking association incorporated under the laws of the united states and include a new york state chartered trust company.
chrp filed its complaint on december,in the cleveland municipal housing court,seeking a declaration that each of named residential properties allegedly owned by deutsche bank constitutes a public nuisance as defined by ohio law,being a menace to the public health,welfare,or safety and seeking injunctive relief requiring deutsche bank to abate the alleged nuisances.the complaint also alleges that deutsche bank business practices relating to the maintenance and sale of properties subject to foreclosure amount to nuisances,in that homes are sold at extremely distressed prices,purchased by speculators,flipped,and ultimately abandoned,to the detriment of property values and neighborhood quality.chrp alleges that deutsche bank practices place homes in a post foreclosure death spiral vacancy boarded windows and doors and vandalism theft of the home assets copper,aluminum,iron haven for criminal activity decrease in neighboring housing values,complaint.chrp also seeks an injunction prohibiting these practices.
in addition to deutsche bank,chrp named the city of cleveland as a defendant.the complaint does not allege any cause of action against the city,nor does it seek any relief from the city.the complaint identifies the city as an entity that may have or claim to have some interest in real property that is the subject of this action by virtue of code violations,utility assessments and nuisance abatement costs,complaint.in answering the complaint,the city asserted against deutsche bank.deutsche bank removed this action to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.
chrp filed a motion to remand,contending primarily that the district court lacked jurisdiction because i chrp lacked article iii and prudential standing ii the city was a defendant and iii the jurisdictional requirement had not been satisfied.alternatively,chrp argued that the district court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under burford sun oil.deutsche bank opposed remand and moved the district court to realign the city as a plaintiff.the district court granted deutsche bank motion for realignment and ruled that it had jurisdiction over chrp claims,but declined to exercise jurisdiction under burford.see cleveland housing renewal project deutsche bank trust,d.
deutsche bank filed a motion to reconsider and presented the district court with newly discovered evidence concerning the cleveland housing court judge alleged bias in this case.the court dismissed the notion of any bias in the housing court,noting that ohio law provides for disqualification of judges and appellate review of housing court decisions and denied the motion to reconsider.cleveland housing renewal project deutsche bank trust,wl ohio,april.deutsche bank timely filed notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
appellate jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.in quackenbush allstate ins,the supreme court held that d,which bars appellate review of remand orders in some instances,must be read in pari materia with c,so that only remands based on grounds specified in c are immune from review under d.id.quoting things remembered,petrarca.in quackenbush,the court held that an remand order does not come within a category of remand orders that are immune from review.id.at.in other words,per quackenbush,an remand order is subject to appellate review.
chrp argues that congress amendment of c to include reference to a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction changes the meaning of c and renders remands also immune from appellate review.yet,in an opinion issued last year,the supreme court declined to read the amendment as working a material change.carlsbad technology,hif bio.specifically,the court recognized that remand orders based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not reviewable,but held that a discretionary decision not to exercise jurisdiction is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.in so ruling,the court cited with approval quackenbush holding that an remand is not for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.the court refrained from revisiting the premises of the quackenbush ruling,id.at,despite expressed unease over the extent to which the court applications of d appear to be at odds with the provision plain language,see id.at scalia,concurring,and souter,concurring.
we follow the supreme court lead.accordingly,chrp objection to appellate jurisdiction is overruled.
subject matter jurisdiction 
as a second threshold matter,chrp argues that irrespective of the merits of burford abstention,the district court order of remand should be affirmed because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the first place.chrp contends the parties are not completely diverse and the is less than.see.this court reviews a district court decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction de novo.loren blue cross blue shield of,cir.the party invoking federal court this case,deutsche bank,as removing the burden of demonstrating by competent proof that the and requirements are met.hertz friend.
diversity of citizenship 
chrp named the city of cleveland the city as a defendant.because both chrp and the city are citizens of ohio,chrp argued below that complete diversity of citizenship was lacking and that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.chrp insisted that the city was a properly joined party,who was not a nominal or formal party,and whose presence was required to avoid the problem of a potential buyer taking the property subject to the city lien for unrecorded assessments.the district court,however,granted deutsche bank motion to realign the city as a plaintiff,which created complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants.cleveland housing,d at.the district court found that chrp concerns regarding liens the city might hold on the properties to be ancillary or secondary to the ultimate purpose of the lawsuit,to abate the conditions creating the nuisance.id.in relation to the primary dispute in controversy,the district court concluded that the city interests are aligned with those of chrp.
the district court properly recognized that it is the court responsibility to ensure that the parties are properly aligned according to their interests in the litigation.see united states fidelity and guar.thomas solvent,cir citing city of indianapolis chase bank of city of new york.parties must be aligned in accordance with the primary dispute in the controversy,even where a different,legitimate dispute between the parties supports the original alignment.id.the primary controversy in this case clearly stems from chrp demand that deutsche bank abate alleged nuisances relating to its properties and be enjoined from creating and maintaining similar nuisances in the future.the purpose of the action is to remedy the condition of the vacant,abandoned and foreclosed properties located within the cleveland neighborhoods chrp serves,mot.to remand at.the city interests are not adverse to this purpose.in fact,to the extent that chrp may be successful,the city will also benefit.the conclusion that chrp and the city interests are aligned,not adverse,in relation to the primary purpose of the litigation is corroborated by the fact that the city filed a to recover the costs of abating nuisances at several of the properties at issue.should chrp ultimately prevail and obtain injunctive relief,deutsche bank will be enjoined from engaging in similar conduct with respect to similar properties in the cleveland area,potentially sparing the city the costs of future nuisance abatement.
chrp does not directly challenge this characterization of the primary controversy between the parties,but argues that the parties common interests in abating the complained of nuisance conditions are insufficient reason to the parties.yet,the potentially adverse interests represented by the city liens on some of the properties are clearly ancillary or secondary to the primary controversy.to find error in the district court realignment of the parties,we would have to disregard the teaching of thomas solvent and indianapolis chase bank.this we are unwilling to do.accordingly,we hold that the district court properly realigned the city as a plaintiff and properly held there is complete diversity between the parties for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.
amount in controversy 
chrp also challenges the district court finding that the requirement for diversity jurisdiction is met.in actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief,it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.hunt.state apple adver.comm n.additionally,we have observed that the costs of complying with an injunction may establish the.everett verizon wireless,cir.deutsche bank has the burden of showing that the requirement more likely than not is satisfied.everett,at.
the district court was persuaded by deutsche bank showing that injunctive relief requiring it to abate the alleged nuisances or demolish the residential properties and requiring it to alter its business practices would result in costs to deutsche bank in excess of.cleveland housing,d at.again,chrp does not directly challenge the district court finding,but argues that the amount in controversy should be determined from its viewpoint,rather than deutsche bank.chrp does not explain what the value of injunctive relief would be or how the value of such relief should be assessed,but asserts simply that the value of the relief is less than.
while the value of the requested injunctive relief to chrp may be difficult to quantify,the notion that abatement of nuisances on parcels of abandoned property would amount to improvement valued at less than is patently suspect.chrp seeks to have properties declared public nuisances and require the defendants to abate each nuisance,which may include,according to the complaint,replacement of the home assets,such as copper or aluminum,repairing or replacing doors and windows,and repairing vandalism damage.as an alternative to abating the properties at issue in this litigation,chrp seeks to have the properties demolished.
deutsche bank has satisfactorily shown that it is more likely than not that the requirement is met.the district court recognized that the cuyahoga county auditor valuation of the properties at a total of more than million is likely inflated,but correctly concluded that potential demolition of even just several properties would likely result in costs exceeding.id.indeed,common sense dictates that the significant remedial measures or complete destruction of the properties chrp seeks would certainly cost,on average,in excess of per structure.in its rather perfunctory challenge to the district court determination,chrp has failed to show error.
accordingly,we hold that the district court properly satisfied itself of its subject matter jurisdiction under.
article iii standing 
even if subject matter jurisdiction is established,chrp maintains that remand to state court is warranted on the ground that it lacks standing to proceed with its claims in federal court.the district court overruled the objection,holding that chrp does have standing.the district court correctly identified and applied the three constitutional standing requirements injury in fact,traceable to the defendant challenged actions,which is redressable by a favorable decision.cleveland housing,d at citing friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,and lujan defenders of wildlife.the district court concluded that chrp had adequately alleged cognizable injury to its organizational efforts to renew and improve blighted cleveland neighborhoods.id.at citing havens realty coleman.the district court was also satisfied that chrp complaint contained adequate allegations that the injury was traceable to deutsche bank practices and that the injury was redressable through injunctive relief.
further,the district court recognized that there are also several judicially limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,such as the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen wright.the court held that chrp complaint meets all of these prudential requirements.cleveland housing,d at.
on appeal,chrp has not mounted a serious challenge to the district court analysis of the constitutional or prudential standing requirements.indeed,we find no error in the district court holding that chrp has standing to prosecute this action in federal court.
burford abstention 
the district court remanded the case to state court based on burford abstention.the supreme court ruled in burford sun oil,that federal courts should exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy.id.at.the district court decision to abstain is reviewed de novo.see saginaw housing com bannum,cir.
there are two leading supreme court rulings on burford abstention,quackenbush allstate ins,and new orleans public service,council of city of new orleans,nopsi.in quackenbush,the court observed that burford abstention is a matter of equitable discretion reflecting principles of federalism and comity and requiring the balancing of federal interests in retaining jurisdiction against the competing concern for the independence of state action 
the equitable decision balances the strong federal interest in having certain classes of cases,and certain federal rights,adjudicated in federal court,against the state interests in maintaining uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem,and retaining local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import.this balance only rarely favors abstention,and the power to dismiss recognized in burford represents an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of the district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.
quackenbush,at citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the quackenbush court noted that its overruling of abstention in nopsi represented a recent application of these principles in relation to a claim of federal preemption of state administrative proceedings,illustrating the narrow range of circumstances in which burford abstention may be justified.id.at.the court characterized the nopsi ruling as follows 
we thus indicated that burford allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if it presents difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,or if its adjudication in a federal forum would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.
id.at quoting nopsi,at.
in nopsi,the state interests were evidenced by a state administrative regulatory scheme,but such a statewide regulatory scheme is not necessarily prerequisite to burford abstention.saginaw housing,at.because burford abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state regulatory scheme,t he key question is whether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state effort to implement its policy.id.at quoting watch,cascade res.recovery,cir.
federal interests 
first,we examine the federal interests.the instant action,removed based on the parties diversity,falls within one of those classes of cases to which a strong federal interest attaches.quackenbush,at.unlike quackenbush,which involved the federal arbitration act,and nopsi,which presented a question of federal preemption,no federal statute or federal right is implicated in this case.chrp complaint is premised exclusively on ohio state law.there is,however,a strong federal interest in adjudicating cases brought under the congressional grant of diversity jurisdiction 
by conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts in diversity cases through,congress intended a uniformly administered federal judicial system,which affords litigants of diverse citizenship convenient forums in which to vindicate their rights.although the basic congressional purpose behind the grant of diversity jurisdiction was to protect suitors from the prejudice of state courts,the congressional purpose was broader.by vesting the federal district courts with equity jurisdiction and guaranteeing adequate appeals within the federal judicial system,congress afforded procedures and remedies that were not available in the courts of several states.
miller davis,cir footnote,citations omitted.
the district court was cognizant of the federal interest in diversity jurisdiction,but noted that such interest was particularly strong in miller because that case involved a large nationwide pension fund.the district court determined that the federal interest in affording a federal forum for chrp complaint is not as strong because no such national concern is presented in this case.cleveland housing,d at.
deutsche bank insists there are federal interests in this case beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction,noting that congress has recently appropriated billion for the redevelopment of real estate markets in distress due to foreclosures.deutsche bank also points to various governmental organizations and programs designed to address the problem of home foreclosures throughout the country as evidence that this case touches on matters of nationwide import.indeed,we can take judicial notice of the fact that residential foreclosures represent a nationwide epidemic that has precipitated various governmental remedial measures.yet,this carries little weight in measuring the federal interests in adjudicating the claims asserted in chrp complaint.this action is not addressed to the problems associated with residential foreclosures generally it is aimed at abating nuisances allegedly caused by deutsche bank at identified locations in the cleveland area.the fact that government funds have been appropriated to address the nation foreclosure crisis does not affect the application of ohio public nuisance law in relation to the properties in cleveland.
nor are we impressed by deutsche bank argument that chrp broadside attack on deutsche bank business practices could result in imposition of local restrictions on the national operations of federally regulated businesses.the argument hints at the notion of federal preemption,but is based only on potential conflicts too speculative to materially enhance the federal interests weighing against burford abstention.
yet,though unpersuaded by deutsche bank arguments that there are federal interests beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction,we believe the district court improperly undervalued the strength of the federal interest in affording a neutral forum for the adjudication of disputes between parties of diverse citizenship.the district court characterized the federal interest based on diversity jurisdiction sans other federal rights as being at its nadir.cleveland housing,d at.the court implicit conclusion that diversity jurisdiction represents a strong federal interest only if accompanied by other federal interests is based on a faulty negative inference.in miller davis,as the district court observed,there were,in addition to diversity jurisdiction,other federal interests that helped render abstention inappropriate.yet this does not compel the conclusion that abstention is appropriate if diversity jurisdiction represents the only strong federal interest.additional federal interests make an already strong federal interest stronger,but their absence does not render an already strong federal interest weak.
in our opinion,the importance of diversity jurisdiction is particularly strong in this case,where the state law claims a are of intense local concern,b are asserted against not just citizens of different states,but affiliates of manifestly foreign,german corporations,and c would otherwise be adjudicated by a municipal judge.the district court minimization of the strong federal interest in affording deutsche bank a neutral forum for the adjudication of chrp state law claims is a flaw that materially affected its analysis.
state interests 
the state interests that may be deemed to outweigh the federal interests must stem from the need to maintain uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem,and the need to retain local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import.quackenbush,at.the district court noted that the ohio legislature had expressed a strong interest in the cleveland housing market by establishing a specialized housing division in the cleveland municipal court with exclusive jurisdiction over statutory public nuisance claims and authorizing cuyahoga county the county surrounding cleveland to create a land reutilization corporation for the purpose of promoting reclamation and development and managing of vacant real property.cleveland housing,d at.further,with reference to the first nopsi factor,the district court held that chrp public nuisance claim,attacking deutsche bank business practices,presents a difficult question of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import.id.at.as to the second factor,the district court held that federal adjudication of chrp statutory public nuisance claim could disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy through uniform adjudication of such claims in the specialized housing division of the municipal court.id.at.
having thus identified two state interests that qualified,per nopsi,for quackenbush balancing against the federal interests,the district court gave short shrift to the actual balancing,and summarily concluded that a balancing of the respective federal and state interests suggests that this court must abstain.id.at.deutsche bank challenges this conclusion on several grounds.
first,deutsche bank notes that the nopsi factors represent cognizable state interests weighing in favor of abstention only where timely and adequate review is available.nopsi,at.deutsche bank argues that adequate review is unavailable in the housing division of the cleveland municipal court because the sole judge of the housing court has made numerous public statements evidencing his bias against banks and mortgage companies in relation to nuisance conditions at vacant properties.we are not persuaded.
the statements attributed to the housing court judge do not relate specifically to this litigation or the properties here at issue.while the statements may be construed as raising questions,they do not necessarily reflect adversely on the housing court judge ability to adjudicate chrp claims fairly and impartially.under ohio law,the housing court judge is subject to disqualification upon a proper showing
