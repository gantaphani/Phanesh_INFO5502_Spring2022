opinion of the court 
general refractories company grc appeals the dismissal with prejudice of its claims of abuse of process and civil conspiracy against the law firm of gilberg kiernan and one of its attorneys,andrew butz.we agree with the district court that the complaint failed to state a claim,under pennsylvania law,for abuse of process,but conclude that it abused its discretion in denying grc leave to amend the complaint as to that claim.we further disagree with the district court that the judicial privilege necessarily would insulate the attorney appellees from liability for abuse of process.finally,we agree with the district court that the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine immunized the attorney appellees from liability for civil conspiracy.we therefore will affirm in part and reverse in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
grc once manufactured material,used in the construction of high temperature facilities,that contained asbestos.since that time,it has been the target of a number of personal injury suits.fireman fund insurance company fireman fund or ffic is an insurance company that issued an excess insurance policy to grc for a period covering october to october,with a extension for november.
the operative facts of this case stem from litigation initiated in april,by grc against fireman fund,in the court of common pleas of pennsylvania,philadelphia county hereinafter referred to as the state court litigation or,by the district court,as the insurance coverage action,wherein grc alleged that fireman fund refused to comply with the excess blanket liability insurance policy.fireman fund asserted that the policy had a total coverage limit of,while grc asserted that the policy had three annual coverage limits of per year.grc claimed breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and bad faith,and sought a declaratory judgment and monetary relief.appellees gilberg kiernan and one of its lawyers,andrew butz hereinafter referred to as attorney appellees initially represented fireman fund in the notably contentious state court litigation.see generally general refractories fireman fund insur,aff in pertinent part,table.
the case before us arises from allegedly tortious acts,committed by fireman fund and the attorney appellees,that were the subject of a motion for sanctions filed by grc against fireman fund in the state court litigation.in the motion,grc alleged that fireman fund,gilberg kiernan,and butz committed an array of discovery and other litigation abuses.after receiving testimony and argument for four days,the court agreed with grc that fireman fund and the attorney appellees conduct was intentional,inexcusable,and warrant ed severe sanctions.general refractories.at.the court view regarding the defendant actions is summarized in the following finding 
the sad history of defendant discovery responses in this case reveals a clear pattern of delay,stonewalling,deception,obfuscation and pretense.defendant intentionally withheld critical documents,ignored court orders,permitted false testimony at depositions and misrepresented facts to opposing counsel and the court.the defendant,through its employees,its house counsel and its engaged litigation counsel participated in an intentional campaign to hide critical facts and documents.at every stage of discovery,reasonable and relevant requests have been met by incomplete responses,unreasonable objections,unfounded claims of privilege and intentionally incomplete privilege logs.whenever plaintiff sought court intervention additional documents were found,voluntarily produced and the privilege log expanded amidst hundreds of such insignificant,nonsensical or unintelligible pages,are material and significant submissions that demonstrate that the defendant engaged in an intentional effort to obstruct legitimate discovery by using the claim of privilege.defendant has attempted to hide discoverable documents,in an attorney file,and have sic used an overly broad,clearly untenable,theory of privilege to conceal the knowledge,activity and intent which form the very basis of this bad faith lawsuit.the purportedly privileged material demonstrates a strategy antagonistic to their insured including discussion of bad faith,delaying payment,and admissions of fiduciary obligations.
id.at.by order dated april,the court imposed a number of sanctions,including the revocation of gilberg kiernan and butz pro hac vice admission,a fine of payable to the city of philadelphia,the payment of grc costs and attorney fees in bringing the motion for sanctions,a extension of discovery,a blanket waiver of fireman fund right to assert privilege as to a large number of documents,and a directive that fireman fund supplement and correct its prior responses to grc discovery requests.id.at.the court noted that it imposed only the minimum sanction that accomplishes the goal of correcting discovery abuses,restor ing the case to proper discovery course,appropriately punishes recalcitrant behavior and deters future obstreperous conduct by the defendant.id.at.on appeal,the superior court of pennsylvania largely upheld all of the sanctions imposed,except for the blanket waiver of privilege.general refractories fireman fund insur.table.
while the appeal was pending,grc brought a separate suit in the common pleas court against fireman fund,gilberg kiernan,and andrew butz together referred to as the defendants,complaining of the actions of fireman fund and the attorney appellees during the state court litigation and seeking recovery of damages.the defendants removed the case to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.
the complaint allegations largely replicate the common pleas court findings in the sanctions proceeding.nevertheless,because we are asked to analyze the sufficiency of the complaint,we find it necessary to highlight the exact wording of many of these allegations,specifically that the defendants engaged in the following conduct a clear pattern of delay,stonewalling,deception,obfuscation and pretense i ntentionally withholding critical documents i gnoring court orders t estifying falsely at depositions,with litigation counsel fully aware of the false testimony m isrepresenting facts to the court and opposing counsel p articipating,through ffic employees,its house counsel and litigation counsel,in an intentional campaign to hide critical facts and documents p roviding incomplete responses,unreasonable objections,unfounded claims of privilege and intentionally incomplete privilege logs in response to reasonable and relevant requests u sing an overly broad,clearly untenable theory of privilege to conceal the knowledge,activity and intent which formed the basis of the insurance coverage action a ctively hiding highly probative documents while moving for summary judgment on the issues to which the hidden documents related u sing hidden documents during a deposition of a representative of grc l itigation counsel falsely suggesting he did not previously know of the hidden documents when their existence was finally disclosed c ontinuing to locate hundreds of documents that should have been produced or put on privilege logs,each time claiming that they had just been found e ngaging in obdurate conduct,including actions demonstrating an attempt to obstruct the discovery process f ailing to timely seek a stay of court orders while an appeal was pending,while at the same time refusing to comply with those orders encouraging witnesses to provide false and misleading testimony and encourag ing and convinc ing ffic to change its position toward the insurance policy coverage and to breach ffic contractual duties to grc.according to the complaint,the defendants engaged in this conduct for various reasons,including to further the interests of ffic,to obtain an unfair litigation advantage,to delay ffic having to pay any money to grc,to drain grc resources and delay the litigation,to keep grc from discovering their agreements and actions,and to defeat the claims of grc at any cost.the complaint also alleges that fireman fund,individually,used the discovery and litigation processes for purposes of harassment and delay.
based on these averments,grc sought recovery under five distinct causes of action.in count i,grc alleged that fireman fund committed insurance bad faith under title,section of the pennsylvania consolidated statutes.in count ii,it alleged that fireman fund breached a fiduciary duty owed to grc.in count iii,it alleged that the defendants violated the pennsylvania common law prohibition against abuse of process.in count iv,it alleged that the attorney appellees tortiously interfered with grc contract with fireman fund.in count v,it alleged that the defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy to violate the pennsylvania bad faith statute and to abuse process.altogether,grc sought damages totaling the total attorney fees and costs they allege they have incurred due to the discovery abuses but not the fees for costs related to bringing the motion for sanctions.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss all counts against them for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted gilberg kiernan and butz motion in whole and fireman fund motion in part.see general refractories fireman fund ins,wl.the court denied fireman fund motion to dismiss count i,the bad faith claim,and also denied its motion as to count ii,the breach of fiduciary duty claim,ruling that that claim would go forward as a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.the court granted each defendant motion to dismiss count iii,the abuse of process claim,and count v,the civil conspiracy claim.id.at.the court also granted the attorney appellees motion to dismiss count iv,the tortious interference claim.id.at.grc moved for reconsideration,leave to amend the abuse of process claim,or,in the alternative,an order under federal rule of civil procedure b allowing it to bring an immediate appeal as to the attorney appellees.the court denied reconsideration and refused to grant leave to amend,but granted the rule b motion.
on appeal,grc challenges the court decision to dismiss the abuse of process and civil conspiracy claims,as well as its denial of leave to amend,but has chosen not to appeal the dismissal of the tortious interference claim.in dismissing the abuse of process claim,the district court held that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for abuse of process and further found that,in any event,judicial privilege would have insulated the defendants from liability for many of their actions,id.at,and that granting leave to amend would be futile.in dismissing the civil conspiracy claim,the court concluded that the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine insulated the attorney appellees from liability.id.at.grc challenges all of these rulings,while the attorney appellees not only contend that the district court rulings were proper,but additionally argue that the abuse of process claim could have been dismissed because it failed to contain any allegations that they used legal process as required to recover under the tort 
we conclude that,although the district court correctly determined that the complaint does not contain the necessary allegations to state a cause of action for abuse of process,the district court interpreted abuse of process in pennsylvania too narrowly and,therefore,should have granted grc leave to amend its complaint.we also reject the attorney appellees argument that grc failed to allege properly that they used a legal process,and we conclude that the district court too broadly interpreted the application of the judicial privilege in pennsylvania.lastly,we agree with the district court that the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine insulated the attorney appellees from liability for civil conspiracy.
ii.abuse of process 
the supreme court of pennsylvania has said that t he gist of an action for abuse of process is the improper use of process after it has been issued,that is,a perversion of it.mcgee feege,citing mayer walter,see also morphy shipley,an abuse is a perversion of legal process.quoting mayer,at.a perversion of legal process occurs when a party uses the process primarily to accomplish a purpose for which the process was not designed.dumont television radio franklin of.generally speaking,to recover under a theory of abuse of process,a plaintiff must show that the defendant used legal process against the plaintiff in a way that constituted a perversion of that process and caused harm to the plaintiff.see hart,rosen am.bank of rolla.
the district court recognized these elements of the tort,general refractories,wl,at,but also stated the following 
the complaint alleges that defendants used abusive discovery tactics and improper motion practice in order to gain a litigation advantage in the insurance coverage action.this allegation is not sufficient to support a claim for abuse of process because the complaint does not allege that defendants abused process for an unlawful purpose unconnected to the purpose for which the process was designed,a successful conclusion to the insurance coverage action.
id.emphasis added.thus,the court found grc complaint deficient because the purpose for any alleged use of process was to gain a litigation advantage in or was connected to the successful conclusion of the state court litigation.as the attorney appellees put it,the district court concluded that,in order to state a claim,the process must have been used primarily for the purpose of coercing a collateral advantage,that is,unrelated to the underlying litigation.grc concedes that,if we agree that the test under pennsylvania law requires a primary purpose of achieving a collateral advantage,the district court properly dismissed the abuse of process claim.
we,however,do not agree.neither the supreme court of pennsylvania,nor any other pennsylvania state court,has so narrowly construed the tort.and,we find no evidence that the supreme court of pennsylvania would do so if presented with the opportunity.instead,the supreme court has interpreted the tort broadly,making clear that it will not countenance the use of the legal process as a tactical weapon to coerce a desired result that is not the legitimate object of the process.mcgee,at.see generally fowler harper,fleming james,oscar gray,the law of torts ed referring to this broader interpretation as the modern trend.as a result,a court must look at the legal process used and decide whether it was used primarily to benefit someone in achieving a purpose which is not the authorized goal of the procedure in question,werner,emphasis added,not whether it was used to achieve a purpose or advantage unrelated or collateral to the entire underlying litigation proceeding.
while it is true that the term collateral is sometimes used by pennsylvania courts when discussing an abuse of process,see,hart,at,the attorney appellees have taken the term out of the context in which courts usually employ it,and therefore stripped it of its connotation.for instance,they rely on the following language from in re larsen,
abuse of process differs from malicious prosecution in that the gist of the tort is not commencing an action or causing process to issue without justification,but misusing,or misapplying process justified in itself for an end other than that which it was designed to accomplish.the improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage,not properly involved in the proceeding itself such as the surrender of property or the payment of money by the use of the process as a threat or a club.there is,in other words,a form of extortion,and it is what is done in the course of negotiation,rather than the assurance sic of the process itself,which constitutes the tort.
id.at citing prosser and keeton on torts,at ed accordingly,the attorney appellees insist that extortion or a similar purpose unrelated to the underlying litigation is necessary for an abuse of process claim.but,again,this results in a distortion of the concept and its meaning.the attorney appellees effectively have interpreted the modifier usually out of the language.a collateral advantage or some type of extortion outside of the underlying litigation is not the only type of abuse of process case rather,it is the usual case in other words,the classic example.al hamilton contracting cowder.
for the same reason,we find unpersuasive the attorney appellees interpretation of section of the restatement second of torts and the pennsylvania cases favorably citing to and adopting it.see,rosen,at.section defines abuse of process essentially as pennsylvania courts do it states one who uses a legal process,whether criminal or civil,against another primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed,is subject to liability to the other for harm caused by the abuse of process.restatement second of torts see also hart,at referring to collateral purpose as use primarily for a purpose for which the process was not designed.the attorney appellees have pounced on comment b to section,in arguing that an purpose must lie behind the use of process.that provision provides that t he usual case of abuse of process is one of some form of extortion,using the process to put pressure upon the other to compel him to pay a different debt or to take some other action or refrain from it.restatement second of torts cmt.b see also rosen,at quoting this section of restatement.again,the attorney appellees ignore usual.the restatement is concerned with individual legal processes primarily used for purposes for which they were not designed,see restatement second of torts,not whether they are used for purposes unconnected or unrelated to the underlying litigation.as the restatement states,the gravamen of the misconduct is the misuse of process,no matter how properly obtained,for any purpose other than that which it was designed to accomplish.id.at,cmt.b emphasis added.the restatement does not speak in terms of the relationship of the purpose to the litigation that the attorney appellees would have us read into the tort 
the potential ramifications of the district court and attorney appellees interpretation of the tort buttress our conclusion.were we to accept their view,we would render the tort largely impotent,inapplicable to those cases where a legal process is pursued in a perverted manner in order to directly harm an adversary.we would be condoning tortious tactics that harm and otherwise disadvantage an adversary simply because those tactics are related to the litigation and improve a party chances of succeeding in the litigation.we refuse to do so and doubt that the supreme court of pennsylvania would.accord poduska ward,cir rejecting the argument that massachusetts limits abuse of process claims to instances where the defendant intended to coerce or extort the plaintiff dan dobbs,the law of torts t he advantage need not always be collateral in the sense that it would be outside the court power to grant.harper,james,gray,the law of torts stating that the cause of action should be available in circumstances other than threats as well,so long as intentional abuse of the legal system can be proved.
in fact,in its most recent opinion discussing abuse of process,mcgee feege,the supreme court of pennsylvania,although not dealing with the issue directly,allowed an abuse of process claim based on purposes that were related to the underlying litigation to go forward.in that case,mcgee had successfully prosecuted a workmen compensation claim against her employer.her employer,however,engaged in a blatant misuse of legal process to avoid payment of a legal obligation.id.at.the misuse involved the filing of over ten different petitions and motions related to the workmen compensation claim,many in spite of supreme court of pennsylvania order granting mcgee petition to enforce judgment.id.at.while the central holding of the case was that an abuse of process did not require a seizure of property,see id.at,the court expressed no reservations with the other aspects of the claim and forcefully endorsed the broad viability of the tort of abuse of process,making clear,as quoted supra,that it will not countenance the use of the legal process as a tactical weapon to coerce a desired result that is not the legitimate object of the process.id.at.the court use of coerce is especially important,because it was concerned with the coercion or causation of an illegitimate result,and did not limit the coercion to that causing a result collateral or unconnected to the underlying litigation or to any other context.
having rejected the less expansive view of the tort urged by the attorney appellees and employed by the district court that would require a purpose unconnected to the litigation,we think the test that courts should use in deciding what circumstances amount to an abuse of process has been clearly enunciated by the supreme court of pennsylvania.quite simply,a court should ask whether there has been a perversion of the process,or,whether a legal process has been used as a tactical weapon to coerce a desired result that is not the legitimate object of the process.id.at.
responding to that inquiry,we believe that using a legal process primarily to harass and cause direct injury to an adversary similar to what occurred here could constitute a perversion of that process.the following excerpt from the superior court opinion in shiner moriarty is illustrative of this concept 
the shiners did not merely allege that the moriartys and the attorney defendants intentions were impure.they alleged that the equity action,the petitions directed toward the confessed judgment,and the sundry motions to stay the execution on the leasehold during the pendency of these actions were undertaken and continued in an effort to harass and to cause them financial and emotional injury.these objectives are illegitimate in the context of any civil proceeding in pennsylvania pursuing litigation primarily to harass and cause injury to the adverse party is an objective not authorized by the equity action or the efforts to avoid the confessed judgment and constitutes a sufficient perversion of the process employed here to support a common law claim of abuse of process t he evidence presented was sufficient to permit a jury to determine that the moriartys and the attorney defendants proceeded for a primary purpose of harassing the shiners,and not to preserve the leasehold and avoid eviction.
shiner moriarty,citations omitted emphasis added see also nienstedt wetzel,cited in shiner,at,and rosen,at stating that the purpose of expos ing the injured party to excessive attorney fees and legal expenses may support an abuse of process claim edwards wyatt,wl,at,finding no abuse of process where the alleged harassment stemmed from allegations in the ad damnum clause of a complaint.other courts have made similar conclusions,such as that use of the legal processes to weaken the resolve of the other party could satisfy the perversion element.givens mullikin ex rel.estate of mcelwaney,id.we hold that abuse of process in the civil discovery context may lie when the party who employs the process of a court specifically and primarily intends to increase the burden and expense of litigation to the other side and the use of that process can not otherwise be said to be for the legitimate or reasonably justifiable purposes of advancing the party interests in the ongoing litigation.citation omitted emphasis in original barquis merchs.collection ass n,cal d,finding a properly pled ulterior purpose where the complaint contained allegations of an intent to impair individuals rights to defend suits and,in effect,to coerce inequitable settlements and default judgments by making it inconvenient for defendants to defend suits on their merits.these examples of what purposes pervert the discovery and other litigation processes seem consistent with the interpretation of the tort in pennsylvania and we are confident that the supreme court of pennsylvania would embrace them.
we pause to add a note of caution.we recognize that causing financial and emotional injury to,as well as weakening the resolve of,opposing parties in the context of ongoing litigation are somewhat nebulous concepts,and when utilizing most litigation procedures an attorney is aware of the possibility that his actions could have one of these results.we do not,here,mean to predict that the supreme court of pennsylvania would allow for liability simply because an attorney acts with these possibilities in mind.rather,the point of liability is reached when the utilization of the procedure for the purpose for which it was designed becomes so lacking in justification as to lose its legitimate function as a reasonably justifiable litigation procedure.nienstedt,at.only at that point could the legal process be considered to have been perverted.
turning to the complaint at issue,it appears that the thrust of grc allegations comes close to laying out a perversion of process.grc avers that the fireman fund used the discovery and litigation process for purposes of harassment and delay,that the abuse of process was without reasonable basis,placed ffic,gilberg kiernan and butz financial interests above grc interests and was for the unlawful and improper purpose of avoiding and delaying grc right to recover under the fireman fund umbrella policy,and that fireman fund,gilberg kiernan,and butz conspired to drain grc resources and delay the litigation.
from these general averments,we view grc as alleging that the defendants used discovery and litigation process for five different purposes harassment,draining resources,delaying payment to grc under the insurance policy,delaying litigation,and avoiding payment to grc under the insurance policy.as evident from our previous discussion,the first four purposes harassment,draining resources,delaying payment,and delaying litigation that grc alleges that the defendants used discovery and litigation process to achieve,if severe enough,could constitute perversions of the legal process.
the purpose of avoiding payment to the adverse party,on the other hand,does not suffice to state an abuse of process claim.if it did,any party who defended a lawsuit,but eventually lost,could be liable for abuse of process.such allegations amount to exactly what the district court interpreted them to mean the attorney appellees used these tactics in an effort to succeed in the litigation.they do not satisfy the requirement of pleading that a particular legal process was used for a purpose other than for which it was intended.hart,at.allowing a party to use the process in order to succeed in the litigation is an end contemplated by most legal processes,and,certainly,that goal does not pervert discovery and litigation process.see poduska,at t he lawsuit objective of a money recovery can not be the basis for abuse of process,or a defendant would have a triable counterclaim,whenever he was sued,by alleging the suit was groundless,and the plaintiff knew it.accord mozzochi beck,dismissing a complaint for abuse of process where the plaintiffs pled only that the defendants acted for an unlawful ulterior purpose,to wit to inflict injury upon the plaintiff and to enrich themselves and their said client although they knew that their said lawsuit was without merit.
nevertheless,the allegations are too vague as they are presented in the complaint.the complaint does not contain the necessary allegations that legal processes were not employed to achieve their intended purposes.the purposes for which the attorney appellees used the various legal processes are not specifically alleged as a part of the abuse of process claim against the attorney appellees,but only against fireman fund.the allegations against the attorney appellees are more conclusory and general in nature.while the purposes of draining resources and delaying litigation likely would satisfy the perversion element,grc does not incorporate such allegations into its abuse of process claim,but only makes such averments under count v the civil conspiracy claim.while a court must construe a complaint liberally,see bald eagle area school dist.keystone financial,cir,it may not rewrite a plaintiff allegations.therefore,the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint because it fell short of making the necessary allegations.
the district did err,however,in refusing to grant leave to amend.the district court denied leave to amend on the ground that the factual allegations which plaintiff proposes to add to the complaint in support of its abuse of process claim would not be sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.however,the court reached this conclusion while under the misimpression that the abuse must have a purpose unconnected to the litigation.
a party generally should be permitted to amend a complaint where if it did so it could state a claim.shane fauver,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a makes clear that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.as the district court noted,however,where the amendment would be futile a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.in re nahc.sec,cir.other grounds that could justify a denial of leave to amend include undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive,and prejudice.shane,at.
in the motion for reconsideration,grc sought leave to specifically state that the defendants used the discovery and motion practice to achieve a purpose that is not the anticipated goal of each of these procedures.based on reading the opinion of the court of common pleas,we conclude that grc possibly could have cured any deficiencies in its complaint regarding the abuse of process claim if allowed to amend.for instance,the court of common pleas said the following regarding the attorney appellees actions in the insurance litigation 
under the guise of negotiation and compromise those few attorneys who employ slash and burn litigation,delay legitimate discovery requests,pretend to be cooperative,dissuade recourse to discovery court,blame their client for failings and make repeated promises,all the while keeping one eye vigilantly on the clock,awaiting the moment when they can pounce upon unsuspecting prey to claim unjustified protection by the passage of a deadline.unfortunately,in the matter before the court,fireman fund insurance company through the action of their pro hac vice counsel has adopted this dysfunctional approach.in stark contrast to the vast number of attorneys in our court,a few lawyers have seized upon enforced deadlines as an opportunity to take unfair advantage of the reasonableness and civility of opposing.
general refractories.at.the findings of the court of common pleas,as shown by this excerpt and the one reproduced supra,seemingly show a concerted and vicious effort orchestrated by the attorney appellees and fireman fund to use various legal processes as a club against grc in the state court litigation.we believe that grc,if granted leave to amend,could properly allege that the attorney appellees used a legal process as a tactical weapon for an improper end not otherwise the legitimate object of that process.
the attorney appellees present an alternative reason as to why the district court should have dismissed the complaint.they contend that it did not contain allegations sufficient to satisfy the use of a legal process element of an abuse of process claim,and that grc could not cure this defect.although it is not entirely clear,the district court appears to have determined that the complaint sufficiently alleged a use of legal process.see general refractories,wl,at.we agree with the district court.
in pennsylvania,t he word process as used in the tort of abuse of process has been interpreted broadly,and encompasses the entire range of procedures incident to the litigation process,shiner,at quoting rosen,at,including discovery proceedings,the noticing of depositions and the issuing of subpoenas.pellegrino food prods,city of warren,d,citing rosen,at see also mcgee,finding meritless petitions for stay,to open or strike judgment,and other motions sufficient to establish abuse of process shiner,at finding that petitions for stays in state and bankruptcy courts,reconsideration of the denial of the stay,an injunction,and to strike a confessed judgment,as well as challenges before a zoning board,constitute use of a legal process for purposes of an abuse of process claim.
while we agree that some of the alleged uses of legal pro
