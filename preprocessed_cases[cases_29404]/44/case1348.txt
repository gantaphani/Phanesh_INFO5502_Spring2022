opinion of the court 
we decide two issues whether new jersey law required daniel and kathleen natale collectively,the natales in the singular,the reference is to daniel natale to file an affidavit of merit in order to state a medical malpractice claim,and whether the natales provided sufficient evidence of a governmental policy or custom for their claim under to survive the motion of prison health services phs for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the natales malpractice claim on the grounds that new jersey law required the filing of an affidavit of merit that they did not submit.the district court granted summary judgment to phs on the natales claim because it concluded that they had not presented any evidence of a policy or custom at phs that deprived daniel natale of his constitutional right to adequate medical care.
we reverse and remand both rulings.because the natales malpractice claim falls within the common knowledge exception to the affidavit requirement,they did not need to submit the affidavit of a medical expert.in addition,the natales produced sufficient evidence of a policy or custom at phs that deprived daniel natale of his right to adequate medical care to survive a motion for summary judgment.
background 
on the evening of november,gloucester township police arrested daniel natale,an diabetic.before transporting him to the camden county correctional facility cccf,the police took him to the emergency department of john kennedy memorial hospital for a medical clearance prior to incarceration.the physician treating natale at the hospital gave him a dose of insulin,and wrote a note stating that natale must have insulin while incarcerated.the note did not,however,indicate how often the insulin should be administered.
at on november,natale arrived at cccf,where,as part of his initial processing,employees of phs,a private company that provides health services to cccf inmates,performed a medical screening.natale informed phs employees that he was an diabetic,and a phs employee noted this fact on natale chart.there is no indication in the record that the phs employee screening natale ever asked him how often he needed insulin.natale was then admitted to the general prison population.
at on november,hours after being admitted to cccf,natale received his first dose of insulin at that facility.he was released later the same day.two days later,natale suffered a stroke.attributing this stroke to the failure of phs to administer insulin during the first hours of his incarceration.natale and his wife,kathleen natale,filed suit in new jersey state court on march,alleging medical malpractice and violations of and.defendant camden county removed the action to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.discovery proceeded over the course of the next year.
on july,the district court ordered sua sponte that the natales show cause why their medical malpractice claim should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim,citing the natales failure to comply with stat.ann.the affidavit of merit statute,which requires the plaintiff in a malpractice case to file an expert affidavit attesting to the merit of the plaintiff claim the district court also entered summary judgment in favor of cccf,the county of camden,and the camden county sheriff department the county defendants on the natales claim,and dismissed the natales claim as to all defendants 
on july,the district court issued an order dismissing the natales medical malpractice claim for failure to state a claim as a result of their failure to file an affidavit of merit.on july,the district court granted phs motion for summary judgment on the natales claim.the district court orders dismissing the natales malpractice claim and granting summary judgment in favor of phs on their claim were final orders,and the natales appeal of both was timely.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.discussion 
dismissal of the natales medical malpractice claim 
we review de novo the dismissal of the natales new jersey malpractice claim.island insteel.waters,cir.the natales argue that because the issue of negligence in this case was one that could be resolved from the jury common knowledge without expert testimony,there was no need for an affidavit of merit,citing to the supreme court of new jersey recent decision in hubbard reed,holding that no affidavit of merit need be filed in common knowledge malpractice cases.
a successful malpractice claim requires a plaintiff to show,inter alia,that a duty of care existed and that the defendant breached that duty rosenberg cahill.in the typical malpractice case,the duty of care,or the standard of practice to which the failed to adhere,must be established by expert testimony.id.quoting sanzari rosenfeld.but where the jurors common knowledge as lay persons is sufficient to enable them,using ordinary understanding and experience,to determine a defendant negligence without the benefit of the specialized knowledge of experts,estate of chin saint barnabas med,the jury itself is allowed to supply the applicable standard of care and thus to obviate the necessity for expert testimony relative thereto.rosenberg,at quoting sanzari,at.the factual predicate for a common knowledge case is one where the carelessness of the defendant is readily apparent to anyone of average intelligence and ordinary experience.estate of chin,at quoting rosenberg,at.
the new jersey legislature enacted the affidavit of merit statute as part of a tort reform package designed to strike a fair balance between preserving a person right to sue and controlling nuisance suits.palanque,internal quotation marks omitted.the statute requires the plaintiff in a malpractice action to file an affidavit of an appropriate licensed person stating that there exists a reasonable probability that the care,skill or knowledge exercised or exhibited in the treatment,practice or work that is the subject of the complaint,fell outside acceptable professional or occupational standards or treatment practices.stat.ann.the penalty for not following the statute is severe absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances,the failure to file the affidavit within sixty days of the filing of the answer shall be deemed a failure to state a cause of action.this requirement curtail s frivolous litigation without preventing access to the courts for meritorious claims.palanque,at.
where,however,common knowledge makes apparent a claim merit,an expert affidavit is unnecessary.hubbard,at.in these cases,the threshold of merit should be readily apparent from a reading of the plaintiff complaint and an expert is no more qualified to attest to the merits of a plaintiff claim than a.id.at.the district court concluded that in this case the crucial issue is whether defendant failed to timely administer medication to natale,an diabetic,and that t he acceptable professional standard for treating an diabetic is not within a lay person common knowledge such that phs negligence can be determined without the benefit of the specialized knowledge of experts.
we disagree.a reasonable jury could conclude that phs personnel were negligent absent expert testimony.phs personnel failed to call natale treating physician to determine how often he needed insulin to be administered.they did even ask natale.when defendant careless acts are quite obvious,palanque,at,no affidavit of merit is required.while laypersons are unlikely to know how often diabetics need insulin,common judgment imparted by human tell a layperson that medical personnel charged with caring for an diabetic should determine how often the diabetic needs insulin.no special expertise or expert testimony is needed to show,at the outset of a case,that the claim is not frivolous.the new jersey supreme court decision in hubbard supports this view thus no affidavit of merit need be filed.the district court decision to dismiss the natales malpractice claim for failure to file such an affidavit was therefore erroneous,and we reverse.
dismissal of the natales claim 
the district court granted summary judgment to phs on the natales claim on the ground that they failed to provide any evidence that a decisionmaker for phs established a policy or custom of ignoring the medication needs of inmates at cccf.we review the decision de novo.fogleman mercy,cir.we may affirm for any reason supported by the record,even if not relied on by the district court,nicini morra,cir.
summary judgment is proper if,when viewed in the light most favorable to the natales,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c bailey united airlines,cir.a factual dispute is material if it bears on an essential element of the plaintiff claim,and is genuine if a reasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party.fakete aetna,cir quoting spring dairies.milk mktg,cir.because there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that phs had a policy failing to address the immediate medication needs of cccf inmates with serious medical conditions,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of phs on the natales claim.
to establish a claim under,a plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of a right protected by the constitution or the laws of the united states committed by a person acting under the color of state law.nicini,at.it is undisputed that phs was acting under color of state law when it provided medical services to daniel natale and no federal laws are implicated by the actions of phs employees.thus we focus on whether phs employees violated natale constitutional rights.
when evaluating a claim brought under,we must first identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated in order to determine whether natale has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.id.quoting county of sacramento lewis,d.if so,the analysis then shifts to a determination of whether the state actor,in this case phs,can be held liable for that violation.see berg county of allegheny,cir.
violation of natale constitutional right 
as a threshold matter,we note that the district court accepted the natales claim for inadequate medical care as one arising under the eighth amendment right of a convicted prisoner to receive adequate medical care,articulated by the supreme court in estelle gamble,d finding that a failure to provide adequate medical care constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.daniel natale was not,at any time relevant to this case,a convicted prisoner.rather,he was a detainee.while the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment upon prisoners,it applies only after the state has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.city of revere massachusetts,d quoting ingraham wright,d.
in this context,the natales should have pleaded their claim as one based on the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.their failure to do so does no lasting damage,however,as the supreme court has concluded that the fourteenth amendment affords pretrial detainees protections at least as great as the eighth amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner,without deciding whether the fourteenth amendment provides greater protections.id.in previous cases,we have found no reason to apply a different standard than that set forth in estelle pertaining to prisoners claims of inadequate medical care under the eighth amendment when evaluating whether a claim for inadequate medical care by a detainee is sufficient under the fourteenth amendment.see,boring kozakiewicz,cir 
we therefore evaluate the natales fourteenth amendment claim for inadequate medical care under the standard used to evaluate similar claims brought under the eighth amendment,the standard used by the district court to evaluate the natales claim.in estelle,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment proscribes deliberate indifference to prisoners serious medical needs.at.in order to establish a violation of daniel natale constitutional right to adequate medical care,evidence must show i a serious medical need,and ii acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need.rouse plantier,cir.
natale has established that he is an diabetic.phs does not dispute that this is a serious illness,and that natale had a serious medical need.because phs is a state actor,employees of phs are considered prison officials.the question,therefore,is whether phs employees were deliberately indifferent to natale serious medical needs 
deliberate indifference is a subjective standard of liability consistent with recklessness as that term is defined in criminal law.nicini,at.in farmer brennan,the supreme court held that finding a prison official liable for violating a prisoner eighth amendment rights requires proof that the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,d.he must be both aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and draw the inference.id.to survive a summary judgment motion on this issue,the natales must point to some evidence beyond their raw claim that phs employees w ere deliberately indifferent,or put another way,some evidence that phs employees knew or w ere aware of the risk to natale.singletary,at.
in situations involving claims for inadequate medical care,we have found deliberate indifference in situations where there was objective evidence that a plaintiff had serious need for medical care,and prison officials ignored that evidence.nicini,at.we have also found deliberate indifference in situations where necessary medical treatment is delayed for reasons.monmouth county corr.inst.inmates lanzaro,cir citing ancata prison health,cir.
sufficient evidence exists in the record that phs employees were deliberately indifferent to natale serious medical needs to survive a summary judgment motion.first,as in nicini,prison officials ignored the evidence of his need for insulin.natale testified that he informed a phs employee that he was an diabetic,a phs employee noted this fact on his chart,and he had a note from a physician indicating that he must have insulin.a reasonable jury could conclude that phs employees knew that natale was an diabetic and that if insulin was not administered as required,he would suffer adverse health consequences.in addition,there is evidence that,as in monmouth county,phs employees delayed medical treatment for phs policy that failed to address the immediate medication needs of inmates with serious medical conditions.nurse lynda sanferraro,a phs employee,testified that phs policy was that a doctor would see inmates within hours,but that there was no practice in place to accommodate inmates with more immediate medication needs a reasonable jury could find that such a practice constituted the delay of medical treatment for reasons.the natales have,therefore,provided sufficient evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment on the question of whether phs employees violated daniel natale fourteenth amendment right to adequate health care while detained.
liability of phs for its employees violations of natale constitutional right 
what remains to be determined is whether,for purposes,the actions of phs employees can be attributed to phs itself phs can not be held responsible for the acts of its employees under a theory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability see monell new york city of soc,d.in order for phs to be liable,the natales must provide evidence that there was a relevant phs policy or custom,and that the policy caused the constitutional violation they allege.see bd.of county comm rs of bryan county,oklahoma brown,d.
not all state action rises to the level of a custom or policy.a policy is made when a decisionmaker possess ing final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action issues a final proclamation,policy or edict.kneipp tedder,cir quoting pembaur city of cincinnati,d plurality opinion.a custom is an act that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker,but that is so widespread as to have the force of law.bryan county,at.
there are three situations where acts of a government employee may be deemed to be the result o
