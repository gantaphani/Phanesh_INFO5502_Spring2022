marc mezibov mezibov appeals the district court dismissal,pursuant to fed.civ.b,of his claim of retaliation against hamilton county prosecutor michael allen allen.mezibov,a criminal defense attorney,claims that allen uttered defamatory comments about mezibov in retaliation for mezibov pursuing his first amendment right to fil e motions and rais e legitimate defenses on behalf of his clients in the courtroom.because the activity that mezibov claims subjected him to retaliation is not a constitutionally protected activity,and because,even if it were,a criminal defense attorney of ordinary firmness would not have been chilled from engaging in that activity as a consequence of allen adverse action,we affirm the district court dismissal of mezibov claim.
background 
mezibov is an attorney licensed to practice in the state of ohio.he served as defense counsel for jonathan tobias during tobias criminal trial in hamilton county,ohio,on counts of abuse of a corpse.allen was the hamilton county prosecutor during tobias prosecution.in the course of representing tobias,mezibov filed three motions seeking to dismiss the indictment and disqualify allen on the basis that he had engaged in improper conduct.the trial court denied the motions,and on october,a jury convicted tobias of two of the counts of abuse of a corpse.
mezibov alleges that immediately following the jury verdict,allen released a statement to the local media which said the following 
obviously,this mezibov is a man who does try too many cases and the verdict shows that.if i were tobias,i would ask for my money back real criminal defense attorneys,lawyers who try cases every day,do do that.they do throw mud obviously it backfired in their face.
mezibov further alleges that later that month,on october,allen appeared on a local television show known as hot seat and made the following comments 
mezibov wanted to make it a show trial where he could attack me,he could attack parrott,but frankly it blew up in his face and now his client,because of mezibov conduct,faces two years in prison and the loss of his medical license.you know,in consumer law we have a saying let the buyer beware.i think in law,you ought to have a saying,let the client beware had tobias approached us early on about cooperating with the prosecution and working for us in a conviction of condon,that something that in all likelihood we would have entertained.but,his lawyer,marc mezibov,chose not to do that.and it makes you wonder,here a man that now is going to lose his medical license,faces two years in jail,who may very well have been able to work with us and escape prosecution.it makes you wonder about the tactics of defense counsel and their intentions quite frankly and when my ethics are questioned and when i called unethical,you gon na get it back and you gon na get it back with both barrels because i have to.i ca permit that to happen.real defense lawyers,the scott croswells of the world,the merle shiverdeckers,they try cases on the facts of the case.they try cases from the testimony that comes from the witness stand and the law that is given from the judge.i think mezibov,what he wanted to do,he wanted his show trial.he wanted to be able to attack me,he wanted to be able to attack parrott,and he wanted to be able to attack the republican party i have to say had this matter been handled in the normal fashion by a defense lawyer who was interested in his client best interest rather than having a political show trial,tobias very well could have fared a lot better than he did.
in july,mezibov filed this action,alleging that allen made defamatory comments under color of state law,in an effort to retaliate against mezibov for filing motions and raising legitimate defenses in his capacity as defense counsel in the criminal proceedings initiated and prosecuted by defendant allen against tobias.in other words,mezibov claims he was being retaliated against for exercising his first amendment right to protect his client sixth amendment and other constitutional rights.mezibov further alleges that as a result of allen comments he has suffered damage to his professional reputation and emotional anguish and distress entitling him to compensation.
the district court dismissed mezibov complaint pursuant to fed.civ.b,holding that in filing motions and vigorously defending his client in court,mezibov was not engaged in a constitutionally protected activity.the district court noted that although mezibov claims his activities are protected under the first amendment,they are simply discrete functions of the practice of law,which is not a privilege or immunity protected by the constitution.since mezibov failed to allege that he was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity,the court reasoned that he did not properly state a claim for relief under,and granted allen motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.

ii.retaliation under 
to survive a motion to dismiss a claim under,the plaintiff must properly allege two elements the defendant was acting under color of state law,and the offending conduct deprived the plaintiff of rights secured under federal law.bloch ribar,cir.as to the first element,by alleging that allen,in his role as prosecutor,made defamatory statements to the media concerning a trial that his office prosecuted,mezibov has sufficiently alleged that allen was acting under color of state law for purposes of.see id.at holding that a county sheriff acted under color of state law when he issued press releases concerning matters of official business in which he was involved.
with regard to the second element of a claim,when the alleged violation of federal law is that a government official retaliated against a plaintiff for exercising his constitutional rights,as in this case,the plaintiff must ultimately prove three the plaintiff engaged in constitutionally protected conduct an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff protected conduct.blatter,cir en banc.the district court dismissed mezibov claim under the first of these by determining that his filing motions and defending his client in court were not activities protected under the first amendment.we agree.
protected interest 
whether an attorney can claim first amendment protection on his own behalf for his filing motions and making courtroom statements on behalf of his client is a question of first impression in this circuit.while the supreme court has not squarely addressed this question,it has noted,in dicta,that i t is unquestionable that in the courtroom itself,during a judicial proceeding,whatever right to free speech an attorney has is extremely circumscribed.gentile state bar of nevada,d.furthermore,it appears that no circuit court has ever actually granted an attorney relief under the first amendment for this narrow category of speech.
it is not surprising that courts have thus far been reluctant to allow the first amendment to intrude into the courtroom.at first blush,the courtroom seems like the quintessential arena for public debate,but upon closer analysis,it is clear this is not,and never has been,an arena for free debate.zal steppe,cir trott,concurring see berner delahanty,cir characterizing the courtroom as a nonpublic forum for purposes of first amendment analysis.an attorney speech in court and in motion papers has always been tightly cabined by various procedural and evidentiary rules,along with the heavy hand of judicial discretion.in fact,judges regularly fine attorneys,and even throw them in jail from time to time,as a direct consequence of attorneys speech,and it appears no circuit court has ever found this to violate the first amendment when an attorney believes that the trial court improperly applied the law or relevant rules in preventing him from presenting information to the judge or jury,his sole remedy traditionally has been to appeal the judge application of the particular rule of exclusion,rather than to claim first amendment protection.see gentile,at.moreover,any such challenge is almost always grounded in the rights of the client,rather than any independent rights of the attorney.see zal,at trott,concurring in the courtroom,during a judicial proceeding,an attorney first amendment rights depend exclusively on his client trial rights.see also legal services corporation velazquez,d upholding first amendment challenge by indigent clients to government funding regime that prevented their attorneys from presenting to a court on the clients behalf certain arguments against the validity of welfare laws.
mezibov reminds us that attorneys and other trial participants do not lose their constitutional rights at the courthouse door.levine united states dist.court for the cent.dist.of,cir.this grandiose statement is of little help,however,when it comes to analysis under the first amendment,where rights have always depended largely upon the nature of the forum.the courtroom is a nonpublic forum,berner,at,where the first amendment rights of everyone attorneys included are at their constitutional nadir.in fact,the courtroom is unique even among nonpublic fora because within its confines we regularly countenance the application of even restrictions on speech.see,zal,upholding against first amendment challenge attorney contempt citations for attempting to present excluded defenses to the jury and for using words forbidden by the judge,such as abortion,fetus,and rights of the unborn,cert.denied,d fed.evid.b banning attorney from arguing that other crimes,wrongs,or acts are relevant to determining a person action in the instant case fed.civ.granting district court the authority to sanction attorney for advancing a point of view it deems to be frivolous fed.app,granting appellate court the authority to deny oral argument,and even award damages to appellee,if it deems appellant point of view to be frivolous.compare fed.evid.a banning attorney from arguing in a sexual misconduct case that an alleged victim other sexual behavior is relevant to the issue of consent in the instant case with fed.evid.a expressly allowing attorney to argue in a sexual misconduct criminal case that defendant prior commission of sexual assault is relevant to whether he behaved similarly in the instant case.
furthermore,in its equating attorneys with other trial participants,the quoted proclamation from levine highlights an important flaw in mezibov argument.we can not believe and have come across no authority to suggest that other trial participants,with the possible exception of an actual party to the case possess any first amendment right to speak up or otherwise present a point of view in the courtroom.we can conceive of no such right for jurors,court reporters,bailiffs,or spectators to interrupt a judicial proceeding with their questions or musings.therefore,in finding no first amendment rights on the part of the attorney participating in a judicial proceeding,we are simply the commonsense principle that attorneys do not possess any right in the first amendment that is not the common legacy of every citizen.bar,baker.in fact,the supreme court has gone even further,declaring that there are times when an attorney first amendment rights are less than those of the common citizen.see gentile,at.
moreover,an attorney job in the courtroom,although it necessarily includes speech,is fundamentally inconsistent with the basic concept of free speech.as an initial matter,that the attorney has any permission to speak in a judicial proceeding is entirely dependent upon his representation of a client absent that client,the attorney is completely silenced.but even once the attorney has his client,his advocacy in the courtroom and in filings can not honestly be characterized as free speech.as noted above,myriad procedural and evidentiary rules,along with a liberal allowance for judicial discretion,operate to severely limit what an attorney can say in the courtroom.but more fundamentally,by choosing to represent a client in court,the attorney assumes a role that is in absolute conflict with his exercising free speech.for example,the attorney is bound by this voluntary relationship to make arguments only to the benefit of his client,regardless of what the attorney himself might like to say.see ohio code of prof l responsibility ec requiring attorney to always act in a manner consistent with the best interests of his client ohio code of prof l responsibility ec declaring that t he expression by a lawyer of his personal opinion is not a proper subject for argument to the trier of fact.in addition,an attorney is ethically bound to make reasonable arguments on behalf of his client,even if the attorney disagrees with them.see ohio code of prof l responsibility ec allowing attorney to urge any permissible construction of the law favorable to his client,without regard to his professional opinion as to the likelihood that the construction will ultimately prevail ohio code of prof l responsibility dr requiring attorney to,within the bounds of his professional judgment,seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the disciplinary rules.therefore,because an attorney,by the very nature of his job,voluntarily agrees to relinquish his rights to free expression in the judicial proceeding,we see no basis for concluding that his free speech rights are violated by a restriction on that expression 
mezibov cites legal services corporation velazquez,d,for the proposition that an attorney has a first amendment right to advocate on behalf of his client in court.the supreme court in velazquez upheld a first amendment challenge by indigent clients to a congressional statute allocating federal funds to local organizations for the purpose of providing legal representation to poor people in proceedings,but with a condition prohibiting legal representation involv ing an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law.id.at.the court interpreted this condition as prevent ing an attorney from arguing to a court that a state statute conflicts with a federal statute or that either a state or federal statute violates the constitution.id.at.the court characterized the congressional funding scheme as a limited public forum,and thus found its condition constitutionally impermissible.
although it is mezibov most helpful authority for his view that an attorney has a first amendment right to advocate in court,velazquez is actually quite different from the case at bar.first,velazquez was a challenge by the legal services corporation and its indigent clients seeking to vindicate the clients own first amendment interests in having their arguments heard in court nowhere does velazquez recognize a first amendment right personal to the attorney independent of his client,as mezibov seeks here.second,velazquez involved a regulation akin to a prior restraint,the clients arguments were entirely excluded from the courtroom before the clients had a chance even to advance them,among the most noxious of affronts to the first amendment.see southeastern promotions,conrad,d any system of prior restraint comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.see also velazquez,at.mezibov,however,presented his arguments fully before being subjected to the alleged retaliation.third,the regulation at issue in velazquez forbade both argument by the attorney and consultation between attorney and client regarding the restricted issues,velazquez,at.the alleged retaliation in the instant case relates only to the narrower category of attorney speech in the context of a judicial proceeding.fourth,velazquez involved the complicating twist of a government funding program that the court deemed a limited public forum for first amendment purposes,id.at.the instant case involves only speech in the courtroom,which as a nonpublic forum is less conducive to free speech rights.see berner,at.for these reasons it can not be said that velazquez recognizes an attorney first amendment rights independent of his client in the context of a judicial proceeding 
we think the district court was correct in its basic conclusion in filing motions and advocating for his client in court,mezibov was not engaged in free expression he was simply doing his job.in that narrow capacity,he voluntarily accepted almost unconditional restraints on his personal speech rights,since his sole raison was to vindicate his client rights.for these reasons,we hold that in the context of the courtroom proceedings,an attorney retains no personal first amendment rights when representing his client in those proceedings.therefore,mezibov has failed to allege that he was engaged in constitutionally protected conduct as the precipitating factor for his alleged retaliation,and his claim under was properly dismissed.
adverse action 
even if we were not convinced that mezibov advocacy is not protected under the first amendment,we would affirm the dismissal of his claim due to his failure to allege that he suffered an adverse action that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the constitutionally protected conduct.blatter,cir en banc.as an initial matter,pursuant to this court en banc decision in,we are required to tailor our analysis under the adverse action prong to the circumstances of this specific retaliation claim.id.at requiring specific tailoring and noting that p risoners may be required to tolerate more than public employees,who may be required to tolerate more than average citizens,before an action taken against them is considered adverse.thus,the appropriate formulation of the adverse action prong in mezibov case is whether the alleged defamation would deter a criminal defense attorney of ordinary firmness from continuing to file motions and vigorously defend his client.see mattox city of forest park,cir formulating test under adverse action prong for elected city council member as whether a public official of ordinary firmness would be deterred from exercising her first amendment rights.
we recognize that in a retaliation case,since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights the effect on freedom of speech need not be great in order to be actionable,at quoting bart telford,cir.nevertheless,since is a tort statute,we must be careful to ensure that real injury is involved,lest we trivialize the first amendment by sanctioning a retaliation claim even if it is unlikely that the exercise of first amendment rights was actually deterred.id.quoting bart,at.
in mattox city of forest park,cir,we addressed first amendment retaliation claims on behalf of an elected city council member and a former firefighter who initiated an investigation of the fire department.the city council member,mattox,claimed that defendants,in retaliation for her speech on matters of public concern,released embarrassing information about her that contributed to her losing the next election.we noted that as an elected public official,mattox voluntarily opened herself to criticism of her actions and political stances,but that discrediting her in retaliation for her exercise of first amendment rights was inappropriate and unfortunate.id.at.nonetheless,we emphasized that she was merely her views,and that p ublic officials may need to have thicker skin than the ordinary citizen,and thus found that mattox alleged injury did not meet the adverse action requirement for retaliation.id.
the firefighter,holly,alleged that defendants released information regarding a traumatic childhood incident and her personal relationships with members of the fire department in retaliation for her first amendment activities.we noted that since holly embarrassing personal statements were irrelevant to the investigation,making them public in retaliation for her first amendment activities would be improper.id.at.nevertheless,we held that despite any such retaliatory intent,holly allegations did not satisfy the adverse action prong.in so doing we emphasized that holly was merely claiming a generalized harm to her character and reputation,that n owhere does she attempt to concretize her personal injury,and that w ithout anything more specific,holly allegations do not meet the constitutional threshold for first amendment retaliation.id.
for purposes of adverse action analysis,mezibov is a hybrid of the two plaintiffs in mattox.like mattox,mezibov,as an attorney taking on a high profile case,voluntarily placed himself open to criticism of his actions.see id.at.as such,mezibov must have a thicker skin than the ordinary citizen when it comes to enduring criticism for his behavior,even if it is protected speech under the first amendment.see id.and like holly,mezibov has failed to allege a specific or concret e personal injury.see id.at.he merely claims damage to his professional reputation and emotional anguish and distress,the very same kind of harms we found insufficient in mattox.see id.
furthermore,in analyzing the extent of the adverse action alleged by mezibov,we must be careful to take into account only those comments made by allen that could reasonably be construed as defamatory,lest we trample on the first amendment rights that allen retains as a government official.see mcbride village of michiana,cir cautioning in a retaliation case that t he proper exercise by government officials of their own free speech rights can not serve as the basis for imposition of liability upon those individuals.in the instant case,mezibov filed public motions with the court accusing allen of unethical conduct.it would be inconsistent with core first amendment principles and basic notions of fairness not to allow allen to respond to these allegations to the extent his comments were not defamatory,even if that response was quite naturally prompted by constitutionally protected speech by mezibov.
with all that in mind,we are not persuaded that a criminal defense attorney of ordinary firmness would be deterred from vigorously defending his clients as a consequence of the alleged defamation in this case.first,as an attorney in a highly publicized case,mezibov must be expected to endure some scrutiny for his actions.second,any harm to mezibov as a result of allen speech is too minimal to be constitutionally cognizable.mezibov alleges no specific a generalized harm to his character and reputation.see mattox,at noting that while in some cases embarrassment,humiliation,and emotional distress are actionable under,such harm is not equivalent to being fired or suspended from one job.furthermore,the substance of allen comments was basically that mezibov is a bad attorney,that he is inexperienced,and that he was putting his own interests before those of his client.to the extent these comments are not constitutionally protected in their own right,we do not think they exact a harm upon mezibov that would deter an ordinary criminal defense attorney from vigorously representing his clients.if anything,we think the opposite that such comments would spur the typical attorney to go out of his way to prove them wrong.in fact,that appears to be just what happened in mezibov case.after allen made his comments,mezibov was successful in getting his client conviction reversed on appeal.see state tobias,no,wl ohio.may.therefore,mezibov has not alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the adverse action prong for a retaliation claim.
conclusion 
in filing motions and vigorously defending his client in a judicial proceeding,mezibov was not engaged in speech protected by the first amendment thus,he has failed to allege the protected interest necessary to succeed on his retaliation claim.furthermore,the defamation mezibov alleges does not constitute an adverse action sufficient to deter a criminal defense attorney
