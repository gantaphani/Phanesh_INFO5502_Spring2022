opinion of the court 
gloria santiago appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissing her claims under against warminster township warminster or the township and three of its senior police officers,including the police chief.santiago claims that she suffered a heart attack after being subjected to excessive force during a raid on her home.her claims against the officers who conducted the raid were earlier dismissed as untimely,and she has not appealed that order.we thus consider only her claims against the three senior officers,who she alleges planned or acquiesced in the use of excessive force,and against the township,which she alleges is liable for the police chief plan because he is a final policymaker for the township.
we conclude that,under the pleading standard set forth by the supreme court in bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,santiago has failed to plead sufficient factual matter to give rise to a plausible claim for relief against the senior police officers.her claim against warminster also must fail because santiago has failed to plausibly plead that the police chief conduct caused her any injury.accordingly,we will affirm.
warminster conducts the surround and call out operation 
on the morning of may,warminster conducted a surround and call out operation at the home of santiago,a resident of warminster.the purpose of the operation was to apprehend steve miranda,one of santiago grandsons the operation was carried out by the members of alpha team,a unit of the central bucks special response team cbsrt.the cbsrt is a police agency consisting of officers representing eighteen municipalities,including warminster.the members of alpha team were detective wayne jones and officers jon ogborn,frederick kutzer,and tim murphy.while only officer kutzer was employed directly by warminster,all outside personnel and equipment were placed under the temporary control of warminster for purposes of the may operation.
at the commencement of the operation,the occupants of santiago home were awakened by police using a public address system.santiago and her daughter,gloria cotte,looked through a window to see an armored vehicle and officers wearing combat uniforms and carrying automatic weapons.upon seeing cotte looking through the window,one of the officers asked her who else was in the house,to which she responded just my family this is the santiago family.third am.compl.at.the officer then ordered everyone to exit the house one at a time.
santiago was the first to come out and was commanded,at gun point,to raise her hands and walk toward the officers.when she did not raise her hands as high as an officer wanted,she was ordered to raise them higher or else be shot.when santiago reached the officers,officer ogborn conducted a pat down search,which revealed no weapons but,humiliating though it was for santiago,included touching her breasts and crotch.he then restrained her hands behind her back with a plastic and seated her on the ground next to the police vehicle.santiago was frightened and complained of chest pain.
after santiago left the house,she was followed by steve miranda and jonathan miranda her two grandsons,herminia miranda her granddaughter,and cotte her daughter.her two grandsons were patted down,handcuffed,and seated on the ground near santiago.her daughter and granddaughter were patted down but not handcuffed or seated.
even after the police had arrested steve only occupant for whom they had a remained seated and restrained.the officers instructed her and cotte to sign a consent form allowing a search of the home.santiago,who speaks no english and can not read or write,did not sign and,of course,could not have unless they unbound her hands.cotte,who later said she felt coerced,did sign.
santiago sat with her hands tied for approximately thirty minutes as her home was searched.throughout that time,she was unable to interfere,was not a flight risk,and presented no danger.she continued to complain of pain and eventually told jonathan miranda that she felt pain in her heart.jonathan miranda told the officers that his grandmother was having a heart attack,and an ambulance was summoned to take her to the hospital.
santiago complaints are filed and dismissed 
on,day before the expiration of the statute of filed her initial complaint in the district court,citing constitutional violations and state law tort claims and naming warminster,warminster police department,john doe police officers,and cbsrt as defendants.for reasons not pertinent here,the bulk of that complaint was dismissed,including all counts against the warminster police department because it was not a separate legal entity from warminster and cbsrt for insufficient service of process,and,after a series of amended complaints and further dismissals,the operative pleading left in the case is santiago third amended complaint.that complaint is framed in two counts a and claim against warminster and the individual defendants for violation of the fourth amendment and state law claims against the individual defendants for assault,battery,false arrest,false imprisonment,and harm resulting from a state created danger.unlike earlier versions of the complaint,the third amended complaint replaced john does with the names of the officers on the scene,identifying detective jones and officers ogborn,kutzer,and murphy.the third amended complaint also added,for the first time,allegations against three warminster police officers claimed to have been involved in planning and supervising the operation chief of police michael murphy,lieutenant christopher springfield,and lieutenant james donnelly,iii collectively,the supervising officers.
the entirety of the allegations against the supervising officers were contained in three paragraphs 
chief michael murphy is police chief of warminster township police department.chief murphy is a founding member and director of the cbsrt.although chief murphy was not present at the scene on may,he ordered and approved the plan to execute the arrest warrants.this early morning surround and call out operation specifically sought to have all occupants exit the plaintiff home,one at a time,with hands raised under threat of fire,patted down for weapons,and then handcuffed until the home had been cleared and searched.chief murphy violated plaintiff fourth amendment rights in that this plan used excessive force in restraining plaintiff,a occupant who presented no threat or risk,for a lengthy period of time and used coercion in obtaining her consent to search the premises.
christopher springfield was a police officer with warminster township police department.on may,he held the rank of lieutenant and was in sic placed in charge of the surround and call out operation by chief murphy.springfield was responsible for all assets including the cbsrt and warminster township police officers.springfield violated plaintiff fourth amendment rights in that he permitted the use of excessive force in restraining plaintiff,a occupant who presented no threat or risk,for a lengthy period of time and used coercion in obtaining her consent to search the premises.
james donnelly is an officer with the warminster township police department.on may,he was also the tactical team leader of cbsrt.chief murphy ordered donnelly to plan and help execute an early morning surround and call out operation which sought to have all occupants exit the plaintiff home,one at a time,with hands raised under threat of fire,patted down for weapons,and then handcuffed until the home had been cleared and searched.donnelly violated plaintiff fourth amendment rights in that this plan used excessive force in restraining plaintiff,a occupant who presented no threat or risk,for a lengthy period of time,and used coercion in obtaining her consent to search the premises.as tactical team leader of cbsrt,donnelly was responsible for the actions of alpha team.
third am.compl.at.
both warminster and the individual defendants moved to dismiss and on december,the district court issued an opinion granting the motion.first,the court dismissed the claims against the officers of alpha team as barred by the statute of limitations next,the court dismissed the fourth amendment claims against the supervising officers because it held that santiago had alleged only respondeat superior liability as to them but that government officials can not be liable for constitutional violations on that basis.the court then dismissed the claim against warminster because santiago had not alleged that chief murphy was a final policymaker,which is a necessary element of the claim santiago attempted to assert against the township.finally,because it had dismissed all of santiago federal claims,the court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims and dismissed them,without prejudice.santiago timely appeal to us followed.
on appeal,santiago argues that the district court erred by dismissing the claims against the supervising officers and warminster.our review of the district court decision to grant the motions to dismiss is plenary.fowler upmc shadyside,cir.we take as true all the factual allegations of the third amended complaint and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them,sheridan ngk metals,but we disregard legal conclusions and recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements.iqbal.at.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.sheridan,at quoting iqbal.at.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.
santiago claims against the supervising officers 
we address first the dismissal of santiago claims against the supervising officers.the district court dismissed those claims because it held that santiago had not pled any basis of liability in the supervising officers own acts but,instead,had alleged only a theory of respondeat superior liability,which can not serve as the basis of a claim for constitutional violations.see iqbal.at government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior.while we conclude that the third amended complaint can be read as alleging liability based on the supervising officers own acts,we will nevertheless affirm the district court ruling because those allegations fail to meet the pleading requirements set forth by the supreme court in twombly and iqbal.
the nature of santiago claims 
liability based on respondeat superior arises solely on the basis of the existence of an relationship,regardless of whether the employer had any part in causing harm.monell dep t of soc.servs.of new york.contrary to the district court view,that is not the theory santiago advances.instead,santiago allegations appear to invoke a theory of liability under which a supervisor may be personally liable if he or she participated in violating the plaintiff rights,directed others to violate them,or,as the person in charge,had knowledge of and acquiesced in his subordinates violations.ex rel.luzerne cnty.juvenile,cir.specifically,santiago alleges that chief murphy and donnelly developed a plan that sought to have all occupants exit the plaintiff home,one at a time,with hands raised under threat of fire,patted down for weapons,and then handcuffed until the home had been cleared and searched.third am.compl.at.the claim is thus that,through the creation and authorization of the plan,chief murphy and donnelly directed others to violate santiago rights,at.the related allegation that springfield,as the person in charge of the operation,permitted the use of excessive force appears to be a claim that springfield acquiesced in his subordinates violations,at.consequently,although the third amended complaint seeks a species of supervisory liability,it is not respondeat superior liability.
the sufficiency of santiago pleadings 
that santiago has alleged supervisory liability claims does not mean that she has supported those allegations with sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,sheridan,at quoting iqbal.at,as is required by the seminal supreme court decisions in iqbal and twombly.to determine the sufficiency of a complaint under the pleading regime established by those cases,a court must take three steps first,the court must tak e note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim.iqbal.at second,the court should identify allegations that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.at.finally,where there are factual allegations,a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.id.
a the elements of santiago claims 
our initial task is to tak e note of the elements santiago must plead in order to state a claim of liability.see iqbal.at identifying t he factors necessary to establish a bivens violation in order to determine what the plaintiff must plead and prove.
to state a claim of supervisory liability against chief murphy and donnelly,at least of the kind that it appears santiago is advancing,she must plead that they directed others to violate her rights,at.of course,chief murphy and donnelly could only be liable if the people they supposedly directed to violate her rights actually did so otherwise,the fact that chief murphy and donnelly might have directed the use of constitutionally excessive force is quite beside the point.city of los angeles heller.thus,any claim that supervisors directed others to violate constitutional rights necessarily includes as an element an actual violation at the hands of subordinates.in addition,a plaintiff must allege a causal connection between the supervisor direction and that violation,or,in other words,proximate causation.
proximate causation is established where the supervisor gave directions that the supervisor knew or should reasonably have known would cause others to deprive the plaintiff of her constitutional rights.conner reinhard,cir see also snell tunnell,cir.particularly after iqbal,the connection between the supervisor directions and the constitutional deprivation must be sufficient to demonstrate a plausible nexus or affirmative link between the directions and the specific deprivation of constitutional rights at issue.hedges musco,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,to state her claim against chief murphy and donnelly,santiago needs to have pled facts plausibly demonstrating that they directed alpha team to conduct the operation in a manner that they knew or should reasonably have known would cause alpha team to deprive santiago of her constitutional rights.conner,at.
as to her claim against springfield,santiago must allege facts making it plausible that he had knowledge of alpha team use of excessive force during the raid and acquiesced in alpha team violations,at.
b the allegations that are not entitled to the assumption of truth 
having identified the elements of santiago claims,iqbal directs that the next step is to identify allegations that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.iqbal.at.in other words,we must accept all of the complaint facts as true,but may disregard any legal conclusions.fowler,at.we also disregard naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement and threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements.iqbal.at.
santiago alleges that the plan developed and authorized by chief murphy and donnelly specifically sought to have all occupants exit the plaintiff home,one at a time,with hands raised under threat of fire,patted down for weapons,and then handcuffed until the home had been cleared and searched.because this is nothing more than a recitation of what santiago says the alpha team members did to her,it amounts to a conclusory assertion that what happened at the scene was ordered by the supervisors.while the allegations regarding alpha team conduct are factual and more than merely the recitation of the elements of a cause of action,the allegation of supervisory liability is,in essence,that murphy and donnelly told alpha team to do what they did and is thus a formulaic recitation of the elements of a supervisory liability claim,iqbal.at internal quotation marks omitted namely that chief murphy and donnelly directed others in the violation of santiago rights.saying that chief murphy and donnelly specifically sought to have happen what allegedly happened does not alter the fundamentally conclusory character of the allegation 
our conclusion in this regard is dictated by the supreme court decision in iqbal.the plaintiff claim in that case required proving that the defendants,attorney general john ashcroft and fbi director robert mueller,had adopted a policy because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.at.the court disregarded allegations that petitioners knew of,condoned,and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject respondent to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy,solely on account of his religion,race,national origin and that ashcroft was the principal architect of this invidious policy,and that mueller was instrumental in adopting and executing it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court called those allegations nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a constitutional discrimination claim.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court emphasized that the claims required dismissal not because they were fanciful,but because they were conclusory.id.likewise,in this case where santiago is required to prove that the supervising officers directed others to use excessive force,an allegation that the plan specifically sought that use of force is nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a supervisory liability claim and hence is not entitled to the assumption of truth.the same is true for santiago allegation that springfield permitted the use of excessive force,which is nothing more than a conclusory statement that he acquiesced in his subordinates violations.
in short,santiago allegations are naked assertion s that chief murphy and donnelly directed alpha team to conduct the operation in the allegedly excessive manner that they did and that springfield acquiesced in alpha team acts.as mere restatements of the elements of her supervisory liability claims,they are not entitled to the assumption of truth.however,it is crucial to recognize that our determination that these particular allegations do not deserve an assumption of truth does not end the analysis.it may still be that santiago supervisory liability claims are plausible in light of the factual allegations in the complaint.we therefore turn to those allegations to determine whether the claims are plausible.
c the plausibility of santiago claims 
a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal.at.other than the conclusory allegations just discussed,the remaining allegations regarding the supervising officers are as follows 
chief michael murphy is police chief of warminster township police department.chief murphy is a founding member and director of the cbsrt.although chief murphy was not present at the scene on may,he ordered and approved the plan to execute the arrest warrants 
christopher springfield was a police officer with warminster township police department.on may,he held the rank of lieutenant and was in placed in sic charge of the surround and call out operation by chief murphy.springfield was responsible for all assets including the cbsrt and warminster township police officers 
james donnelly is an officer with the warminster township police department.on may,he was also the tactical team leader of cbsrt.chief murphy ordered donnelly to plan and help execute an early morning surround and call out operation as tactical team leader of cbsrt,donnelly was responsible for the actions of alpha team 
third am.compl.at.
for purposes of analyzing the motions to dismiss,we take those factual allegations as true and also accept as accurate the factual allegations regarding alpha team execution of the operation.in summary,the allegations against alpha team are that the officers ordered everyone to exit the house one at a time that santiago exited first under threat of fire that santiago was patted down in a demeaning fashion,found to be unarmed,and subsequently handcuffed that the remaining occupants of the home then exited,some of whom were handcuffed while others were not that santiago daughter was coerced into consenting to a search of the home and that santiago was left restrained for thirty minutes while her home was searched,during which time she had a heart attack.
the question then becomes whether those allegations make it plausible that chief murphy and donnelly directed alpha team to conduct the operation in a manner that they knew or should reasonably have known would cause alpha team to deprive santiago of her constitutional rights,conner,at,or that springfield had knowledge that alpha team was using excessive force during the raid and acquiesced in alpha team violations,at.
the plausibility of the claims against chief murphy and donnelly 
first,with respect to chief murphy and donnelly,we consider whether the fact that they planned the operation coupled with the fact that the operation resulted in excessive force against santiago makes it plausible that the plan called for the use of excessive force.we conclude that it does not.santiago has only alleged that excessive force was used against her.the complaint does not allege that any other occupant was threatened with fire.it specifically states that the other women were not handcuffed.it does allege that the two grandsons were handcuffed,but one of them was the subject of the arrest warrant and there are no allegations stating whether the other was found to be armed or a risk of flight.consequently,there is no basis in the complaint to conclude that excessive force was used on anyone except santiago.even if someone else had been subjected to excessive force,it is clear that the occupants were not being treated uniformly.thus,santiago allegations undercut the notion of a plan for all occupants to be threatened with fire and handcuffed.while it is possible that there was such a plan,and that alpha team simply chose not to follow it,possibility is no longer the touchstone for pleading sufficiency after twombly and iqbal.plausibility is what matters.allegations that are merely consistent with a defendant liability or show the mere possibility of misconduct are not enough.iqbal.at internal quotation marks omitted.here,given the disparate treatment of the occupants of the home,one plausible explanation is that the officers simply used their own discretion in determining how to treat each occupant.in contrast with that obvious alternative explanation for the allegedly excessive use of force,the inference that the force was planned is not plausible.id.at quoting twombly,at.
where,as here,an operation results in the use of allegedly excessive force against only one of several people,that use of force does not,by itself,give rise to a plausible claim for supervisory liability against those who planned the operation.to hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff to pursue a supervisory liability claim anytime a planned operation resulted in excessive force,merely by describing the force used and appending the phrase and the chief told them to do it.iqbal requires more.
the plausibility of the claim against springfield 
we next ask whether the allegation that springfield was placed in charge of the operation,coupled with what happened during the operation,makes it plausible that springfield knew of and acquiesced in the use of excessive force against santiago.again,we conclude that it does not.the complaint implies but does not allege that springfield was present during the operation.assuming he was present,however,the complaint still does not aver that he k
