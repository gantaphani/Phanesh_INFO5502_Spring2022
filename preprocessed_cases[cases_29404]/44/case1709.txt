facts and procedure mutiny aboard meaux 
meaux is in the maritime sandblasting and painting business.it is a texas corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of muehlhan ag muehlhan,based in germany,which acquired meaux in.mike fogleman was a project manager for meaux at that time he took the helm as meaux president in late.charlie kotrla was an operations manager for meaux.both are louisiana citizens.in december,fogleman and kotrla resigned and,via their jointly owned venture cleanblast,llc,began competing with meaux when fogleman and kotrla left,many of meaux work crews and clients soon sailed with the tide,defecting to cleanblast.smelling a rat,meaux sued defendants in texas state court in early,contending that fogleman and kotrla had surreptitiously and unlawfully poached employees and clients while working for meaux.defendants removed the case to federal court.meaux petition,which remained the operative pleading,alleged,inter alia,that its loss of business due to defendants actions was significant.
the district court entered a scheduling order on september,which set a deadline of january,for amended pleadings.meaux did not file an amended complaint.per the court scheduling order,the parties filed a joint pretrial order on october.meaux statement of the case relayed the thrust of the facts recounted above,but did not indicate what remedies meaux sought.along with the pretrial order,the parties filed proposed jury instructions and witness lists.meaux submission included a jury instruction and interrogatory for lost profits,past and future,caused by defendants actions.in a simultaneously filed witness list,meaux designated muehlhan chief financial officer,carsten ennemann,as a witness familiar with the financial damages sustained by meaux.
a final pretrial conference was set for february.the parties would embark on jury selection and trial the next day.on february,defendants filed a brief in opposition to meaux requested jury instructions for lost profits.defendants asserted that meaux failure to state that it sought lost profits in the body of the pretrial order meant such claim was waived.at the pretrial conference on february,the district court indicated that it would allow meaux to amend the pretrial order to conform its claims to those presented in its pleadings.the court preliminarily stated that it would not allow meaux to insert claims which had not heretofore been raised.the court reserved ruling pending further briefing.meaux filed a brief asserting that,under rockwell international united states,d,it could raise lost profits for the first time in the pretrial order.defendants disagreed and filed a motion to dismiss meaux claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.
the following day,february,the court tentatively stated that it would allow amendment of the pretrial order,but only to conform to the pleadings.on the second day of trial,february,after considering additional arguments and authorities,the court charted a new course.it first noted that meaux original petition had asserted that defendants tortious acts caused meaux to suffer lost revenues and actual damages.moreover,defendants filed pretrial motions concerning lost profits,including a motion to compel production of documents pertinent to lost profits and a summary judgment motion challenging meaux evidence of damages.the court pointed out that defendants at no time asserted that meaux failed to plead lost profits with sufficient specificity to satisfy federal notice pleading standards.moreover,the court own procedures manual indicated that counsel shall submit as part of the final joint pretrial order proposed jury instructions.meaux had included lost profits instructions in its proposed jury instructions.defendants did not argue that this was insufficient under the local rules until just before trial.the court reasoned given the foregoing,it can not be said that the defendants were totally unaware of or surprised by the plaintiff claim for lost profits submitted in the proposed jury instruction or unprepared to litigate this issue at trial.the court further found that modification of the pretrial order to include lost profits is warranted to prevent substantial injustice.thus,the court held that lost profits could be submitted to the jury.
at trial,meaux called ennemann to testify about lost profits for fiscal year.defendants objected that ennemann lacked personal knowledge regarding the operations and profits of meaux business,and that meaux had failed to designate him to testify about these matters.the court overruled the objection,but indicated that defense counsel could take ennemann on voir dire before the jury to challenge his familiarity with meaux operations and profitability.counsel did so.ennemann testimony revealed that accounting and budgeting data produced at meaux were regularly transmitted back to the mother ship in germany.as cfo of muehlhan,ennemann monitored meaux financials and was cognizant of factors affecting meaux profitability,such as oil prices and hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico.defense counsel also objected that at the time of his deposition,ennemann was not familiar with all relevant facts and source documents concerning meaux accounts and budgeting.he became familiar with such matters after his deposition.counsel moved to disallow ennemann testimony on the basis of unfair surprise.the court denied the motion,reasoning that defense counsel had the documents prior to the deposition and could have used the documents to demonstrate ennemann purported lack of familiarity with meaux business practices.
in sum,the court held,and explained to the jury,that ennemann was not an expert witness,but rather a corporate fact witness whom meaux would present to estimate the lost profits suffered by meaux in as a result of cleanblast efforts to corral its employees and clients.the court observed that ennemann was familiar with such matters in his capacity as cfo of muehlhan,and that a lack of specificity or detail in his familiarity with operations at meaux should affect the weight assigned to his testimony by the jury.ennemann then explained and the projected revenues and actual revenues received.the projected revenue figures came from a budget report prepared by fogleman himself prior to his departure.in total,ennemann estimated that meaux lost million in due to defendants malfeasance.at trial,fogleman stood by his budget figures as reasonable estimates of revenues.
at the close of meaux case and at the close of evidence,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the court denied.the court charged the jury,which returned a verdict in favor of meaux and awarded million in lost profits.the court entered judgment on february.defendants their motions for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.meaux moved the court to amend judgment to add pre and interest.the court denied all motions without stating reasons.this appeal followed.
ii.amendment the unknown shore 
defendants first argue that the amendments to the pretrial order allowed meaux to engage in trial by ambush.defendants insist that the absence of the precise term lost profits in the pretrial order led them to the inescapable conclusion that meaux theory of damages would not include lost profits.they contend that the amendments to the pretrial order left no time to depose additional witnesses or obtain an expert to counter meaux lost profits projections and calculations.meaux responds that it was perfectly apparent throughout discovery and pretrial litigation that it would seek lost profits.meaux notes that lost profits were mentioned in its proposed jury charge,which was filed simultaneously with,and pursuant to local rule was deemed part of,the pretrial order.moreover,defendants sought discovery on meaux lost profit claim and unsuccessfully sought summary judgment on the claim.thus,any claim of ambush is an unfathomable yarn.
two years before the amendment 
we review district court decisions regarding amendment of pretrial orders for abuse of discretion.quick,sage group plc,cir.because of the importance of the order in achieving efficacy and expeditiousness upon trial in the district court,appellate courts are hesitant to interfere with the court discretion in creating,enforcing,and modifying such orders.id.quoting flannery carroll,cir.it is axiomatic that under federal rules of civil procedure and,a final pretrial order supersede s all prior pleadings.rockwell int l,at citations omitted.after a scheduling order deadline has passed,a party must show good cause to obtain leave to amend the operative pleadings.s w,southtrust bank of alabama,na,cir citing.b.the district court discretion to allow amendment or modification of a pretrial order is guided by the following factors the explanation for the failure to timely move for leave to amend the importance of the amendment potential prejudice in allowing the amendment and the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.id.citations and internal alterations omitted.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing meaux to seek lost profits.defendants assert that the district court allowed amendment of the pretrial order because this was meaux counsel first federal trial,which is not a reasonable excuse.the court did acknowledge that it gave some leeway in light of counsel lack of experience.this explanation is far from persuasive,and weighs in defendants favor.see id.at noting that inadvertence as an explanation is tantamount to no explanation at all.however,the court remarks in this regard were minor relative to its careful sounding of other germane factors,which reveal that there was good cause to allow amendment.the court recognized that the amendment was very important to meaux case.see id.without lost profits,meaux would have no remaining theory of recovery.because disallowing the amendment would have left meaux dead in the water,the court held that modification of the pretrial order was warranted to prevent substantial injustice.this finding is watertight.
additionally,the prejudice to defendants was minor.see id.at.in the two years between filing and trial,defendants obtained discovery and filed motions concerning lost profits.meaux inclusion of lost profits instructions,which the court deemed part of the pretrial order,gave defendants a warning shot across the bow months in advance of trial that this remedy was not abandoned.it is unpersuasive for defendants to say that they believed otherwise,especially when the pretrial order and proposed jury instructions made no reference to other remedies.defendants repeatedly bewail the ambush they suffered when the district court allowed meaux case to proceed.as did the district court,we find such protestations empty and disingenuous.defendants were not waylaid by guerilla litigation tactics.being denied the ability to prevail on a technicality is not the kind of prejudice we must remedy.
finally,a continuance was impracticable because trial was imminent.the unfortunate timing was largely defendants fault.defendants could have challenged at any time that meaux request for lost profits,either in the original petition or the pretrial order,adequately met federal pleading standards and the requirements of local rules.defendants waited to do so,quite literally,until the eve of trial.as far as the district court was concerned,the ship had sailed.in light of the facts and circumstances present in this case and the solicitude we afford the district court hand on the tiller of trial management,we can not conclude that the court abused its discretion in allowing meaux to seek lost profits at trial.see quick,at.
surprise witness 
defendants also contend that they were ambushed by meaux decision to have carsten ennemann testify about lost profits,and not rene godoy,who took over as president of meaux after fogleman resignation.wrong again.whether we view the court decision to allow ennemann to testify about lost profits as a modification of the pretrial order or a ruling on the propriety of the designation of the witness,we review for abuse of discretion.see geiserman macdonald,cir.defendants contend that when they deposed ennemann,he denied having knowledge of the underlying documents meaux would rely on at trial to prove its quantum of damages.at trial,the court rejected defendants assertion that allowing ennemann to present such evidence was unfair surprise.counsel had the relevant documents prior to ennemann deposition and could have questioned him to plumb his familiarity,or lack thereof,with meaux operations and profitability.at trial,the district court allowed counsel to engage in voir dire to test ennemann knowledge.the court concluded that ennemann had personal knowledge of meaux profitability,which he garnered in his capacity as cfo of muehlhan.the foregoing conclusion is well supported in the court log.
moreover,meaux timely designated ennemann in the pretrial order as a fact or lay opinion witness.see united states valencia,cir recognizing that corporate officer who provides projections or opinions about changes in profits is not an expert witness,but rather,a lay witness under federal rule of evidence.a m research found.magna,cir same.as such,the heightened disclosure requirements for an expert witness were not implicated.a bradley united states,cir holding that district court abused its discretion in allowing expert witnesses to testify.ennemann works on the starboard side of the atlantic and does not personally observe meaux operations.he does not paint oil rigs or sandblast ships.however,as chief financial officer,he is intimately familiar with meaux financial performance.it would defy reason to say that the district court abused its discretion in allowing him to testify about such matters.finally,there was no surprise in meaux election to call ennemann to testify,and not rene godoy.meaux designated ennemann in the pretrial order as a witness familiar with the financial damages sustained by meaux.merely because godoy could have also testified about these matters as well does not mean he had to.in sum,defendants have not shown that the court abused its discretion in allowing ennemann testimony to reach the jury.
iii.treason harbour 
defendants next say they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the evidence did not establish that their breach of fiduciary duties caused meaux to suffer losses,and was too speculative to support the jury award of million.neither harpoon pierces the jury verdict.
master and usurper 
we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.hamburger state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
a motion for judgment as a matter of law in an action tried by jury is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.if reasonable persons could differ in their interpretation of the evidence,then the motion should be denied.a motion for judgment as a matter of law should only be granted when the facts and inferences point so strongly in favor of the movant that a rational jury could not reach a contrary verdict.we accord great deference to the jury verdict when evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence,viewing all the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.
