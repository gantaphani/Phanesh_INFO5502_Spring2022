opinion of the court 
a statute that regulates the contractual limitations on time for passengers to bring a lawsuit against maritime carriers,provides that carriers may not impose of less than one year.this minimum one year is tolled,however,for injured minors pursuant to c in such cases,the clock starts ticking only when the minor legal representative has been appointed,so long as such appointment occurs within three years of the minor injury.id.this appeal concerns the application of this statute to the personal injury claims of christian joseph gibbs,a minor,and his parents suzanne and richard gibbs collectively,the gibbses,who challenge the district court dismissal of their lawsuit against carnival corporation,carnival cruise lines carnival,charging carnival with negligence,infliction of emotional distress,and breach of contract in connection with injuries suffered by christian gibbs aboard one of carnival cruise ships on august.
the passenger ticket contract between the gibbses and carnival included a provision that contained the minimum one year limitation allowable under the statute.the gibbses and carnival disagree as to when or whether suzanne gibbs was appointed guardian ad litem of christian in order to serve as his legal representative.carnival contends that the appointment occurred on march,the date of a letter from the gibbses attorney informing carnival that he has been retained by suzanne gibbs,individually and as guardian ad litem for christian joseph gibbs.under this interpretation,the one year to file suit would have ended on march,well before the gibbses filed this action before the district court on august.the gibbses respond that this letter has no legal effect,and that under new jersey court rule,a parent of a minor shall be deemed to be appointed guardian ad litem of the child in negligence actions only upon the filing of a pleading or certificate signed by an attorney.according to this court rule,the gibbses submit,suzanne gibbs was appointed legal representative of christian gibbs only when the complaint was filed in the district court.since they commenced this suit within the period available to appoint a legal representative for an injured minor under s c,they dispute carnival claim that the time had run.
the district court declined to resolve this aspect of the dispute.instead,it concluded that the march,letter from the gibbses attorney to carnival was legally binding and estopped the gibbses from arguing that the new jersey court rule applied.determining that the march,date of the letter is the time that christian gibbs received a legal representative,the court granted carnival motion to dismiss the case because it was filed after the one year expired.
before we address the estoppel issue,however,we must first clarify the appropriate choice of law.although it appears that the district court considered this case to be one that sounded in admiralty,it did not specify whether it applied the federal admiralty law of estoppel or new jersey standard.this omission is reflected in the briefs of the parties,which referred only to new jersey law.at oral argument before us,carnival conceded that federal admiralty law governs,but the gibbses maintained that we should apply new jersey law.we agree with carnival.because christian gibbs injuries occurred aboard a cruise ship in navigable waters,his cause of action contains the traditional nexus for maritime torts.
in order to sustain a claim of estoppel under federal admiralty law,a party must show that it relied in good faith on a misrepresentation of another party,and that this reliance caused it to change its position for the worse.evidence of detrimental reliance or prejudice is a critical element of estoppel,and carnival fails to satisfy this burden.moreover,the district court should not have precluded the gibbses from presenting their argument,which we find meritorious,that the in the passenger ticket contract had not expired because no legal representative had yet been appointed for christian gibbs.accordingly,the court use of equitable estoppel was mistaken,and we will therefore set aside the order dismissing christian gibbs claims.
having disposed of the estoppel issue,we must still determine whether the gibbses claim is barred by the suit time provision in the passenger ticket contract.this presents the question not directly addressed by the district court how is a legal representative appointed within the meaning of c to answer this,we must turn to federal rule of civil procedure,which explains how to determine when a legal representative has been appointed to protect a minor interests.the first step of the rule inquiry is to look to the law of the minor domicile to see if the minor already has a legal representative appointed for him.since christian gibbs is a domiciliary of new jersey,we apply new jersey court rule,which states that a parent is appointed guardian ad litem of her child only upon the filing of a pleading or certificate with a court.since the gibbses did not file any papers with a court before commencing this action in the district court,at the time the complaint was filed no legal representative had yet been appointed for christian gibbs under the laws of new jersey.this takes us to the second step of rule,which is the requirement that a district court appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor who is otherwise not represented under the law of the minor domicile.the court should take into account all factors relevant to the protection of the minor interests when selecting a guardian ad litem,but need not look to the procedures specified in the state law.in this case,the complaint before the district court specified that suzanne gibbs would represent christian as his guardian ad litem,and there is no reason to suggest that the court should not have accepted this appointment.
therefore,under the guardian ad litem appointment process envisioned by rule,no legal representative had been appointed for christian until the gibbses commenced this lawsuit before the district court,which was within the three year time period under c to appoint a legal representative.accordingly,christian claim is not under the passenger ticket contract and c.for these reasons,we will vacate the order dismissing christian claim and remand this action to the district court for further proceedings.
on august,while accompanying his parents on a cruise,christian gibbs suffered second degree burns on the soles of his feet when he stepped onto the hot surface of the deck of the carnival vessel,the destiny.he was in the care of carnival employees at the time as part of the camp carnival child care program.his parents,suzanne and richard,decided to interrupt their vacation and return home to new jersey with christian to care for his injuries.
after engaging in settlement discussions with carnival,the gibbses retained the law offices of gold and albanese gold and albanese to represent their interests.on march,robert francis gold,an attorney at gold and albanese,wrote to carnival informing it that the firm has been retained by suzanne gibbs,individually and as guardian ad litem for christian joseph gibbs,to represent their interests in connection with certain burn injuries suffered by christian joseph gibbs.carnival responded with a letter dated april,acknowledging receipt of gold correspondence and asking that any relevant information be forwarded to the company.there was no subsequent contact between the parties until an attorney at gold and albanese sent a copy of christian gibbs medical records to carnival on or about may.subsequently,carnival notified gold and albanese by mail that the gibbses claim was according to a provision in the passenger ticket contract that limited the time available for filing of a suit against carnival to one year after the date of injury.
the gibbses then commenced this action in the district court on august,alleging that carnival was liable for negligence,infliction of emotional distress,and breach of contract.the complaint sought relief on behalf of christian as well as his parents.carnival moved to dismiss the case pursuant to fed civ.b.carnival motion argued alternatively that the suit was untimely because of the provision in the passenger ticket contract the district court lacked in personam jurisdiction over carnival and the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim because of a forum selection clause in the ticket contract specifying a court in florida as the exclusive forum to resolve disputes arising from the contract.
the district court granted carnival motion on the first according to the one year in the passenger ticket contract.finding that the passenger ticket contract contained an enforceable provision allowing only one year to file suit on any claims arising from the contract,the court applied the provision against the gibbses and dismissed suzanne and richard gibbs individual claims.maritime carriers are entitled to impose contractual limitations on the time to bring a lawsuit so long as the allowable period is no less than one year.a.such suit time provisions in passenger ticket contracts must be written in language that meets a standard of reasonable communicativeness,which involves a liberal examination of the provision for clarity,physical placement,and ease of understanding.marek marpan two,cir see also schenck kloster cruise limited.the gibbses are not contesting the district court finding that the suit time provision in their passenger ticket contract is legally valid and binding under federal admiralty law.moreover,they do not dispute the district court dismissal of suzanne and richard gibbs individual claims against carnival.the district court correctly dismissed these claims,since this lawsuit was filed just short of two years after their cause of action after the one year in the passenger ticket contract.
the court also dismissed christian gibbs claims,but on a different theory.noting that christian was a minor and therefore that c applied,the court read this statute as allowing a period in which to appoint a legal representative for christian.once a representative was appointed,the court explained,the one year for filing a suit on christian claims would commence.the district court did not specify what process would be used for determining when a legal representative was appointed within the meaning of c.rather,the court applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel essentially to preclude the gibbses from denying that the march,letter from their counsel,gold and albanese,constituted the appointment of suzanne gibbs as guardian ad litem or legal representative of christian under c.
the court therefore refused to entertain the gibbses submission that suzanne gibbs was not appointed legal representative for christian by the march letter because new jersey court rule states that a parent may become the guardian ad litem of her child in negligence actions only upon the filing of a pleading or certificate before a court.under this theory,which the court did not take into account,the gibbses should be allowed to proceed on christian claim because the complaint was filed before the three years allowed under c to appoint a legal representative for an injured minor.since the appointment of the legal representative and the filing of the suit occurred simultaneously,the gibbses argued,the had not run.
instead,the court looked at the language of the march letter and found that it clearly communicated to carnival that suzanne gibbs had been appointed legal representative of christian on or about that date.the court chose to apply the law of estoppel because it believed that allowing the gibbses to disavow the depiction of suzanne gibbs as legal representative for christian in the march letter in favor of their new theory squarely brings into play the concept of estoppel which goes right to the fairness issue.accordingly,the court ruled that the gibbses should have filed christian claims within one year after march.since the complaint was not filed in the district court until august,the court held that it was untimely.the gibbses appeal of the district court order granting carnival b motion that dismissed christian gibbs claims is the issue before this court.we have appellate jurisdiction under,and our review over the district court order granting a b motion is plenary.semerenko cendant,cir.we review the court interpretation of,like any other matter of statutory interpretation,de novo.see united states zwick,cir.
ii.choice of law 
in their complaint,the gibbses invoked diversity jurisdiction,pursuant to,as the basis of their claim before the district court.although both parties refer to this case as one concerning admiralty,they cited only to new jersey law in the briefs.at oral argument in response to questions from the court,carnival conceded that admiralty law governs,but the gibbses maintained their position that new jersey law governs.normally,this court would apply the choice of law rules of the forum this case,those of new order to determine what substantive law governs a diversity action.see klaxon stentor electric.however,if the case sounds in admiralty,it would be inappropriate to apply new jersey law or any other state law,instead of federal admiralty law.
the initial step in the choice of law analysis is to determine whether this case sounds in admiralty.in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d,the supreme court summarized prior precedent and articulated a test for ascertaining when a case sounds in admiralty.first,the incident must have occurred on navigable water or be an injury suffered on land that was caused by a vessel on navigable water.id.at.second,a court must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disrupting impact on maritime commerce.id.internal quotations omitted.finally,a court must determine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.internal quotations omitted.
we are satisfied that the gibbses claims sound in admiralty under this analysis.first,the injuries to christian gibbs transpired on the carnival cruise lines vessel,the destiny,which was traveling in navigable waters.second,passenger vessels are clearly engaged in maritime commerce.see east river transamerica delaval,d.finally,the defective design or manufacture of parts of a boat designed for maritime use,such as the deck of a cruise ship,bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity,mink ex rel.ins.of am.genmar,cir citing cases where products liability actions involving pleasure craft in navigable waters sounded in admiralty law.
although the gibbses complaint alleged more than mere products also claimed breach of contract,infliction of emotional distress,and negligence on the part of carnival analysis pointing to a nexus with maritime commerce is still present.see fedorczyk caribbean cruise lines,cir concluding that a slip in a bathtub in a ship cabin has a nexus to traditional maritime activity despite the fact that the injury was not a uniquely maritime occurrence friedman cunard line,noting that even assuming that a maritime nexus is necessary to establish admiralty jurisdiction over a tort committed on the high seas a question the supreme court left open in east river steamship and does not appear to have subsequently addressed,that nexus is established by the role that cruise ships play in maritime commerce.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has also specifically held that intentional infliction of emotional distress torts that occur on board cruise vessels are governed by maritime law.wallis ex rel.wallis princess cruises,cir.
moreover,as to the contract claims,it is settled jurisprudence that passenger ticket contracts for cruises are maritime contracts governed by federal admiralty law.carnival cruise lines shute,d see also schenck kloster cruise,aff,cir vavoules kloster cruise,stating that since,courts,without exception,have applied federal maritime law in cases involving passenger cruise tickets and other maritime contracts,and citing examples.
since we conclude that this case sounds in admiralty,we apply federal admiralty law and not the law of new jersey or any oth
