and his mother,sharon duck,sued the isle of wight county virginia school board,superintendent,and special education director,alleging violations of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,section of the rehabilitation act of,and.the plaintiffs sought equitable and monetary relief on the grounds that the defendants failed to provide with special education services while he was a student at carrsville elementary school.the defendants conceded liability for violating the idea and entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs resolving all claims under this statute.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on claims under the rehabilitation act and we affirm the order granting summary judgment on claim.however,we reverse the award of summary judgment as to his claim under the rehabilitation act and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
was born on may.in september,he started kindergarten at joseph king elementary school king in franklin city,virginia.in november,duck grew concerned about progress in kindergarten and requested that the school evaluate for a possible learning disability.after several evaluations,the school determined that was a disabled child eligible to receive special assistance in the classroom.
in july,after completed his first grade year at king,the school prepared an individualized education program iep to commence when began the second grade in september duck participated in the preparation of iep and agreed to accept the special education services offered by the school.nevertheless struggled through the second grade.as a result,teachers and duck formulated a new iep and agreed that would repeat the second grade for the school year.after successfully completing the second grade,began the third grade at king in september.the parties disagree as to whether the franklin city schools implemented an iep for the school year.although duck contends that had an iep for the third grade,no record of an iep was produced in the district court.
after his third grade year,and duck moved to isle of wight county.on august,duck completed a registration form to enroll in the isle of wight county schools.the form asked has this child been identified for special education,gifted and talented programs,or alternative education programs at.duck checked the box indicating yes on the registration form.in addition,someone wrote the phrase special ed.below the yes box on the registration form,apparently to indicate that had last been enrolled in an iep for the school year.duck,however,denies that this was her handwriting.
in september,when started the fourth grade at carrsville elementary school,there was no iep in place,and he was not enrolled in any special education classes.in october,duck observed that was having trouble in school,and she requested a meeting with school officials.on november,the principal,special education coordinator,and several teachers met to discuss performance in school.duck could not attend the meeting,but she sent grandmother to attend in her place.at the meeting,the school representatives indicated that was doing somewhere between ok and fair in the regular classroom without special assistance.accordingly,they decided that would not be placed in special education classes.duck did not agree with this decision,but the defendants failed to notify duck of her right to an appeal.as a result,duck did not challenge the november decision.
during fifth grade year,duck requested that the school evaluate to determine whether he could receive special education assistance.her efforts to have tested,however,proved unsuccessful.in september,entered the sixth grade at windsor middle school.after his schoolwork continued to suffer,was evaluated and the school determined that he was learning disabled and therefore eligible to receive special education services.duck and the school thereafter formulated an iep,and was placed in special education classes beginning in the summer between sixth and seventh grade.
on january,duck filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,asserting claims against the defendants for herself as well as.the complaint alleged that the defendants denied a proper education by not providing him with special education services for the three years that he was a student at carrsville elementary,from the fourth through the sixth grade.count i of the complaint asserted a violation of the idea on the grounds that an iep was allegedly in place with the franklin city public schools when transferred to carrsville elementary school for the fourth grade,and the defendants were therefore obligated to confirm that was no longer a child with a disability before terminating his special education services count ii alleged that the defendants discriminated against on the basis of his disability in violation of the rehabilitation act finally,count iii asserted a violation of the plaintiffs civil rights under.
on the grounds that no record of an active iep existed when transferred to carrsville,the defendants answered and denied that they were obligated to determine his eligibility for educational assistance.nevertheless,the defendants admitted that they violated the procedural requirements of the idea by failing to inform duck of her right to appeal the school determination that would not be placed in special education classes the parties subsequently resolved count i of the complaint,with the defendants agreeing both to comply with all applicable provisions of the idea,and to pay the costs and attorney fees associated with the plaintiffs claims under the idea.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,however,on count ii of the complaint.specifically,the defendants observed that the rehabilitation act does not contain a statute of limitations,and that the federal borrowing doctrine therefore requires the selection of the most analogous statute of limitations under state law.see wilson garcia,d.the parties agreed that the limitations period provided by the virginia rights of persons with disabilities act,ann.b michie,was most applicable to federal claims under the rehabilitation act.the defendants contended that under the borrowing doctrine,claim under the rehabilitation act was subject not only to the limitations period provided by the virginia statute,but also to the requirement in the statute that plaintiffs provide written notice of a claim to the defendant within days of the alleged discriminatory practice.id did not provide the defendants with written notice of his claim under the rehabilitation act within days of the determination that he would not receive special education services.thus,the defendants argued that with the notice provision in the virginia statute required the dismissal of his rehabilitation act claim the district court agreed and accordingly granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on count ii of the complaint.the district court also granted summary judgment for the defendants on count iii,holding that under our decision in sellers school board of manassas,cir,the plaintiffs claims under were nothing more than a prohibited attempt to recover money damages for a violation of the idea.
through duck,now appeals the dismissal of his claims under the rehabilitation act and 
we review de novo the order granting summary judgment on counts ii and iii of the complaint.coons secretary of the treasury,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,we must determine whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law and whether there are any genuine issues of material fact to warrant a trial on the merits.id.on appeal,contends that the federal borrowing doctrine does not authorize the application of the virginia provision to his federal claim under the rehabilitation act.secondly,challenges the denial of his claim for monetary damages under.we address each issue in turn.
iii.rehabilitation act 
analytical framework of federal borrowing doctrine 
f ederal law is frequently deficient in that it does not supply the complete legal framework necessary to the fair adjudication of federal causes of action.brown united states,en banc.more precisely,a lthough federal law may establish rights,federal law does not always include the procedural or elements that are generally considered necessary to the fair litigation of its causes of action.id.internal quotations omitted.accordingly,when facing deficiencies in federal law,the borrowing doctrine authorizes courts to look to other sources of law to borrow appropriate provisions.id.
with respect to federal civil rights actions,congress has expressly codified this borrowing doctrine in the statute provides a framework for courts to follow when faced with apparent deficiencies in federal law.specifically,
section establishes a process for the selection of the appropriate substantive law in civil rights actions.first,it is to be determined whether federal civil rights law is deficient in that it fails to furnish a particular rule if it is deficient,the most closely analogous state law may fill the vacuum only if it is consistent with the meaning and purpose of constitutional and federal statutory law.if state law is inconsistent,it must be disregarded in favor of the federal common law.
bass wallenstein,cir see also wilson,at.establishing framework for incorporating state law provisions into federal law.
relevant to this appeal,the rehabilitation act is a federal civil rights statute and thus the framework provided by governs the selection of appropriate state law rules to fill deficiencies in the federal statute.see mccullough branch banking trust,cir wolsky medical coll.of hampton,cir see also holmes texas a m,cir the selection of a limitations period applicable to rehabilitation act cases is governed by a.the district court in this case applied two distinct provisions of virginia law to federal cause of action under the rehabilitation act a the statute of limitations provided by the virginia rights of persons with disabilities act,and b the provision contained within the same virginia statute.we address each decision separately in accordance with the framework established by.
statute of limitations 
under,we first analyze whether the rehabilitation act was deficient for want of a limitations period.brown,at because the practice of borrowing presupposes a need to fill a deficiency in the federal scheme,a court must first look to see if there is indeed such a deficiency.as the seventh circuit observed in jaworski schmidt,cir state law is to be resorted to in resolving an issue if,and only if,federal law is deficient,and if,and only if,state law is not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.id.at quoting a emphasis added.
the rehabilitation act is indeed deficient without a statute of limitations to govern the federal cause of action.in fact,the most common deficiency in a federal statute that triggers the borrowing doctrine is the absence of a limitations period.brown,at.as the circuit observed in brown,the absence of a statute of limitations is an egregious gap in a cause of action.whatever the source of a cause of action,some clear end to one liberty to commence suit is necessary.id.emphasis in original.as a result,the district court was justified in looking to state law to supply an appropriate limitations period for cause of action under the rehabilitation act.
with respect to the second and third prongs of the borrowing analysis,we observed in wolsky that t he virginia rights of persons with disabilities act was modeled after and is almost identical to the rehabilitation act.wolsky,at.accordingly,we held that it is consistent with federal law to apply the limitations period in the virginia statute to claims under the rehabilitation act.id.at.the district court was therefore correct in adopting the limitations period provided by the virginia statute as the limitations period for federal claim under the rehabilitation act.
as noted earlier,the district court granted summary judgment on rehabilitation act claim on the grounds that he failed to comply with the provision of the virginia rights of persons with disabilities act.the defendants argued,and the district court agreed,that the virginia notice requirement was applicable to federal claims under the rehabilitation act because the notice provision is consistent with the goals underlying the federal statute.specifically,the defendants contended that congress enacted the rehabilitation act to accomplish objectives that are similar to those advanced by the americans with disabilities act ada,et,a federal statute that requires plaintiffs to provide timely notice of a discrimination claim the ada notice requirement serves the goal of prompt notification and swift resolution of the conflict.mccullough,at.inasmuch as the virginia notice requirement serves the same goals the defendants argued that application of the notice provision to claims under the rehabilitation act is consistent with federal law as required by.
for his part,contends that the application of the notice requirement to his claim under the rehabilitation act is by the supremacy clause of the united states constitution he argues that the imposition of the notice requirement adds an additional element of proof to his federal cause of action,and that the supremacy clause forbids state efforts to change or curtail a federal right.appellants br.at.
both parties,however,overlook the threshold analysis required by that is,whether the rehabilitation act is deficient without a provision.by its terms,authorizes the adoption of a particular state rule if,and only if,federal law is deficient without it.jaworski,at see also a.for the reasons that follow,we are constrained to hold that there is no deficiency in the rehabilitation act that authorizes the adoption of a state provision pursuant to.
deficiency analysis 
first,we note that the deficiency established by the lack of a limitations period in the rehabilitation act is not,of itself,license to incorporate additional state law into the federal statute.instead,we borrow only what is necessary to fill the gap left by congress.west conrail,d.thus,the provision in the virginia statute must be analyzed independently to determine whether its application to claim under the rehabilitation act is permissible under.
we are not aware of a single court that has held that the rehabilitation act is deficient for the lack of a provision.this is for good reason such rules are not necessary to the fair litigation of the federal cause of action.brown,at.in brown,for example,the circuit held that the federal scheme for litigating bivens claims is not deficient for want of a provision.brown,at.the court explained that 
a notice provision has a very different relationship to a cause of action than that of a statute of limitations,tolling provision,or survival rule.
while these latter provisions all operate to define the point of repose,after which expectations become settled,the notice of claims provision does something different.of course,if it is not complied with,and there are no grounds for waiver,it bars an action,and thus it acts to create settled expectations but this is simply a penalty for noncompliance.the provision function is to compel notice so that the defendant may investigate early,prepare a stronger case,and perhaps reach an early settlement.the need to apply traditional provisions of repose statutes of limitations,tolling provisions,and survival rules remains unchanged,since the notice provision has a purpose that is quite distinct.
because statutes of limitations are such universally familiar procedural aspects of litigation,and because they are so generally understood as essential to a fair scheme of litigation,the judiciary is safe in assuming that congress intended or at least would have intended to limit all congressionally created causes of action by statutes of limitations.in other words,the judiciary can safely look at the absence of a limitations provision as a deficiency.
the judiciary is on less secure ground,however,when it limits statutory or common law causes of action with procedural rules embodying interests that are not as universally understood to be essential to fair litigation as are the repose interests embodied in traditional statutes of limitations.the absence of such rules in the cause of action can not as easily be termed a deficiency.
id.at footnote omitted.in holding that does not authorize the application of notice rules to bivens claims,the brown court observed that this conclusion was also supported by the overwhelming majority of federal and state courts that have confronted the issue of borrowing notice of claims provisions under.id.at collecting cases.
the fact that brown and the decisions it cites were rendered in the context of bivens and actions does not undermine our confidence that the rehabilitation act is similarly not deficient without a provision.the core reasoning of these the interests served by rules are not essential to federal equally applicable to the rehabilitation act.as the supreme court in felder casey,d,reasoned 
because statutes of limitation are among the universally familiar aspects of litigation considered indispensable to any scheme of justice,it is entirely reasonable to assume that congress did not intend to create a right enforceable in perpetuity.provisions,by contrast,are neither universally familiar nor in any sense indispensable prerequisites to litigation,and there is thus no reason to suppose that congress intended federal courts to apply such rules,which significantly inhibit the ability to bring federal actions.
id.at.internal quotations omitted emphasis added.
in this case,the district court never addressed the issue of whether the rehabilitation act is deficient for the lack of a provision.instead,the district court held that board of regents tomanio,d,requires the application of the notice provision to claim under the rehabilitation act.in tomanio,the supreme court held that when a federal court borrows a state limitations period pursuant to,it must also apply the state rule for tolling the statute of limitations.tomanio,at.the supreme court reasoned that rules for tolling a statute of limitations are such an integral part of a complete limitations policy,that it would make little sense not to incorporate these rules when a limitations period is borrowed pursuant to.id.at.in particular,tomanio explained that 
any period of limitation is understood fully only in the context of the various circumstances that suspend it from running against a particular cause of action in virtually all statutes of limitations the chronological length of the limitation period is interrelated with provisions regarding tolling,revival,and questions of application.
id.at.internal quotations omitted.
the supreme court rationale in tomanio,however,does not support the application of the virginia notice rule to federal claims under the rehabilitation act.this is because a notice provision has a very different relationship to a cause of action than that of a statute of limitations,tolling provision,or survival rule.brown,at.while these latter provisions all operate to define the point of repose,a notice rule enables defendants to investigate early,prepare a stronger case,and perhaps reach an early settlement.felder,at.quoting brown,at.these are legitimate goals,to be sure,but very different from those fostered by a statute of limitations.as a result,unlike the tolling provision at issue in tomanio,there is no basis for characterizing a requirement as an integral part of a complete limitations policy.tomanio,at.therefore,because a notice requirement functions independently and serves different purposes than a statute of limitations,brown,at,we conclude that tomanio does not support the incorporation of such rules into federal actions pursuant to.
consistency analysis 
our conclusion that the rehabilitation act is not deficient for want of a requirement,by itself,precludes the application of the notice provision to claim under the rehabilitation act.jaworski,at state law borrowed only where federal law is deficient.nevertheless,we discuss the remaining steps of the analytical framework under to demonstrate that the application of the notice requirement in this case would contravene an important federal interest.
as noted earlier,the defendants contend that the purposes served by the virginia notice rule are consistent with the goals underlying the rehabilitation act.this contention alone,however,does not support the application of the notice requirement to federal claims under the rehabilitation act.the notice requirement may serve objectives similar to the those advanced by the federal statute however,a provision that is incompatible with the constitution is not subject to borrowing under.bass,at section authorizes the adoption of state law only if it is consistent with the meaning and purpose of constitutional and federal statutory law.emphasis added.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the application of the notice requirement to claims under the rehabilitation act would contravene the supremacy clause.under virginia law,the notice provision is not merely a procedural requirement,but instead an essential element of the plaintiff cause of action and a condition precedent to any right of action against the defendant.see daniel city of richmond,t he giving of the required notice is mandatory and is an essential element of the plaintiff case,which he must allege and prove.see also breeding ex rel.breeding hensley,construing provision as condition precedent to right of action.
this characterization precludes any attempt to incorporate the notice provision into federal law pursuant to,since borrowing such a requirement would engraft elements upon a federal statute in violation of the supremacy clause.the court in brown made this very observation in distinguishing the effect of borrowing a state statute of limitations under from the adoption of a state provision.specifically,the court reasoned that we may 
safely posit that federal lawmakers,when setting out the elements of a cause of action,do not usually intend that there should forever remain a remedy available once those elements are established.it is much more difficult to assume that those lawmakers,when they set out the elements of a federal cause of action,would normally intend for additional and unstated elements to be also considered necessary,and for state law to be consulted to supply those missing yet necessary elements of the federal action.in particular,nothing in federal borrowing doctrine leads us to believe that state law can precondition the accrual of federal rights of action.
brown,at emphasis added internal citations omitted.state law is not usually thought to add elements to federal rights of action.id.nor did congress intend to assign to state courts and legislatures a conclusive role in the formative function of defining and characterizing the essential elements of a federal cause of action.wilson,at.the application of the virginia notice requirement to federal claim under the rehabilitation act would contravene the supremacy clause,and therefore does not authorize the borrowing of the notice provision in this case.
ultimately,because does not authorize the application of the virginia notice requirement to claim under the rehabilitation act,the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants on count ii of the complaint was erroneous.
finally,we address attempt to recover money damages under for the defendants admitted violation of the idea.we clearly disapproved of this practice in sellers,observing that the idea comprehensive remedial scheme demonstrated congress intent that disabled children pursue claims to a free appropriate public education solely through the remedial mechanisms established by the statute.sellers,at citing smith robinson,d.accordingly,we held that parties may not sue under section for an idea violation.sellers,at.
contends that notwithstanding our holding in sellers,our decision in robinson pinderhughes,cir,authorizes his claim for damages under.we disagree.although we permitted the plaintiffs in pinderhughes to file a action to enforce an administrative order under the education of the handicapped act eha et,the
