factual and procedural background 
on august,lehmann,a louisiana resident,was injured when her motor vehicle collided with a dump truck owned by the parish that was being operated by one of its employees.on august,lehmann timely filed suit in louisiana state court against the parish and gallagher basset services,the alleged insurer of the parish,to recover for her injuries.she subsequently dismissed gallagher basset services after learning that it was not the parish insurer.in,lehmann discovered that ge had issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to the parish under which ge was obliged to defend and indemnify the parish in respect to her accident.nevertheless,lehmann deliberately did not join ge as a defendant,because ge,as a private corporation,could have demanded a jury trial on her claim,whereas the parish,as a political subdivision,could not lehmann and her counsel thought it would be to her advantage to pursue her claim only against the parish in order to have it decided exclusively by a judge,rather than have a jury decide the same claim against the insurer in the same proceeding.on august,six days before the case went to trial,ge received notice of lehmann state court lawsuit against the parish.ge did not intervene or undertake to defend the parish,and the parish did not call upon it to do so.the case was tried by a state court judge on august,and.
on april,the state court rendered judgment in favor of lehmann and against the parish in the amount of,along with interest from the date of judicial demand until paid and all costs which the court set at.the louisiana first circuit court of appeal affirmed the trial court judgment on july.the parish allowed the judgment to become final without applying to the appeals court for rehearing or to the louisiana supreme court for a writ of certiorari.lehmann was unable to collect on the judgment,however,because the parish did not appropriate the funds necessary to make it legally exigible and payable.see.const.art.xii,c.
on august,over one year after her judgment against the parish had become final,lehmann filed this lawsuit in louisiana state court against ge seeking to recover the damages owed to her under the judgment.she contends that ge is responsible for payment of her judgment as a result of the coverage provided by the insurance policy that was in effect at the time of her motor vehicle collision.on september,ge removed the lawsuit to the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana.in its answer,ge pleaded the affirmative defense of nonjoinder of an indispensable party,arguing that the parish was indispensable to the case pursuant to louisiana direct action statute,as well as the defenses of res judicata and prescription,among others.lehmann then moved for leave to amend her complaint in order to join the parish as a party,but her motion was denied by the magistrate judge 
after the district court denied the parties for summary judgment the parties agreed on march,to a bench trial in which adjudication would be based solely on submitted pleadings,briefs,and exhibits.ge did not challenge any of lehmann factual allegations,but instead asserted the following legal defenses that the claims had prescribed,that the claims were barred by res judicata,that the claims were barred by the terms of the parish insurance policy,and that lehmann failed to comply with louisiana direct action statute because she did not succeed in joining the parish as a party.the district court rejected the first three arguments advanced by ge,but concluded that the direct action statute did not permit lehmann to sue the insurer alone in this instance.the district court therefore rendered judgment in favor of ge and dismissed lehmann claims with prejudice.lehmann then took this timely appeal of the district court judgment.ge subsequently the district court rejection of its other defenses.

iii.discussion 
lehmann argues that the district court erred when it concluded that she had not complied with the joinder procedures of louisiana direct action statute because none of the enumerated exceptions in section b a f were present,and thus dismissed her suit with prejudice we agree.in mcavey lee,cir,we held that section b 
consists of three complementary elements the injured plaintiff substantive right against the insurer,which accrues derivatively with his substantive right against the insured tortfeasor the injured plaintiff direct action or remedy against the insurer and the procedural requirements,set forth in the provision ending with subparagraphs a e of section b,which,in effect,provide the insurer a procedural means to avoid defending a direct action alone,except in the circumstances listed,by objecting to the of the insured.
id.at stated another way,we concluded that the section b a f provisions merely added a procedural method by which the insurer can object to the of the insured other than in the exceptional circumstances listed they did not affect the plaintiff substantive and remedial rights under the direct action statute id.at see also safford tammany parish fire prot.dist,wl,at,unpublished citing mcavey for the proposition that defendant right to demand joinder of its alleged assured is a procedural rather than substantive right.we specifically rejected the argument that the a f provisions are a substantive condition precedent to the injured plaintiff right,remedy and judgment against the insurer under the direct action statute.mcavey,at see also montrell state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,citing with approval to this holding in mcavey.the district court,which had not b
