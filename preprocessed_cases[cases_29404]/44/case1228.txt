opinion of the court 
marie yurecka,individually and as administratrix of the estate of william yurecka,and as natural guardian of yurecka and yurecka,and brian yurecka appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of jeffrey zappala and arlene on the ground that the rescue doctrine does not support the yureckas claims arising from two automobile accidents on the pennsylvania turnpike,the second of which caused the death of william yurecka.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the rescue was ongoing at the time of the second accident,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this action arises from two automobile accidents that occurred on the pennsylvania turnpike on the evening of may.the following facts are undisputed.
while driving north on the turnpike in heavy rainfall,william yurecka,his wife marie yurecka,and their three children saw a white toyota pass their vehicle and travel out of sight.the toyota was driven by jeffrey zappala,and seated in the front passenger seat was his wife,arlene.the yureckas later noticed the toyota lying overturned off of the right side of the highway.they decided to stop to provide assistance,as both and yurecka were trained and certified in first aid by the red cross.the yureckas pulled to the side of the highway,parked their minivan with the hazard lights flashing,exited the vehicle and walked downhill toward the.
as the yureckas approached the zappalas vehicle,which was visibly totaled as a result of the accident,the zappalas managed to climb out through the rear of their vehicle although the zappalas said that they were all right and appeared externally uninjured,they followed the yureckas to their minivan,where the yureckas made room for them to sit under the minivan rear hatch to provide shelter from the heavy rain.yurecka walked to a nearby emergency call box to phone the police and then returned to the minivan to assist the zappalas.the yureckas three children remained inside the passenger compartment.
while the zappalas sat beneath the rear hatch of the yureckas minivan,the yureckas verbally comforted them,provided them with warm blankets and a pair of shoes for zappala,who had lost hers in the accident,and stayed with them to monitor for possible shock and other injuries while the zappalas waited for police to arrive.
approximately seventeen minutes later,while the zappalas waited inside the yureckas minivan,a third vehicle,driven by defendant robert rockwell,lost control on the wet highway.his vehicle swerved and hydroplaned into the yureckas parked vehicle.yurecka,who had been standing near the rear corner of the minivan,was hit by the rockwell vehicle and dragged north into the left lane of the turnpike.the police arrived after yurecka was hit,and he was transported to the hospital,where he died as a result of multiple traumatic injuries from the collision.
in may,the yureckas brought an action for wrongful death,survival claims,and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the zappalas in the luzerne county,pennsylvania,court of common pleas.the case was then removed to the middle district of pennsylvania on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the yureckas claims were based on the zappalas negligence in causing the first accident,which prompted the yureckas to come to their rescue,placing yurecka in the way of harm that ultimately led to his death.the zappalas argued that any rescue was completed at the time of the subsequent accident,and that the rescue doctrine no longer applied.
the district court agreed,granting a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the rescue doctrine did not apply at the time of the second accident the court also found,however,that the zappalas were driving at an unsafe speed at the time of their accident,and that the yureckas had been rescuers at the time they stopped to provide assistance.yurecka zappala,slip op.at.on april,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint in favor of the zappalas.the yureckas appeal.

discussion 
although the pennsylvania supreme court has not clearly defined the scope of pennsylvania rescue doctrine,other existing case law indicates that a rescuer plaintiff may recover for injuries suffered in the course of a rescue if it can be shown that the defendant negligently caused the dangerous situation the person requiring rescue was in imminent peril or the rescuer reasonably believed that such peril existed and the rescuer actions during the rescue were not reckless.see pachesky getz.altamuro milner hotel,states that i n applying the rescue doctrine,the court must first determine the negligence vel non of the defendant.the pennsylvania superior court has also recognized that the situation precipitating the rescue must warrant a reasonable belief that the peril facing the object of the rescue was urgent and imminent.bell irace.this approach reflects the broadly accepted rescue doctrine principle that a plaintiff remains in the course of a rescue attempt where the plaintiff acts under a reasonable belief that the endangered party peril continues.sweetman state highway,see also wagner.ry,estate of keck by and through cabe blair.finally,pachesky states that rescuer plaintiffs may recover for injuries suffered in the course of a rescue if they acted in the exercise of ordinary care for their own safety under the circumstances,short of rashness and recklessness.pachesky,at quoting walker hauling johnson,
the zappalas do not dispute for summary judgment purposes that zappala was negligent in causing the first accident,and have not alleged that the yureckas acted recklessly in carrying out the rescue.rather,the zappalas contend that there was no imminent peril at the time of the second accident,and that the yureckas had no reasonable belief that such peril existed.therefore,the decisive issue in this case is the second element of the rescue doctrine test whether there existed either continued peril or a reasonable belief of such peril in the minds of the rescuers at the time of yurecka fatal injury.
