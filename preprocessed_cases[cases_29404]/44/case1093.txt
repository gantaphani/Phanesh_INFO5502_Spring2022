opinion of the court 
in this appeal from a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claim,we must determine whether state officials approval and subsidization of an apartment for the section housing program,even though the apartment allegedly failed to comply with section housing quality standards,constitutes a danger toward the apartment tenant and her guest in violation of their substantive due process rights under the united states constitution.
accepting plaintiffs plausible factual allegations as true for the purpose of this appeal,we do not find that plaintiffs have adequately pled a danger claim.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the district court 
on july,a fire at an apartment located at west street in erie,pennsylvania took the lives of tenant tyreesha richardson and her guest gwyneth henry.their bodies were found on the third floor of the apartment,and an autopsy confirmed both women died from smoke inhalation.the bedroom purportedly lacked a smoke detector and an alternate means of egress even though the apartment was required to have both safety features under the section housing choice voucher program in which richardson participated.
plaintiff alyshia richardson is the administratrix of the estate of tyreesha richardson,and plaintiff mario henry is the administrator of the estate of gwyneth henry.
section of the united states housing act of,established a housing program to help eligible families afford safe and sanitary housing.the united states department of housing and urban development hud oversees the program,which is administered by local agencies in accordance with federal guidelines.in erie,the local administering agency is the housing authority of the city of erie hace.defendant john horan is the executive director of hace,where he is responsible for ensuring hace complies with applicable laws and regulations as well as overseeing its employees.defendant joseph angelotti is employed by hace as a section housing inspector.
hace provides housing vouchers to families it determines qualify for assistance.a qualifying family may take the voucher to a willing landlord of its choosing,subject to hace approval of the tenancy.hace approval requires an inspection and a determination that the dwelling unit meets the housing quality standards hqs promulgated by hud.among other things,the housing quality standards require that the dwelling unit have an alternate means of exit in case of fire such as fire stairs or egress through windows,k,and at least one or smoke detector,in proper operating condition,on each level,id.n.
if hace approves a tenancy after inspection,hace and the property owner will enter into a housing assistance payment hap contract in which hace agrees to pay a certain portion of the tenant monthly rent.the tenant enters into a lease with the property owner and is responsible for paying the remainder of the rent.the property owner must keep the unit in compliance with the housing quality standards for the duration of the lease.hace employs housing inspectors to inspect units prior to leasing,annually thereafter,and at other times as needed to ensure compliance.id.a.hace administrative plan provides 
the owner must maintain the assisted unit in accordance with hqs.
the hace will take prompt action to enforce the owner obligations for owner breach of the hqs.
the hace will notify the owner and tenant of hqs deficiencies for which the owner is responsible.the notice will provide for the following 
for hqs failures,the owner will be given up to thirty days to correct the item s.the hace executive director or designee may,at discretion,approve a reasonable extension of time depending upon the extent or scope of work required.
if the defect is life threatening to the family health or safety,the owner will be given hours to correct the violation.
if the owner fails to correct failed items,the payment will be suspended or the hap contract will be terminated.
the hace will not make any assistance payments for a dwelling unit in which hqs deficiencies have not been corrected after the notice period has expired.
if life threatening deficiencies are not corrected within hours,the owner will be given notice of intent to terminate the hap contract and that the housing assistance payment will be suspended through the termination notice period.
compl.citing housing authority of the city of erie,section housing choice voucher administrative plan,to 
richardson was a tenant participant in the section housing program.with her voucher,richardson rented a unit on the second and third floors of an apartment duplex owned by brett and patricia hammel.
according to the complaint,on march,angelotti performed the initial inspection required to approve the apartment for the program.he failed the apartment at that time and informed the owners the following repairs were necessary to make it suitable for the section program 
in the third floor bedroom 
install a smoke detector.
secure the railing.
c.a fire escape ladder must be in place for a second means of egress.
on april,angelotti purportedly allowed the apartment to pass inspection,even though it still lacked a fire escape ladder.we will also assume the apartment lacked a smoke detector,although the complaint is inconsistent regarding such allegations 
angelotti then purportedly allowed the apartment to pass annual inspections in,and.plaintiffs assert angelotti inspected the apartment on march and march of.a hace inspection checklist lists various categories for inspection.on the checklist,next to the smoke detectors category,an x has been marked under the column stating no,and the words install in bedroom have been written in.id.in,the apartment was inspected once.the checklist has the same no indication next to the smoke detectors category,along with a handwritten annotation 
install as need replace batteries.
the results of the annual inspection are unknown,but on april,kimberly preston,hace section program coordinator,sent a letter to richardson stating 
please be advised that the housing authority of the city of erie will terminate all housing assistance payments and the section contract on your behalf effective may.
this action will be taken because your housing unit was not brought up to the required housing quality standards.please refer to our inspection report dated april,however,if the work has been completed,please contact the office and schedule a.
id.preston sent similar letters to richardson after the and inspections.the letter warned that housing assistance payments would terminate effective may,due to the inspection report dated march,unless the apartment was brought into compliance with the housing quality standards.the letter warned that housing assistance payments would terminate effective may,due to the inspection report dated april,unless the apartment was brought into compliance with the housing quality standards.despite these warning letters and the owners continued failure to comply with the housing quality standards,hace did not terminate the housing assistance payments for richardson apartment.as noted,on july,the apartment succumbed to fire and richardson and henry died in the bedroom.
plaintiffs brought suit on behalf of decedents richardson and henry,asserting the following an equal protection claim against the city of erie a claim against hace,horan,and angelotti for violating the housing act a claim against hace,horan,and angelotti under the danger theory and a negligence claim against the hammels,the apartment owners.
the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge and adopted in toto the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge.the court dismissed plaintiffs equal protection claim and housing act claim.but the court found plaintiffs adequately pled a danger claim by asserting that but for defendants affirmative acts in approving and subsidizing the apartment,richardson would not have been living in that apartment,and she and henry would not have been killed in the fire.the court stated richardson and henry deaths were a foreseeable result of defendants acts,and found richardson and henry were part of a discrete class of persons occupants of the bedroom subjected to harm.the court also concluded a jury could find defendants behavior was deliberately indifferent and.
the court rejected horan and angelotti qualified immunity defense,explaining that because the danger doctrine was since july,and defendants deliberately disregarded a known violation of section,they could not have believed their conduct comported with the law.the court found a reasonable official would have understood that approving the apartment for the section program despite its noncompliance with the housing quality standards would violate decedents substantive due process rights.
horan and angelotti appeal the district court order denying them qualified immunity on plaintiffs danger claim.meanwhile,plaintiffs negligence claim against the hammels and danger claim against hace remain pending in the district court.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under because an order denying a public official motion to dismiss that is based on qualified immunity and turns on a question of law is immediately appealable as a final decision under the cohen collateral order doctrine.ashcroft iqbal,d citing cohen beneficial indus.loan.
we exercise de novo review of a district court denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds as it involves a pure question of law.james city of wilkes barre,cir.to withstand a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at quoting bell ail.twombly,d.while legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint,they must be supported by factual allegations.id.at.
plaintiffs brought suit under.under section,a plaintiff must plead a deprivation of a constitutional right and that the constitutional deprivation was caused by a person acting under the color of state law.phillips cnty.of alleg hen y,cir.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.to determine whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,we must ask whether the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,and whether the right was clearly established.pearson callahan,d quoting saucier katz,d.the courts of appeals may exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.id.at.in this case,we find the complaint,taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,fails to show the officials conduct violated a constitutional right.walter pike,cir quoting saucier,at.therefore,plaintiffs claim should have been dismissed.
federal appellate courts that have addressed the issue have held that the housing act does not create a private right to housing of a particular condition or a private cause of action to enforce any such right see banks dallas hous,cir perry hous.auth.of charleston,cir.the statute itself is silent on the issue of a private cause of action.see.but the implementing regulations specify that no rights are conferred on tenants to sue for violations of the housing quality standards.see stating the housing choice voucher program does not create any right of the family,or any party other than hud or the pha public housing agency,to require enforcement of the hqs requirements by hud or the pha,or to assert any claim against hud or the pha,for damages,injunction or other relief,for alleged failure to enforce the hqs.
in accordance with this case law,plaintiffs do not bring suit under for violations of section or its accompanying regulations.rather,plaintiffs contend that defendants,acting under color of state law,deprived decedents of their right s to life,liberty and bodily integrity under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.phillips,at.although the supreme court has made clear that a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause,deshaney winnebago cnty.dep t of soc,d,we have recognized that a state actor may be held liable under the danger doctrine for creating a danger to an individual in certain circumstances.see morrow balaski,wl,at cir.june,en banc.
the danger doctrine derives from the supreme court decision in deshaney.in that case,joshua deshaney was repeatedly beaten by his father.at.although the winnebago county department of social services dss obtained a court order to place joshua in the temporary custody of a local hospital,it returned him to his father custody after deciding there was insufficient evidence of abuse.id.at.dss continued to check on joshua,but despite signs of abuse,failed to take any action to protect him.id.at.the beatings from his father eventually caused joshua to suffer severe brain damage.id.at.
joshua and his mother brought suit against dss and several of its employees under,alleging that by failing to protect joshua against a risk of which they knew or should have known,defendants violated joshua rights under the fourteenth amendment.id.the court rejected joshua claim,stating,a s a general matter,we conclude that a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.id.at.the court acknowledged that in limited contexts,such as incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal liberty,a special relationship between the state and the individual imposes on the state an affirmative duty to protect,but found that such a relationship did not exist between joshua and the state because the harm to joshua occurred while he was in his father custody.id.at.
moreover,in finding the state and its employees could not be held liable on the facts of the case,the court explained the state had not,by its actions,placed joshua in a more dangerous position 
while the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua faced in the free world,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.that the state once took temporary custody of joshua does not alter the analysis,for when it returned him to his father custody,it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual safety by having once offered him shelter.
id.at.among several circuits,including our own,this language generated a complement to the deshaney holding that has come to be known as the danger doctrine.bright westmoreland,cir.to establish a danger claim,plaintiffs must plead four elements 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct 
a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience 
a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and 
a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
morrow,wl,at quoting bright,at.in this case,we need look further than the first element of the danger claim.because the harm caused was not a fairly direct result of defendants actions,plaintiffs have not adequately pled a danger claim.
the first step of the danger analysis requires the harm to be a foreseeable and fairly direct consequence of defendants actions.to adequately plead foreseeability,we require a plaintiff to allege an awareness of risk that is sufficiently concrete to put the state actors on notice of the harm.phillips,at.we think the harm that occurred here was like
