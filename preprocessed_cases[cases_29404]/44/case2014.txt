spinnaker exploration company,joe nowiczewski,individually and doing business as nova consulting services,and white wing consultants appeal the denial of their motions for judgment as a matter of law jmol and new trial.those motions contest the jury verdict in favor of dalton arsement claims arising under the outer continental shelf lands act,ocsla applying texas law,concerning his being injured on an offshore drilling platform while employed by one of spinnaker contractors,production services phs.arsement did not respond to the motions,which were denied only three days after being filed.in the,the district court improperly prohibited additional motions being filed in district court.
for jmol spinnaker,the platform owner,claims arsement failed to prove liability against it under chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code chapter protecting property owners from liability to employees of contractors constructing improvements to owners real property two of spinnaker contractors,white wing and nova,claim arsement did not make the requisite showing of control for liability under redinger living,and nowiczewski claims no liability can attach to him individually unless nova,his sole proprietorship,is liable.concerning jmol for spinnaker,a key issue is whether,in its motion,it could rely for the first time on chapter.
for new trial,defendants claim the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and the district court erred by refusing a requested jury instruction as to the liability of arsement employer,phs.
jmol should have been granted to defendants.accordingly,we need not reach the new trial claims.the district court is again directed not to prohibit motions being filed in district court after it rules on motions.vacated and rendered.
when injured,arsement was employed as a welder by phs,an independent contractor engaged by spinnaker to refurbish an oil and gas production platform it owned and operated in the gulf of mexico.spinnaker engaged nova to identify needed refurbishments on the platform and ensure contract compliance for the installation of various products on the platform.nova,in turn,engaged white wing consultants to inspect the refurbishment project for safety and contract compliance.
arsement was injured on november,only his second day on the platform,during installation on the platform of a sump deck,a structure.the sump deck,measuring approximately by feet and weighing approximately six tons,was to be installed as the lowest of the platform three decks,below the production middle and main top decks.the sump deck had been brought to the platform location near the texas coastline and placed on a vessel along side the platform.two different plans were devised to install the sump deck.
plan a utilized the vessel.it was to take the sump deck under the platform and,using the vessel crane,lift the sump deck to the desired height.once the sump deck was at the level the lowest tier of the platform below the production deck,workers would pull it into place with pneumatic winches and weld it on the platform.
under plan b,the sump deck would instead be lifted,using the vessel crane,from the vessel to the main top deck of the platform.the main deck crane would then be used to lower the sump deck along side the platform to the level the lift.air tuggers attached to,and hanging below,the production middle deck would then pull the sump deck under the production deck and into place for welding.
plan b was selected.arsement was designated by menard,his phs supervisor,to be the signalman for the lift again,on only his second day on the platform.menard was not a certified crane operator.for the events leading to his injury,arsement gave the following testimony.
menard operated the crane on the main deck,with arsement signaling to menard from a stairwell on the outside of the platform,below the production deck.once the sump deck was lowered to the production middle deck level,arsement attached the air tuggers to the sump deck and returned to his signaling position below the production deck.after the sump deck had been lowered past his signaling position,however,several men moved to stand above him on the stairwell,inadvertently blocking arsement view of menard at the crane controls.on the other hand,menard testified arsement was never out of his line of sight.arsement asked the men to move,and they did move out of the way for a short time,but then moved back in his line of sight.when the men moved back,they began to yell about the emergency shutdown device esd line,which was near arsement position and which,if ruptured,would shut down the entire platform.these warnings,given by men in a superior vantage point to the esd line,made arsement worry the block attached to the crane line to steady its load and below which the sump deck was attached was about to hit and sever the esd line.arsement moved up several steps to get a better view.from this position,to avoid the esd line being ruptured by the block,arsement attempted to steady the block to do so,he lifted his foot above the handrail and used his foot to push the block out of the way.
once arsement foot was on the block,however,the crane stopped lowering without arsement instruction.on the other hand,menard testified he never stopped the crane.arsement felt he could not move his foot without causing the block to swing out and,when it swung back,perhaps destroy the esd line and handrail.therefore,arsement kept his foot on the block,steadying it he planned to signal the crane to start lowering again and then quickly remove his foot.the crane began lowering the deck again unexpectedly,however,without signal from arsement,so that he did not have time to react before his foot was caught in a pinch point between the crane block and the handrail and was injured.except for the injury to arsement,the lift was completed without incident.
as all parties agree,this is a texas situs oclsa action,applying texas law.see fruge parker drilling,cir,cert.denied,d ocsla adopts the law of the adjacent state.arsement sued spinnaker,white wing,and three nova entities nova ventures,llc nova technological services,and joe nowiczweski,individually and doing business as nova consulting services a sole proprietorship,the claims against two of the three nova entities were dismissed without prejudice,with the only remaining claims as to nova being against nowiczweski,individually and doing business as nova consulting services.
at the trial,arsement testified had expert testimony that plan a was safer than plan b and called as witnesses,among others,brown for spinnaker,mason for white wing,degroat by deposition for nova,and menard by deposition for phs.concerning his injury,arsement presented evidence,inter alia,that it caused a nerve damage condition called reflex sympathetic dystrophy,a permanent impairment.
at the close of arsement case in chief,each defendant moved for jmol under federal rule of civil procedure a.the motions were denied.defendants presented one witness,who testified about the nature of arsement injury.
during the charge conference,the district court refused defendants requested sole proximate cause instruction,which attributed all causation to phs.defendants renewed their jmol motions,pursuant to rule a,after the jury began deliberations.the motions were again denied.
in its verdict,the jury apportioned seven percent fault to arsement,with the remainder split equally between spinnaker,nowiczweski individually and doing business as nova,collectively,and white wing therefore,each was found percent liable.after discounting the judgment for arsement fault,the court entered a verdict in arsement favor for,inter alia,approximately million.in a separate order responding to defendants motion for remittitur,the district court confirmed the apportionment of liability but ordered a new trial unless arsement agreed to accept an award of,inter alia,approximately million.arsement did so.the district court entered final judgment on january.
on february,defendants moved for jmol pursuant to rule b.in doing so,spinnaker invoked chapter for the first time,claiming arsement did not present sufficient evidence for liability under the chapter.nova,nowiczewski,and white wing renewed their contentions that arsement did not prove liability against them.defendants moved,in the alternative,for new trial,claiming the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and the district court reversibly erred by refusing the requested sole cause instruction on phs liability.arsement did not file a response.the district court denied the motions by order signed on february three days after filing and entered four days later february.that order improperly prohibited filing additional motions in district court.
defendants contest the denial of jmol and new trial.because jmol should have been granted defendants,we need not reach their new trial claims.
prior to,texas common law controlled premises liability claims by an independent contractor employee injured while that contractor was performing work for either a premises owner or contractor.the texas supreme court has distinguished between two types of liability to which an owner or contractor may be exposed when a third party is injured on the property 
an owner or occupier of land or contractor has a duty to use reasonable care to keep the premises under his control in a safe condition this duty to keep the premises in a safe condition may subject the general contractor or owner to direct liability for negligence in two situations those arising from a premises defect,those arising from an activity or instrumentality.
redinger,at emphasis added.the standards for premises defect liability and negligent activity liability are different.redinger controls the latter.id.
a property owner or contractor was liable for negligent activity only if it controlled the independent contractor methods of work and failed to take reasonable care for such control.see id.at.rendered in,redinger adopted the restatement second of torts,holding although the general rule is that an owner or contractor does not owe an independent contractor a duty of reasonable care for the independent contractor actions,
o ne who entrusts work to an independent contractor,but who retains control of any part of the work,is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care,which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care.
id.citing restatement second of torts emphasis added.to trigger liability,the level of control exercised must be more than a general right to order the work to start or stop,to inspect progress,or receive reports.id.the texas supreme court further cabined control,holding a n employer who gives orders or provides detailed instructions on the means or methods to carry out a work order owes the independent contractor employee a duty of reasonable care to protect him from hazards.mendez,emphasis added.again,these common law rules applied to property owners and contractors alike.redinger,at.
in,however,the texas legislature enacted chapter to provide greater protection for property owners against both types of premises liability claims.as does the common law,chapter provides that property owners are not liable for injuries to employees of independent contractors working on the owner real property,or improvements to it,unless,first,the property owner exercises control over the manner in which the work is performed.see.civ.prac.ann.vernon.chapter narrows the property owner duty to an independent contractor,however,by further protecting the owner from liability unless he second,has actual knowledge of the danger resulting in the personal injury and third,fails to adequately warn of that danger.emphasis added.entities operating offshore oil and gas rigs,as in this action,are owners under chapter.francis coastal oil gas,dist,no pet.
it is undisputed that spinnaker owns and operates the platform and that arsement was renovating or repairing an improvement to it.therefore,spinnaker qualifies as an owner under chapter.it cited chapter in its jmol motion.
spinnaker contends arsement negligent activity claims against it are controlled by the chapter and arsement failed to make the requisite showing for liability.arsement responds that spinnaker can not invoke chapter because it failed to raise the chapter before final judgment.spinnaker replies that,on appeal,arsement may not raise his objections to spinnaker invocation of chapter in its jmol motion because arsement did not do so in district court in response to that motion.therefore,before we can consider liability vel non for spinnaker,we must determine whether chapter was raised at trial and,if not,whether spinnaker properly invoked the chapter in its rule b motion.
arsement asserts chapter can not apply to his claims against spinnaker because that theory of law was not raised at trial and because spinnaker did not mention chapter in the order,it may not do so,absent an amendment to the order.spinnaker replies that trial was based on texas premises liability law,and chapter is the law controlling property owners liability in these situations.spinnaker also maintains even if arsement properly raised the issue of forfeiture of chapter for trial,his forfeiture claim would be meritless because chapter requires no predicate pleading.
it goes without saying that a order controls the scope and course of trial a claim or issue not included in the order is waived,unless presented at trial without objection.e sobley southern natural gas,cir wallin fuller,cir.chapter was not cited in the order,but each of its elements were present.arsement specified his claims were brought pursuant to surrogate texas substantive law and contended defendants exerted control over the manner in which arsement performed his work defendants had actual knowledge or should have known that plan b was dangerous and one reason defendants were negligent was their failure to warn him about the danger of the lift.emphasis added.in that order,spinnaker contested arsement claim that it controlled his activities and stated spinnaker liability depends upon a finding of negligence.the order did not cite chapter,although,obviously,it is a part of texas substantive law,the term used in the order.again,the order did discuss the three elements for liability under chapter control,knowledge,and failure to warn.as noted,chapter requires actual knowledge unlike the standard,constructive knowledge is not sufficient.
trial was conducted applying negligence.for example,the following colloquy occurred at the conference 
defendants i understand the law to be,at least in texas proceeding,and we using 
the court well,is outer continental shelf lands act applying texas law 
defendants that exactly what this is,your honor.
the court all right.so what we applying is premises liability as articulated by texas law and restated in the second tort.
emphasis added.as noted above,redinger adopted the restatement second of tort for negligent activity premises liability cases.at.thus,it appears that the district court expected to employ principles of liability for all parties.
along this line,at trial,arsement questioned mason for white wing whether spinnaker failed to properly control,plan,coordinate and implement a safe plan for the work on its platform and around with multiple contractors and with personnel.further,at a conference during arsement case in chief,the following colloquy occurred 
the court the substance of the charge,what specific law are we applying is this brought under the outer continental shelf lands act and we applying contiguous state law 
arsement yes,your honor.
the court and so that will be texas law.
defendants correct.
finally,the jury instructions prepared by the court tracked generic negligence employed in personal injury actions.in other words,not even the elements for liability pursuant to redinger were stated.no party objected.
pursuant to the above discussion,chapter was not mentioned before spinnaker jmol motion and trial was conducted applying negligence for all parties.spinnaker contends even if chapter was not cited at trial,the trial was conducted nevertheless using texas premises liability law and chapter is the law applicable to premises owners,such as spinnaker,in actions like this.spinnaker maintains there is no duty to plead chapter affirmatively.arsement claims spinnaker can not introduce a new theory of law without filing a motion for leave to amend the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure b.
chapter plain language does not require an affirmative pleading.the chapter states it applies to claims for damages caused by negligence against property owners who own property primarily used for commercial or business purposes.civ.prac.ann.emphasis added.further,texas courts have found chapter is the exclusive remedy for negligence claims of the kind asserted by arsement against spinnaker.see dyall simpson pasadena paper,slip op.at,wl,dist.july motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc pending not yet reported plaintiffs required to surmount chapter for claims sounding in negligence against qualified property owners francis,at chapter precludes negligence claims.thus,as to spinnaker,the order invocation of texas substantive law and issues of control,knowledge,and failure to warn,and the court noting in the during trial the application of texas law,must involve chapter.
no predicate pleading is required to invoke that chapter.further,it had been in effect for four years before arsement injury.it goes without saying that every person is presumed to know the law,ramsey,cir presuming parties were aware of controlling statute passed four years earlier edwards,cir,cert.denied,d.although chapter was not cited prior to spinnaker jmol motion,several of its control and actual also present for liability and underlay the whole trial.
spinnaker first cited chapter in its rule b motion.in other words,it did not cite chapter as grounds for its rule a motions during trial.arsement did not file a response to spinnaker rule b motion.accordingly,he did not then object to spinnaker raising chapter for the first time.nevertheless,arsement maintains on appeal that spinnaker forfeited being able to rely on chapter in its jmol motion by not citing it in the order or at trial.spinnaker replies that arsement is precluded from taking this forfeiture position on appeal because he did not present it to the district court in response to spinnaker rule b motion.
if a party fails to raise an issue in its rule a motions at trial,it may not do so in its rule b motion.stores,cir.an exception occurs if the nonmovant here,arsement fails to raise this forfeiture claim in opposition to the rule b motion this failure precludes raising the forfeiture claim on appeal.thompson and wallace of memphis,falconwood,cir see also horton bank one,cir contentions not raised in district court can not be asserted for first time on appeal.because arsement failed to oppose spinnaker rule b motion,he is precluded from raising the forfeiture claim here.
although he did not present the following contentions in his brief,arsement made them at oral argument,concerning the district court being extremely prompt in denying the rule b motion and,in that,prohibiting additional motions.no authority need be cited for the rule that,generally,we do not consider an issue first raised at oral argument on appeal.that rule controls here but,because of the unusual nature of the proceedings,we feel compelled to at least present these contentions.even if we were to rule on them,they would fail.
the motion was filed on february.the district court was signed four days later on february filed february.obviously,because arsement never responded to the motion,he did not do so before the court ruled.
arsement suggested initially that the district court violated its own local rule by ruling on the motion before days had passed.although those rules allow a party days to respond to a motion,see.local a,there is no rule imposing deadlines on responding to motions.
next,arsement maintained it would be unduly harsh to apply the rule to a party who does not respond to a rule b motion when the court has ruled so promptly in that party favor.we reiterate the nonmovant must object in district court when the movant raises an issue in its rule b motion not presented in its rule a motions otherwise,the nonmovant fails to preserve the forfeiture issue for appellate review.
finally,arsement asserted that,after the district court ruled so promptly on the jmol motion,the court concomitant proscription against filing additional motions in district court prevented his doing so,including objecting to chapter being raised for the first time.as discussed in part.infra,arsement was still required to object,notwithstanding the court improper order.
because arsement did not respond in district court to spinnaker invocation of chapter,arsement forfeited his contention that spinnaker was precluded from raising chapter.spinnaker discussed chapter in detail in that motion.the district court did not address the chapter in denying jmol.of course,a reviewing court may employ the controlling law in reviewing the evidence when that law was presented to the district court,even if not employed by it.see,united states generes,d.
judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when a claim can not under the controlling law be maintained.a.chapter is the controlling law for arsement claims against spinnaker.therefore,we employ that chapter in our de novo review of the denial of spinnaker jmol motion.
accordingly,concerning jmol vel non,at issue is whether arsement presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find spinnaker liable under chapter and white wing,nova,and nowiczewski liable under the common law,as articulated in redinger.as discussed,the jury instructions did not state the controlling law as to spinnaker chapter or as to white wing,nova,and nowiczewski redinger.it is well established,however,that our review of the is not restricted to the law as stated in the jury instructions instead,our review addresses the separate question of whether there was sufficient evidence for a jury to reach its conclusion under the applicable law.see,lane sims,cir,at.
we review de novo a jmol denial,bellows amoco oil,cir,cert.denied,d.jmol is proper when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court concludes that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict.id.at.a.restated,we must affirm unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury verdict.a,lane,at.for our de novo review of a,we review all of the evidence in the record but may not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d citations omitted.likewise,the evidence,as well as all reasonable inferences from it,are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.lane,at.
chapter provides that property owners are not liable for personal injury claims by an employee of a subcontractor who constructs,repairs,renovates,or modifies an improvement to real property arising from the failure to provide a safe workplace.arsement maintains chapter does not apply to his claim because spinnaker provided an unsafe workplan,not the unsafe workplace necessary for a chapter premises liability claim.this contention is unavailing.arsement couched his claims in terms of general premises liability in the order and during trial.as noted above,premises liability can attach against a property owner for a premises defect or negligent activity.see redinger,at see also levrie department of army,cir.moreover,chapter applies to all claims for damages caused by negligence arising from the condition or use of an improvement to real property where the contractor or subcontractor constructs,repairs,renovates,or modifies the improvement.thus,chapter applies to premises defect claims the condition of an improvement to real property,see fisher lee and chang partnership,dist,pet.denied,and negligent activity claims use of an improvement to real property like the one presented by arsement,see francis,at.
again,chapter protections apply to a property owner unless three criteria are satisfied.for liability,the property owner must first exercise or retain some control over the manner in which the work is performed,other than the right to order the work to start or stop or to inspect progress or receive reports.the requisite control factor is narrowly construed the owner must control the mode or method of the contractor work.dyall,wl,at.in addition to control,the other two criteria are the property owner must have actual knowledge of the danger or condition resulting in the personal injury and it must have failed to adequately warn of this danger,emphasis added.
spinnaker is the owner and operator of the property upon which arsement was injured arsement is the employee of an independent contractor renovating an improvement to that property.therefore,concerning plan b,arsement had to prove spinnaker exercised control had actual knowledge of the danger and failed to warn.
arsement was injured while the sump deck was being installed pursuant to plan b.the procedure employed was a,because the crane cable holding the load,instead of being completely vertical along side the platform,would be pulled to the side under the platform when the sump deck was pulled under it by air tuggers.those involved in devising that plan were brown,spinnaker chief of production on the platform degroat,a nova employee mason,the white wing inspector and menard,arsement superior at phs.arsement claims spinnaker,through its agent,brown,controlled the planning of the installation lift and thus controlled the actual work procedure which caused arsement injury.to this end,arsement adduced the following evidence.
he testified brown had control over what materials were used,but never told arsement how to do his work arsement warned menard plan b was dangerous and menard insisted on the plan because brown and mason required it.
arsement expert,craddock,testified brown was responsible for overall safety on the platform brown had authority regarding the timing and performance of operations on the platform when multiple operations occurred at once brown was involved in the creation of plan b arsement did not plan the lift phs could not have changed the plan without brown approval in craddock opinion,brown was responsible for the safe performance of the lift and brown was responsible for the actions of the three men who,according to arsement testimony,impeded arsement view and thus his ability to safely perform the lift.
brown was the spinnaker employee in charge on the day of arsement injury.he testified a side lift was common on construction projects he had authority to prioritize platform activities and to modify existing procedures if he needed to,for safety reasons spinnaker procedure manuals instructed that the supervisor shall authorize the shutdown of any unsafe activity and these guidelines,if not followed,are grounds for termination.
mason was the white wing inspector present on the day of the injury.he testified brown had authority to shut down any procedure he thought unsafe neither arsement nor menard could have used spinnaker equipment without brown approval brown helped devise plan b mason knew of the possibility of the load or the block coming into contact with the outside rail of the platform and menard could have ordered the original plan plan a carried out if safety required.
a property owner can not be liable for injury to an employee of an independent contractor arising from renovation or improvement to real property unless the property owner retains control over the manner in which the work is performed,other than the right to order the work to start or stop.civ.prac.regarding plan b formulation,brown was present at the meeting to devise the plan and authorized the use of spinnaker platform crane instead of the vessel crane.brown authorizing the use of spinnaker equipment and having authority to stop unsafe actions from taking place merely constitute the right to order the work to start or stop not sufficient,without more,for the requisite control for chapter liability.
concerning the additional requisite proof,there is no evidence on exactly what was said at the planning meeting for plan a or at the meeting about three days later for plan mason testified that brown was aware of what was going to take place regarding the sump deck installation and had authority to shut it down if he thought it was unsafe,but the evidence is not conclusive on whether brown had further input into the details of how plan b would work.brown testified he was the production supervisor mason,the construction supervisor.further,there was no evidence that spinnaker had direct control of the implementation of plan arsement admitted that he only took orders from menard,his phs superior,and that spinnaker did not control his work.craddock agreed that arsement only took the orders and took the responsibility from menard,who was his supervisor.arguably,this is insufficient evidence for spinnaker controlling the mode or method of arsement work.
even assuming that spinnaker had sufficient control over the mode or method of the lift,no evidence was offered to show brown and thereby spinnaker had any knowledge,much less actual knowledge,of the danger resulting in the personal injury,as required by emphasis added.mason testified plan a was changed to plan b because the parties agreed plan a was unsafe and plan b was a safer alternative than plan mason also testified that another factor in devising plan b was the vessel being unavailable for the lift.brown testified he thought plan b could be safely implemented and plan a would have been more dangerous than plan b,because the vessel could not have put the sump deck at a level where the vessel crane could have operated safely without hitting any of the platform.arsement warned menard plan b was dangerous because it was a but,again,there was no evidence spinnaker was of that view.
there was not sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that spinnaker through brown had the requisite actual knowledge of the danger plan b resulting in the injury to arsement.spinnaker was entitled to jmol.
although chapter applies to spinnaker as property owner,fisher,at,it does not apply to general or independent contractors.as the parties agree,texas common law controls white wing,nova,and nowiczewski liability vel non.likewise,it is undisputed that the district court applied such law to arsement claims against them.
in this regard,white wing,nova,and nowiczewski maintain arsement failed to prove liability against them under the controlling precedent elucidated by the texas supreme court in redinger,and its progeny.arsement does not dispute that redinger controls instead,he maintains he adduced sufficient evidence in that regard.
arsement claims negligent activity premises liability against white wing,nova,and nowiczewski,because plan b was utilized.recovery on a negligent activity theory requires that the plaintiff be injured by or as a contemporaneous result of the activity itself.villegas texas department of transportation and rekca,antonio,pet.denied.
a contractor does not assume liability for another injury under a negligent activity premises liability theory unless that contractor has control over,and responsibility for,the premises.id.accordingly,if an independent contractor is in control of the premises,he is charged with the same duty as an owner or possessor.id.again,in describing the duty owed an independent contractor,redinger held 
the general rule is that a contractor does not have a duty to see that an independent contractor performs work in a safe manner however,when the general contractor exercises some control over a subcontractor work,he may be liable unless he exercises reasonable care in supervising the subcontractor activity.
at.thus,to prove negligent activity premises liability,an employee of an independent contractor must prove another contractor had some control over the employee work and failed to exercise reasonable care in supervision.thomas internorth,cir.
to prove control in absence of a contractual agreement,the employee must show the contractor actually exercised control over the manner in which the independent contractor work was performed.dow chemical bright.m erely exercising or retaining a general right to recommend a safe manner for the in
