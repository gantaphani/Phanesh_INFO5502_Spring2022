opinion of the court 
new jersey affidavit of merit statute the aom statute or simply statute,stat.ann.a,requires certain claims against professionals to include an affidavit from an independent professional attesting to the claims merit.we decide whether the aom statute covers nuveen municipal trust action seeking money damages for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and malpractice,allegedly committed by two professional firms.though typically we conceive such statutes as applying only to malpractice claims rooted in negligence resulting from harm to a known property,new jersey courts go further,making our answer yes.
background 
this case stems from a loan transaction between appellant nuveen municipal trust nuveen,on behalf of its nuveen high yield municipal bond fund,and bayonne medical center bayonne.on october,nuveen purchased a million bond anticipation note ban from bayonne.in connection with the transaction,bayonne provided nuveen with an audit report authored by bayonne accounting firm,withumsmith brown,withum,and an opinion letter authored by bayonne counsel,lindabury,mccormick,estabrook cooper lindabury.soon after the transaction,bayonne filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.nuveen contends that the audit report and opinion letter concealed aspects of bayonne financial condition and,had it known about these financial issues,it would not have purchased the ban.
nuveen filed this action against withum and lindabury collectively,appellees.it asserts negligent misrepresentation and fraud as to withum and negligent misrepresentation and malpractice as to lindabury the remedy it seeks throughout is money damages.the district court dismissed the action with prejudice based on nuveen failure to file an affidavit of merit complying with the aom statute.
after initially remanding the case to the district court on a jurisdictional issue,we issued an opinion in august nuveen mun.trust ex rel.nuveen high yield mun.bond fund withumsmith brown,cir.in it we held,inter alia,that the district court was correct in not affording nuveen certain procedural protections with respect to the aom statute.additionally,we stated that i f the aom statute applies to the action,we believe that nuveen noncompliance with it calls for the action dismissal.id.at.we questioned,however,whether the action was subject to the statute and thus reserved deciding whether the district court was correct to dismiss the action with prejudice.instead,we certified the following two questions of law regarding the statute to the new jersey supreme court.
whether the nature of the injury alleged in this case,the loss of money expended to purchase the ban from bayonne,falls within the aom statute coverage of any action for damages for personal injuries,wrongful death or property damage.specifically,is nuveen seeking recovery in this action for property damage as that term is used in stat.ann.a 
whether an action alleging an intentional tort,such as common law fraud or aiding and abetting common law fraud,which relates to alleged professional malpractice or negligence but does not require proof of malpractice or negligence,is subject to stat.ann.a 
judge aldisert dissented in part from our decision,contending that no certification was necessary,as the new jersey supreme court has been adequately clear on the points in question.in his view,nuveen action was subject to the aom statute and,consequently,had been correctly dismissed.
in,the new jersey supreme court denied our petition for certification.shortly thereafter,appellees filed a supplemental brief addressing additional new jersey state law and renewing their argument that an aom was required in this case and that we should affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
in this opinion we address what we did not in our august opinion essentially,whether the aom statute applies to nuveen action.in light of the new jersey supreme court denial of our petition for certification,we decide the question based on our best understanding of how the new jersey supreme court would rule.see sheridan ngk metals,cir a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to follow state law as announced by the highest state court if the state highest court has not decided the question,we must predict the position the court would take on the issue and should look to decisions by intermediate appellate state courts internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we conclude that because nuveen action can be characterized as one seeking recovery for property damage and requires proof of appellees deviation from professional standards of care,the aom statute applies and the action was properly dismissed under new jersey law.
ii.discussion 
the aom statute provides that an affidavit of merit is required in actions seeking damages for personal injuries,wrongful death or property damage resulting from an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a licensed person in his profession or occupation.n.stat.ann.a.the overall purpose of the statute is to require plaintiffs in malpractice cases to make a threshold showing that their claim is meritorious,in order that meritless lawsuits readily could be identified at an early stage of litigation.court gardner,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.court,the seminal new jersey case on the aom statute,sets out the following framework for analyzing whether the statute applies to a particular claim 
whether the action is for damages for personal injuries,wrongful death or property damage nature of injury whether the action is for malpractice or negligence cause of action and whether the care,skill or knowledge exercised or exhibited in the treatment,practice or work that is the subject of the complaint fell outside acceptable professional or occupational standards or treatment practices standard of care.
id.at alteration in original quoting stat.ann.a.the parties do not dispute that the complaint satisfies element.we only consider,therefore,whether nuveen allegations satisfy elements and.
nature of injury 
element requires us to address whether the money damages sought by nuveen in connection with its loan transaction with bayonne qualify as a claim for property damage required by the statute.nuveen,relying on couri,contends that it seeks only compensatory damages and related costs and,as such,is not asserting a claim for property damage.see id.at.the plaintiff there filed a complaint against his psychiatrist for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty resulting from the psychiatrist distribution of a preliminary report to the estranged wife of the plaintiff without his knowledge or consent.id.at.the plaintiff initially requested compensatory and punitive damages but later narrowed his request to the he had already paid the psychiatrist for the report and associated costs.id.at.the latter moved to dismiss,arguing that the claim was for malpractice and that the plaintiff had not filed the requisite affidavit of merit.the court rejected this argument,holding that because the damages sought were not damages for personal injuries,wrongful death or property damage,plaintiff claim did not satisfy the first element of the statute and no affidavit of merit was required.id.
unlike the plaintiff in couri,nuveen is not seeking to recoup money it has already paid to appellees.in fact,it has never directly dealt with appellees.instead,it seeks unspecified money damages stemming from its loan transaction with bayonne.
contrary to nuveen contentions,case law from lower new jersey courts comports with couri and supports the conclusion that the monetary recovery sought by nuveen is of the type that triggers the aom statute.cornblatt barow,rev on other grounds by,for example,squarely addressed the issue of whether a claim that a party alleged malpractice resulted in money damages was contemplated by the legislature as a claim for property damage under the aom statute.id.at.there the court held that 
m alpractice or negligence committed by architects,engineers,or attorneys may very well result in damage to real and personal property.personal property embraces everything that may be tangible or intangible such as a cho
