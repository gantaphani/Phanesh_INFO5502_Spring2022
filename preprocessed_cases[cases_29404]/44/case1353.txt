consolidation coal company consolidation petitions for review of a determination of the united states department of labor benefits review board the board that occupational pneumoconiosis hastened the death of claimant beatrice kramer deceased spouse,marion kramer kramer,who also suffered from metastasized colon cancer.because we conclude that the board october,decision and order affirming the award to claimant of survivor benefits pursuant to title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,et the act was supported by substantial evidence,including the competent opinion of the examining forensic pathologist,and was in accordance with the law,the petition will be denied.
kramer had more than years of coal mine employment,and the parties have stipulated that he suffered from occupational black lung disease,a form of pneumoconiosis during his lifetime,kramer claims for benefits were denied because testing conducted by consolidation examining physicians did not establish that kramer was totally disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment,as required for lifetime benefits.see et.
the act and its implementing regulations provide compensation and other benefits to living coal miners and their dependents where the miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis,and to miners surviving dependents where death is due to pneumoconiosis.for purposes of the act,death is considered due to pneumoconiosis if the disease was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to death.c.this term has been held to encompass situations in which pneumoconiosis actually hastened the miner death.see,shuff cedar coal,cir lukosevicz director,owcp,cir stating that the test is whether the black lung disease even briefly hastened the miner death 
at the time of his initial application for lifetime benefits in,kramer testified that shortness of breath interfered with his ability to continue employment,prompting his early retirement at age,and kramer internist was of the opinion that kramer was disabled by pneumoconiosis.the administrative law judge the alj decision concluded that kramer alleged shortness of breath was not totally disabling,based on testing performed by consolidation physician,gregory fino,whose diagnosis included pneumoconiosis.see september,decision and order granting benefits at.the last of kramer pulmonary function and blood gas studies was administered in,when kramer filed a duplicate claim,approximately years prior to his death shortly thereafter,kramer was diagnosed with cancer of the colon,which metastasized to his liver and then to his lungs.
following kramer death in october,cyril wecht wecht conducted an autopsy,reviewed kramer medical records,and concluded that kramer died due to adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with multiple metastases.wecht also concluded that kramer moderately severe pneumoconiosis was a substantial contributing factor to his death in that the presence of this secondary disease process further compromised kramer respiratory function and added to his cardiovascular burden.wecht explained that,were it not for the pneumoconiosis,kramer lung tissue would have been better able to maintain normal blood gas exchange,allowing kramer to compensate for a longer time for the respiratory burden caused by the lung tumors.kramer treating surgeon,michael reilly reilly,concurred in the conclusion that pneumoconiosis hastened death,noting that as a result of this condition kramer lung tissue was less capable of maintaining oxygenation and exchange than it otherwise would have been,so that kramer could tolerate and compensate for less tumor load than an individual with otherwise healthy lung tissue.
in the original hearing on claimant request for survivor benefits,consolidation submitted to the alj the medical opinions of its own pathologists,jerome kleinerman,joseph tomashefski,and richard naeye,and that of a pulmonary disease specialist,gregory fino each of consolidation experts concluded that kramer pneumoconiosis did not hasten death.as a basis for this conclusion each expert cited the absence of clinically significant lung dysfunction during kramer lifetime and the premise that kramer pneumoconiosis was a disease,one that does not worsen after a miner leaves employment.
in the decision and order granting benefits,the alj concluded that kramer pneumoconiosis hastened,and was therefore a substantially contributing factor in,kramer death,pursuant to c in so holding,the alj discussed the medical evidence in great detail and declined to accept the lifetime studies as dispositive.rather,the alj focused on the evidence of kramer pulmonary condition near the time of death.in addition,he expressly accorded less weight to consolidation experts because of the import they affixed to the lifetime studies on appeal to the board,consolidated contended,as it does before this court,that the alj erred in his weighing of the medical evidence and substituted his own judgment for that of the medical experts.the board rejected these contentions in toto and affirmed claimant entitlement to survivor benefits.we have appellate jurisdiction in this matter pursuant to a.
the determinations of the benefits review board are reviewed only for error of law and to assure that it has properly adhered to its scope of review.walker universal terminal and stevedoring,cir.the decision of the administrative law judge must be affirmed by the board if it is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.see b a see also smith,hinchman grylls,d oravitz director,owcp,cir appellate review thus necessarily entails an independent review of the record and a decision as to whether the administrative law judge findings were supported by substantial evidence.walker,at.substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.see richardson perales,d kertesz,at.
a claimant is entitled to survivor benefits pursuant to c if she demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the miner had pneumoconiosis arising from his employment and that the pneumoconiosis was a substantial contributing cause or factor as one which miner death.see a,c,and see also supra.
consolidation first asserts that all evidence attributable to wecht should have been disregarded because wecht failed to include a uniquely detailed description of his microscopic findings in his autopsy report.the microscopic findings portion of that report simply referred to findings consistent with the gross autopsy report in addition,a supplemental report contained a detailed,though standardized,description of his microscopic findings consolidated asserts that wecht use of a reference to findings consistent with the gross autopsy in his autopsy report,and his use of a standard description of microscopic findings in supplemental reports on pneumoconiosis,do not comply with statutory requirements and constitute a fail ure to provide a meaningful microscopic description of kramer lung tissue.see consolidation brief in support of petition for review at a requiring that an autopsy report include a detailed gross macroscopic and microscopic description of the lung.the alj and the board found that the autopsy report was consistent in form with the regulation.october,decision and order at citing dillon peabody coal,blr.
in dillon,the board held that while the alj should consider the quality standards found in section,the standards are not mandatory,and autopsy or biopsy reports can not be mechanically precluded from consideration solely because of failure to comply with those standards.to the contrary,in reviewing the autopsy evidence,the alj should determine whether the missing information is essential to the reliability or the probative value of the report and,where such information is,the alj may consider and accept the report.the board held that this determination can only be made by the alj,as,based on the unique facts of each case and that the alj is not limited to the four corners of the autopsy report in determining its reliability,but may look to other supportive documents in the record in an attempt
