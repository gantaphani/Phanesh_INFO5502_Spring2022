background 
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to appellants,the individuals opposing summary judgment.see mcadams.mut.life ins,cir.
mrc and related businesses 
mrc is a contractor that provides engineering services to the government of the united states.at all relevant times,mrc principal shareholders were members of the mclaughlin family andra,the daughter of mrc founder bruce and douglas mclaughlin,andra brothers and brandy,andra niece.andra son,conn,and another niece,morgan mclaughlin,also held shares in mrc,although they held far fewer shares than the aforementioned family members 
prior to appellants termination,the above individuals,with the exception of conn and the addition of harold,comprised mrc board of directors the board andra was chairman of the board harold,in addition to being a board member,was mrc president and chief operating officer and henry was the company executive.henry reported to harold,and harold reported directly to andra.
besides mrc,the mclaughlin family owned and operated several other businesses.one of those businesses was mclaughlin partners partners,a company created to provide services for a fee to the other mclaughlin businesses,including mrc.
as a government contractor,mrc had to follow a set procedure in order to receive payment from the government.before the beginning of each fiscal year,mrc had to submit a provisional budget to the government.the budget,which was based largely on a projection of mrc yearly expenses,would list the payments that mrc was to receive from the government during the year.mrc could adjust the budget at any time over the course of the year if its actual expenses differed from its projections.at the end of the year,a final accounting would determine whether the government owed mrc money or vice versa.
from to,mrc annual revenue fell from approximately million to million as a result,mrc reduced its workforce by more than half.moreover,in,appellants salaries were reduced by ten percent and they were not awarded bonuses for the first time since.in his deposition,harold testified that by,there was an undertone of anxiety amongst all mrc employees,including myself,about the possibility of being laid off.
harold and henry responsibilities 
as president,harold was responsible for the management,including the financial management,of mrc.harold had ultimate responsibility over the budget and its adjustment over the course of a given year.in other words,harold had authority over government billings and payments.in adjusting the budget,harold could make any expense unallowable,meaning that it would not be charged to the government.when harold had a question about whether an expense could be charged to the government,he sought the advice of a government auditor from the defense contract auditing agency dcaa.
harold was also responsible for reporting items of concern to andra and the board.he fulfilled that responsibility by regularly sending memos to andra.over the years,when harold discovered what he thought might be a fraudulent practice or a wrongful charge to the government,he reported it to andra in a memo.
although harold was ultimately responsible for the budget,it was henry who prepared the budget henry would submit a draft budget to harold for approval.henry,like harold,had the authority to revise the budget during a given year and make any expense unallowable.henry felt that he had a duty to report any problems he encountered to harold,who would then report them to andra and the board.indeed,in his deposition,henry testified i f somebody in the mclaughlin family were conducting fraud,m y responsibility would be to discuss it with harold,and h e would have to take it from there.
events pertaining to the litigation 
in june,mrc hired conn as its director of marketing before starting at mrc,conn worked for partners.a short time after conn arrival at mrc,harold and henry learned that he had been collecting a salary and benefits from both mrc and partners appellants then met with conn on more than one occasion to discuss the issue.during one meeting,harold informed conn that his actions were fraudulent and that he could be sent to prison.conn told harold that the issue was n one of his business.harold then threatened to discuss the issue with dcaa auditors.in response,conn allegedly said if you go to dcaa,i have you fired or you be fired.conn never mentioned the details of his conversations with appellants to andra 
during this period,andra hired james waddell waddell,a management consultant and her,to evaluate mrc senior and henry.as part of his evaluation,waddell interviewed a number of mrc managers.conn arranged for the interviews to occur while appellants were on vacation.in august,waddell submitted to andra a report that was critical of appellants management style 
on august,harold drafted a letter to andra concerning the conn issue.it stated,in relevant part 
recently it has been brought to my attention that conn has been receiving two salaries in that we are subject to dcaa a udits there could be a potential problem should dcaa auditors uncover this in that i recognize that this could be a potential problem,i am first bring ing this to your attention.i tried to discuss this with conn,but he would recognize the problem.i am looking to you to help me resolve this situation.
andra did not respond to the letter.neither harold nor henry took any further action with respect to the conn issue while employed by mrc.and,they did not discuss the issue with the government until may,almost two years after they were fired and subsequent to the initiation of this litigation.
on september,andra met with harold.at the meeting,andra allegedly said that she felt threatened by harold letter of august,and referred to it as the last straw.she then terminated the employment of harold and henry 
on december,appellants initiated this action.in their complaint,appellants asserted claims against mrc under the provisions of the fca,h,and the riwpa,laws et.appellants asserted that they were fired for,inter alia,complaining about conn receipt of dual salaries and benefits.following the close of discovery,mrc filed a motion for summary judgment,which was allowed.appellants now appeal that ruling,but only as it relates to conn receipt of dual salaries and benefits.
