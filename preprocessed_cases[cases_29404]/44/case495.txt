factual background 
in ruling on a motion to dismiss,a court must accept all facts of the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.aybar,cir.moss served as the camp head of archery during the summers of and.in october,moss received a letter from grabill informing him that his employment would not be renewed for the summer of.no reason for the decision was given,and moss had no prior indication of dissatisfaction with his efforts.grabill later told moss that he had received three complaints against him alleging inappropriate contact with boys at the camp.two of the complaints were made by parents directly to the camp the camp complaints a third complaint came through the state of new hampshire the state complaint.grabill refused to provide any detail regarding the identity of the complainants and only disclosed some purported partial details of one complaint.
grabill later told charles donovan,the camp assistant head of nature and bunk counselor,of the complaints against moss,stating that one came through the state of new hampshire.grabill also told donovan that he was concerned something like this would happen again and that the existence of three known allegations automatically implied the existence of numerous other unreported ones.despite moss requests for specific details,none were provided.moss also requested his personnel file from the camp pursuant to new hampshire revised statutes annotated i,but did not receive it or any documentation of any complaint against him.

discussion 
i.the defamation claim 
principles govern our disposition of this appeal.the issue on a motion to dismiss is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail,but whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence in support of his claims.scheuer rhodes,d,overruled on other grounds,davis scherer,d.dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d accord cooperman individual,cir.
because this case arises under our diversity jurisdiction,we look to new hampshire substantive law of defamation in applying these principles.under that law,t o establish defamation,there must be evidence that a defendant publish ed a false and defamatory statement of fact about the plaintiff to a third party.independent mech.contractors,gordon burke sons,citing restatement second of torts.moss complaint alleges two statements published by grabill to donovan are defamatory that grabill had received three complaints regarding moss concerning inappropriate contact with boys at the camp,including two from parents and one through the state of new hampshire,and that grabill was concerned that something like this would happen again and a total of three known allegations automatically implied the existence of numerous other unreported ones.we take up the two statements separately in the following sections.

defamatory meaning 
a statement is defamatory if it tends to lower the plaintiff in the esteem of any substantial and respectable group of people.nash keene publ g.the district court held that the statement about a complaint having come through the state of new hampshire could not reasonably be read to defame moss by lowering him in the esteem of others.it reasoned that the statement is not about moss but about the source of the complaint,that moss does not charge either that grabill said that moss had inappropriate contact with campers or that the state had investigated moss for having inappropriate contact.the court concluded that because grabill told donovan of no action or conclusion or statement of fact by the state,other than purely ministerial function of transmitting a complaint,grabill reference to the the state is immaterial,and could not reasonably be read as lowering moss esteem in the eyes of others.
this deconstruction of the complaint misses the nub of the complaint,to wit,that grabill falsely told donovan he had received complaints about moss having inappropriate contact with boys at the camp.the district court was right when it found the reference to the state to be immaterial,but its finding led it to the wrong conclusion.had grabill donovan that he had received a complaint through an unidentified source about moss having inappropriate contact with boys at the camp at which he served as a counselor,there could be no doubt that such a statement would lower him in the esteem of others.
in context,the phrase inappropriate contact with boys at the camp can be reasonably understood to mean either sexual or physical misconduct.because inappropriate contact is a common euphemism for child abuse,the statement is capable of defamatory meaning.it implies that moss is accused of criminal conduct involving moral turpitude,which some jurisdictions treat as slander per se without need of proof of special damages.see,calvert corthell,me explaining that,if proven,false statements imputing accusations of physical and sexual child abuse are defamatory per se huxen villasenor,so d,finding defamation per se where a parent falsely accused a teacher of physically abusing a student see also restatement second of torts.
moreover,the statement tends to disparage moss in a way that is peculiarly harmful to his professional reputation.moss alleges that he has worked for thirty years building his reputation as an archery coach and took great pride in treating his pupils professionally.he argues that the stigma of a child molestation accusation would severely impact his ability to work as an archery coach.it is axiomatic that an allegation of child abuse is peculiarly harmful to a professional working with children.statements that harm one professional reputation also constitute slander per se.ramirez rogers,me finding statements actionable per se where gymnastics school owner sued competitor for making false statements that plaintiff was under investigation for child abuse incidents at her school because the utterances adversely reflected on her business reputation see also restatement second of torts disend meadowbrook,reversing dismissal of a teacher defamation acti
