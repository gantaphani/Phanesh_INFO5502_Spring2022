in may,fifteen year old jennifer rivera was shot dead in front of her house in providence,rhode island,to stop her from testifying at a murder trial that she saw charles pona,the defendant in the trial,fleeing from the scene of the murder of hector feliciano in august of.her death has been avenged in one sense charles pona,who ordered her murder,was convicted of her murder in state court.charles pona was sentenced to life plus twenty years.
iris rivera,jennifer mother,seeks to avenge her daughter death in another sense.she filed a federal lawsuit alleging the police had violated jennifer constitutional substantive due process right to life by failing,after promising to do so,to protect jennifer from the danger posed by pona if she agreed to testify against him.she sued the providence police department ppd police officers matos and finegan and state assistant attorneys general white and page,whom she said acted directly to compel jennifer to testify the providence police chief urbano prignano for failing to train and properly supervise his officers and the city for having a policy and practice of not protecting endangered witnesses who were given assurances of protection in addition to her federal constitutional claims,the sole basis on which she is in federal court,rivera brings claims under rhode island law 
it would be inhumane not to feel a sense of outrage over jennifer death,or a sense of deep sympathy for iris rivera who has lost her daughter.but our question is one of federal law,not one of sympathy.the supreme court has said that only in very rare situations will the state failure to protect someone amount to a constitutional violation,even if the state conduct is grossly negligent.the court has cautioned that t he doctrine of judicial requires courts to exercise the utmost care whenever they are asked to break new ground in this field.collins city of harker heights,d.based on the facts alleged in the complaint,we conclude that this is not one of those rare cases.
the most difficult analysis involves those constitutional claims against the police officers and state attorneys who made the promises in fact,it may be that the officers made no promises or contingent promises at best.it may be that they intended to keep or tried to keep the promises,but were unable to guarantee jennifer safety.we do not know the defendants version of the events.they chose to test the plaintiff claims by motion to dismiss,so we must assume the truth of everything alleged by the plaintiff in the complaint.still,we conclude that the plaintiff has not stated a claim of violation of jennifer federal constitutional rights.for that reason,the claims against all defendants were properly dismissed.whether the plaintiff has some recompense under the laws of rhode island is another matter for rhode island to decide.whatever recompense there can be to jennifer and iris rivera,it is not to be found in this case.
we explain our reasons,starting with the allegations in the complaint.
we look only to the allegations in the complaint and take them as true,as required in a rule b motion.
on august,hector feliciano was shot to death in a vacant lot next to jennifer rivera home.fifteen year old jennifer rivera,who lived at congress street in providence,rhode island,heard gun shots,went to her kitchen window,and saw a dark skinned man scale the fence of the lot and drive away in a sport utility vehicle.at the request of a providence police officer,jennifer went to the police station that same day and signed a witness statement.
on august,at the request of feliciano family,she went to the police station a second time.she signed another statement and identified charles pona from police photographs as the man she saw fleeing the crime scene.on october,charles pona was arrested for the murder of feliciano.on november,he began serving a sentence on unrelated charges.
starting in november of,rivera was continually threatened with death if she agreed to testify as to the murder she witnessed.at this time,jennifer and her mother informed jennifer counselor of the death threats that she had been receiving.the ppd and providence police detectives were immediately notified of the threats against jennifer life if she were to testify about having witnessed the murder.
s oon thereafter,the ppd repeatedly assured her she would be safe.the ppd also informed defendants white and page,prosecutors in the attorney general office,of the threats against jennifer.
based on these promises of protection,jennifer agreed to and did testify at the grand jury hearing on november.
another fifteen year old boy testified at this grand jury hearing as well,apparently also identifying pona.that evening a passenger in an automobile pointed a gun at this boy sister and asked where her brother was.upon learning of these threats,the ppd placed the boy in a witness protection program that same day.
the threats against jennifer life,if she agreed to testify against pona,continued.specifically,police detectives matos and finegan were repeatedly informed of the death threats made against jennifer.on november,detective finegan confirmed that he had received the information regarding the threat and indicated that he would speak with jennifer.in january,a detective of the ppd contacted jennifer counselor to confirm that he was aware of the threats against jennifer life as a result of her willingness to testify about having witnessed the murder.
on march,charles pona was indicted on charges of murdering hector feliciano,and on april,he was released on bail after completing his sentence on unrelated charges.all defendants were aware of the release of charles pona.
on may,a subpoena was issued by defendants white and page to jennifer to appear in court at on may to testify in the murder trial of charles pona.white and page were aware of the threats being made against jennifer life if she agreed to testify.on may,the ppd notified jennifer that she was required to testify on may.as late as may,jennifer told the defendants white and page and a ppd detective that she was afraid to go to court because she would be killed.again,the defendants promised to protect her in order to secure her testimony.
as a result of the promises for protection,jennifer continued in her willingness to testify to what she had seen on the day of the murder and to identify charles pona at trial as the killer of feliciano.
on may,jennifer rivera was standing in front of her house when a young man with a hooded shirt stepped out of a car,grabbed her,and shot her in the head.dennard walker,pona half brother,shot jennifer and was convicted for her murder.on november,charles pona was convicted of jennifer murder and conspiracy to commit murder because he had ordered jennifer killed.
the complaint alleges that despite the repeated threats to jennifer life,her repeated requests for protection,and the defendants repeated assurances that they would protect her,the defendants took no action to protect jennifer including,among other things,failing to place her in the state witness protection program.rivera alleged that the defendants undertook a duty to protect jennifer by identifying her as a witness to the murder and taking her statement,promising to protect her if she testified,and subpoenaing her to testify before the grand jury and at the trial of charles pona,knowing that she was reluctant to testify without such protection because of the repeated death threats she had received.
the complaint also alleges that the city of providence and the ppd maintain legally inadequate training and supervision of employees,including the individual defendants,for protecting witnesses.
rivera alleged in the complaint that by failing to protect jennifer the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to jennifer constitutional rights and that the defendants conduct shocks the conscience.
defendants matos,finegan,white,and pagea.standard of review 
with respect to defendants matos,finegan,white,and page,the district court dismissed the case against them for failure to state a claim under.b.this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal of rivera federal claims.
for civil rights cases,unless the statute specifies otherwise,there is no heightened pleading standard.leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d educadores puertorriquenos en accion hernandez,cir.thus in adjudicating motions to dismiss under rule b,the district court must apply the notice pleading requirements of rule a.educadores,at.under that lenient rule,the complaint only needs to include a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.this statement must give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d educadores,at.
in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,a court must take the allegations in the plaintiff pleadings as true and must make all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see estremeda,cir.a complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.internal quotation marks omitted.still,notice pleading notwithstanding,rule b is not entirely a toothless tiger.educadores,at quoting dartmouth review dartmouth,cir.in substantive due process cases,the supreme court has held that such claims must be carefully scrutinized to determine if the alleged facts support the conclusion that the state has violated an individual constitutional rights.see collins,at.it is important to focus on the allegations in the complaint to determine how the plaintiff describes the constitutional right at stake and what the police officers and state attorneys allegedly did to deprive the plaintiff husband of that right.
this scrutiny of the complaint entails two separate inquiries.the first is whether the facts alleged state a claim for violation of constitutional rights.if such a claim is stated,there is a second inquiry as to whether the allegations meet the separate set of requirements as to particular categories of defendants to establish a claim within,the statutory provision on which suit is brought.because we find no cognizable claim of a violation of a constitutional right is stated,we uphold the dismissal of the case without reaching the second inquiry.
b.the existence of a constitutional violation 
the due process guarantees of the fourteenth amendment forbid the state itself from depriving a person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of laws.
in order to establish a substantive due process claim,the plaintiff must first show a deprivation of a protected interest in life,liberty,or property.see rhode island of correctional officers rhode island,cir macone town of wakefield,cir.it is not enough to claim the governmental action shocked the conscience.see washington glucksberg.the implication of a fundamental right is a threshold requirement for establishing a due process violation.the complaint alleges that jennifer was caused to be deprived of her life,a protected interest.
second,the plaintiff must show that the deprivation of this protected right was caused by governmental conduct.that is easily met when a government actor causes the injury,such as when police officers act under color of law.see martinez colon,cir to be sure,violence is attributable to state action if the perpetrator is acting under color of state law.it is much more difficult when the person who inflicts the injury is a private person.the due process clause acts as a check on the government,not on actions by private individuals.here,of course,the person who killed jennifer was a private individual.nonetheless,there are possible scenarios of government involvement with a private individual which amount to government example,if the police had handed the murderer the gun with instruction to shoot her,hemphill schott,cir,or assured pona that he could attack jennifer with impunity,dwares city of new york,cir.that is certainly not the case.the claimed governmental involvement in causing jennifer death was much more indirect the government is said to have enhanced the danger posed by a private individual and then failed to protect against this risk.
the supreme court has stated that as a general matter,a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.that is because the purpose of the due process clause is to protect the people from the state,not to ensure that the state protects them from each other.the clause is phrased as a limitation on the state power to act,not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security,id.at,because t he framers were content to leave the extent of governmental obligation in the latter area to the democratic political processes,id.at.
however,the court recognized that this general principle is not absolute in situations in which there is a special relationship,an affirmative,constitutional duty to protect may arise when the state so restrains an individual liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself,and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs.id.at.the affirmative duty to protect arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.id.this court has recognized that this relationship,and thus a constitutional duty,may exist when the individual is incarcerated or is involuntarily committed to the custody of the state.see monahan dorchester counseling,cir.
the supreme court also suggested,but never expressly recognized,the possibility that when the state creates the danger to an individual,an affirmative duty to protect might arise 
while the state may have been aware of the dangers that the plaintiff faced in the free world,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.by returning the plaintiff child to his abusive father,the state placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all.
deshaney,at.emphasis added.from this statement comes rivera argument that the due process clause is implicated when the state has played a role in creating the danger or has enhanced the danger to an individual at least three circuit courts have recognized the existence of a constitutional violation when,on particular facts,the state fails to protect against private violence under this state created danger theory.see kallstrom city of columbus,cir reed gardner,cir wood ostrander,cir.one circuit has flatly rejected the theory.see beltran city of el paso,cir.other circuits have discussed the theory.see pinder johnson,cir en banc.
this court has,to date,discussed the state created danger theory,but never found it actionable on the facts alleged.see coyne cronin,cir stating that the due process clause may be implicated where the government affirmatively acts to increase the threat to an individual of private harm hasenfus lajeunesse,cir where a state official acts so as to create or even markedly increase a risk,due process constraints may exist,even if inaction alone would raise no constitutional concern.ramirez,cir recognizing that a government employee can in a rare and exceptional case,affirmatively act to increase the threat of harm to the claimant or affirmatively prevent the individual from receiving assistance soto flores,cir discussing,as a possible exception to the general deshaney rule,a substantive due process violation when the state,through its affirmative acts,creates or greatly enhances the danger faced by the plaintiff from third parties souza pina,cir monahan,at.
even if there exists a special relationship between the state and the individual or the state plays a role in the creation or enhancement of the danger,under a supposed state created danger theory,there is a further and onerous requirement that the plaintiff must meet in order to prove a constitutional violation the state actions must shock the conscience of the court.see hasenfus,at in a state
