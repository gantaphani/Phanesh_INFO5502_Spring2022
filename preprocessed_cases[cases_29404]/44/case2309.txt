rosella hunt appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment against her on her claim against the board of education of the school district that employed her and the superintendent of that school district,karen mantia,alleging that the defendants violated her right to substantive due process by subjecting her to dangerous working conditions in her job as a teacher aide for special education students.on an field trip to a bowling alley,an autistic girl,a,assaulted hunt,rupturing disks in her neck.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,concluding that there was no affirmative action by the school district that endangered hunt.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on review of a grant of summary judgment,we take the facts in the light most favorable to hunt.
hunt was hired in as an educational assistant,or teacher aide,helping with special education children in the sycamore community school district.in her first year,she was injured when an autistic child attacked her and she fell to the ground,cracking her elbow.
in,hunt was assigned to work in the classroom where an.autistic.at that time and weighed over pounds.she had a history of assaultive behavior,as shown by the incident reports appearing in the record.there is a dispute about how many reports there are,but the school district contends the number is,up to and including the date of hunt injury.these reports show numerous injuries to the people taking care of a,including injuries caused by biting,kicking,hitting,and scratching.the reports extend from march through december,and they indicate that at least some of the people taking care of frustrated with the situation.for instance,one victim answered the incident form question what is being done to prevent this type of incident from happening in the future a nothing that i can see.this behavior of just goes on on.
the record indicates that the school district had a system for information on such incidents to be collected and ultimately addressed through a disabled child individualized education program and a behavioral intervention plan.indeed,the district initiated a behavioral intervention plan for november.
in the school year,before being assigned to a classroom,hunt heard from two aides and a bus driver that,kicked,and bit other students and staff and had injured an aide.during the school year,hunt saw and hit priscilla masters,her teacher,and two aides.such a problem on the school bus that the junior high school assistant principal hired hunt to ride the bus with her to keep her from hurting other people and to make her get off the bus when they got to school.hunt received extra pay for that assignment.on october,while riding the bus,hunt in the back and bit her hand.
on december,there was an field trip of the partners club at a bowling alley.the partners club paired special education students with other children for social activities.hunt volunteered to help at partners club events and received extra pay for doing so.she and been at the bowling alley with the partners club before.on this occasion,there were two teachers and two aides along to supervise.when into another bowling lane and began trying to hit a child from another school,hunt went to intervene.her in the chest and pulled a lanyard around hunt neck,choking her.hunt heard her neck pop.hunt was injured and has been diagnosed with two herniated disks in her neck.
hunt sued the sycamore community school district board of education,its superintendent,karen mantia,and a parents for violation of her federal rights under and for negligence.her section claim was for violation of her right to personal security and bodily integrity by failing to provide or maintain a workplace that was free of foreseeable and unreasonable risks of physical harm.she alleged that the school district and mantia knew that the injury she sustained was substantially certain to result from the way the school district had chosen to handle a.the school district and the superintendent moved for summary judgment.
the district court examined whether the school district could be liable under based on the danger doctrine.the district court held that there was no danger in this case for two reasons the mere act of permitting a to attend or not prohibiting her attendance at the extracurricular event is not an affirmative act that can support a danger claim,and hunt attended the bowling alley event voluntarily despite knowing that a had attended past partners club bowling events and despite knowing firsthand about a physically aggressive behavior in other situations.the district court specifically declined to decide the questions of the schools district liability under monell and the school superintendent supervisory liability because it held there was no underlying constitutional violation.
the district court entered summary judgment for the school district and the superintendent.hunt then settled the case against a parents,which was dismissed with prejudice.she now appeals from the final judgment against her.
the standard of review for summary judgment is de novo.sperle.dep t of,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
ii.substantive due process and the danger doctrine.
to establish a cause of action under,hunt must marshal evidence that could establish two elements deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states caused by a person acting under color of state law.mcqueen beecher cmty,cir.the right hunt contends was violated was her right to substantive due process.in a claim predicated on a due process violation,there is a certain redundancy in the two elements both require a link between the injury and the government,since the due process clause is not violated by purely private wrongs.see deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.
hunt contends the school district actors violated her due process rights by providing and maintaining a workplace in which likely to and did in fact injure her.n othing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.id.a governmental actor may,however,violate the due process clause by allowing a third party to harm a person in government custody,see id.at.stemler city of florence,cir,or by creating a particular danger to the victim.this latter theory of liability,which the supreme court adverted to,but did not espouse,in deshaney,see at,has been recognized in this circuit as a viable species of substantive due process claim.kallstrom city of columbus,cir.under the danger doctrine,a governmental actor can be held responsible for an injury committed by a private person if 
an affirmative act by the governmental actor either created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be exposed to the injurious conduct of the private person 
the governmental actor act especially endangered the plaintiff or a small class of which the plaintiff was a member and 
the governmental actor had the requisite degree of culpability.
mcqueen,at.
of these three elements,we will focus on the question of culpability in mcqueen,the court explicitly stated that the level of culpability for the danger doctrine is that level that would suffice to establish a substantive due process violation.id.at.
iii.substantive due process culpability.
the leading case on the standard of culpability in substantive due process cases based on executive action is county of sacramento lewis,d.in lewis,the supreme court considered whether the personal representatives of a boy who was killed in a car chase established a claim for a substantive due process violation against a sheriff deputy and others by alleging that the deputy caused the boy death through deliberate indifference or reckless disregard for the boy life.justice souter discussion defined the issue as a question of whether the executive action of engaging in the car chase was arbitrary 
since the time of our early explanations of due process,we have understood the core of the concept to be protection against arbitrary action we have emphasized time and again that t he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,whether the fault lies in a denial of fundamental procedural fairness or in the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective 
our cases dealing with abusive executive action have repeatedly emphasized that only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense 
at.citations omitted.
justice souter then said that the cognizable level of executive abuse of power is conduct that shocks the conscience.id.at.the conscience is not always shocked by the same level of culpability,however,so we can not equate the standard with any traditional category of fault,such as intent or negligence.id.at.we can say that mere negligence is definitely not enough and that conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any governmental interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.id.at.but the middle states of culpability,such as recklessness,gross negligence,or deliberate indifference,may or may not be shocking depending on context.id.at.deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another,and our concern with preserving the constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an exact analysis of circumstances before any abuse of power is condemned as conscience shocking.id.at.
the circumstances the supreme court found determinative in lewis were that the situation call ed for fast action and the deputy had obligations that tend ed to tug against each other,specifically,the duty to restore and maintain lawful order,on the one hand,versus the duty to avoid creating danger by engaging in a chase.id.at.the supreme court declined to make the governmental actor choice between legitimate obligations into a constitutional issue.ultimately,the supreme court held that even if the deputy was alleged to have acted with deliberate or reckless indifference,the complaint did not allege a substantive due process claim because it did not allege that he had acted from any motivation other than a legitimate law enforcement purpose of apprehending a suspect.id.at.accordingly,we hold that chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability under the fourteenth amendment,redressible by an action under.id.at.
as we shall explain below,when executive action is worse than negligent but was not done for the purpose of injuring someone or in furtherance of invidious discrimination,see upsher grosse pointe pub.sch,cir,lewis and later cases interpreting it have identified several considerations that bear on whether the action will be considered arbitrary,including the voluntariness of the relationship between the government and the plaintiff,especially whether the plaintiff was involuntarily in government custody or was voluntarily a government employee whether the executive actor was required to act in haste or had time for deliberation and whether the government actor was pursuing a legitimate governmental purpose.
a voluntariness of plaintiff relationship with government actor and assumption of risk.
lewis recognized that cases in which the plaintiff is in government custody present a demanding standard of behavior for governmental actors.where the victim is in government custody,deliberate indifference to that person medical needs is.at.the victim dependence on the state,his inability to provide for his own needs,and the involuntariness of his situation require the government to take care of the prisoner.id.at.farmer brennan,d.we applied this concept of custody to a case in which the victim was not literally a prisoner,but was incapacitated by intoxication when the police physically picked her up and put her in the truck with a drunk and abusive man,which led to her death.stemler city of florence,cir.even without proof that the police intended to hurt the victim,their deliberate indifference to the known risk established the necessary culpability for a substantive due process claim.
on the other hand,cases in which the plaintiff is a government employee suing for injuries received in the line of duty present the opposite situation in terms of voluntariness of the relation therefore,such claims are particularly unlikely to succeed.see generally witkowski milwaukee county,cir n o decision in the seventh circuit or in any circuit after collins harker heights,d has awarded damages under to a public employee injured in the line of duty.
the leading case concerning government employees is collins harker heights,d,in which a city allegedly failed to train its employees or provide them with equipment necessary for entering sewer lines,and an employee died of asphyxia after entering a manhole to unstop a sewer line.the fifth circuit denied liability,relying on the fact that the plaintiff decedent was a government employee,but the supreme court said,the employment relationship,however,is not of controlling significance,because the city could have committed a due process violation if it had,for instance,given an employee a dangerous assignment to punish him for exercising his first amendment rights.id.at.however,failure to provide the plaintiff decedent a safe working environment was not something due process protected against 
petitioner submission that the city violated a federal constitutional obligation to provide its employees with certain minimal levels of safety and security is unprecedented.it is quite different from the constitutional claim advanced by plaintiffs in several of our prior cases who argued that the state owes a duty to take care of those who have already been deprived of their liberty.
id.at.failure to provide a safe working environment is not,in a constitutional sense,id.at,because it is not arbitrary.the court concluded 
our refusal to characterize the city alleged omission in this case as arbitrary in a constitutional sense rests on the presumption that the administration of government programs is based on a rational decisionmaking process that takes account of competing social,political,and economic forces.walker rowe,cir.decisions concerning the allocation of resources to individual programs,such as sewer maintenance,and to particular aspects of those programs,such as the training and compensation of employees,involve a host of policy choices that must be made by locally elected representatives,rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of government for the entire country.
while it has not proved impossible for government employees to establish arbitrariness of their employer,such claims have,for the most part,not succeeded in this circuit.in a danger case in which public employees prevailed against their employer,we determined that police had a due process claim against the city for endangering them by releasing information that would make it easier for third persons to harm them.kallstrom city of columbus,cir.in contrast,in other cases in which the harm to a government employee was inflicted by third persons,we have held that there was no danger.in nobles brown,cir,we held that a government employee could not recover when hurt by a third person in the line of duty.in nobles,a prison guard was taken captive and raped by a prisoner.we noted that the defendant officials were charged with having played a part in creating the dangers faced by the plaintiff,and so nobles was distinguishable from deshaney.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that the guard rights had not been violated because it was not the government officials,but a prisoner who raped the guard.id.at.we quoted walker rowe,cir,which said that even deliberate exposure of public employees to high risk does not violate the constitution because it is not an abuse of government power.nobles,at internal quotation marks omitted.accord sperle.dep t of,cir see also hayes vessey,cir claim by prison teacher against prison officials based on rape by inmate failed for lack of intentional governmental act.
a case from outside the doctrine shows that a government agency provision of an unsafe workplace to its employees is particularly unlikely to shock the conscience.in upsher grosse pointe public school system,cir,after a contractor refused to rip up carpet from asbestos tile because of the danger from the asbestos,a school district decided to use its custodians to do the work instead,with virtually no safety precautions.t he plaintiffs chiseled,chipped,pounded,pulverized,hammered,and jack hammered the tiles id.at.the custodians were massively exposed to friable asbestos and sued the school district under for substantive due process violations.we upheld summary judgment for the school district,stating a very stringent culpability standard 
this court made clear in lewellen metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county,cir that in a setting,in order to establish liability for violations of substantive due process under,a plaintiff must prove that the governmental actor either intentionally injured the plaintiff or acted arbitrarily in the constitutional sense.the lewellen court expressed doubt as to whether,in a case,deliberate indifference could give rise to a violation of substantive due process.we point this out because the district court,in ruling on the defendants initial motion for partial summary judgment,stated that t he claim could possibly go forward as a case of deliberate indifference.we believe the more exact standard,announced in lewellen,is that in order to succeed on a claim in a setting,a plaintiff must prove either intentional injury or arbitrary conduct intentionally designed to punish,giving a worker a particularly dangerous assignment in retaliation for a political speech or because of his or her gender.or,as stated in stemler,at,a plaintiff must prove conscience shocking behavior.
at emphasis added and citations and some internal punctuation omitted.thus,the distinction between custodial settings and voluntary relationships such as employment was considered to be the determinative factor in setting the culpability level for a substantive due process claim.
although not discussed explicitly in upsher,the concept of assumption of risk is relevant in the public employee cases where the employee was hired to perform an inherently dangerous job.assumption of risk is closely akin to the voluntariness factor that distinguishes governmental action towards persons in custody from governmental action government employees.in walker rowe,at,a case the supreme court cited in collins,at,and we cited in nobles,at,judge easterbrook relied on the fact that guards signed on for a dangerous job 
the state may not dragoon people to be guards.guards,represented by their labor unions,may decide to accept a little less safety in exchange for a little higher pay.having decided that the combination of pay,benefits,and safety is satisfactory,the guards can not turn around and say that the constitution required that safety be a larger component of the total package.
at.accord washington dist.of columbia,the state did not force appellant to become a guard,and the state has no constitutional obligation to protect him from the hazards inherent in that occupation.we relied on similar reasoning outside the government employment context in our case of jones reynolds,cir,cert.denied,d,where police showed up at a drag race,and one of the racers decided to back out of the race until the police reassured the crowd that they did not come to arrest anyone.in fact,the police stayed and played rap music over their car system for the delight of the crowd.there was a crash and bystanders were killed.id.at.the court held that the police had not increased the risk to spectators.judge sutton wrote,when a victim bears some responsibility for the risks she has incurred,it is even more difficult to say the state has created the danger to her by its affirmative acts.id.at.while this analysis is directly relevant to whether the requirement of an affirmative act has been satisfied,the same facts also bear on the culpability of the government actors.but kallstrom,at rejecting argument that city could require officers to waive constitutional protections as condition of employment.
the reluctance we have shown to create constitutional torts in the public employment context received validation in the supreme court recent decision in engquist oregon department of agriculture,d.there,the supreme court held that an equal protection cause of action based on arbitrary conduct against a class of one would not extend to claims of government employees against their employers.id.at.while public employees do not surrender their constitutional rights in entering public employment,those rights must be balanced against the realities of the employment context.id.at.it would be particularly disruptive of governmental operations to subject employment decisions based on characteristics unique to an which are by their nature subjective and constitutional rationality review.decisions discriminating against identifiable classes of citizens,such as racially discriminatory firings,are more easily judged against a clear standard that enables governmental employer and courts alike to distinguish the permissible from the impermissible.id.at.although we must bear in mind the supreme court statement in collins that public employment is not determinative in assessing due process liability for acts,at,engquist at least gives us pause when asked to constitutionalize the school district alleged misjudgments in choosing between service to its students and solicitude for its employees.
b need for haste or opportunity for deliberation by government actor.
in lewis,the supreme court stated that executive officials are held to a higher standard when they have the leisure to deliberate about a decision than when they have to act instantaneously.at.justice souter reasoned that indifference to a prisoner medical needs could be when the governmental actor actually had the time to deliberate but chose not to care for or protect the prisoner 
nor does any substantial countervailing interest excuse the state from making provision for the decent care and protection of those it locks up the state responsibility to attend to the medical needs of prisoners or detainees does not ordinarily clash with other equally important governmental responsibilities.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,when prison officials are reacting to an emergency,indifference will not be because the importance of competing obligations and of deferring to decisions made in haste and under pressure make the court view the officials actions more leniently.id.at.like prison officials facing a riot,the police on an occasion calling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug against each other.id.at.justice souter therefore concluded that deliberate indifference to the risk was not enough to make a cause of action against the police who engaged in a dangerous chase in lewis.id.at.in contrast,where there is the opportunity for reflection and unhurried judgments,we have stated that government officials could be liable upon a showing that they were subjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiff.mcqueen beecher cmty,cir arledge franklin county,cir.
this discussion about decisions made in haste and under pressure is a corollary to the theme that bad government decisions are not due process violations unless they are arbitrary,meaning that there is no legitimate reason for them.the need to act in haste is itself a governmental purpose that can justify executive actions that,if made at leisure,might appear irrational or arbitrary.see claybrook birchwell,cir.thus,conduct that might offend under a deliberate indifference test may still not be considered arbitrary if it was undertaken for a legitimate governmental purpose in a crisis requiring immediate response.
c countervailing governmental purpose.
where the substantive due process claim arises out of a governmental actor attempt to discharge duties which it is required by law or public necessity to undertake,courts are particularly unlikely to find the action arbitrary,even if the actor was imprudent in choosing one legitimate goal over another.see lewis,at.this circuit discussed the need to allow governmental actors to balance competing governmental obligations in schroder city of fort thomas,cir.there,the parents of a child killed by a speeding car sued the city on the theory that it violated substantive due process in setting the speed limit on their street and in failing to enforce the limit.we said that the plaintiffs had not established any of the elements of the danger doctrine.in particular,the city was not culpable enough to shock the conscience,for in setting and enforcing a speed limit,the city was obliged to choose between and among competing policy options.id.at.even creating a known risk in the process would not satisfy the culpability standard for substantive due process.id.similarly,in mitchell mcneil,cir,an allegation that the city of memphis had a policy of police lending their cars to confidential informants,one of whom killed the plaintiffs child,did not rise to the culpability level required for a substantive due process claim.the city use of informants with criminal proclivities,though certainly not without risk to the public,was undertaken for the legitimate purpose of fighting crime.id.at.the policy did not shock the judicial conscience.id.
some authority from this circuit indicates that whether the required culpability level is intent to harm or subjective deliberate indifference depends entirely on whether the situation is an emergency or allows time to deliberate.see ewolski city of brunswick,cir claybrook,at.but see draw city of lincoln park,cir stating flat intent to harm requirement in case that presented no obvious need for hasty action upsher,at stating that intent to harm or punish is required in all cases,without mentioning factor.as the rule is articulated in these cases,if the situation is an emergency,the heightened intent standard would apply,and if there is time to deliberate,the lower deliberate indifference standard would apply.see ewolski,at.superficially,this dichotomy might seem to preclude taking account of whether or not the government actor is or is not motivated by a countervailing legitimate purpose.if countervailing purposes could not be taken into account,in,situations,a government actor choice could shock the conscience because he knowingly risked a person life,even where he picked the lesser of two evils.by this reasoning,a policeman could not risk one person life to save ten others.scott clay county,cir in applying objective test for use of excessive force under the fourth amendment we balance the severity of the suspect crime,the threat to others safety,and whether the suspect is actively evading or resisting arrest.the outcomes in our cases do not support such an interpretation.as ewolski demonstrates,some scenarios facing police or other governmental actors require agonizing choices,even if those choices do not have to be made in split seconds.in ewolski,police had to choose whether to intervene aggressively in a crisis or to continue a.they chose to intervene,which led to a disaster when the hostage taker killed one of the hostages.we held that,even though the police chief was subjectively aware that aggressive intervention might result in harm to the hostages,he also had reason to believe that delaying could have led to such harm.ewolski,at.therefore,even if he made a bad choice,his action was not deliberately indifferent and therefore did not shock the conscience.id.at.for us to find deliberate indifference,therefore,we must find not only that the governmental actor chose to act or failed to act despite a subjective awareness of substantial risk of serious injury,but we also must make some assessment that he did not act in furtherance of a countervailing governmental purpose that justified taking that risk.after all,farmer brennan,d,defines deliberate indifference in terms of excessive risk,indicating that the need for the risk is being balanced against countervailing considerations.id.at.deliberate indifference standard incorporates due regard for prison officials unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions internal quotation marks omitted.thus,even where the governmental actor is subjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm,we will be unlikely to find deliberate indifference if his action was motivated by a countervailing,legitimate governmental purpose.
a recent second circuit decision pondered this problem.in lombardi whitman,cir,workers at the world trade center site alleged that the epa had made misleading statements that lulled the plaintiffs into not protecting themselves from the health risks posed by the pollutants at the disaster site.the second circuit said the standard should not depend on whether the epa decisions were hurried or unhurried,since that is not the whole story.the statements characterized as misleading were meant to calm the public to encourage people to return to their normal lives.id.at.
hurried or unhurried,the defendants were subjected to the pull of competing obligations the complaint thus recognizes what everyone knows that one essential government function in the wake of disaster is to put the affected community on a normal footing,to avoid panic,keep order,restore services,repair infrastructure,and preserve the economy.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.the second circuit concluded that substantive due process liability should not be allowed to inhibit or control policy decisions of government agencies,even if some decisions could be made to seem gravely erroneous in retrospect.id.at.since the government was acting for the benefit of the public,even a deliberate choice made with knowledge that it would endanger the plaintiffs health would not shock the conscience.id.at.the conscience recognizes the dilemma of conflicting obligations.id.at.
granted,ewolski intimated that there is some limit on the governmental actor choice between legitimate goals,since ewolski refused to hold that police could take any risk with the lives of hostages in an armed standoff situation,as long as they did not act maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.at.however,the case in which a governmental actor choice between legitimate governmental purposes would shock the judicial conscience would have to be quite extreme,since we roundly criticized the police chief choice in ewolski,but we did not find he had committed a substantive due process violation.id.at.certainly,where the governmental actor was animated by a countervailing purpose that was a mandatory duty imposed by federal law or the constitution,the possibility of his action shocking the judicial conscience is remote.in such cases,while we may disagree with the governmental actor choice,the necessity of the choice was foisted upon him by federal law,and we have been loathe to hold that one clause of the constitution is violated by executive action taken in furtherance of another clause or in obedience to another command of federal law.
this circuit has held as much in several cases where we have said that we will not place governmental actors in a catch situation by imposing substantive due process liability for failure to do an act that might itself have exposed the actor to liability on another theory.we said in bukowski city of akron,cir,that there was no due process violation where the plaintiffs contended the police should have detained their daughter against her will to protect her,but doing so could have made the police liable for depriving her of her liberty.under the legal theory adopted by the plaintiffs,the defendant officials would have violated the constitution no matter how they acted.id.accord may franklin county comm rs,cir cartwright city of marine city,cir see also deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d in defense of the state officials it must also be said that had they moved too soon to take custody of the son away from the father,they would likely have been met with charges of improperly intruding into the relationship,charges based
