background 
when reviewing a grant of judgment as a matter of law,we are obliged to take the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,and must defer to the jury assessment of the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn from it.see realty dev,cir.our recitation thus states the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff,and is drawn in relevant part from the evidence heard by the jury.
meloff began her employment as a clerk typist in new york life philadelphia office in,and received periodic promotions over the years.she transferred to the new york office in and became a staff assistant in the central services office.in,she was promoted to administrative assistant,a position later reclassified as staff consultant,and then service consultant.meloff did not receive another promotion after.she continued to reside in philadelphia and commuted to work in new york by train.
meloff inquired in october about further promotional opportunities and learned from her supervisor,frances donnelly,about a service center pilot project.after receiving assurances from jim mellbye,a corporate vice president for that unit,that promotions were possible,she transferred in november.despite assuming supervisory duties,she was not promoted,and she became increasingly frustrated.at her annual evaluation in november,at which she received a favorable review,she expressed her disappointment to john begley,her immediate supervisor.meloff told begley men less qualified than she were receiving promotions and that sex discrimination was to blame.she testified that she told begley men in her group are being promoted every day for lesser skills and lesser accomplishments.i felt that i was being discriminated against with all the accomplishments that i had had.she named several men who she believed were promoted during the time she was not promoted,although she admitted on cross that the men she named always occupied higher positions than she did.meloff told the jury she believed she was being discriminated against because 
for the first time since i arrived at the home office i was now supervising a group of people.my job description clearly stated that there were no supervisory responsibilities and men with lesser skills and accomplishments were being promoted on a more regular basis and i was told that the last piece of my puzzle to attain my promotion from begley and mellbye would be to make the dallas phone center a success,and it was.
begley explained to meloff on december,that she would not receive a promotion because mellbye did not think meloff position warranted one.meloff told begley she was being discriminated against and that she would talk to a lawyer.meloff spoke with mellbye on december,and she again complained of discrimination.mellbye stated it was customary for him to report any complaints to his supervisor,richard koontz.within the month,koontz fired meloff for misusing her corporate american express card during a period when she charged her personal travel expenses without reimbursing the company.
meloff received her corporate american express card in april and signed a contract stating meloff would indemnify and hold harmless new york life from any and all personal expenditures the new york life personnel manual corporate credit card section states,t his card is to be used for business purposes only.use of the card for personal expenditures is prohibited misuse or abuse of the card may result in revocation of the card and disciplinary action.meloff testified that she never saw this material,although she did consult the manual from time to time about other matters.on two occasions in late or early,meloff spoke with barbara fagnano,then an assistant vice president in consumer affairs,about charging personal trips.meloff learned from fagnano that she could obtain a credit memorandum from alice orisino,supervisor of the transportation department,and submit it along with a reimbursement check.
beginning in january,meloff used the card to pay for her monthly amtrak commuter ticket.both personal and business travel expenses were centrally billed to new york life,while other expenses were billed to the cardholder.meloff reimbursed the company for her travel through march,and the company treasury department accepted the reimbursement check and accompanying documentation.she continued to charge the company for her commuting expenses through december without making any reimbursement payments.meloff blamed the oversight on a heavy travel schedule and illness in her family.she testified that she recognized her mistake and wrote a check for before she went on vacation in late december.she left the check in her apartment.on january,she returned from vacation and went directly from the airport to work.she did not have the check with her.
when meloff arrived at the office that morning,larry contello,a budget coordinator,confronted meloff about her credit card charges and informed her that new york life did not allow personal charges nor did it have a procedure for reimbursement.meloff replied that she was unaware of any such restrictions.she obtained a reimbursement form from orisino but was told that new company policy required a supervisor signature.meloff then spoke to mellbye 
i explained the whole situation of what had happened,that due to the heavy travel burdens and the onus of my family that i had been behind in my commuter pass payment and that i had a check that i wrote for and i wanted to present it to alice orisino to get the credit memorandum and i was told now because of a new procedure i had to get mellbye to sign off on this credit memorandum.
mellbye said he would have to check to make sure he had authority to sign,because the credit card came under a different budgeting department,but he also said,no problem.meloff received further assurances that there were no problems when she met with contello boss,a corporate vice president.
the jury heard testimony from jerry mccaffrey,new york life corporate vice president for human resources,regarding the treatment of another employee who misused his new york life american express.mike arbitman used his new york life corporate card to pay for a variety of personal expenses,running up a bill in excess of during and.his card was canceled,but he suffered no other employment consequences as a result of the personal charges koontz himself,who fired meloff,admitted to charging some personal expenses on his corporate card,apparently without incident.
on january,mellbye approached meloff at the coffee cart and asked her to come to a meeting at his office at.when meloff came to the meeting,she found mellbye waiting with koontz and ellen lindsey,director of
