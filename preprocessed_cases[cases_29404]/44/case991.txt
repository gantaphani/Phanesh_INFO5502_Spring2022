gayle higgins appeals from the may,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york william conner,district judge granting railroad company motion for summary judgment.higgins complaint alleges that her latent multiple sclerosis became symptomatic as a result of stress induced by the verbal and physical harassment of john militano,a and supervisor.in particular,higgins appeals the grant of summary judgment for defendant on three claims higgins brought under the federal employers liability act negligent failure to provide a safe workplace negligent supervision of militano and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court granted summary judgment on these claims on the basis that militano conduct could not be imputed to and that supervision of militano had not been negligent.we affirm.
background 
for purposes of this review of summary judgment in favor of defendant,the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff.higgins began working for in.in april,she took a position as secretary to facility director william duke at equipment maintenance facility in harmon,new york.after duke became ill in april,higgins worked for both michael yaeger and john militano when they shared the facility director position.when yaeger was appointed facility director a few months later,higgins became his secretary.during this time,militano was the superintendent of the diesel shop and managed employees who maintain the railroad rolling stock.
between and,higgins alleges that militano engaged in a course of conduct toward gayle higgins that included both unwanted physical contact that was sexual in nature and outrageous abuse regarding work matters.militano allegedly yelled and swore at higgins in front of others about matters on approximately four occasions.higgins also alleges several incidents in which militano engaged in sexual banter with her by,for example,telling her that she had a great ass.
finally,higgins alleges five incidents of sexually tinged physical contact by militano.in the summer of,militano brushed his hand against higgins breast while reaching around her to put out his cigarette in an ashtray.on two occasions in november,militano poked her in the ribs.yaeger learned of the second one and told militano not to behave that way.in april,militano slapped higgins rear end while she was using a fax machine,after which he laughed and ran away.finally,higgins alleges that once when she was squatting down at a file cabinet,militano came up from behind her,put his arms around her waist,startling her such that she fell down.higgins claims that these incidents made her upset and angry but admits that she never felt physically threatened.
except for the poking incident that yaeger observed and inquired about,higgins did not report these incidents of physical contact to anyone at the time they occurred.it was not until may,while she was on leave recovering from surgery,that higgins filed a complaint with office of workplace diversity.the complaint alleged that higgins had been sexually harassed,subjected to a hostile work environment,and retaliated against by militano.
maryann of office of workforce diversity responded immediately,interviewed numerous people and wrote a thorough report.concluded that although militano had engaged in inappropriate behavior,there was no evidence of sexual harassment or retaliation.as a result of the investigation,militano received a letter informing him that his behavior was unprofessional,warning him that a single repetition could result in his termination and informing him that he had been scheduled for a conflict resolution seminar.by letter informed higgins of the action that had been taken against militano,but also advised higgins that she should carry out her work in a more professional manner,including utilizing available complaint procedures.offered a mediation session,but higgins refused to participate.
following her surgery,higgins returned to work in august but in a different position,working as a secretary for train masters edward byrne and peter hansen in another building on the harmon site.higgins alleges that militano called byrne office with abnormal frequency,told her that she still had a great ass,and stalked her on two occasions by driving around the parking lot when she was leaving.higgins did not bring these incidents to the attention of yaeger or,but she may have mentioned aspects of them to byrne.in late september,higgins became ill and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.in,higgins stopped working and is currently on permanent disability leave.
discussion 
on appeal,higgins claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to by wrongly finding that,in her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,higgins did not at least raise an issue concerning whether militano conduct was imputable to and improperly applying the standard for imputing an intentional tort to the two negligence claims.we review grants of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.vkk football league,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.
all of higgins claims are brought under the federal employers liability act fela.because intentional torts are recognized under fela,see,davis green.harrison.pac,d,and claims for solely emotional injury are also recognized,consol.rail gottshall,d,we find that claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress can be brought under fela 
the district court dismissed higgins intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because it found higgins allegations insufficient to impute to liability for militano alleged actions.the district court applied the test employed by the seventh circuit in lancaster norfolk and ry.a fela plaintiff may prevail in an intentional tort case by showing either that the intentional tort was committed in furtherance of the employer objectives or that the employer was negligent in hiring,supervising,or failing to fire the employee,cir.we consider first whether militano was acting within the scope of his employment and then whether hiring and supervision of militano was negligent 
under fela,liability for the intentional torts of an employee whose tortious acts are committed within the scope of employment will be imputed to the employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior but no liability attaches when an employee acts entirely upon his own impulse,for his own amusement,and for no purpose of or benefit to the defendant employer.gallose long island,cir quoting copeland francisco ry,cir.
it is well settled that sexual harassment consisting of unwelcome remarks and touching is motivated solely by individual desires and serves no purpose of the employer.faragher city of boca raton,d.therefore,the alleged comments and acts can not be imputed to under this doctrine,leaving only militano outbursts to be imputed.however,higgins only alleges four specific incidents of yelling.in the first incident,militano allegedly yelled,you fucking get the icc list when i give it to you.the other three incidents are of a similar nature.standing alone,these four incidents do not approach the extreme and outrageous conduct required to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress.restatement second of torts see also atchison,topeka and santa fe ry.buell,d.
the second means of holding an employer liable for intentional conduct under lancaster is to show that the employer was negligent.lancaster,at.in this case,higgins argues that liability should attach because was negligent in supervising militano.higgins claims of negligent supervision and negligent failure to provide a safe workplace require the same showing of negligence.we therefore analyze the second means of holding metro north liable under lancaster and the direct negligence claims together.
in order to demonstrate negligent supervision,higgins must show that knew or should have known prior to the incidents of propensities of militano to commit such acts.harrison.pac,d per curiam.although a relaxed standard of proof of negligence applies in fela actions,see ulfik commuter,cir,we find that,based on the facts alleged by higgins,no reasonable jury could find that was negligent.
certainly knew that militano had difficulty controlling his temper.however,the record indicates that his outbursts were and therefore would not have put on notice that he was prone to sexually harass his.as is discussed above,imputing to only the incidents of yelling is insufficient to make out an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.similarly,these incidents are insufficient to demonstrate negligence on the part of because it is not foreseeable that would be harmed by such outbursts.
higgins provides no evidence that was aware that militano was prone to sexually harass his prior to the alleged unwanted physical contacts and all but one of the alleged comments.there had been two prior complaints about militano.yaeger reported that carl walz had complained that militano touched his rear end while trying to take time cards from walz and that lew erwin complained that militano had poked erwin while publicly reprimanding him for not enforcing personal protective equipment standards.yaeger investigated the incident with erwin but was not able to confirm that militano had poked erwin,and erwin eventually dropped his complaint.although walz complaint alleges a violation of his person,there was no suggestion that the touching was in any way sexual.in any event,these instances of inappropriate behavior toward men did not put on notice that militano was likely to commit acts of sexual harassment toward women.nor did higgins report the incidents of unwanted sexual contact by militano as they occurred.as the district court noted,higgins did not tell anyone about the touching of her buttocks or breasts at the time.the only incident that higgins supervisor yaeger learned of was the.
thus,knew of only three incidents of unwanted poking of erwin,one poking of higgins,and the inappropriate touching of is not enough to put on notice that militano was prone to sexual harassment.see williams passenger,cir affirming summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff provided no evidence that railroad actually knew or should have known of defect moody boston and me,cir same ulfik,at holding that direct knowledge of physical ailments from inhaling fumes satisfied requirement of foreseeability syverson consol.rail,cir holding that conrail knowledge that area was magnet for vagrants put it on notice of risk to safety of workers lancaster,at,pattern of supervisory abuse including extreme menacing,goosing,and striking with sledgehammer could have provided notice of risk.because higgins has not demonstrated that was aware of any particular threat posed by militano,higgins can not prove that the railroad was negligent with respect to its supervision of him.
any suggestion that general supervision practices placed its employees at an unreasonable risk of sexual harassment is rebutted by the undisputed facts regarding significant program.noted in her report on higgins sexual harassment complaint that higgins made a personal decision not to utilize the widely disseminated internal complaint procedure.when higgins eventually did file a complaint,undertook a thorough investigation which concluded that,while militano had acted unprofessionally at times,he had not sexually harassed higgins.further offered to mediate between higgins and militano,and warned militano by letter that a single future instance of unprofessional conduct will be disciplined severely up to and including dismissal and scheduled him for a conflict resolution seminar.finally,because higgins did not report the alleged august and september incidents,could not have been negligent in failing to respond.the presence of a mechanism at to address issues of sexual harassment and higgins failure to fully use this mechanism distinguish this case from those that have found that a poor supervision system provided sufficient evidence of negligence to present the case to a jury.see smith passenger,cir denying judgment notwithstanding the verdict because but for defendant negligent failure to follow rule on reports of misconduct,shooting by disgruntled employee might have been prevented williams long island,cir absence of convenient alternative means of reaching platform could support inference that was negligent under fela relaxed negligence standard.
to recap,the four alleged incidents of yelling that can be imputed to under the doctrine of respondeat superior are insufficient to make out a case for intentional infliction of emotional distress.viewed in the light most favorable to higgins,she has failed to demonstrate that was negligent with respect to militano.she has not shown that knew or should have known that militano was prone to commit acts of sexual harassment before the alleged incidents occurred.moreover,the evidence of extensive complaint program negates any suggestion that general employee supervision practices negligently contributed to the alleged acts of harassment.accordingly,the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of.
conclusion 
we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to dismissing plaintiff suit.
the majority,consistent with the district court approach,affirms the grant of summary judgment on plaintiff direct negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims on the grounds that harassment of plaintiff by militano was not within the scope of employment and that no reasonable jury could find negligent because did not have notice of militano propensity to harass employees.i disagree.i would affirm,however,on the grounds that plaintiff emotional injuries,and consequent physical manifestations,are not compensable under fela because they fail to satisfy the zone of danger test developed in consolidated rail gottshall,d.
the majority concludes that higgins provides no evidence that was aware that militano was prone to sexually harass his prior to the alleged unwanted physical contacts and all but one of the alleged comments.but this is not a title vii sexual harassment case,nor is the underlying tort based on sexual harassment instead,plaintiff claim is that she was repeatedly yelled at by militano and touched inappropriately by him,and that this conduct in its entirety either amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress or caused her harm for which is liable because its negligent supervision of militano permitted the harassment to occur.although an employer knowledge may be probative evidence in an negligent supervision claim,i find the majority sole focus on whether was aware of any propensity of militano to harass his sexually to be inappropriate.
the majority notes that yaeger,a supervisor,admitted knowing that militano had been accused of inappropriate physical contact with two other employees,carl walz and les erwin.while yaeger was never able to determine whether or not the physical contact with erwin had occurred,he admitted that he did not counsel militano in a corrective fashion or from a disciplinary standpoint.yaeger also agreed when asked that there were times when john militano has had difficulty in controlling his anger in the shop,and further stated that he had spoken to militano on several occasions about better handling his subordinates or better handling how to speak to people.indeed,the majority recognizes that certainly knew that militano had difficulty controlling his temper.given this evidence and the nature of plaintiff claim,a reasonable jury could conclude that knew or should have known that militano had a propensity to act abusively toward employees.
furthermore,while i do not disagree with the majority conclusion that e xcept for the poking incident that yaeger observed and inquired about,higgins did not report these incidents of physical contact to anyone at the time they occurred,taken together,there is evidence in the record suggesting that may have been aware of several of the incidents involving militano alleged abuse of plaintiff well before her formal complaint in may,and failed
