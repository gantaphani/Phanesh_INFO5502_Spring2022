this is an appeal by maribel arturet vélez maribel,plaintiff in the district court,from the dismissal of her complaint in a wrongful death case.the defendants in the district court were four major tobacco companies the companies reynolds tobacco company,liggett group,brown williamson tobacco,and the american tobacco company.the dismissal was on the ground that the statute of limitations barred the suit.
maribel is the daughter of angel luis arturet concepción angel,who died in march.on september,maribel brought the present suit in the federal district court in puerto rico against the companies for the wrongful death of her father.the complaint alleged that angel,born in the,had been a smoker for more than years prior to his death at age,and that he had sought repeatedly to stop smoking but had been unable to do so even after doctors warned him that he should.
the suit,brought primarily in diversity is concededly governed by the law of puerto rico.puerto rico has a statute of limitations for tort claims.laws ann.tit.obviously anticipating a challenge on this ground,the drafter of the complaint did not emphasize the capacity of cigarettes to fact,the cause of angel death is not explicitly rather the capacity of tobacco to addict the smoker.conformably,the complaint alleged that maribel did not learn that addiction was a substantial factor relative to her father death until january,after consulting a lawyer who had experience with cigarette cases.
the complaint went on to charge that the companies had knowledge of the dangers of their product including the product addictiveness,did not disclose these dangers,marketed their product to youth for whom smoking was especially dangerous,and increased the addictive character of their cigarettes by various means while denying that cigarettes were addictive.successive counts charged strict liability,negligence,failure to warn measured by both state and federal standards,defective product and defective design.the complaint sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.
the companies moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.b,on the ground that the complaint showed on its face that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations.addressing the tolling defense implicit in the complaint addiction allegations,the companies argued that the alleged implied cause of death was disease,cancer not in any event maribel knew or should have known enough at the time of her father death about the link between smoking and her father addiction,illness,and death to require her to file her suit within one year.the motion pointed to numerous cases holding that by the,knowledge of the dangers of smoking was so widespread that judicial notice could be taken of it.
maribel responded that the common knowledge defense had not been accepted by all courts and that her knowledge and diligence were questions for the jury.maribel contended that until she encountered a newspaper article on september,she did not realize that cigarettes were addictive.even now,she said,the cigarette industry continued to deny the addictive effects of nicotine.
the district judge granted the motion to dismiss in an opinion and order filed on september.the court said that a number of like cases had been dismissed by other judges of the same district court.it agreed with the defendants that at best the complaint implied that angel had died from a illness like cancer or heart disease,and it held that any of these medical conditions,together with maribel knowledge of her father smoking,put her on notice of her potential cause of action against defendants no later than march when her father died.this appeal followed.
the case is complicated by the reinforcing effects of two legal tactics the decision by maribel counsel to leave obscure some arguably pertinent information,the immediate cause of death and the decision of the companies counsel to use rule b rather than a motion for summary judgment to present the statute of limitations issue.it was somewhat risky for the district court to employ rule b as the vehicle for disposition of the statute of limitations issue.
nevertheless,the district court result is correct.in framing the issues,we accept that the allegations of the complaint are generally to be taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss,and a complaint should not be dismissed if a claim can plausibly be embraced by those allegations.rodi new england sch.of law,cir although the statute of limitations is formally a defense,it was effectively anticipated by the complaint inasmuch as the complaint clearly laid the groundwork for a tolling argument and can be disposed of fairly on the present briefs.see id.at.
in our view,as in the district court,maribel must be claiming that her father death was proximately caused by one or more of the familiar diseases linked with tobacco use and recited in the complaint itself.doubtless,addiction can cause harms independent of,the cost and discomfort suffered by any addict who weans himself from a drug through medical means like the million compensatory damages which maribel complaint seeks can only be from losses resulting from angel death.nowhere does maribel dispute the district court inference to this effect.
yet it is playing word games to say,as the companies suggest,that therefore angel allegedly died from a disease like cancer rather than from addiction.it could well be that both were proximate causes the addiction by making it impossible for angel to quit and the continued smoking by finally killing him.see generally harper,james gray,the law of torts,at ed.just how maribel could show that but for the addiction her father would have quit in time to save his life is a different question but arguably the complaint would permit her to try to make such a showing.
we also think it fair to infer that maribel knew at the time of her father death that cigarettes were capable of causing the deadly diseases recited in her complaint.nowhere does she deny this,some of her statements tend to confirm throughout her papers she has consistently alleged that she did not know that cigarettes were addictive until within a year before the complaint was filed.the latter claim,that she only then learned that cigarettes were highly addictive in the medical sense,we will accept as true for purposes of this appeal.compare soliman philip morris,cir,cert.denied,d,with grisham philip morris,cir.
a cause of action for wrongful death arises at the time of death,but puerto rico,like many other jurisdictions,tolls the running of the statute until the claimant is on notice of her is,notice of the injury,plus notice of the person who caused it.montesinos,cir quoting colon prieto geigel,wl,offic.trans.this does not require actual knowledge it is enough that the plaintiff had notice that would have led a reasonable person to investigate and so uncover the needed information,at hospital del maestro,cir.
the companies in this case say that the injury that should have put maribel on notice is angel death,if not his earlier medical conditions of which she evidently had knowledge.yet,while some decisions talk in terms of injury,others recognize we think there can be injuries that do not raise even a suspicion of liability,and that the statute is to be tolled until the time when a reasonable plaintiff would begin an investigation,espada lugo,cir.this is likely not a true conflict in case law but rather different emphases in phrasing due to different patterns of fact.
even so,once maribel father died from a disease that could easily have been caused by cigarette smoking,she had notice that she might well have a claim based on the companies furnishing of a dangerous product and,if she had diligently pursued such a claim with a competent lawyer,the reinforcing arguments based on addiction could have been unearthed.like one who suspects that an operation had gone wrong but does not know why,she had a duty to investigate and is charged with knowledge that consulting with a competent lawyer would have brought forth.see,at.
in her complaint,maribel says that only when she knew of the addictive prope
