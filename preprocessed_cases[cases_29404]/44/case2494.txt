plaintiff leonard hale brought this action against several officers and several municipalities alleging that they conducted an unconstitutional search of his residence.the district court dismissed all defendants save one on the basis of qualified immunity,or on other grounds.the remaining defendant,scott kart,appeals the district court failure to award him summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.
background 
plaintiff leonard hale called police to his apartment due to a domestic dispute between plaintiff and the mother of two of his children,jerijo lysher.lysher consumed significant quantities of alcohol during the several hours of her birthday celebration there and she became belligerent.plaintiff requested that lysher,who did not reside there,leave and she became even more belligerent.according to plaintiff,lysher wanted him to drive her home while he wanted her to call her mother,with whom she lived,to come and get her.plaintiff called the police and asked them to remove lysher from his home.officer jacobson,of blackman township police department,responded and informed lysher that she had to leave.according to officer jacobson,while lysher was still in the house,she informed him that plaintiff had large amounts of prescription medication and cash in his bedroom.lysher also informed officer jacobson that plaintiff was illegally selling prescription medication.plaintiff testified that he did not hear these accusations,explaining he was at the far side of the room.no search was conducted at that time.officer jacobson instructed lysher to gather her things and leave.lysher complied with this directive.she and two of her children not the children she had with hale left without incident 
officer jacobson drove lysher to the police station and requested that a patrol car conduct surveillance on plaintiff residence.at the station,officer jacobson called defendant kart,a deputy with the county sheriff department,who was the lead investigator into a recent prescription drug theft from a local pharmacy,to question lysher.officer jacobson related lysher story to kart and told him that plaintiff had informed officer jacobson that he could not search the bedroom without a warrant lysher then told defendant kart that plaintiff was illegally selling prescription drugs.she also told him that she had stayed at plaintiff apartment for two weeks and that she witnessed several drug sales.lysher described large amounts of currency she had seen in the same bedroom as the drugs.
defendant kart was aware that lysher had used prescription drugs illegally in the past.defendant knew that lysher was angry at plaintiff and that she had consumed alcohol.finally,lysher admitted to defendant that she had taken drugs given to her by plaintiff at some point during her stay.defendant kart also knew that when officer jacobson asked her to gather her belongings and leave with her children,she did so without protest.
defendant kart used his interview with lysher as a basis for an affidavit in support of the search warrant for plaintiff residence.he included all of the details about the location of the cash and prescription drugs,the fact that a witness lysher had been at the apartment for two weeks,the fact that lysher had been given vicadin by plaintiff,the sales lysher claimed to have witnessed,and that she had seen the currency on the day of the affidavit.he also included the fact that a patrol car was currently conducting surveillance on plaintiff residence.defendant kart did not include the fact that lysher was angry at plaintiff,nor did he include the fact that lysher had consumed alcohol while at plaintiff apartment.
the affidavit served as the basis for the search warrant defendant kart obtained from the michigan district court judge.defendant kart and other officers searched plaintiff house pursuant to the warrant.although some prescription drugs and in currency were found at the house,no charges were filed against plaintiff.
plaintiff,on his own behalf and on behalf of his two minor children,brought this action against all of the officers involved in the search,as well as both the county of jackson and the township of blackman.the district court dismissed plaintiff claims on summary judgment with respect to all defendants except defendant kart on the grounds that they were entitled to rely on the warrant and that there was nothing unconstitutional in the manner in which it was executed.the district court ruled that summary judgment was unwarranted with respect to defendant kart because a reasonable jury can find that lysher credibility was so lacking that it was unreasonable for kart to rely on the warrant.thus,a genuine issue of material fact exists and summary judgment is denied against kart hale,et,kart,et,wl.in a footnote it expounded on this holding by stating 
to be sure,the fact that lysher was intoxicated and highly agitated does not mean as a matter of law,that a reasonable officer would not trust lysher tip.indeed,some people are more candid when they are drunk than when they are sober.nevertheless,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs,i must conclude that whether a reasonable officer would believe lysher tip in her intoxicated state is a question of fact for the jury.
id.defendant kart appeals that denial.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
the district court denied defendant kart qualified immunity and thus summary judgment because it believed that a factual dispute related to probable cause existed.we review this holding de novo.adams city of auburn hills,cir.we have jurisdiction to hear his appeal.id.a district court decision rejecting an individual defendant claim to qualified immunity is immediately appealable to the extent that it raises a question of law,notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.
the question for this court in denying qualified immunity in a action is whether the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.malley briggs,d.while we look at the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the facts we are looking at are those known to kart when he sought the warrant.we apply a standard of objective reasonableness.id.at.devenpeck et,alford,d,wl indicating that the supreme court continues to support objective standards in the context of qualified immunity cases.
in actions,an officer ordinarily receives qualified immunity if he or she relies on a judicially secured warrant.malley,at.therefore,under the appropriate standard,we must first determine whether the warrant is so lacking in the indicia of probable cause that defendant kart reliance on the warrant is unreasonable.because,defendant kart affidavit provided the sole basis for the warrant,we must evaluate the sufficiency of the affidavit.
a.the affidavit,on its face,is sufficient.
affidavits do not have to be perfect,nor do they have to provide every specific piece of information to be upheld 
affidavits are not required to use magic words,nor does what is obvious in context need to be spelled out if a ci saw guns,he is not required to explain how he knew what a gun looks like.nor is an affidavit required to present proof that would without question withstand rigorous taken as a whole,the affidavit provided sufficient facts from which the magistrate could draw an independent conclusion as to the probability certainty is not required of what it alleged a search would disclose.
united states allen,cir en banc.in addition,we look at warrants,and,in this case,the affidavit supporting the warrant,using a totality of the circumstances test.illinois gates et,d.the totality of the circumstances test requires us to evaluate the probabilities of finding criminal activities based on the evidence provided in the affidavit,as opposed to requiring that the evidence in the affidavit guarantees the discovery of criminal activity.id.
in this case,the affidavit was sufficient on its face such that an officer could rely on it.the affidavit described the probable existence of large quantities of prescription medication and cash in a specific location in an apartment.in addition,the affidavit disclosed the basis for the officer belief,disclosed by a witness,that was specific.the witness lysher claimed to be present during drug sales and she claimed to have seen large quantities of currency present at the location.her presence in the apartment,her relationship to the apartment tenant,and her reason for being there,are explained.lysher is not an anonymous or paid informant her identity is disclosed.finally,the affidavit contains lysher admission that she had been given vicadin by hale.the affidavit also stated that defendant kart was the lead investigator in a recent and theft of large quantities of vicadin as well as other prescription drugs from a local drug store.
all of these specific facts present ample evidence of probable cause that drugs and their proceeds would be found at plaintiff apartment.in addition,because lysher admitted in her statement to defendant kart that hale gave her a prescription drug,her account becomes even more credible.united states harris,d people do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their admissions.since she was at the apartment when removed by the police,her opportunity to have seen the drugs and money was confirmed by her removal from the premises.the affidavit and thus the warrant,on its face,and looking at the totality of the circumstances,contains sufficient indicia of probable cause to allow an officer or a judge to reasonably rely on it.even if the warrant is sufficient,however,defendant can not rely on it if he knowingly made false statements in the affidavit such that,but for those falsities,the warrant would not have been issued.yancey,at.therefore we must also engage in a second inquiry did plaintiff provide evidence that would undermine defendant reliance on the warrant 
no evidence exists with respect to either defendant intent to mislead by omission or to whether the omitted evidence would be critical to a finding of probable cause.
in mays city of dayton,cir,this court clarified our standard for evaluating officers conduct in the procurement of search warrants except in the very rare case where the defendant makes a strong preliminary showing that the affiant with an intention to mislead excluded critical information from the affidavit,and the omission is critical to the finding of probable cause,franks is inapplicable to the omission of disputed facts.mays,at italics in original the logic in mays is obviously meant to apply to plaintiffs as well,given that mays was a case in atkin,this court further clarified the high bar to which we subject these sorts of inquiries if the defendant does succeed in making a preliminary showing that the government affiant engaged in deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth in omitting information from the affidavit,the court must then consider the affidavit including the omitted portions and determine whether probable cause still exists.united states atkin,cir internal citations omitted defendant is proper in this case as this case dealt with suppression of the evidence in a criminal trial.
these two combined holdings instruct district courts that plaintiffs must make a strong preliminary showing that the affiant with an intention to mislead excluded critical information from the affidavit,and the omission is critical to the finding of probable cause.mays,at italics in original.only if the plaintiff makes this strong preliminary showing may the court consider the affidavit including the omitted portions and determine whether probable cause still exists.atkin,at.absent this first preliminary showing,the district court may not engage in the second inquiry related to probable cause.
therefore,our inquiry is whether the plaintiff made a strong preliminary showing that the affiant intended to mislead the judge by omitting information from the affidavit.only then can we address the question of whether a factual matter related to probable cause exists that would preclude summary judgment.if one exists,kart is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings instead,we must remand to the district court for submission of that factual matter to a jury with instructions on how those factual matters relate to the existence of probable cause.in this case,plaintiff has not provided evidence disputed or otherwise on either point.
plaintiff provided no evidence of defendant intent to mislead.
mays indicates that in omission cases,franks is inapplicable unless the plaintiff makes a strong preliminary showing of defendant intention to mislead in making the omissions.mays,at.while this court has not described in great detail what types of evidence will satisfy the strong preliminary showing of an intention to mislead in omission cases,it seems clear that plaintiff has not met that burden here.
there is no evidence on the record that would establish defendant intent to mislead the judge.the mere existence of omissions alone is ordinarily not enough to make this strong preliminary showing.we do not foreclose the possibility that strongly material omissions could provide evidence of an intention to mislead however,there is no evidence that the omissions of which plaintiff complains were material to the grant of the search warrant.put another way,plaintiff can not and on appeal does not argue that the search warrant would not have been granted had the omissions been included.plaintiff merely argues that defendant kart should have engaged in further investigation before seeking a warrant.such a claim is not enough,in this circumstance,to meet plaintiff burden under the first prong of the mays test because it does not speak to defendant kart intent to mislead,it only speaks to the thoroughness of his investigation as a result,on this basis alone,defendant kart deserves qualified immunity.we address the second prong of the mays test to add further clarity.
the omissions are not critical to the finding of probable cause.
under the second prong of the mays test,if the omissions were critical to the finding of probable cause,we must deny qualified immunity.mays,at.in order to determine whether the omissions were critical to the finding of probable cause,this court has indicated that the affidavit should be reevaluated with the omitted portions included to see if those omitted items would change a probable cause determination.united states hill,cir.our consideration of this prong is complicated somewhat by the fact that this is a civil case that comes before us on summary judgment.we have,however,the depositions of all the witnesses to lysher condition at the time she made the statements kart relied on in formulating his affidavit 
while it is true that where a genuine issue of material fact exists it is appropriate to deny summary judgment under fed.civ.c,that fact does not answer the question of whether probable cause determinations in cases should be submitted to a jury.while the facts underlying probable cause,if in dispute,must be submitted to a jury,probable cause determinations are legal determinations.
probable cause determinations are legal determinations.
when no material dispute of fact exists,probable cause determinations are legal determinations that should be made by a court.stewart sonneborn.city of takoma park,cir when,as in this case,there is no genuine issue of material fact,the existence of probable cause becomes a purely legal question subject to de novo review.potts city of lafayette,cir smith tucker,it is the duty of the court when the facts are in dispute to submit the question to the jury with the instructions that if they find the facts to be one way they amount to probable cause and if they find them to be another that they do not amount to probable cause.see yancey,at.diamond howd,cir klein long,cir gardenhire schubert,cir pyles raisor,cir in general,the existence of probable cause in a action presents a jury question,unless there is only one reasonable determination possible.all four of these cases discuss probable cause in the context of an arrest.
all of these sixth circuit cases stand for the proposition that a jury trial i
