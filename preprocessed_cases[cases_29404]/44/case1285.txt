opinion of the court 
factual and procedural history 
this appeal requires us to answer a question.the case arises from a motor vehicle accident in pennsylvania on february,involving rodolfo garcia hereinafter garcia,a pennsylvania citizen,and defendant timothy gladney hereinafter gladney,a new york citizen and new york licensed driver.garcia was driving a dodge truck registered and insured in pennsylvania.gladney was driving a toyota automobile that he had rented earlier that day in brooklyn,new york,from plaza oldsmobile hereinafter plaza,a new york corporation with its principal place of business in that state.garcia alleged that he suffered permanent and disabling injuries as a result of the accident and that plaza,as owner of the vehicle,was liable to him for his injuries.consequently,he brought this diversity of citizenship action,in which the district court had jurisdiction under,against gladney and plaza as well as certain other defendants not involved in this appeal garcia wife,maritza,has joined in the action asserting a claim for loss of consortium but as a matter of convenience we will refer to garcia as the in the singular.as of the time that plaza filed this appeal,there had not been a trial on liability for the accident,even as between garcia and gladney,and damages had not been determined,and,as far as we are aware,there still has not been a trial in the district court.
in the district court,plaza and garcia filed cross motions for partial summary judgment seeking a determination of whether the court should ascertain plaza potential liability by application of pennsylvania common law or section of new york vehicle and traffic law.the distinction is likely to be critical because under pennsylvania common law,which is predicated on traditional agency principles,regardless of gladney culpability plaza could not be liable to garcia whereas,under new york law,if gladney is determined to be liable to garcia,plaza also would be liable to him as new york imposes vicarious liability on a vehicle owner for injuries arising from the negligence of anyone using or operating its vehicle with permission compare fried seippel,with ferry fisher,as would be expected,garcia asserted that new york statutory law applied whereas plaza contended that pennsylvania common law applied.surprisingly,the parties have not been able to direct our attention to any published opinion of any state or federal court in pennsylvania directly addressing the issue here the district court concluded that there was a false conflict between new york and pennsylvania law,and that new york law applied and thus on june,granted garcia motion insofar as he requested the court to apply new york law.we will explain below what circumstances give rise to a false conflict.
plaza then moved for certification of the june,order pursuant to b so that it could seek leave from this court to appeal from that order and it moved,in the alternative,for reconsideration of the order.by order dated august,the district court granted plaza motion for certification under b but denied its motion for reconsideration.we granted plaza petition for permission to appeal on november.
ii.discussion 
as we have indicated the sole question presented on appeal is a narrow issue whether the court should use pennsylvania common law or new york statutory law to determine if plaza can be liable.we exercise plenary review over the choice of law question raised by this appeal.see simon united states,cir shuder mcdonald,cir.
in a diversity of citizenship action,we determine which state substantive law governs by applying the rules of the jurisdiction in which the district court sits,here pennsylvania.klaxon stentor.petrella kashlan,cir melville american home assur,cir.griffith united air lines,is pennsylvania leading case.in that case,the pennsylvania supreme court abandoned the traditional lex loci delicti conflicts rule in which the law of the place of the wrong governed the substantive rights and liabilities of the parties and substituted a more flexible rule which permits analysis of the policies and interests underlying the particular issue before the court.id.at.we have indicated that this methodology has evolved into a hybrid approach that combines the approaches of both restatement second of conflict of laws contacts establishing significant relationships and interest analysis qualitative appraisal of the relevant states policies with respect to the controversy.melville,at.
under pennsylvania law,before assessing the governmental interests of the jurisdictions whose law may control and examining their contacts with the dispute,we must determine what type of conflict,if any,exists between the purported competing bodies of law.see kuchinic mccrory.we begin with an interest analysis of the policies of all interested states and on the result of that whether the case involves a true or false conflict or whether it is unprovided for.budget,chappell,cir see also lejeune,cir.
there is a true conflict when the governmental interests of both jurisdictions would be impaired if their law were not applied.lacey cessna aircraft,cir emphasis in original.if a case presents a true conflict,pennsylvania rules call for the application of the law of the state having the most significant contacts or relationships with the particular issue.in re estate of agostini.but there is a false conflict if only one jurisdiction governmental interests would be impaired by the application of the other jurisdiction law.lacey,at.if there is a false conflict,we apply the law of the only interested jurisdiction.see,kuchinic mccrory,at.finally,there are cases in which neither jurisdiction interests would be impaired if its laws are not applied the principle of lex loci delicti,the law of the place of the wrong,supplies the substantive law to be applied in cases.see miller gay,
in our analysis the first issue that we must address is whether new york vehicle and traffic law with respect to the issue at hand has extraterritorial application,and,accordingly,whether that law by its terms can be applied to determine liability for the pennsylvania accident underlying this appeal.section of new york vehicle and traffic law provides that e very owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle by any person using or operating the same with the permission,express or implied,of such owner.veh.traf.law mckinney.as we noted above,the statute imposes vicarious liability on vehicle owners for the negligence of anyone using or operating their vehicles with their permission,without regard to whether the owner by its negligence contributed to the accident.
even though the wording of section suggests that it could not apply to an accident without new york state as the section refers to vehicles used or operated in this state,meaning new york,the new york court of appeals,the court of last resort in new york state,consistently has interpreted section as having extraterritorial application see,sentry ins.amsel,farber smolack.obviously those decisions settle that issue for us.
moreover,the extraterritorial reach of the statute becomes evident when one looks to the manner in which the new york legislature has meshed section to its insurance laws.all owners of motor vehicles registered in new york state are required to carry at least the minimum insurance laid down by statute.veh.traf.law,mckinney.furthermore,that insurance must extend to claims arising out of the ownership,use,or operation of a vehicle within the state of new york,or elsewhere in the united states in north america or the dominion of canada.veh.traf.law a.the new york courts have interpreted this section to show a commendable concern not only for residents of new york,but residents of other states who may be injured as a result of the activities of new york residents.tooker lopez.
the court in fried,specifically addressed the scope of section and held that the provision applies unless the accident vehicle ha s never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within new
