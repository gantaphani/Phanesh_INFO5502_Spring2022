the plaintiffs below,martin and lisa whiteman whitemans,appeal from a final order of the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia that granted summary judgment to the defendant,chesapeake appalachia,chesapeake,upon the whitemans claim for common law trespass.we find no error in the district court decision and affirm for the reasons that follow.
the whitemans own the surface rights to approximately acres in wetzel county,west virginia,pursuant to a general warranty deed dated march.see ja at.chesapeake owns lease rights to minerals beneath the whitemans surface property.see ja at.the property rights of both the whitemans and chesapeake ultimately flow from two severance deeds that originally split the surface and mineral estates of the acres relevant here.the two severance deeds effected severance by granting the respective surface estates to grantees while reserving and excepting the mineral estate to the grantor.specifically,both deeds contain the following language 
there is reserved and excepted unto the said ellis miller,the grantor,all of his interest in and to the oil and gas within and underlying the parcels as well as all of the coal not heretofore conveyed,and all other minerals within and underlying the above described property,with the necessary rights and privileges appertaining thereto.
ja at.notably,the severance deeds neither reserve any specific surface rights to the mineral estate owner nor mention permanent waste disposal resulting from mineral extraction.
today,the whitemans live on and farm their acres,primarily raising sheep and,relatedly,using part of the land to produce hay for the sheep.see ja at.conversely,chesapeake operates three natural gas wells on approximately ten acres of the whitemans property that was formerly used for hay production.ja at.the whitemans can no longer produce hay on those ten acres because chesapeake well operations and permanent drill waste disposal on the surface have rendered that portion of the whitemans property unusable for any suitable purpose ja at.
nevertheless,for each of their gas wells located on the whitemans surface property,chesapeake obtained valid well work and pit waste discharge permits from the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep.ja at.as part of the permitting process,chesapeake gave the whitemans notice of chesapeake intent to drill and dispose of drill waste in waste pits.see ja at.chesapeake attached its wvdep application for well work and pit waste discharge permits to the notice it gave the whitemans.ja at.the permit application included spaces for chesapeake to describe anticipated pit waste as well as proposed disposal methods.id.on each permit application,chesapeake listed anticipated pit waste to include drill water,frac blow back,and various formation cuttings id.chesapeake also noted that it intended to dispose of pit waste by land application,or in the case of the pits located on the whitemans property,by treating water,applying waste to the land,and burying cuttings.id.
after the permitting process was complete,chesapeake began drilling.while drilling on the whitemans property,chesapeake used a drilling fluid,known in the oil and gas industry as mud,to remove drill cuttings during the drilling process see ja at.once removed from the wells boreholes,chesapeake disposed of the drill cuttings in accord with the waste disposal method listed on their well work and pit waste discharge permit applications,namely by depositing the drill cuttings into open pits located near the wellheads on the whitemans surface property see ja at.at the conclusion of the drilling process,chesapeake removed the plastic liners from the waste pits,mixed the drill waste with clean dirt,and compacted and covered the pits.sediment control barriers surround the pits.see ja at.
the pit or open system of drill waste disposal was the common method employed in west virginia at the time the wells were drilled on the whitemans property,although alternative disposal methods were used in other areas of the country.see ja at.one such alternative is a system.the system of drill waste disposal is a relatively recent development in the oil and gas industry.under the system,drill cuttings and other waste are removed from the well site and placed in landfills.see ja at.systems have some advantages over disposal.they better preserve expensive drilling mud for future drilling operations,eliminate the possibility of a pit failure,and create a smaller drilling operation footprint at a well site.see ja at.nevertheless,systems are expensive and often cost or more per well than open systems,depending on the well location.see ja at.chesapeake began using the system in some of its oklahoma and texas operations in and,and,in december,began preparing to implement the system in west virginia.see ja at.
the whitemans have admitted that,at present,their monetary damages are trivial and not real significant.ja at.indeed,the only expert testimony offered in the case regarding the value of the whitemans land opined that chesapeake drilling operations caused no diminution in value thereto.see ja at.rather,the core of the whitemans prayer for relief is vindication of their right to exclude others from their land and affirmative injunctive relief to remove the waste pits in order to alleviate the whitemans fears of possible future liability that might stem from the waste pits.see ja at.
this civil action was filed originally in the circuit court of wetzel county,west virginia,and removed to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship under a.the whitemans are citizens and residents of west virginia chesapeake is an oklahoma corporation with its principal place of business in oklahoma.ja at.the amount in controversy exceeds 
in their complaint,the whitemans asked for an injunction and damages based on claims arising from the drilling and operation by chesapeake of three natural gas wells on surface property owned by the whitemans.ja at.the complaint alleged claims under west virginia common law only,namely nuisance,trespass,negligence,strict liability,recklessness or gross negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.ja at.cross motions for summary judgment were filed.ja at.by order entered on june,the district court denied the whitemans motion and granted chesapeake motion on the trespass claim only.ja at.thereafter,with the court approval,the whitemans voluntarily dismissed all their other claims.ja at.a final order was entered on june,from which the whitemans took a timely appeal to this court pursuant to.ja at.the only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of chesapeake upon the whitemans claim for common law trespass.
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we apply de novo the same standard that the district court was required to apply for granting the motion for summary judgment.ray commc ns,clear channel commc ns,cir.specifically,summary judgment is warranted if,from the totality of the evidence,including pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and affidavits,the court believes no genuine issue of material fact exists for trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure sylvia dev.calvert,cir.when an appeal arises from a grant of summary judgment,the reviewing court must view the evidence,and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom,in the light most favorable to the party.see laing fed.exp,cir 
the substantive legal issue before the court on appeal is whether chesapeake permanent disposal of drill waste upon the whitemans surface property is reasonably necessary for the extraction of minerals here,the only relevant substantive law stems from west virginia common law.accordingly,we look to that state law for a controlling principle.see erie tompkins.
as noted above,the district court below granted summary judgment in favor of chesapeake as to the whitemans common law trespass claim only in west virginia,common law trespass is an entry on another man ground without lawful authority,and doing some damage,however inconsiderable,to his real property.hark mountain fork lumber,emphasis added.a continuing trespass occurs,for example,when one person leaves on the land of another,with a duty to remove it,a structure,chattel,or other thing.restatement second of torts.regarding remedies for actions in trespass,the general rule in west virginia is that a mere trespass to real estate will not be enjoined when the injury is susceptible of complete pecuniary compensation and for which the injured person has an adequate legal remedy.wiles wiles.nevertheless,in west virginia,a court of equity has jurisdiction to enjoin a continuing trespass.tate united fuel gas.notwithstanding the above,a claim for trespass under west virginia common law can only lie if one entry upon the land of another or one leaving a thing upon the land of another is without lawful authority.hark,at.
a common source of lawful authority one might have for either entering upon another land or leaving something on another land is a license.however,at its most basic,a license is simply permission,usually revocable,to commit some act that would otherwise be unlawful,including,but not limited to,an agreement that it is lawful for the licensee to enter the licensor land to do some act that would otherwise be illegal.black law dictionary ed.in west virginia,however,a line of precedent informs a mineral estate owner authority to enter upon the land of a surface estate owner,without express license or otherwise,to extract minerals,beginning with marvin brewster iron mining,wl,the seminal case that introduced the concept of what has come to be known as reasonable necessity and its application to severance deed construction in other words,in west virginia,a mineral estate owner that enters upon a surface estate owner land does so without lawful authority only if,under the reasonable necessity standard,the mineral estate owner exceed s its rights thereby invading the rights of the surface estate owner.adkins united fuel gas.
in marvin,a surface estate owner sought,among other things,to enjoin a mineral estate owner from mining underneath the surface estate owner land.marvin,wl,at.the surface estate owner complained that the mineral estate owner had,among other things,deposited ore and rubbish from the mines along the front and atop the surface estate owner land.id.at.the lower court in marvin concluded,as a matter of law,that although the mineral estate owner had a right to enter the surface estate owner land to mine,the mineral estate owner had no right to deposit or keep upon the surface estate owner lands any refuse stuff or rubbish.id.at.accordingly,the lower court ordered that the mineral estate owner be enjoined from further waste disposal on the surface estate owner land and that the mineral estate owner remove mine waste that the mineral estate owner had already deposited on the surface.id.at.the new york court of appeals reversed the lower court as to this conclusion of law,among others,and sent the case back for a new trial because the court of appeals believed the lower court failed to consider whether depositing mine waste on the surface was necessary to be done for the reasonably profitable enjoyment of the mineral estate owner property in the minerals.id.at.more specifically,the court of appeals held that a mineral estate owner may not claim,as incident to the grant of the mineral estate itself,that which is convenient but only that which is necessary,but may have that in a convenient way.id.at.in other words,the court indicated that a grant of minerals underlying a tract of land,absent a deed or lease provision to the contrary,carries with it a right to use so much of the surface as is fairly necessary to recover the mineral and preserve the mineral holder reasonably profitable enjoyment of the mineral although the marvin court went on to state in dicta that it would be a rare case where a mine owner could justify leaving mine waste on the surface permanently,the court nevertheless conceded that what is necessary is a fluid concept that must be determined on a case by case basis.see id.at stating that the facts of each case must determine what is necessary.
if not earlier,the west virginia supreme court of appeals cited marvin with enthusiastic approval in both porter mack,and squires lafferty,thus officially adopting the principle that ownership of a mineral estate carries with it an implied right to use the surface in such manner and with such means as would be fairly necessary for the enjoyment of the mineral estate.porter,at see squires,at holding that the right to use the surface in a manner and with such means as would be fairly necessary to enjoy the mineral estate is incident to ownership of the mineral estate itself.unlike the instant case,however,neither porter nor squires were trespass cases.rather,both were cases where a mineral estate owner sought an injunction against the surface estate owner for obstructing various aspects of the mineral estate owner mining operation.
in porter,the mineral estate owner sought to mine clay and other minerals and carry them off using a tram road he proposed to build on the surface estate owner property,but the surface estate owner obstructed.see porter,at.in squires,the mineral estate owner sought to drill test holes and transport machinery and men over the surface estate owner property,but the surface estate owner went so far as to lock the mineral estate owner access gate and then assault the mineral estate owner employee that forced passage.squires,at.in both cases,the west virginia supreme court of appeals ruled in favor of the mineral estate owner,finding the building of a tram road across the surface estate owner property fairly necessary to enjoying the mineral estate in porter,and finding the drilling of test holes and transport of machinery and men across the surface fairly necessary in squires.notwithstanding their dissimilarity to this case,porter and squires enshrine the overarching principle that,incident to mineral estate ownership,a mineral estate owner in west virginia has a right to use the surface in such manner and with such means as would be fairly necessary to enjoy the mineral estate.moreover,both porter and squires demonstrate that the application of such a principle is necessarily,just as the new york court of appeals said in marvin.see marvin,wl,at.the fairly necessary standard from porter and squires has remained intact in west virginia property law and been applied to a multitude of factual scenarios,including some more factually analogous to this case than either porter or squires.
in adkins united fuel gas,a surface estate owner brought a trespass claim against the mineral estate owner for damages caused by the mineral estate owner gas drilling operations on the surface owner land adkins united fuel gas.specifically,the mineral estate owner drilled a gas well near the center of a tract,part of which the surface owner used to grow alfalfa,corn,and vegetables.id.additionally,the mineral estate owner constructed a road and pipelines through the surface owner corn and alfalfa fields to provide access to the well.id.moreover,the mineral estate owner cut one lengthy ditch to carry water and other refuse from the gas well and cut another ditch to lay a gas pipe necessary to operate the gas well.id.both ditches were cut through land the surface owner had used to grow crops.id.as a result of the mineral estate owner drilling and associated activities,the surface was rendered unusable for crop production.id.
after it had completed drilling the gas well,the mineral estate owner removed one gas pipe,drained the ditches and covered them over,leaving the permanent gas pipe just under the surface.id.as to the reasonable necessity of the mineral estate owner use of the surface,the court in adkins held 
there was nothing done which was unnecessary or unreasonable in the construction of the road to bring machinery in to drill the defendant gas well.likewise the laying of the pipe line over the surface of the land is not disclosed to have been unnecessary.the construction of the open ditch for draining sand,water and other refuse from the well during the drilling thereof seems to have been an effort on the part of defendant to prevent the spreading of such sand,water and refuse over the adjacent surface of plaintiff land,and,therefore,was a minimization of damages.
id.at.in other words,the court in adkins did not change the reasonable necessity standard.rather,it simply applied the standard,as it always had before,to a set of facts unique to the case in adkins.
perhaps the most recent and comprehensive scrutiny of the reasonable necessity doctrine,however,occurred in buffalo mining martin.there,as in porter and squires,a mineral estate owner sought to enjoin the surface owner from interfering with the mineral estate owner mining operations.specifically,the mineral estate owner endeavored to construct a power line necessary to ventilate a coal mine located under the surface owner property.buffalo mining,at.however,the court in buffalo mining did not simply apply the fairly necessary doctrine from porter,squires,adkins,and others.rather,the court applied the following gloss to that doctrine 
w here implied as opposed to express rights are sought,the test of what is reasonable and necessary becomes more exacting,since the mineral owner is seeking a right that he claims not by virtue of any express language in the mineral severance deed,but by necessary implication as a correlative to those rights expressed in the deed.in order for such a claim to be successful,it must be demonstrated not only that the right is reasonably necessary for the extraction of the mineral,but also that the right can be exercised without any substantial burden to the surface owner.
buffalo mining,at emphasis added.
although buffalo mining involved a severance deed more detailed than those presented here,its holding nevertheless harmonized the reasonable necessity standard as it applies to two divergent types of conflict between mineral estate owners and surface estate owners.the first involves conflicts where the mineral estate owner engages in activity that disturbs,perhaps permanently and negatively,the surface.see adkins united fuel gas,cutting ditches through surface owner farmland,permanently burying a gas pipeline used for gas drilling,and spilling oil and oily water on surface owner crops squires lafferty,drilling test holes on surface and transporting machinery and men across the surface porter mack,construction of tram road on surface to transport minerals.the second involves conflicts where the mineral estate owner engages in activity that virtually destroy s the surface or is otherwise totally incompatible with the rights of the surface owner.buffalo mining,at see brown crozer coal land,refusing to construe a severance deed to allow auger mining,which had resulted in slippage of the surface sufficient to uproot trees,toss boulders,and divert streams virginia pittsburgh coal strong,refusing to construe a severance deed to allow strip mining and reasoning that if the owner of the surface has a proprietary right to subjacent support he has at least an equal right to hold intact the thing to be supported,the surface.buffalo mining articulation of reasonable necessity without substantial burden generally allows the first set of surface uses,when reasonably necessary,as implicit to a grant of a mineral estate because the surface generally incurs no substantial burden.conversely,the second set of surface uses will generally be disallowed as implicit to a grant of a mineral estate the burden of such uses on the surface is generally so substantial that an explicit deed provision will usually be required 
before buffalo mining,the reasonable necessity doctrine simply did not discern between a case where a mineral estate owner drilled a hole into the surface and a case where a mineral estate owner all but removed the surface.indeed,the west virginia supreme court very recently noted that it has often been asked to address disputes between surface owners and mineral owners,and in some cases,it is sometimes unclear if a particular mineral is a mineral or part of the surface.faith united methodist church cemetery of terra alta morgan,wl,at.june.perhaps more to the point,however,the court noted that in some cases mineral extraction temporarily disturbs the surface and in other cases mineral extraction destroys the surface.see id.no matter the degree of disturbance,the court added,a s new minerals are discovered,and as better techniques for harvesting those minerals become available,legal conflicts between owners of the surface and of the minerals will abound.ultimately,we believe buffalo mining sorts the minor to moderate surface disturbance cases from the major surface destruction cases when a mineral estate owner seeks to do either pursuant to implied rights collateral to a grant of the mineral estate itself.
the court below acknowledged that the severance deeds in question did not address the issue of use of the property surface to store drill cuttings and other waste but nevertheless found such right to be created by implication as a reasonably necessary incident to creation of a gas well.the whitemans advance several arguments as to why the lower court conclusion was erroneous.we address each separately.
as a threshold matter,the whitemans essentially argue that chesapeake had a burden to show its use of the surface was reasonably necessary and did not impose a substantial burden upon the surface,that chesapeake failed utterly to develop a record to support such a showing,and that the court below erred in granting chesapeake summary judgment as a result.see appellant br.at.the whitemans apparently rely,in part,on buffalo mining,and no other authority,to support this argument.see id.at,stating chesapeake is subject to buffalo mining company exacting test in which it must show both necessity and the absence of a substantial burden on the surface.the whitemans miss a fundamental distinction between this case and buffalo mining concerning which party would carry the initial burden of proof at trial.as with any ordinary tort claim,the plaintiff must make an affirmative showing of a prima facie case the defendant need neither affirm nor rebut anything.see rhodes du pont de nemours,cir cert.denied,d noting that common law trespass require s that a plaintiff establish that the defendant conduct produced some injury to the plaintiff or to the plaintiff property.citing hark mountain fork lumber.
in buffalo mining,as noted above,the plaintiff was a mineral estate owner seeking to enjoin the surface owner from interfering with the mineral estate owner mining operations.buffalo mining,at.in other words,the mineral estate owner claimed the surface estate owner was interfering with the former incidental property rights associated with its grant of the mineral estate.accordingly,as the plaintiff,the mineral estate owner in buffalo mining had the initial burden of proving that the surface owner conduct produced some injury to the mineral estate owner incidental property rights.see rhodes,at.here,as chesapeake aptly recognizes,it is the other way around the whitemans have sued chesapeake for trespass and,accordingly,the whitemans would carry the burden of making a prima facie trespass claim at trial.see appellee br.at.moreover,no west virginia case has treated a mineral estate owner claim to reasonably necessary use of the surface to extract minerals as an affirmative defense.neither shall we.
relatedly,the whitemans argue that the court below failed to analyze the burden that chesapeake drilling operations imposed on the surface.appellant br.at.again,the burden to prove unauthorized entry or use in trespass is on the plaintiff.nevertheless,the record below supports a finding that the drill waste pits do not impose a substantial burden on the whitemans surface property.one of chesapeake experts opined that the drill waste pits have not affected the whitemans property value at all.ja at.the whitemans failed to rebut this expert opinion,offering none of their own to evaluate the risk that the drill waste pits in this case might slip or break.see
