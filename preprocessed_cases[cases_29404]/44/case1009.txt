background 
the underlying facts in the dispute in this case are laid out in detail in our prior opinion,familiarity with which is assumed.bbl i,at.
in brief,in november,bank brussels lambert bbl,a belgian banking corporation,joined a lending group led by the chase manhattan bank,chase new york that negotiated a secured million revolving credit agreement with two oil companies,collectively known as arochem.the primary collateral put up by arochem was to be its petroleum refinery in puerto rico.chase new york recommended to the lending group that it retain defendant fiddler gonzalez rodriguez fiddler,a puerto rican law firm,as local counsel for the limited purpose of providing an opinion letter as to the validity and enforceability of the security interest being acquired by the lending group.fiddler provided the requested opinion letter to the lending group,and the loan closed on january.five days later,as per the terms of the credit agreement,bbl disbursed million from its new york branch to arochem.
on december,arochem defaulted on the loan.shortly thereafter,will harris,the president and majority shareholder of arochem,was convicted of multiple counts of bank fraud,and during those proceedings it came to light that arochem may have systematically misreported its assets to the lending group.bbl sued chase new york for fraud and breach of contract,and during discovery in that case it inadvertently came to light that fiddler had received documents in an unrelated representation of chase manhattan puerto rico branch chase puerto rico which suggested that arochem was fraudulently manipulating its accounting and financial reports.bbl then commenced the instant suit against fiddler for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.
fiddler moved in the district court to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,which the district court granted in an opinion and order dated april.the district court held that none of the bases for jurisdiction set out in new york statute,cplr,were satisfied.
in bbl i,we agreed with the district court except with respect to a,which applies to persons who commit a tortious act outside new york which causes injury inside the state.id.at.contrary to the district court,we determined that if bbl had sufficiently averred a tort by fiddler,the situs of the injury alleged was new york,as the location where the first effect of the tort namely,the disbursement of funds to arochem by bbl new york place.id.at.we therefore remanded to the district court for it to determine whether bbl had sufficiently averred facts constituting a tort if so,whether the remaining requirements of cplr a had been satisfied and if so,whether exercise of jurisdiction would comport with the requirements of federal due process.id.at.
on remand,the district court determined,first,that bbl complaint had made out a legally sufficient claim for legal malpractice under puerto rican law.bbl ii,wl,at.specifically,the district court held that fiddler duty of loyalty to its client bbl might have required fiddler,upon learning of arochem financial manipulations,to either disclose that information or,if fiddler could not do so because that information was privileged,to withdraw from representation of the lending group.id.at.although the district court expressed skepticism as to whether bbl could ever prove causation,it held sufficient bbl allegation that,had fiddler withdrawn,bbl would have refused to participate in the credit agreement.id.at.
turning to the two subsections of cplr a,the district court next held that subsection ii,which relates to whether the defendant should reasonably have expected its acts to have consequences in new york,was not satisfied because fiddler had not sought out the representation and had therefore not purposefully affiliated itself with new york.id.at.however,with respect to subsection i,the district court held that fiddler longtime maintenance of an apartment in new york counted as a persistent course of conduct and that therefore personal jurisdiction under the statute had been established.id.at.
addressing the final question of federal due process,however,the district court held that it could exercise neither specific nor general jurisdiction over the defendant because the minimum contacts threshold had not been satisfied.id.at.with respect to general jurisdiction,the court held that fiddler contacts with new york were insufficiently continuous and systematic.id.at.with respect to specific jurisdiction,the court held that because fiddler had not specifically sought out the representation which gave rise to the claim,fiddler had not purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in new york.id.at.because the district court found that the test had not been satisfied,it did not reach the issue of whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over fiddler would be reasonable.id.at.the district court,therefore,again dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
with exceptions not relevant here,a district court sitting in a diversity action such as this may exercise personal jurisdiction to the same extent as the courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which it sits.k a.accordingly,resolution of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction made in the southern district of new york requires a analysis.first,the court must determine if new york law would confer upon its courts the jurisdiction to reach the defendant,which in this case could only be possible under the new york statute,cplr.if there is a statutory basis for jurisdiction,the court must then determine whether new york extension of jurisdiction in such a case would be permissible under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.bbl i,at.we review a district court dismissal for want of personal jurisdiction de novo.id.
jurisdiction under cplr a 
as noted,the only statutory ground on which we remanded to the district court for further proceedings was cplr a.this provision states as follows 
as to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section,a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any,or his executor or administrator,who in person or through an agent 
commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state,except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act,if he 
i regularly does or solicits business,or engages in any other persistent course of conduct,or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered,in the state,or 
ii expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.
cplr.because there is no dispute that the act forming the basis of the plaintiff complaint,namely,the failure of fiddler to either inform bbl of the arochem allegations of which it became aware or to withdraw as counsel,took place outside new york,and because we held in our first opinion that the injury allegedly caused by this act occurred in new york for a purposes,bbl i,at,it remained for the district court only to determine,first,whether plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the act was tortious,and second,whether plaintiff satisfied either or both of subsections i and ii.
in order to satisfy the first element,plaintiff had to aver facts constituting a tort under the law of the pertinent jurisdiction.id.at.because both parties have assumed that the law of puerto rico rather than new york governs whether the acts alleged are tortious,and neither side has identified any material difference between the two jurisdictions laws in this regard,we will likewise so assume,without deciding,which jurisdiction law is the proper one.we are also mindful of the fact that the inquiry at this stage is the preliminary question of jurisdiction,distinct from an inquiry into ultimate liability on the merits,see watch barnes reinecke,thus plaintiff need not actually prove that defendant committed a tort but rather need only state a colorable cause of action.see vincent alexander,practice commentaries,mckinney consol.laws of.
the district court held that plaintiff had stated a colorable tort claim under the law of puerto rico for legal malpractice based on an attorney duty of loyalty to his client.bbl ii,wl,at.we agree.as the district court correctly noted,puerto rican courts have determined that a conflict may arise where,in the course of successive or simultaneous representations of clients,the adequate representation of a subsequent or simultaneous client may require disclosure of the other client confidences.id.at quoting in re belen trujillo,english trans.upon discovering such a conflict,the attorney must withdraw from the representation without divulging any confidential communications.id.
defendant fiddler does not dispute this as a correct statement of the law with regards to representational conflicts in puerto rico.it argues,rather,that because it was retained only for the limited purpose of providing an opinion letter on the security interest being provided to the lenders,the information fiddler received about arochem financial dealings fell beyond the scope of its representation and therefore presented no conflict requiring its withdrawal.fiddler has not presented and we have not found any law,regulation or judicial opinion suggesting that puerto rico,or any other jurisdiction for that matter,would take such a miserly view of an attorney duty of loyalty to his or her client.fiddler likely had no duty to seek out information beyond what was necessary for the limited task for which it was retained,but plaintiff tort allegations here invoke fiddler obligations once information material to the business decisions of fiddler clients came into fiddler possession,not any broader affirmative duty to investigate as the district court concluded,the plaintiff assertion that fiddler,as bbl attorney,was obligated to disclose the chase puerto rico information as relevant to bbl decision with respect to the rca loan,thus creating a conflict that should have led it to withdraw from representation of both clients sufficiently alleges a breach of duty that gives rise to a claim for legal malpractice.id.as stated above,we need not finally decide the merits of plaintiff malpractice action it suffices that plaintiff has stated a colorable tort claim so as to give the district court jurisdiction to determine the merits 
turning to the two subsections of a,the district court found that subsection i had been satisfied by fiddler persistent course of conduct in new york of renting of an apartment for some eight years in manhattan.id.at.this apartment was available for the use of the firm partners,and,while it had apparently been largely used for vacations,defendant admits that at times the apartment was used for firm business and the firm claims the apartment as a business expense.bbl i,at.we therefore agree that this apartment rental was sufficient to constitute a persistent course of conduct by the firm.although this jurisdictional predicate has not often been expounded upon in the new york courts,there is nothing in the plain language of a i which suggests that the relevant contacts must be solely in fact,this predicate juxtaposition as an alternative to regularly do ing or solicit ing business suggests precisely the opposite.see also david tunick,kornfeld,considering both business and activities of art dealer in re union carbide.consumer prods.bus.secs,listing defendant leisure travel and negotiation of personal loan in addition to meetings granada television,int l,lorindy pics.int l,t he persistent course of conduct may involve a great range of human activity which,while it might fall beyond the pale of business conduct,would,because of its consistency,serve as a solid link of jurisdiction to new york.quoting mclaughlin,practice commentary,mckinney consol.laws of.nor do we accept the defendant argument that,despite the fact that this apartment was maintained by the firm both for business purposes and as compensation to its members,these contacts should not be imputed to the firm.
defendant argues that to read cplr a i as somehow providing a basis for jurisdiction based on the mere rental of an apartment in a hotel would render that provision unconstitutional.of course,it is not the mere rental that satisfies a i,it is the,persistent rental and use,coupled with the commission of a tortious act causing injury in new york,which confers jurisdiction.moreover,as the new york court of appeals has made clear,the constitutional analysis is a distinct step from the statutory one it is only once the statute is deemed satisfied that the court need examine whether due process is likewise comported with.lamarca.
finding jurisdiction to be present under cplr a i,we have no need to determine whether it is also present under a ii 
ii.due process 
having determined that the new york statute would extend the state jurisdiction over defendant in this case,we turn to whether the exercise of this jurisdiction comports with federal due process.to do so,we undertake an analysis consisting of two components the minimum contacts test and the reasonableness inquiry.metro.life ins,cir.
the first of these tests asks whether the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.titan,guangzhou zhen hua shipping,cir quoting calder jones,d alteration in original some internal quotation marks omitted.where the claim arises out of,or relates to,the defendant contacts with the forum,specific contacts exist where the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum and could foresee being haled into court there.accord burger king rudzewicz,d.a state may assert general jurisdiction,jurisdiction irrespective of whether the claim arises from or relates to the defendant forum where these contacts are continuous and systematic.titan,at see also helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.
we have no quarrel with the district court conclusion that general jurisdiction could not be maintained over defendant in these circumstances.bbl ii,wl,at.with regard to specific jurisdiction,however,the district court took too narrow a view of the relevant contacts.
the district court focused on the contacts which directly gave rise to the cause of action 
bbl argues that because fiddler opinion was a condition precedent to the rca,a new loan transaction,and addressed to the banks care of chase in new york and because fiddler communicated with the banks and their counsel,all located in new york,regarding the opinion,fiddler has sufficient new york contacts to support a finding of specific jurisdiction.again,nothing about any of these contacts demonstrates fiddler purposeful availment of the new york forum.fiddler did not solicit the banks to be retained for the opinion letter,the opinion letter solely concerned issues of puerto rico law and the other new york contacts such as communication by telephone,fax and mail are incidental to its unsolicited representation of
