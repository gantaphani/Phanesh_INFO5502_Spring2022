jenggi kaluom kaluom appeals from the order and final judgment entered by the united states district court for the southern district of texas,galveston division,on february,granting stolt offshore stolt motion for summary judgment and dismissing kaluom suit with prejudice.we agree with the district court that the voyage requirements set out in and apply to those foreign vessels encompassed by penalty wage statutes and.accordingly,because the foreign vessel on which kaluom worked was not embarked on one of the voyage types described by sections and,we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
kaluom is a malaysian national employed by malaysian crewing company ppsb ppsb assigned kaluom to work aboard the dlb,a foreign vessel documented under foreign laws.from september,to november,while the dlb was performing subsea pipeline laying operations on the united states outer continental shelf,kaluom worked aboard the dlb,first as a rigger but later as a pipe facing machine pfm operator.on november,while the dlb was working in the gulf of mexico,kaluom was injured in an accident and had to be airlifted to a hospital in galveston,texas.
on october,kaluom brought suit against stolt,a louisiana corporation with its principal place of business in the southern district of texas.kaluom asserted a penalty wage claim for himself and on behalf of others similarly situated,under and kaluom contended that stolt manned,victualed and navigated the dlb,and employed the vessel master,and that stolt failed to pay him the balance of wages owed to him under united states labor laws.kaluom received wages at a malaysian pay rate but contends that he should have been paid based on united states labor laws because the fair labor standards act flsa mandates overtime as well as a minimum hourly wage that is higher than its malaysian counterpart.
on november,stolt moved for summary judgment,contending inter alia that the penalty wage statutes kaluom relied on,and,could not be read in isolation from and,which articulate specific voyage prerequisites to applying chapters and of title of the united states code.stolt argued that,in light of and,kaluom could not rely on and penalty wage provisions because the dlb was on neither a foreign or intercoastal voyage,as articulated by section,nor a coastwise voyage,as described by section on december,kaluom responded to stolt motion for summary judgment,asserting that penalty wage statutes and appl y once a foreign vessel is in a harbor of the united states,regardless of the type of voyage that the vessel is engaged in.
on february,the district court granted stolt motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment dismissing with prejudice a ny and all of kaluom claims.the court reasoned 
the dlb was engaged in a pipeline installation project in the gulf of mexico during the period of kaluom assignment.the vessel originating port was in fourchon,louisiana,and there is no evidence that the ship went to any other port,nor is there any evidence that it engaged in a foreign,intercoastal or coastwise voyage the requirement of a foreign,intercoastal or coastwise voyage is a prerequisite to the application of the penalty wage provisions.see.if a ship is not engaged in one of the specified voyages,the penalty wage provisions do not protect the seamen on those vessels.a plain reading of the statute compels this result,and to read the statute in any other way would be erroneous.
on march,kaluom timely filed a notice of appeal.

discussion 
kaluom contends the district court misinterpreted and when it concluded that,before those statutory provisions may apply to a foreign vessel,the vessel must be on one of the voyage types specified in foreign or intercoastal voyages and coastwise voyage.kaluom does not seriously challenge the district court finding that the dlb was not on a foreign,intercoastal,or coastwise voyage,and he admits that for seamen serving on american vessels,the penalty wage statutes only apply if the voyage requirements are met.kaluom nevertheless argues on appeal that there is no voyage prerequisite for seamen serving on foreign vessels when those vessels are in united states harbors.
kaluom brought suit under two penalty wage provisions and.sections and both make clear that they apply to a seaman on a foreign vessel when in a harbor of the united states.i id.e.kaluom asserts that in his case,because the dlb is a foreign vessel we should read sections and independently of and voyage requirements.he bases this argument in large part on the fact that chapters and of title are generally inapplicable to foreign vessels.kaluom contends that the penalty wage statutes plain language,legislative intent,and legislative history support his view of the correct construction of penalty wage statutes and.we disagree with kaluom and decline to read sections and in the independent manner he advocates 
i.the statutory text 
t he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.id.we consider the text of and in turn.
subsections e and f of set out a seaman entitlement to of the balance of wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or delivers cargo during the voyage and to the balance of wages due the seaman at the end of a voyage.subsection g indicates that failure to adhere to subsection f provision for wages at a voyage end leads to penalty wages when payment is not made as provided under subsection f of this section without sufficient cause,the master or owner shall pay to the seaman days wages for each day payment is delayed.g.
a states that chapter of title sections applies to vessels that are on a foreign voyage between a port in the united states and a port in a foreign country except a port in canada,mexico,or the west indies or an intercoastal voyage between a port of the united states on the atlantic ocean and a port of the united states on the pacific ocean.see id.a.subsection c,however,states that u nless otherwise provided,this chapter chapter does not apply to a foreign vessel.id.c.
kaluom asserts that i indicates that section penalty wage provision,but not section requirement of a foreign or intercoastal voyage,applies to foreign vessels.subsection i states this section applies to a seaman on a foreign vessel when in a harbor of the united states.id.i.
kaluom argument against applying a voyage requirement fails.when construing a statutory provision,we first consider the statute as a whole before turning to the particular provision at issue.see in re universal seismic associates,cir when interpreting statutes,this circuit looks to the plain language of the statute,reading it as a whole and mindful of the linguistic choices made by congress quoting whatley resolution trust,cir.section is part of chapter,and clearly dictates that chapter applies only to those vessels that meet the foreign or intercoastal voyage requirement.a.section penalty wage provision is accordingly limited by the foreign or intercoastal voyage requirement described in section of whether the vessel at issue is american or foreign.because the dlb was on neither a foreign nor an intercoastal voyage,section penalty wage provision is inapplicable to kaluom.
our analysis of the other penalty wage statute relied on by kaluom,mirrors the foregoing analysis of section.subsections a and b of section set out a seaman entitlement to wages.subsection a states that a fter the beginning of a voyage,a seaman is entitled to receive from the master,on demand,of the balance of wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or delivers cargo during the voyage.a.subsection b states that the master shall pay a seaman the balance of wages due the seaman within days after the termination of the agreement required by section of this title or when the seaman is discharged,whichever is earlier.c exacts penalty wages for the failure to adhere to subsection b when payment is not made as provided under subsection b of this section without sufficient cause,the master or owner shall pay to the seaman days wages for each day payment is delayed.
indicates that chapter sections of title applies to those vessels not covered by chapter that are on a voyage between a port in one state and a port in another state except an adjoining state.id.a.subsection c states that u nless otherwise provided,this chapter does not apply to a foreign vessel.
kaluom relies on e,which states that section applies to a seaman on a foreign vessel when in harbor of the united states.however,like subsection i,subsection e can not be read in isolation from the chapter that surrounds it.because section dictates that chapter applies only to those vessels not covered by chapter that have embarked on a voyage between a port in one state and a port in another state except an adjoining state,and because the dlb was not on such a voyage,kaluom may not take advantage of penalty wage provision.
we also note that both sections and refer to a vessel voyage.see id.e describing the seaman entitlement to wages a fter the beginning of the voyage id.a same id.f discussing the seaman entitlement to the balance of his wages a t the end of a voyage.these references support our determination that and should be read in conjunction with and,as these references employ the term voyage in a manner consistent with use of the term elsewhere.su aster,cir declining to define voyage as a leg of the trip because such a definition conflicts with the structure and language of the wage act.
moreover,we reject kaluom assertion that inclusion of the phrase in a harbor of the united states in subsections i and e indicates the lack of a voyage requirement where foreign vessels are at issue.in su southern aster,cir,the ninth circuit concluded that the in a harbor of the united states phrase serves as a jurisdictional provision.see at.thus,the ninth circuit relied in part on that phrase in holding that f,g should not apply to foreign seafarers discharged from foreign ships in foreign ports.see id.at.the ninth circuit explained,had congress wanted to include all foreign vessels,it could have done so expressly.the language of the wage act is clear.it applies only to foreign vessels in united states ports.id.at we conclude that in this case,too,the statutory language is clear the voyage requirements in sections and apply to seamen on both american and foreign vessels who wish to invoke the penalty wage provisions in and.
ii.legislative intent 
i n rare cases the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,and those intentions must be controlling.griffin oceanic contractors,d.this,however,is not such a rare case.
first,if we were to construe subsections i and e in the independent manner kaluom advocates,refraining from applying and voyage requirements to foreign vessels,at least one of the subsections referring to foreign vessels would be redundant.this is so because if the voyage requirements are read separately from subsections i and e,i and e would be without a meaningful difference.if congress had intended these subsections to be free of chapter and chapter voyage requirements,then congress would likely have indicated the disparate treatment of foreign vessels by creating a single,separate section dealing with penalty wages for seamen on foreign vessels.
second,there is strong evidence that congress did not intend for foreign vessels to be treated differently under the penalty wage statutes.the united states supreme court has stated that the purpose of amendments made in to the penalty wage in the application of penalty wages to seamen on foreign to equalize the rights of foreign and united states seamen see strathearn dillon.stating that,at least in regards to section,the seaman act of march,stat,manifests the purpose of congress to place american and foreign seamen on an equality of right.construing and in the manner kaluom advocates would place seamen on foreign vessels in a better position than their colleagues on american vessels seamen on foreign vessels could claim penalty wages in situations where seamen on american vessels could not.thus,legislative intent supports applying and voyage requirements to foreign vessels that otherwise fall under or umbrella.
iii.legislative history 
the penalty wage statutes legislative history is likewise conclusive.as explained below,from to,there was just one section setting out both the voyage requirements and the penalty wage provisions.this historical structure indicates that and voyage requirements should be read together with the penalty wage when dealing with foreign vessels.
seamen wages were the subject of legislation enacted by the first congress,giving seamen the right to collect their wages as soon as the voyage is ended.governor of the bank of scotland sabay,cir quoting act of july,ch,stat.congress established penalty wages approximately years later,in.id.citing shipping commissioners act of,ch,stat.the shipping commissioners act of dictated that every master or owner who neglects or refuses to make payment in manner aforesaid without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum not exceeding the amount of two days pay for each of the days,not exceeding ten days,during which payment is delayed,stat.at.the section of the act setting out this penalty wage provision begins with describing the seaman entitlement to wages,stating in pertinent part,t he master or owner of any ship making voyages as hereinbefore described in section twelve of this act shall pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination of the agreement,or at the time such seaman is discharged,whichever first happens id.emphasis added.section twelve of the act refers to foreign and intercoastal voyages see,stat.at.
the and statutes were the basis for of the revised statutes,which contained language substantially identical to that in the statute.sabay,at citing stat.ed.section of the revised statutes incorporated both the act reference to foreign and intercoastal voyages and the act provision for penalty wages.thus,from,the provision for penalty wages and the description of voyage requirements were located in the same statutory section.
twenty years later,in,congress amended the penalty wage statute,eliminat ing the limitation for penalty wages,but decreas ing the penalty from two to one day pay for each day of delay.sabay,at citing act of,ch,stat.the amendment also added to section reach,dictating payment to seamen by the master or owner of any vessel making coasting voyages,stat.at emphasis added.section continued to refer to foreign and intercoastal voyages.id.as with the version of section,the amended version included voyage requirements and provided for penalty wages within a single statutory section.
in,section was again amended,and penalty wages were doubled to the present two days pay for each.id.citing seaman act of,ch,stat,codified at.like the previous versions of section,the version,in a single section,provided for penalty wages and set out the types of voyages that would bring a vessel under its purview.see,stat.at.also in the act amending section,it was provided that section,which refers explicitly to section,shall apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the united states,stat.at stating that when the voyage is ended every such seaman shall be entitled to the remainder of the wages which shall then be due him,as provided in section hundred and of the revised statutes emphasis added.as noted,section expressly applied only to seamen on the specified voyages.the amendment to section,with its as provided in section language,appears to be the first time that seamen on for
