we must decide whether a federal district court has diversity jurisdiction over a lawsuit involving a partnership where one of its partners is a dual citizen domiciled in a foreign state.the district court held that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over such an entity,and we affirm.

we have jurisdiction pursuant to over a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and our review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is plenary.see vanterpool,cir.
ii.factual and procedural background 
plaintiff clifton swiger sued allegheny energy,allegheny energy supply,llc,allegheny energy services,and morgan,lewis bockius llp morgan lewis,collectively defendants,on several state law claims,including abuse of process,wrongful use of civil proceedings,invasion of privacy,and wrongful discharge,in the eastern district of pennsylvania based upon diversity jurisdiction.
morgan lewis,joined by the other defendants,moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,on the ground that complete diversity between the parties was lacking.morgan lewis is a partnership that,at the time of the filing of the lawsuit,had among its partners,charles lubar,a dual united states and united kingdom citizen domiciled in the united kingdom.the district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that g iven that for diversity purposes,the court must consult the citizenship of all of the members of an artificial entity such as a general or limited partnership and because a united states citizen who is not domiciled in one of the united states can not invoke diversity jurisdiction in one particular state,we must conclude that we are without jurisdiction to act in this matter.swiger allegheny energy,wl,at,emphasis in the original citations omitted.swiger timely appealed.
iii.analysis 
swiger argues that the district court erred in holding that it lacked diversity jurisdiction because,according to swiger,a single partner who is not a citizen of a state does not render the entire partnership stateless for diversity purposes whether a federal district court has diversity jurisdiction over a lawsuit involving a partnership that has among its partners an american citizen domiciled in a foreign state is an issue of first impression in this circuit.to our knowledge,however,all courts that have addressed this issue have held that such an entity does not qualify for diversity jurisdiction.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with those other courts and hold that if a partner of a partnership is a united states citizen permanently living abroad,there can be no diversity of jurisdiction over the partnership because the partner is neither a citizen of a state nor a citizen of a foreign country.
swiger also argues that even if the stateless partner destroys diversity,the district court nevertheless had alienage jurisdiction because lubar,as a dual citizen of the united states and the united kingdom,is a citizen or subject of a foreign state.this argument,however,is foreclosed by our recent decision in,at,in which we held that,for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,we consider only the american citizenship of a dual national.we consider each of swiger arguments in turn.
diversity jurisdiction and the stateless partner 
district courts have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and is between citizens of different states citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state citizens of different states and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign state are additional parties and a foreign state,defined in section a of this title,as plaintiff and citizens of a state or of different states.
a natural person is deemed to be a citizen of the state where she is domiciled.see gilbert david.a corporation is a citizen both of the state where it is incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.c.
partnerships and other unincorporated associations,however,unlike corporations,are not considered citizens as that term is used in the diversity statute.see carden arkoma,d holding that a limited partnership is not a citizen under the jurisdictional statute see also lincoln prop.roche,d f or diversity purposes,a partnership entity,unlike a corporation,does not rank as a citizen.united steelworkers of am.bouligny,d holding that a labor union is not a citizen for purposes of the jurisdictional statute great fire proof hotel jones.holding that a limited partnership association,even though it was called a and declared to be a citizen of the state under the applicable state law,is not a citizen of that state within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute chapman barney.holding that although the company was endowed by new york law with the capacity to sue,it could not be considered a citizen for diversity purposes james moore,moore federal practice ed hereinafter moore federal practice a partnership is not a citizen of any state within the meaning of the statutes regulating jurisdiction.
given that partnerships are not citizens for diversity purposes,the supreme court has long applied the rule of chapman barney that courts are to look to the citizenship of all the partners or members of other unincorporated associations to determine whether the federal district court has diversity jurisdiction.see lincoln prop,at.carden,at.bouligny,at.great fire proof hotel,at.chapman,at.see also charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure ed.w henever a partnership,a limited partnership,a joint venture,a joint stock company,a labor union,a religious or charitable organization,a governing board of an unincorporated institution,or a similar association brings suit or is sued in a federal court,the actual citizenship of each of its members must be considered in determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists.in chapman,the supreme court,on its own motion,reversed a judgment on the grounds that the federal court did not have jurisdiction over a stock company because the record did not demonstrate that all the partners of the stock company were citizens of a state different than that of the defendant 
on looking into the record,we find no satisfactory showing as to the citizenship of the plaintiff.the allegation of the amended petition is that the united states express company is a company organized under a law of the state of new york,and is a citizen of that state.but the express company can not be a citizen of new york,within the meaning of the statutes regulating jurisdiction,unless it be a corporation.t he company is,a mere partnership 
the company may been organized under the laws of the state of new york,and may be doing business in that state,and yet all the members of it may not be citizens of that state.the record does not show the citizenship of barney,or of any of the members of the company.
at.emphasis added.in a nearly unbroken chain the supreme court has consistently applied the chapman rule,holding that a partnership is not a citizen,but that the court must look in the case of a suit by or against a partnership association to the citizenship of the several persons composing such association.great fire proof hotel,at.see also carden,at.bouligny,at.
further,in the context of partnerships,the complete diversity requirement demands that all partners be diverse from all parties on the opposing side.see lincoln prop,at.accord carden,at.accepting the rule that the court will count every member of an unincorporated association for purposes of diversity jurisdiction and reject ing the contention that to determine,for diversity purposes,the citizenship of an artificial entity,the court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity members carlsberg res.cambria sav.loan ass n,cir when the rule of complete diversity is read in conjunction with the principle that the citizenship of a partnership depends upon that of its members,it becomes clear that diversity jurisdiction may not obtain here,unless all of the members of the plaintiff partnership are of distinct citizenship from all of the defendants.underwood maloney,cir w here jurisdiction is sought to be founded on diversity of citizenship,the action being by or against an unincorporated association the citizenship of the individual members must be shown to be wholly diverse from that of the opposing party or those of the opposing parties.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.w here the interest is joint,each of the persons concerned in that interest must be competent to sue,or liable to be sued in the federal courts.
partnerships which have american partners living abroad pose a special problem.in order to be a citizen of a state within the meaning of the diversity statute,a natural person must be both a citizen of the united states and be domiciled within the state,d.an american citizen domiciled abroad,while being a citizen of the united states is,of course,not domiciled in a particular state,and therefore such a person is stateless for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.see id.thus,american citizens living abroad can not be sued or sue in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction as they are neither citizens of a state,see a,nor citizens or subjects of a foreign state,see id.a.see,at.
putting these principles together,that is,that the citizenship of the individual partners must be shown to be wholly diverse from that of the opposing party or those of the opposing parties and that american citizens living abroad can not sue or be sued in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction,our sister circuits and other federal courts have concluded that if a partnership has among its partners any american citizen who is domiciled abroad,the partnership can not sue or be sued in federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction.see herrick scs commc ns,cir accord isi int l,borden ladner gervais llp,cir one of the partnership partners is a citizen domiciled in canada she has no state citizenship,so the diversity jurisdiction is unavailable.cresswell sullivan cromwell,cir if in fact any of s c united states citizen partners are domiciled abroad,a diversity suit could not be brought against them individually in that circumstance,since for diversity purposes a partnership is deemed to take on the citizenship of each of its partners,a suit against s c could not be premised on diversity.internal citations omitted see also moore federal practice if a member of a partnership is a united states citizen permanently living abroad,there can be no diversity of jurisdiction because the member is neither a citizen of a state nor a citizen of a foreign country.
swiger,however,asks us to disregard these cases and create an exception to the chapman tradition.he argues that we should ignore lubar lack of state citizenship and focus only on the partners who are citizens of a state.morgan lewis has american partners domiciled in,among other states,pennsylvania,new york,and california therefore,morgan lewis,according to swiger,is a citizen of pennsylvania,new york,california,and so on.although morgan lewis has a stateless partner,swiger contends that the partnership can hardly be characterized as stateless indeed,under this view,morgan lewis is quite stateful.that is,according to swiger,one party,morgan lewis,is a citizen of pennsylvania,new york,and california,and so on,and the other party,swiger,is a citizen of west virginia,ipso facto,the parties are citizens of different states.
we can not agree.first,the supreme court has explicitly held,and consistently stated,as we have already noted,that a partnership is not a citizen for purpose of diversity jurisdiction.instead,for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,a partnership citizenship as a party is determined by reference to all partners,and all partners must be diverse from all parties on the opposing side lincoln prop,at.see also carden,at.w e reject the contention that to determine,for diversity purposes,the citizenship of an artificial entity,the court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity members.second,morgan lewis,as an entity,is just as stateless as it is stateful morgan lewis is not an american citizen,and it has no domicile in any state.but rather than treating partnerships as stateless,the chapman rule determines the partnership citizenship for purposes of diversity by referring to the citizenship of each partner.the rule of chapman is a legal construct that allows a real legal entity,though a,to sue and be sued in federal court based upon diversity by looking through the partnership to the citizenship of each partner.
because morgan lewis has a stateless partner,and thus,all partners of morgan lewis are not diverse from all parties on the opposing side,the district court correctly held that it lacked diversity jurisdiction over this action.
alienage jurisdiction 
swiger argues that even if jurisdiction based on diversity of state citizenship is lacking,the district court nevertheless had diversity jurisdiction under a,because lubar,as a dual citizen of the united states and the united kingdom would still be a citizen or subject of a foreign state,and as such,lubar would be diverse from swiger within the meaning of a.that is,complete diversity would exist because swiger is a citizen of west virginia and lubar is a citizen of the united kingdom.after this appeal was briefed,but before oral argument,we decided this question in,in which we held that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,only the american nationality of a dual national is recognized.see,at.because lubar is a united states citizen,any reliance on a alienage jurisdiction would be in error.id.at.thus,o nly if lubar was domiciled in a particular state of the united states at the time the suit was filed,and that state was diverse from that of swiger,would subject matter jurisdiction be present as against morgan lewis.id.
iv.conclusion 
whenever a partnership or other unincorporated association brings suit or is sued in a federal court,the citizenship of each of its partners or members must be considered in determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists,and all partners or members must be diverse from all parties on the opposing side.lubar,a morgan lewis partner and american citizen domiciled abroad,is stateless for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.because lubar,as a stateless person,can not sue or be sued in federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction,neither can morgan lewis.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i agree that the authority relied upon by my colleagues strongly suggests the analysis the lead opinion has adopted and the result my colleagues have reached.i am therefore reluctant to disagree with that conclusion even though i do not think that the result we reach today is necessarily compelled by precedent of this court or the supreme court.i am,in fact,concerned that our decision today unnecessarily extends two conventions of diversity jurisprudence and thereby inappropriately circumscribes that jurisdiction.i think my colleagues would agree that it would be more logical to treat stateless partners in situations like this as jurisdictional zeroes,rather than as citizens of the plaintiff state but we are not writing on a blank slate.
i realize,of course,that it is not the province of this or any other lower court to undermine the carden rule or the stateless person doctrine discussed in the lead opinion.nevertheless,applying the carden rule and stateless person doctrine here results in a ruling that is inconsistent with both reality and common sense.accordingly,although i concur in the result,i hope that congress will one day see fit to clarify that our diversity jurisdiction does extend to this situation.
article iii of the constitution provides,in pertinent part,that t he judicial power shall extend to controversies between citizens of different states.in its current form,the diversity statute provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds and is between citizens of different states a.in chapman barney,the supreme court established that the citizenship of an unincorporated association such as a partnership is defined by the citizenship of
