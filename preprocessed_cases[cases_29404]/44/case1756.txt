appellants,flaherty crumrine preferred income fund,flaherty crumrine preferred income opportunity fund,flaherty preferred securities income fund,collectively,and stan haiduk haiduk,filed a securities fraud class action and individual fraud claims against appellees txu corporation txu and its former ceo john wilder wilder for allegedly making material misrepresentations and omissions of fact in connection with a offer to purchase certain convertible txu securities the tender offer in.specifically,appellants alleged that appellees fraudulently misrepresented the timing and magnitude of a planned stock repurchase program and dividend increase in order to induce the appellants to participate in the tender offer.the district court dismissed appellants fraud claims alleged under sections b and e of the securities exchange act and sec rule,as well as appellants common law fraud claims,for failure to state a claim under the heightened pleading standards applicable to securities fraud claims.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
appellants are three investment funds and an individual plaintiff haiduk,all of whom owned convertible txu securities called txu corporate units the corporate units and txu income prides the prides.both classes of securities were traded on the new york stock exchange and were convertible into txu common stock.
prior to the tender offer,wilder,txu ceo,had implemented a restructuring program aimed at improving txu business.on may,approximately four months before the tender offer,txu issued a press release outlining its view of the company financial restructuring program.the press release indicated that txu did not anticipate a dividend increase until,when certain financial benchmarks were reached,but noted that txu board of directors the board might consider other relevant factors in determining when or if to authorize a dividend increase 
upon reaching the targeted balance sheet strength and financial flexibility,management would recommend that the board of directors reevaluate the current dividend policy.at that time,management expects it would recommend targeting annual common stock dividends equal to a pay out of percent of the earnings of txu electric delivery business.of the free cash flow,management would expect to return roughly percent to shareholders in the form of distributions or repurchases and to retain roughly percent for long term growth initiatives.assuming the execution of the business initiatives and transactions described above,and depending on market trends in commodity prices,management expects that this capital allocation program will enable management to recommend an increase of the dividend in.in addition to management recommendation,the board of directors may consider other relevant factors in determining if and when to make a change in the dividend policy.
on september,txu announced that it was offering to purchase up to outstanding corporate units and up to outstanding prides.appellants collectively held corporate units and prides prior to the tender offer.investors holding the outstanding securities had the option to tender their securities to txu or retain them,and appellants were among the roughly of investors who accepted the tender offer and sold their securities back to txu.the price offered for the securities in the tender offer was for each corporate unit and for each pride.the tender offer purchase price was determined by applying a factor to the weighted average price of txu common stock between september,and october.the tender price was higher than the market price for the securities at the time of the tender offer.the offer itself as well as forms filed with the sec and the associated press release contained the following language concerning the dividend policy 
txu debt and capital management program is intended to strengthen txu balance sheet and financial flexibility.as a part of its capital management and restructuring program and considering current business and market conditions,txu management is evaluating whether it should recommend to the txu.board of directors that they reevaluate txu current common stock dividend policy.txu can not predict the outcome of management evaluation,when,if at all,management would make a recommendation to the board of directors to change the current common stock dividend policy,or what management recommendation might be.in addition to any recommendation from management,the board of directors may consider other relevant factors in determining if and when to make a change in txu common stock dividend policy.
txu also announced its intent to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock,subject to market conditions and other factors.on september,ceo wilder made a presentation in which he reiterated previous representations that the dividend policy was under review and discussed txu capital allocation and growth strategy.
on october,just one day before the expiration of the offer,txu management gave a detailed financial plan to certain credit rating agencies for the purpose of facilitating the agencies determinations of whether an increase in txu annual dividend would adversely affect the corporation credit rating.on october,the final day of the tender offer,tendered of its corporate units to txu for total proceeds of,and haiduk tendered corporate units for total proceeds of and prides for total proceeds of.
on october,six days after the end of the tender offer period,txu management provided materials to the board proposing a change in dividend policy,and on october,management recommended a increase of the annual dividend on common stock and a increase in the stock repurchase program.in the interim between management provision of the materials to the board and the final recommendation,txu management received final reports from the credit rating agencies informing the corporation that an increase in dividend payouts would not adversely affect its credit rating.on october,the board approved the dividend increase and the stock repurchase program.on october,txu publicly announced its plan to increase the common stock dividend from to and to repurchase approximately million shares of txu common stock.immediately following the announcement,the value of txu common stock jumped nearly.the corporate units and the prides experienced correlated increases in value.
on,september,appellants filed their original class action complaint in the district court,alleging that the appellees violated federal securities laws and intentionally defrauded appellants and other similarly situated holders of txu securities by failing to inform those who participated in the tender offer that a dividend increase and increased stock repurchase was imminent.appellants essential theory is that txu and wilder failed to inform them of the impending dividend increase in order to induce appellants to participate in the tender offer before the value of their securities increased.appellants alleged three causes of action for fraud under the securities exchange act a violation of section e a violation of section b and rule and controlling person liability against wilder under section a appellees filed a motion to dismiss all of the appellants claims on december,which was granted by the district court.appellants appealed to this court,but while the appeal was pending,the united states supreme court issued its decision in tellabs,makor issues rights,d,which clarified the pleading standard for scienter under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.in response to the tellabs decision,and without addressing the merits of the appeal,this court vacated the district court judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of tellabs.flaherty crumrine preferred income fund txu.cir.

appellants urge that,in accepting the tender offer,they relied on the representation originally stated in txu may press release indicating that txu did not anticipate a dividend increase until,when certain financial benchmarks were reached.appellants do not clearly delineate between whether they allege an affirmative misrepresentation or an omission.in their second amended complaint,appellants pointed to various statements made after the may press release which they allege do not contain a sufficient disclosure of the impending dividend increase or affirmatively misstate that no dividend increase will occur until after certain financial benchmarks are reached.
the first of these statements,issued in the tender offer materials on september,stated 
as a part of its capital management and restructuring program and considering current business and market conditions,txu management is evaluating whether it should recommend to the txu.board of directors that they reevaluate txu current common stock dividend policy.txu can not predict the outcome of management evaluation,when,if at all,management would make a recommendation to the board of directors to change the current common stock dividend policy,or what management recommendation might be.in addition to any recommendation from management,the board of directors may consider other relevant factors in determining if and when to make a change in txu common stock dividend policy.
appellants contend that this statement is misleading because,although it does state that the dividend policy is under review,it does not sufficiently disclose the alleged steps taken to increase the txu dividend upon completion of the tender offer.
the second statement that appellants point to was made by wilder at the merrill lynch global power gas leaders conference on september,during the tender offer period wilder presented a power point presentation,which included a slide that described txu capital allocation policy.the slide stated that the dividend payout was under review.the statement concerning the dividend payout was contained in a flow chart and was preceded by a statement that debt reduction was to continue until certain financial goals had been met.an arrow pointing toward the dividend payout section flowed from the debt reduction section of the chart.appellants contend that this flow chart indicated that the dividend payout step would not take place until the debt reduction goals had been met.appellants contend that at the time wilder made this statement,he knew that the financial benchmarks would not be met before the dividend was increased and that significant steps had been taken to increase the dividend which were not communicated sufficiently by the statement that the dividend policy was under review.appellants also contend that appellees failure to retract the may statement concerning the dividend policy violated federal securities laws.
in addition to the facts pleaded in the their complaint,appellants reference statements made in a january,letter appended to their complaint written by then txu associate general counsel david poole the poole letter and conclusions in an expert report prepared by professor linda allen the allen report which appellants claim provides evidence that at the time of the tender offer,appellees were fully aware of the impending dividend increase.
in the poole letter,txu counsel stated that management had been contemplating a change in dividend policy since august,but did not make a final decision until after the close of the tender offer on october.the poole letter also asserted that txu management would not make a decision concerning the dividend policy until they had received information from certain credit rating agencies,evaluating the impact of changes in dividend policy and capitalization on the credit ratings of debt securities of txu and its subsidiaries.appellants contend that this explanation,advanced here by the appellees,is implausible,pointing to conclusions made in the allen report.by comparing the txu restructuring and dividend policy changes with those of other companies and evaluating the dates put forth in the poole letter,the allen report concludes the fact that the agencies had not given any official evaluation of the dividend senior management likely already knew during the tender offer period that the credit rating agencies would not downgrade its issuer rating based on the common share dividend increase.the allen report also concludes,based on allen evaluation of the general credit rating process of major credit rating agencies,that the credit agency review could not be completed between october,the date on which appellees furnished the credit agencies with paperwork concerning the proposed dividend increase and october,two days before management recommended the increase.
although the timing of the dividend increase,which was recommended by txu management just eight days after the close of the tender offer,is suspect,appellants have not provided facts sufficient to support a cogent and compelling inference that appellees made any statements intentionally or recklessly to mislead txu investors.in fact,it is not clear that appellees ever issued a materially misleading statement or omission of fact concerning the dividend policy.the close proximity of the dividend increase to the end of the tender offer,though it provides some support for an inference of scienter,is not sufficient,without more,to establish a strong inference of the requisite intent.see in re digital island sec,d,aff,cir holding that the fact that the offeror company disclosed two successful transactions within weeks after tender offer was completed does not establish that company had knowledge of these transactions at time tender offer was made.
appellants contend that they relied on the may press release which stated that a dividend increase was not likely until when certain financial benchmarks had been made,but reserved the right of the management to consider other factors in determining if and when to change the dividend policy.appellants have not presented any evidence of scienter with regard to this statement.there is no evidence that at the time this statement was made in may,txu management,specifically wilder,was aware or should have been aware that txu planned to increase the dividend prior to the financial benchmarks being reached.
the second statement pointed to by appellants,made at the start of the tender offer period,was that the dividend policy was under review.appellants contend that this statement was made to mislead investors because at the time it was made,substantial steps had been taken toward a dividend increase which warranted a more substantial disclosure or a retraction of the may press release statements.again,appellants evidence does not support a strong inference that,on the date this statement was issued,appellees knew and were at least reckless in failing to disclose that there was an impending dividend increase.although the allen report provides some support for the notion that txu management likely made preparations for the dividend increase before the close of the tender offer,such preparations do not support a cogent and compelling inference that wilder or other txu management were intentionally or recklessly misleading investors.in fact,the statement that the dividend policy was under review conveyed that txu had taken some steps in evaluating a change in the dividend policy.
the precedent of this court does not support the notion that txu disclosure that its policy was under review was insufficient,let alone fraudulent,under federal securities laws.txu had disclosed that its dividend policy was under review,but that it could not predict if,or when,management would ultimately recommend a dividend increase.txu management did not recommend the dividend increase until sometime after october,and the board did not actually approve a dividend increase until october.both of these dates fell after the expiration of tender offer on october.this court precedent advises that a middle course is proper when making disclosures concerning future plans which have not been fully determined in the context of a tender offer.susquehanna pan am.sulphur,cir holding that a tender offeror is not required to make predictions of future behavior,however tentatively phrased,which may cause the offeree or the public investor to rely on them unjustifiably.txu could not have disclosed that a dividend increase was likely during the tender offer without running a risk of liability if the dividend increase was not ultimately approved.see id.the statement that the dividend policy was under review appears to be a statement that,although vague,accurately represents the state of the dividend policy during the tender offer period.furthermore,given that the may press release stated that the board could consider factors other than the outlined financial benchmarks when determining whether to change the dividend policy,the statement in the tender offer materials that the dividend policy was currently under review was entirely consistent with the press release,and obviated the need to retract the may representations.
the statement made by wilder during his presentation provides a closer question as to whether the appellants have established scienter.appellants contend that wilder presentation reiterated the structure stated in the may press release,conveying that a dividend increase was contingent upon the completion of certain financial benchmarks.in order to satisfy the scienter requirement,appellants must establish that wilder made this representation knowingly or recklessly in order to mislead investors.
in the first instance,there is a question as to whether wilder presentation was a misstatement.although the phrase dividend payout is contained in a flow chart which is preceded by the debt reduction step,the dividend payout step does affirmatively state that it is presently under review,consistent with txu prior disclosures even assuming that the presentation was a misleading statement concerning the dividend policy,appellants have not provided evidence to support a strong inference of scienter.appellants again poi
