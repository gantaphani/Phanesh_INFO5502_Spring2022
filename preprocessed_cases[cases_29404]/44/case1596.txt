the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc appeals from the district court judgment in favor of navy federal credit union navy federal on the eeoc title vii retaliation claim concerning donna santos,a former navy federal supervisor.in its complaint in the eastern district of virginia the complaint,the eeoc alleged that navy federal had illegally discharged santos for opposing what she reasonably believed to be the unlawful treatment of one of her subordinates,tammy simms.following extensive discovery proceedings,the district court awarded summary judgment to navy federal,concluding that the eeoc evidence of retaliation was insufficient and that its claim was also barred by laches.see eeoc navy fed.credit union,no.june,the opinion.as explained below,we vacate and remand.
navy federal,a credit union serving employees of the department of the navy and their families,is headquartered in vienna,virginia in april,donna santos began working as a supervisor in navy federal staffing section,a position entailing her oversight of four subordinates during her probationary period,santos received positive performance appraisals,and,in january,she was recognized in an internally circulated message for a wonderful idea to help us enhance software support.
in march,however,representatives of navy federal employee relations section received complaints from three of santos subordinates about her performance,including that she was incompetent and,and that there was a lack of communication,training,and leadership in the staffing section.these three employees including tammy simms also complained that santos had failed to intervene in issues involving dianne snably the fourth santos subordinate,and that santos and snably seemed to have teamed against them.they reported their complaints to the employee relations section on march,and.
notwithstanding these complaints,santos,on march,received a merit salary increase,and,on april,she received an annual performance appraisal rating her as highly successful or successful in all scored categories in this appraisal,santos was complimented for,inter alia,learning to address and resolve conflicts among the staff immediately instead of allowing them to fester being intricately involved in motivating the staff delegat ing effectively and assign ing the workflow so that deadlines and objectives are met deal ing equitably with the group and continu ing to improve her organizational and planning skills.it was also recognized that t he staffing section continues to improve their team work under santos direction.id.
after april,assessments of santos performance became less laudatory.on july,santos immediate supervisor,jan herman,met with santos to discuss three specific to post a job vacancy announcement,telephone usage,and coverage of the staffing section during lunch.then,on august,herman documented santos performance for the month,observing that she needed improvement in the areas of leadership and controlling operations.in support of this assessment,herman noted the following santos was absent from work on the day her section distributed an important booklet,leaving no one to address problems relating thereto she attended a computer software class when her section was already on two occasions,significant mistakes were found in paperwork that had been approved by a subordinate to whom santos had delegated that responsibility on three occasions,staffing section employees were observed being idle and some of santos subordinates were regularly five to ten minutes late to work in the morning,took overly long breaks and lunches,closed their work stations early,and made excessive personal phone calls.herman concluded that santos needs to pay attention to her staff,what is getting done,and ensuring that the staffing section is running smoothly and according to policy at all times.herman also remarked that santos is more interested in her own training and development in pc applications than in her job as a navy federal supervisor.id.at the time of these observations,herman considered conducting a special review of santos which presumably would have involved a more formal performance appraisal and constituted a more grievous mark on santos employment record.by early september,however,herman had decided against such a review,because santos had improved her job performance.
in,tammy simms was promoted by navy federal to a position in the staffing section,which placed her under santos supervision.over time,santos criticized simms performance in various respects,but complimented it in others.simms perceived santos criticism of her as unfair and complained that santos overburdened her with an inequitable workload.other staffing section employees,however,believed that santos sometimes gave special treatment to simms by,among other things,excusing simms from physical tasks because of a difficult pregnancy,and adjusting her work schedule to accommodate limitations.
simms was one of the three santos subordinates who complained in march about santos lack of effective leadership,including her failure to rein in their snably.the record reveals that snably was at times all of her,but perhaps especially to those who were women,including simms and barbara stephens simms reported to santos on march,and then to the employee relations section on march,that she believed snably was hiding her paperwork to set her up and had done the same to stephens.although santos expressed her dissatisfaction with snably to simms,simms concluded that santos was an ineffective supervisor and was thereafter unwilling to go to santos about problems with snably.simms also came to suspect that santos and others were prejudiced against simms.
in late august through early september,a series of meetings were held among,in various configurations,simms,santos,snably,herman,and representatives of the employee relations section.during these meetings,the participants discussed both positive and negative aspects of simms performance,her ongoing complaints about santos and snably,and simms concerns about possible racial discrimination against her and stephens.these meetings failed to resolve the tensions in the staffing section or convince simms that she was being treated fairly.
on september,simms filed an internal request for resolution form,with the employment relations section.in it she alleged race,color,sex,and age discrimination,and detailed numerous instances of alleged unfair treatment by santos,snably,and others.shortly thereafter,according to santos and the eeoc,navy federal devised a plan to terminate simms in retaliation for her discrimination complaint,and to cover up its reasons for the discharge in order to protect itself from liability in subsequent litigation.the eeoc maintains that santos opposed this retaliation position that resulted in her suspension and,ultimately,her discharge from navy federal.
by the time simms lodged her internal complaint,herman had considered conducting a special review of santos,but decided against it in view of santos improved performance.between the time that simms filed her complaint and the time that santos learned of navy federal retaliation scheme,aspects of santos performance were assessed on two occasions.on september,herman observed a problem with santos and simms taking a lunch break at the same time,prompting her to warn santos not to make it a continuing practice.on a more positive note,personnel director ellen yarborough sent a handwritten note to santos on october,thanking her for her hard work in developing a new application for the annual financial plan and for completing all the personnel budget requirements.yarborough remarked we appreciate your dedication to getting it done.great job id.santos asserts that she received yarborough note,along with a cash bonus,as part of the directors award given to one employee annually in the human resources division for outstanding contributions to the division.
according to santos,she shortly thereafter learned of navy federal scheme to retaliate against simms.the scheme was to give simms favorable performance evaluations,which could be used to defend navy federal actions in subsequent litigation and to heighten scrutiny of simms activity in order to discover an objective and seemingly legitimate basis for her termination.
on october,a meeting was held with santos,herman,and two representatives of the employee relations section,including the head of that section,angela culbertson.culbertson was angry about simms allegations of discrimination and declared that she would get tammy simms on principle.culbertson instructed santos to heighten surveillance of simms work habits,including compiling accuracy reports and documenting the quantity of work that simms produced.santos knew that the oversight responsibilities would fall primarily to snably,the subject of many of simms complaints.she objected to the plan because she felt that it would be unfair to simms.santos proposed that she oversee simms work instead,but culbertson rejected her plan.
shortly thereafter santos participated in a conference call between culbertson and navy federal outside counsel.while discussing simms discrimination complaint,the attorney for navy federal suggested that culbertson just fire the bitch.the attorney also warned culbertson that any negative evaluations of simms performance could be perceived as retaliatory.santos was then asked whether simms was likely to file a retaliation claim if she was terminated.when santos responded affirmatively,she was asked to leave the meeting.santos later learned that culbertson had decided to give simms favorable performance assessments while efforts were made to discover an objective basis for terminating simms,such as payroll fraud.
the week before october,santos was determined to be well qualified for a promotion in the human resources division.nevertheless,on october,santos received a special review,which covered the period from may,to october.this review downgraded santos performance appraisal in numerous areas relating to her supervisory and management duties.in conjunction with the review,santos was placed on probation for days,through approximately april.she retained her usual supervisory responsibilities during that period.
in november,santos prepared several proposed evaluations of simms performance,all of which concluded that simms performance needed improvement.culbertson rejected each of these assessments because they were too negative,and she eventually took it upon herself to prepare a substantially more positive evaluation that rated simms successful or highly successful in all scored categories.when asked by herman to sign culertson evaluation of simms,santos refused to do so,being unwilling to endorse an evaluation she believed to be fabricated.herman strongly urged santos to sign the evaluation and warned her that if she failed to do so her probationary period would not go well for her and that she was doing herself in.santos nevertheless refused to sign the evaluation,prompting herman to endorse it instead.
on january,herman called santos into her office and advised her to begin looking for a different job.although navy federal usual special review policy was to place the targeted individual on probation for days and offer suggestions for improvement during that period,herman advised santos that there was nothing she was going to be able to do to change things.on february,herman prepared a special review of santos for the period from october,to february,further downgrading her scores and recommending termination for an inability to improve performance of supervisory responsibilities to a successful level.on february,santos was terminated.
on march,simms resigned from navy federal and filed a discrimination complaint against it in the fairfax county human rights commission the fchrc.two days later,on march,simms complaint was with the eeoc,pursuant to a worksharing agreement between the fchrc and the eeoc the worksharing agreement.on may,navy federal initially responded to simms complaint in the fchrc.in its response and subsequent correspondence,navy federal disputed simms charge of discrimination on several grounds,including that she had received a successful performance appraisal from herman in january.the fchrc actively investigated simms charge until october,when navy federal declined to make a settlement offer to simms.thereafter,the fchrc investigator assigned to the simms case essentially ignored it while dealing with personal issues,only corresponding with navy federal in march with requests to interview several of its employees.finally,the fchrc assigned a new investigator to the simms case in the fall of.
on february,the fchrc issued a ruling on simms discrimination complaint,finding sufficient evidence of retaliation,but insufficient evidence of race or national origin discrimination.subsequently,on march,the fchrc referred the simms case to the eeoc to ascertain whether it wished to issue a cause finding,noting that the fchrc had lost jurisdiction,as of march,to conduct a public hearing on simms complaint.four months later,on july,the eeoc issued its own determination,agreeing with the fchrc conclusions and additionally finding reasonable cause to believe that simms supervisor later identified as santos was the victim of retaliation 
settlement negotiations then commenced between the eeoc acting on behalf of simms and santos and navy federal.eventually,simms requested a letter so that she could pursue a federal court action on her own meanwhile,settlement negotiations continued between the eeoc now acting on behalf of santos only and navy federal.the last of those negotiations occurred between september and november of.finally,on april,the eeoc initiated this proceeding on santos behalf in the eastern district of virginia.in its complaint,the eeoc alleged that navy federal had retaliated against santos in contravention of section a of title vii,a.
on june,navy federal sought summary judgment on laches grounds,which the court denied on july.on december,following discovery,navy federal renewed its motion,asserting the following that eeoc evidence of retaliation was insufficient and that the eeoc claim was barred by laches.by its opinion of june,the district court granted summary judgment to navy federal both on the merits and on the grounds that laches barred the eeoc claim.opinion at.the eeoc has filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo an award of summary judgment,viewing the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.see seabulk offshore,am.home assurance,cir.such an award is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c alteration in original.
because the equitable balancing required in a laches determination is committed to the discretion of the district court,we may reverse such a ruling only if such discretion was abused.see white daniel,cir.by definition,a court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.united states ebersole,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
by this appeal the eeoc makes two contentions that the district court erred in ruling that the eeoc failed to present sufficient evidence of retaliation and that the court abused its discretion in ruling that laches barred the eeoc claim on behalf of santos.we assess each of these contentions in turn.
in assessing the eeoc retaliation claims,we are obliged to begin with the language of the relevant statutory provisions.in pertinent part,section a of title vii prohibits an employer from taking an adverse employment action against any employee because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter.title vii a,a.under the framework first formulated by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d,a plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.see laughlin metro.airports,cir citing mcdonnell douglas,at.once this burden is carried,the burden shifts to the defendant,who is obliged to articulate a legitimate,justification for the adverse employment action.see id.if the defendant carries this burden,the onus is on the plaintiff to then demonstrate that the reason advanced by the defendant is a mere pretext.see see also reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
by its opinion,the district court concluded that the eeoc had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation against navy federal,and that the eeoc had failed to demonstrate that the reason advanced by navy federal was a pretext.opinion at.as explained below,we are unable to agree with these conclusions.
in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must prove three elements that she engaged in a protected activity that her employer took an adverse employment action against her and that there was a causal link between the two events.see von gunten maryland,cir citing beall abbott,cir.only the first element of this test is at issue here.the district court concluded that the eeoc had failed to establish that santos had engaged in a protected activity.the court reached this result for two reasons a because santos had not opposed any action taken by navy federal and b because santos had no reasonable basis for believing that any action taken by navy federal was unlawful.opinion.
under the applicable legal principles,in the context of a retaliation claim,a protected activity may fall into two categories,opposition and participation.only one of these relevant here.see laughlin,at citing a.as we have recognized,protected oppositional activities may include staging informal protests and voicing one own opinions in order to bring attention to an employer discriminatory activities,as well as complain ts about suspected violations,bryant aiken reg l med,cir.
in concluding that santos did not oppose any of navy federal actions toward simms,the district court emphasized that santos was one of the primary objects of simms internal discrimination complaint.opinion at.but the unlawful activity that santos claims to have opposed was not the discrimination alleged by simms,but rather navy federal acts of retaliation against simms for complaining of discrimination.according to santos,navy federal intended to terminate simms in retaliation for her allegations of discrimination,and to cover up its improper reasons for her termination with ostensibly objective grounds.the evidence reveals that santos opposed this scheme.specifically,when culbertson gave primary supervisory authority over simms to snably,santos objected,believing the transfer of authority from her to snably to be a component of navy federal improper retaliatory scheme.more importantly,when santos was asked to sign what she believed to be a misleading but favorable evaluation of simms work,santos refused to do so because of her understanding that navy federal intended to use the evaluation to defend itself from future litigation by simms this evidence,showing that santos objected to snably supervision of simms and that she refused to approve the misleading evaluation of simms performance,precluded a ruling in favor of navy federal on the question of opposition.
the district court further concluded,however,that even if santos had opposed actions taken by navy federal,she could not have reasonably believed that those actions were in violation of title vii.we have recognized that section a protects activity in opposition not only to employment actions actually unlawful under title vii but also employment actions an employee reasonably believes to be unlawful.see united states ex rel.wilson graham county soil water conservation,cir,vacated on other grounds,d see also nealon stone,cir.in its ruling,the district court reasoned that the increased surveillance and scrutiny of simms work habits were merely administrative actions that could not reasonably be adverse employment actions.it further held that santos could not reasonably have believed that navy federal efforts to evaluate simms more favorably than she deserved were adverse to simms because favorable treatment is b y definition not adverse.id.
unfortunately,the district court analysis on this point took too narrow a view of navy federal actions relating to simms.assessing the evidence of navy federal actions towards simms as a whole,santos held a reasonable belief that navy federal was unlawfully retaliating against simms.the series of relevant events,recounted by santos in her testimony before the fchrc and in her deposition here,shows that her superiors at navy federal set in motion a plan to terminate simms in retaliation for her complaints of racial discrimination,while at the same time seeking to conceal their improper motives under the guise of objective criteria.
shortly after simms filed her discrimination complaint,santos attended a meeting where culbertson became angry and asserted that she would get tammy simms on principle.shortly thereafter santos participated in the conference call where navy federal lawyer suggested that they just fire the bitch.during this conference call,the attorney also advised culbertson that any unfavorable evaluations of simms performance could potentially support a retaliation claim by simms.culbertson and others at navy federal then developed a plan under which simms would receive favorable evaluations while her actions were scrutinized to discover an objective basis for her discharge,such as payroll fraud,which would insulate navy federal from civil liability.navy federal was not,in this context,doing simms a favor by positively assessing her job performance.the heightened scrutiny and favorable evaluations were thus part and parcel of its larger plan to fire simms for unlawful reasons and to cover up those reasons with pretextual charges.when santos objected to the added surveillance and refused to sign the misleading evaluation of simms,she therefore reasonably believed that she was opposing unlawful retaliation.in these circumstances,the eeoc has presented evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation against santos.
as explained above,when a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.see reeves,at.laughlin,at citing mcdonnell douglas,at.if the defendant carries this burden,the presumption of retaliation falls,and the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving that the defendant reason for the adverse employment action was pretextual.see id 
in ruling in favor of navy federal on the pretext issue,the district court concluded that the eeoc had presented no evidence to directly rebut defendant evidence that santos supervisory skills were deficient.opinion at.navy federal did present evidence that,despite santos technical skills,she was not considered a capable supervisor.during march,three of santos subordinates complained of problems within santos section.indeed,one complained that there was a lack of communication,training,and leadership in the staffing section.another complained that she was receiving inadequate training and that santos had lost control of her section.in july,herman,santos supervisor,met with her to discuss various performance issues,and in august,herman documented that santos needed improvement in the areas of leadership and controlling operations.
the summary judgment record,however,also contains evidence demonstrating that santos supervisors were pleased with her overall job performance and that her opposition to the plan to terminate simms was the actual basis for her discharge.in april,shortly after her subordinates complained of her incompetence and lack of supervisory skills,santos received a positive annual performance appraisal,which praised,inter alia,her achievements in resolving interpersonal conflicts in her section,motivating her staff,and deal ing equitably with the group.although by september herman had registered complaints about certain aspects of santos performance,herman decided against a special review because she believed that santos performance had improved.furthermore,in october,navy federal presented santos with the human resources division direc
