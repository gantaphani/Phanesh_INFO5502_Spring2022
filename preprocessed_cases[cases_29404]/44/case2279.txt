david best claims to suffer from permanent loss of his sense of a result of a pool chemical spilling onto his face and clothing at a lowe home center store.after filing suit against lowe,best planned to introduce the expert testimony of francisco moreno,a otolaryngologist an ear,nose,and throat doctor and a former chemical engineer,in order to establish the causal link between the chemical spill and his injuries.the district court excluded moreno testimony,holding that the method employed by the doctor in drawing his conclusions regarding causation was unscientific speculation.this resulted in summary judgment being granted in favor of lowe.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
best visited a lowe store in knoxville,tennessee in june.intending to purchase chemicals for his swimming pool,he located a product called aqua ez super clear clarifier aqua ez.when best lifted the plastic container from the shelf,an unknown quantity of the contents splashed onto his face and clothing.the container had allegedly been accidentally punctured with a knife by the lowe employee who had opened the shipping box.best went to the emergency room of a hospital for treatment on the day that the spill occurred.four months later,best sought care and treatment from moreno for the injuries associated with the incident.moreno has practiced medicine as an otolaryngologist since.before attending medical school,moreno earned a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering.he was employed as a chemical engineer from until.
at the time of his initial visit to moreno,best described the incident at lowe.he said that the spilled product had a strong odor,and that immediately thereafter he had suffered from irritation and burning of his skin,irritation to his nasal passages and mouth,dizziness,and shortness of breath.best also reported that he experienced clear drainage from his nose following the spill and that he eventually lost his sense of smell completely.moreno was unable to inspect best mucous membranes for physical damage because they are located too far inside the nasal passages to permit visual examination.
best was seen for a second time by moreno in january.moreno took a new medical history and again performed a physical examination to the extent possible in light of the position of the mucous membranes in the nose.at that time,best was experiencing known as a runny or stuffy swelling and decreased airflow.best reported that,during the year period since the spill incident,he had struggled with rhinitis,anosmia,and dizzy spells.
in april,moreno administered to best the university of pennsylvania smell identification test upsit,a standardized test of olfactory function.the test involves various sample chemicals,requiring the test subject to choose one of four descriptions of each sample scent.best scored a six on the test,a score consistent with complete anosmia.
moreno testified in his deposition that l oss of smell is caused by either a virus,an accident,tumors to the brain,surgery into the brain,or exposure to chemicals.he also conceded that sometimes anosmia is idiopathic,meaning that it occurs for unknown reasons,and that some medications can cause a loss of the sense of smell.moreno proceeded to list the following medications that best reported taking at the time of his chemical exposure aspirin,atenolol,effexor,hydrochlorithiazide,lescol,letensin,moxamorphin,oxycontin,protonix,and remeron.moreno stated that atenolol and lotensin are for blood pressure aspirin,moxamorphin,and oxycontin are for pain effexor is for depression hydrochlorothiazide is a fluid pill and protonex is for the stomach.he was unfamiliar with the drug lescol.referring to all of the medications,he stated that i n my practice,with the patients that i have seen over the years,i have never seen an anosmia caused from the use of these medications.he also said that he had looked up all of the medications except lescol in the course of his practice.moreno was unable to list the general types of medications that can cause a loss of the sense of smell.
lowe provided best attorney with a document identifying the pool chemical as aqua ez.the document describes the product as a thick blue liquid containing cationic polymers that attract foreign particles in the pool water so that they can be more efficiently removed by the filtration system.after receiving this document,best attorney obtained a material safety data sheet msds prepared by ciba specialty chemicals corporation,the supplier of the active ingredient in aqua ez.moreno reviewed the msds,which describes the characteristics of the active ingredient.
the relevant ingredient is an organic cationic polyelectrolyte.specifically,the compound is a homopolymer with the name,n.the msds identifies the chemical as hazardous and states that p rolonged or repeated contact may cause eye and skin irritation.primary routes of entry for the compound are listed as ingestion,skin,inhalation,eyes.according to the msds,if the chemical is inhaled,the person should be r emove d to fresh air,if not breathing give artificial respiration.if breathing is difficult,give oxygen and get immediate medical attention.the handling instructions state do not inhale use only with adequate ventilation.under the heading engineering controls,the msds instructs work in well ventilated areas.do not breathe vapors or mist.the msds also notes that acute inhalation toxicity for the compound has not been determined.moreno later reviewed a second msds,published by,another supplier of the relevant compound.that msds confirmed that the compound is irritating to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory tract and that it m ay be harmful if inhaled.
moreno concluded,based on the msds information,that the inhalation of aqua ez has the potential to cause damage to the nasal and sinus mucosa and the nerve endings of the olfactory bulb.according to moreno,the culprit components of the polymer in question include a chlorine derivative and an ammonium derivative.he offered his opinion that a chemical burn can cause a loss of smell on a time basis due to scarring of the tissue,and reported that he has treated other chemical exposures with anosmic side effects following exposure to chlorine derivatives.but moreno did not know the precise amount of the offending chemical that best had been exposed to,nor was he able to determine the threshold level of exposure that could cause harm.moreno summarized his diagnosis regarding causation this way 
the patient had an accident,chemical was spilled,the patient can not smell.if we have any trust in the patient at all,all i can say is he can not smell.i did test him,his test was positive in the fact that he was anosmic.all i can tell you is that exposure to only exposure that he had at the time that i talked to him was exposure to this chemical.there was nothing else in his history that dictated the fact that he was anosmic otherwise.
in short,because of the temporal relationship between best exposure to the chemical and the onset of his symptoms,in conjunction with a principled effort to eliminate other possible causes of anosmia,moreno formed the opinion that the inhalation of aqua ez caused best to lose his sense of smell.
procedural history 
best originally filed suit against lowe in a tennessee trial court.lowe timely removed the case to the federal district court based upon diversity of citizenship under.after best identified moreno as an expert witness,counsel for lowe took the doctor deposition.lowe then moved for the exclusion of moreno testimony regarding the cause of best injury and also moved for summary judgment.the district court excluded moreno proposed testimony after concluding that the doctor opinion was too speculative.best lowe home centers,wl at.june.because best presented no other evidence to carry his burden of proof on the element of causation,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of lowe on best anosmia claim.id.best later withdrew his claims for the less serious injuries and losses that he allegedly suffered as a result of the chemical spill.the court accordingly granted summary judgment in full to lowe.best now appeals the district court decision to exclude moreno testimony.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we apply the standard in reviewing a district court decision regarding the admissibility of expert testimony.hardyman norfolk ry,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.brown raymond,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
admissibility of expert testimony on medical causation 
rule of the federal rules of evidence controls the admissibility of all types of expert testimony.the rule provides as follows 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
according to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,a district court task in assessing evidence proffered under rule is to determine whether the evidence both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.id.at.the district court must consider whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.id.at.
daubert attempts to strike a balance between a liberal admissibility standard for relevant evidence on the one hand and the need to exclude misleading junk science on the other.see amorgianos passenger,cir.there is no definitive checklist or test for striking this balance,but the supreme court in daubert set forth a number of factors that typically bear on the inquiry.at.these include whether the theory or technique in question can be and has been tested,whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication,whether it has a known or potential rate of error,and finally,whether the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance in the relevant scientific community.id.at.the rule inquiry is a flexible one,and t he focus must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions they generate.id.at.an expert who presents testimony must employ in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.kumho tire carmichael,d.
c.the district court analysis 
in applying daubert to moreno opinion,the district court focused on the analysis found in the case of downs perstorp components,d.the district court in downs excluded the testimony of a physician who concluded that an incident involving skin contact and inhalation exposure to a polyurethane polymer caused the plaintiff to suffer severe facial pain,sensory abnormalities,visual field losses,impaired balance,slowed reaction time,and impairment.id.at.that opinion in turn relied heavily on moore ashland chemical,cir en banc affirming a district court exclusion of a physician opinion.downs,d at.downs also identified and considered a list of red flags provided by a treatise on evidence,and the district court in the present case followed suit.id.at citing saltzburg,martin kapra,federal rules of evidence manual,ed.
the red flags that were employed by both the downs court and the district court in the present case to purportedly demonstrate a lack of reliability were the following improper extrapolation,reliance on anecdotal evidence,reliance on temporal proximity,insufficient information about the case,failure to consider other possible causes,lack of testing,and subjectivity.downs,d at best,wl at.according to the district court below,moreno opinion regarding the cause of best alleged loss of his sense of smell raised every red flag except number lack of testing.id.at.
specific faults perceived by the district court included moreno extrapolation from the chemical ability to irritate mucous membranes to a conclusion that such irritation could lead to scarring and anosmia.id.at.the court also faulted moreno for relying on past experiences with patients who had been exposed to different chlorine derivatives and the temporal proximity between the incident and the reported injury.id.it next criticized moreno for having insufficient information about the case because he reli ed on best general and subjective report of the accident,an examination of best,and the msds sheet.id.the court then noted that moreno was unfamiliar with lescol,one of best medications,and concluded that his opinion was faulty for failure to consider other possible causes.id.in light of moreno testimony that testing the effects of hazardous chemicals on humans is not appropriate,the district court decided not to hold the lack of such testing against him.id.having concluded that the six other red flags were raised,however,the court held that moreno opinion was inadmissible unscientific speculation.id.
differential diagnosis 
moreno employed a methodology known as differential diagnosis in forming his opinion.differential diagnosis is t he method by which a physician determines what disease process caused a patient symptoms.the physician considers all relevant potential causes of the symptoms and then eliminates alternative causes based on a physical examination,clinical tests,and a thorough case history.hardyman norfolk ry,cir quoting federal judicial center,reference manual on scientific evidence.
as described above,moreno formed his opinion regarding best alleged loss of his sense of smell by considering a list of the possible causes of such an injury a virus,an accident,tumors to the brain,surgery into the brain,or exposure to chemicals as well as best use of medications and the possibility of another,unknown idiopathic cause.he took note of the temporal proximity between best exposure to aqua ez and discovered that the pool clarifier contained a chemical that,according to the msds,is irritating to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory tract and m ay be harmful if inhaled.although moreno was unable to quantify the level of best exposure,he noted that the chemical was quite little bottle is poured into a whole swimming pool and relied on best report that the material splashed onto his face and clothing.moreno ruled out medications as the cause,based on his knowledge of the side effects of nine out of best ten medications he had no information about the tenth,and also because he had never known of a patient who had used any of the medications and developed anosmia.finally,moreno ruled out idiopathic anosmia because of the remote likelihood that some unknown cause would bring about anosmia all of a sudden around the same time as an exposure to a chemical that is known to irritate the nasal mucous membranes.
this court recognizes differential diagnosis as an appropriate method for making a determination of causation for an individual instance of disease.hardyman,at.an overwhelming majority of the courts of appeals agree,and have held that a medical opinion on causation based upon a reliable differential diagnosis is sufficiently valid to satisfy the first prong reliability of the rule inquiry.westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir collecting cases from the first,second,third,ninth,and circuits.differential diagnosis is considered to be a standard scientific technique of identifying the cause of a medical problem by eliminating the likely causes until the most probable one is isolated.hardyman,at quoting westberry,at.
the district court below did not cite hardyman or any other cases that discuss the admissibility of causation opinions based on the method of differential diagnosis.because the court did not recognize that differential diagnosis is a valid technique that often underlies reliable testimony,its conclusions are not entitled to the deference that they would otherwise receive under the standard of review.see united states bent oak highway,cir explaining that we will extend a high degree of deference to the district court decision under the standard only if the district court properly understood the pertinent law.we will accordingly analyze moreno method de novo to determine whether his methodology led to a reliable,admissible opinion under rule.
not every opinion that is reached via a method will meet the standard of reliability required by daubert.see,rolen hansen beverage,cir holding that a doctor opinion did not meet the kind of methodological rigor that characterizes acceptable differential diagnosis.the problem is that no case in this circuit has previously provided detailed guidance for the district courts in separating reliable differential diagnoses from unreliable ones.we find the third circuit opinion in the case of in re paoli railroad yard pcb litigation,cir,instructive in this regard.
in paoli railroad yard,the court evaluated the causation testimony of two physicians regarding the various ailments of a large number of plaintiffs who lived near a facility where polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs were used for an extended period of time.id.at.the third circuit noted that differential diagnosis generally is a technique that has widespread acceptance in the medical community,has been subject to peer review,and does not frequently lead to incorrect results.id.at.it also emphasized the individual nature of each differential diagnosis.id.t he steps a doctor has to take to make a differential diagnosis reliable are likely to vary from case to case.as a result,the court stated that,to the extent that a doctor utilizes standard diagnostic techniques in gathering information,a finding that the doctor methodology is reliable is more likely.id.another observation by the court was that performance of physical examinations,taking of medical histories,and employment of reliable laboratory tests all provide significant evidence of a reliable differential diagnosis,and that their absence makes it much less likely that a differential diagnosis is reliable.id.the core of differential diagnosis is a requirement that experts at least consider alternative causes.id.at.
we hereby adopt the following test,adapted from the third circuit opinion a opinion in the form of a doctor differential diagnosis is reliable and admissible where the doctor objectively ascertains,to the extent possible,the nature of the patient injury,see id.at a physician who evaluates a patient in preparation for litigation should seek more than a patient of symptoms or illness and should determine that a patient is ill and what illness the patient has contracted,rules in one or more causes of the injury using a valid methodology,and engages in standard diagnostic techniques by which doctors normally rule out alternative causes to reach a conclusion as to which cause is most likely.id.at.
in connection with the third rules out prong,if the doctor engage s in very few standard diagnostic techniques by which doctors normally rule out alternative causes,the doctor must offer a good explanation as to why his or her conclusion remain s reliable.id.similarly,the doctor must provide a reasonable explanation as to why he or she has concluded that any alternative cause suggested by the defense was not the sole cause.id.at.
our approach is similar to those employed in other circuits that recognize differential diagnosis as a valid basis for opinions.see,ruggiero,cir where an expert employs differential diagnosis to rule out other potential causes for the injury at issue,he must also rule in the suspected cause,and do so using scientifically valid methodology.internal quotation marks omitted glastetter novartis pharm,cir in performing a differential diagnosis,a physician begins by ruling in all scientifically plausible causes of the plaintiff injury.the physician then rules out the least plausible causes of injury until the most likely cause remains.
moreno opinion was sufficiently reliable to warrant admissibility 
applying our newly formulated test to moreno opinion,we conclude that his methodology meets the minimum threshold for admissibility.we consider each element of the test in turn.
moreno ascertained,to the extent possible,that best is anosmic 
moreno employed a confirm best complaint that he could not smell.based on the research that moreno had done regarding tests for anosmia,he concluded that the upsit is as objective as you ever going to get.lowe has made no attempt to discredit that test.
instead,lowe argues that moreno had never before administered the upsit and that best score was only one point outside the range for malingering,suggesting that best purposely manipulated the result.lowe also points out that when best took the upsit,moreno possessed conflicting information about best smoking factor that the doctor knew could affect the test results.in addition,lowe complains that moreno did not examine the record of best visit to the hospital emergency room,during which best allegedly stated that he did not inhale the aqua ez.but best also reported at that time that the chemical spilled on his face and clothing,and he described its strong odor.moreno accordingly observed that he would have to assume that regardless of the statements made that best had to have had some exposure.
all of lowe attacks on moreno efforts to ascertain whether best is anosmic amount to factual disputes suitable for.see daubert,at.vigorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.where,as here,a doctor has used a reliable method to conclude that the plaintiff has suffered an injury,potential problems such as those pointed out by lowe do not warrant the total exclusion of plainly relevant testimony.
moreno employed a valid methodology to rule in aqua ez as a potential cause 
based on his medical knowledge,moreno compiled a list of possible causes for the injury,including virus,accident,brain tumor,brain surgery,exposure to chemicals,medications,or an ideopathic unknown cause.lowe strongest argument is that no published material confirms that inhalation of the chemical in aqua ez can cause anosmia.but there is no requirement that a medical expert must always cite published studies on general causation in order to reliably conclude that a particular object caused a particular illness.kudabeck kroger,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreno did not arbitrarily rule in aqua ez as a potential cause,but instead concluded from the msds sheet and his own knowledge of medicine and chemistry that the chemical it contains can cause damage to the nasal and sinus mucosa upon inhalation.
in addition,moreno has treated other patients who developed anosmic symptoms after inhaling chlorine derivatives.the opinion presented by moreno thus differs markedly from those in cases like ruggiero,cir,where the second circuit excluded a doctor opinion that a particular diabetes medication could cause liver cirrhosis and death because the expert could not point to anything suggesting such a possibility.id.at.
another second circuit case,mccullock fuller,cir,comes much closer to the circumstances in the present case.in mccullock,the plaintiff developed throat polyps after being exposed to fumes.id.at.her treating physician,an experienced medical doctor certified by the american board of otolaryngology,opined that the plaintiff polyps resulted from inhalation of the fumes from the pot.id.at.the msds sheet for the hot glue at issue in mccullock contained similar warnings to those in this case,including avoid breathing,and vapors and fumes may cause irritation of the nose,throat and respiratory tract.id.at.despite the defendant insistence that the expert could not point to a single piece of medical literature that says glue fumes cause throat polyps,id.at,the court admitted the doctor testimony,citing in support the doctor review of the msds and his training and experience,among other things.id.at.moreno testimony should likewise be admitted here.
moreno engaged in standard techniques to rule out alternate causes 
having no evidence that virus,accident,brain tumor,or b
