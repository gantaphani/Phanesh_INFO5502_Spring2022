plaintiff harold shields filed this suit after officials in kerr county,texas dropped charges against him for the aggravated sexual assault of a child.claiming that he never should have been charged in the first place,shields sued kerr county and two county employees for alleged violations of federal and state laws.during the pendency of the lawsuit,shields attempted to stay the case to depose members of the grand jury that indicted him.the district court issued orders that quashed the depositions of the grand jurors denied shields requests to stay or continue the case while he sought approval to depose the grand jurors and granted summary judgment on all counts in favor of the defendants.shields appeals these rulings.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in november,kerr county sheriff deputy carol twiss began investigating the sexual assault of a young girl,during the course of the investigation,told investigators that her grandfather and uncle had molested her.she also said that two of whom she referred to as m were involved.
deputy twiss suspected that harold lloyd shields was initially,the principal ground for suspicion appears to have been the fact that shields was acquainted with grandfather.subsequently,during an interview conducted by deputy twiss and others,was presented with a photographic lineup and identified a picture of shields as resembling m.in addition,deputy twiss and others interviewed shields and considered several of his responses suspicious.
based on their investigation,kerr county officials decided to prosecute shields.they began by seeking a indictment against him.as part of this process,deputy twiss filed an affidavit and testified before the grand jury.ultimately,the grand jury indicted shields on three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child.shields subsequently surrendered to kerr county officials,was arrested,and paid a bond fee of to secure his release pending trial.before trial,however,recanted her allegations concerning m,and kerr county dismissed the charges against shields.
shields now contends that deputy twiss failed to conduct an appropriate investigation.according to shields,had an appropriate investigation been carried out,it would have revealed his innocence.in support of this contention,he points to a series of facts that were inconsistent with his being for example,due to impotence,he was unable to perform some of the acts that alleged were done to her.additionally,he did not move to texas until approximately two years after said that m began molesting her.shields also contends that the photographic lineup shown to was flawed and prejudicial because only the photograph of shields bore physical characteristics similar to description of angered by these perceived lapses on the part of deputy twiss and donnie coleman,the kerr county assistant district attorney who prosecuted him,shields sued 
in september,shields filed his second amended complaint.in it,he named as defendants deputy twiss and assistant district attorney coleman in their individual capacities he also named kerr county,texas as a defendant.
proceeding under,shields alleged in his second amended complaint that each of the defendants violated his constitutional rights while acting under the color of state law.specifically,shields asserted claims of unreasonable arrest,unreasonable detention,and malicious prosecution under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.he further averred that deputy twiss and assistant district attorney coleman failed to conduct a reasonable investigation.moreover,he contended that kerr county should be held liable for these violations of his constitutional rights because it failed to supervise deputy twiss properly and to provide her with a manageable caseload,thereby preventing her from conducting a reasonable investigation.similarly,he asserted that kerr county did not properly train or supervise deputy twiss in the creation and presentation of photographic lineups.finally,shields invoked the district court supplemental jurisdiction and pleaded four tort claims under texas law against twiss and coleman false arrest,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,and negligent investigation.
this case was originally assigned to the late judge garcia.during discovery,shields sought to depose several members of the state grand jury that indicted him,ostensibly to show that the indictment they returned was faulty because exculpatory evidence had been withheld from them.the defendants moved to quash the subpoenas,arguing that both federal and state law require the proceedings of grand juries to be kept secret.in response to these motions to quash,shields moved the court for leave to file a consolidated response.in his consolidated response,shields noted that there were no existing records of the proceedings,and he contended that,as a result,he needed to depose the grand jurors to rebut the defendants reliance on the indictment to preclude his constitutional claims.
on january,the district court issued an order granting the defendants motions to quash and ordering shields counsel not to contact any member of the kerr county grand jury that indicted shields.this order was signed fred biery district judge for garcia.one day later,judge garcia granted shields motion to file a consolidated response.concerned that the court had not considered his consolidated response when ruling on the motions to quash,shields promptly filed a motion for reconsideration,which judge edward prado summarily denied.
undeterred,shields next petitioned a texas state court to permit him to depose the grand jurors.he also asked the district court to stay this case pending the outcome of the ancillary proceeding.judge biery denied shields request for a stay in august.
each defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in march.later that month,this case was reassigned to judge royal furgeson.in july,judge furgeson granted the defendants motions for summary judgment.
in his decision granting summary judgment for the defendants,judge furgeson first held that shields failed to create a genuine issue of fact concerning whether deputy twiss and assistant district attorney coleman withheld information from the grand jury.accordingly,judge furgeson held that the grand jury finding of probable cause precluded shields fourth amendment claims regarding his arrest and imprisonment.judge furgeson further stated that even if the indictment had not been returned,shields claims would still fail because he did not show that twiss and coleman should be denied qualified immunity for acting unreasonably in determining that probable cause existed.second,judge furgeson found that shields claim was also precluded by the grand jury finding of probable cause.additionally,according to judge furgeson,shields claim failed because he did not allege that either twiss or coleman acted with malice.third,judge furgeson found that there was no authority supporting a constitutional claim for unreasonable investigation.fourth,judge furgeson found that kerr county could not be held liable because shields put forward no evidence of any constitutional violation.likewise,judge furgeson found that shields put forward no evidence showing that kerr county had a policy or custom encouraging the use of unconstitutional photographic lineups.finally,judge furgeson found that summary judgment in favor of the defendants was appropriate on shields claims.in support of this conclusion,judge furgeson stated that shields failure to establish a genuine issue of fact concerning his constitutional claims doomed his claims and,alternatively,that shields had not presented evidence that twiss and coleman should be denied official immunity under texas state law.accordingly,judge furgeson granted summary judgment for the defendants on all counts and dismissed shields suit with prejudice.
after summary judgment was granted against him,shields filed a motion for reconsideration under rule.in this motion,he asked the district court to vacate its final judgment and stay the case while he appealed to the texas supreme court an adverse ruling regarding his request to depose the grand jurors.judge furgeson denied shields motion,noting that the district court had itself considered the discoverability of the grand jurors testimony and refused to permit the depositions.
following the denial of his motion for reconsideration,shields filed the present appeal.
ii.discussion 
shields raises three issues in his appeal.first,he maintains that the district court erred in quashing the depositions of the grand jurors.second,he asserts that the district court should have granted his request for a stay pending the outcome of the ancillary litigation.third,he contends that the district court erroneously determined that there exist no genuine issues of material fact preventing the entry of summary judgment.this court examines each of these claims in turn.
a.the request to depose grand jurors 
the court begins with shields claim that the district court erred when it quashed the depositions of the grand jurors.according to shields,since no record existed of the grand jury proceedings,he needed to depose members of the grand jury to prove that deputy twiss and assistant district attorney coleman withheld information from the grand jury.shields contends that by improperly quashing these depositions,the district court made it impossible for him to prove his malicious prosecution and civil rights claims.

at the outset,the court notes that under both federal and state law,a general rule of secrecy shrouds the proceedings of grand juries.see.e douglas oil of cal.petrol stops,d crim.proc.ann.vernon supp in re byrd,no pet.even so,both federal and texas law permit discovery of grand jury material when the party seeking discovery demonstrates a particularized need for the material.united states procter gamble,d accord.e e i crim.proc.ann.d in re byrd,at.a party claiming a particularized need for grand jury material under rule e has the burden of showing that the material it seek s is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding,that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy,and that its request is structured to cover only material so needed.douglas oil,at.this burden must be met even when the grand jury in question has concluded its operations,as is the case here.id.while a party can in limited circumstances obtain grand jury material by showing a particularized need,the need for protection of the workings,integrity,and secrecy of grand jury proceedings is a,public policy.the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings is not something that is intruded into except in rare circumstances.
in the present case,shields has not shown a particularized need for compelling the disclosure of grand jury information,much less for compelling the depositions of grand jury members.shields claims that he needs to depose members of the grand jury to prove that information was withheld from them.he has not,however,put forward any evidence whatsoever showing that twiss or coleman withheld information from the grand jury,a point noted by the district court robinson twiss,no,slip op.at,holding that shields provided no concrete evidence for his claim that information was withheld from the grand jury.twiss,conversely,has testified under oath that she presented all relevant information in her incriminating and the grand jury.likewise,donnie coleman,the assistant district attorney who presented the case against shields to the grand jury,testified under oath that twiss gave the grand jury the things that matched up and the things that did match up.
because shields has utterly failed to rebut twiss and coleman sworn testimony,the district court had no reason to believe that any useful information would be uncovered if shields were allowed to depose the grand jurors.without some evidence to support shields claims that the defendants withheld exculpatory evidence,the district court certainly had no reason to believe that these depositions were necessary to avoid a possible injustice,one of the elements required for a showing of a particularized need for grand jury material.see douglas oil,at.holding that a party claiming a particularized need for grand jury material must show that disclosure is necessary to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding.shields has presented no evidence that would justify a fishing expedition into the proceedings of the grand jury.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the motion to quash.
even if shields had put forward evidence of his need for grand jury he has not is still the question of whether he could ever compel the depositions of grand jury members.shields has pointed to no authority for the proposition that one can take the depositions of grand jury members when,as is the case here,there is no transcript of the grand jury proceeding.this court,like other courts,is unaware of any authority supporting this proposition.see,united states roethe,furthermore,the defendant has suggested no authority,and i am aware of none,in support of his request to conduct an examination of the grand jurors.if depositions of grand jurors could ever be matter as to which this court expresses no would take a far more substantial showing of particularized need than what shields has made here thus,the district court acted well within the bounds of its discretion when it granted the motion to quash shields deposition notices.
b.the request for a stay 
the court next turns to shields claim that the district court erred in denying his request to stay,abate,or continue its disposition of the case pending further discovery.

both before and after summary judgment was granted against him,shields sought,and was denied,a stay or continuance from the district court pending the final resolution of the collateral proceeding that he initiated in state court in pursuit of permission to depose the grand jurors.shields now contends that by not staying or continuing the case pending resolution of this litigation,the district court denied him a full and fair opportunity to discover information essential to his opposition to summary judgment,a denial that constitutes reversible error.in support of this claim,shields invites the court attention to anderson liberty lobby,d,which holds that when a party is not given a full and fair opportunity to discover information essential to its opposition to summary judgment,the limitation on discovery is reversible error.
shields appeal of the district court denial of his requests for a stay or continuance is undermined by the fact that the litigation has now been resolved against shields.specifically,the texas supreme court denied review in the ancillary proceeding on february,thereby making permanent the state trial court denial of shields discovery request.in re grand jury proceedings.gj,antonio,pet.denied.consequently,the issue of whether the proceedings in this suit should have been stayed until the texas supreme court acted is moot and need not be addressed on the merits by this court.
c.the decision to grant summary judgment 
finally,the court turns to shields claim that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
