this maritime action was brought in district court against cardinal services,cardinal under the jones act and against corporation as to oryx energy company,under the louisiana civil code provisions governing negligence premises liability and strict liability which are incorporated by reference through the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla suit was filed by rusty roberts and his wife,sandra roberts,individually and on behalf of their minor children collectively plaintiffs after rusty roberts,an employee of cardinal,was injured while working on a stationary offshore platform owned by oryx and subsequently acquired by the plaintiffs now appeal the district court grants of summary judgment dismissing their claims against cardinal and.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
cardinal provides a range of services to the energy industry in louisiana and texas as well as in the gulf of mexico offshore those states.among the oil and gas well services performed by cardinal in those areas are wireline,electric line,plugging and abandoning p a,cementing,and pumping services,as well as acquisition and interpretation of oilfield data.cardinal offshore services are performed on both fixed and movable facilities belonging to others as well as on board its own liftboats.
roberts worked for cardinal in its p a department from until the date of his injury in,first as a p a helper and then,following a promotion,as a p a operator.the platform on which he was injured while helping to perform a p a operation is located on the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico,off the louisiana coast.he was injured by the accidental firing of a perforation gun attached to a wireline that was being used on the platform by the crew of which he was a member in connection with plugging a well.a wireline is a continuous cable used to perform various subsurface functions in a well,including the lowering and raising of various tools,instruments,and other devices.one of the downhole tools used on a wireline is a perforation gun,a device that originally used cartridges similar to rifle or pistol ammunition but evolved to use shaped charges,ammunition which is internally and fires directionally.it is formed in layers,one a brittle compound of explosive material and the other a metal alloy.when fired by any of several methods,this ammunition shoots a short,concentrated stream of molten alloy or plasma in the direction at which the open end of the charge conically shaped interior is aimed.generally,perforating guns are used either early in the life of a well to fractionate frac a formation or zone so as to commence or enhance production or,late in the life of a well or of a particular formation,to perforate casing or tubing in preparation for squeezing or sealing off the well or the zone to plug and abandon it.
on the evening of roberts injury,the cardinal crew was attempting a p a job on the platform in question.cardinal was responsible for all aspects of the project,having reserved only the right to observe and inspect cardinal work to ensure its satisfactory completion.the cardinal crew had assembled a perforating gun,with its shaped charges aimed in a single direction,and had lowered the gun into the well on a wireline.this particular gun included an exterior sleeve and was rigged to fire when the pressure around it increased to a predetermined inch psi level.during its initial descent down the well,the gun encountered a closed or partially closed downhole valve,so the crew reversed the downward direction of the wireline,raising it and the attached perforation gun to the top of the wellbore,close to which roberts was standing.a valve in the well tubing below was then opened by a cardinal employee,resulting in a sudden increase in pressure in the wellbore,which presumably caused the gun to fire unfortunately,the shaped charges happened to be aimed in roberts direction,and he was severely injured when they fired.
in their lawsuit,the plaintiffs asserted negligence claims against roberts employer,cardinal,under the jones act,advancing that he was a seaman.they brought negligence,premises liability,and strict liability claims against as owner of the platform,asserting responsibility under louisiana law as incorporated by reference in the ocsla 
cardinal filed a motion for summary judgment in which it asserted that roberts did not have a sufficient temporal connection to a cardinal vessel or fleet of vessels to be a jones act seaman.agreeing with cardinal as a matter of law,the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs claims against the employer.
also filed a motion for summary judgment in which it asserted that the plaintiffs could not prevail on any of the theories of louisiana law that they proffered under the ocsla.as the plaintiffs did not oppose summary judgment motion on the premises liability claims asserted under articles and of the louisiana civil code,the court granted motion as to those claims,and the plaintiffs do not them on appeal.
the plaintiffs conceded that,in its contract with cardinal for the performance of the may p a operation,had not retained the requisite operational control to support the imposition of liability for the allegedly negligent acts of its independent contractor,precluding recovery against vicariously for any negligence of cardinal.the plaintiffs therefore grounded their and negligence and strict liability claims against on allegations that the use of a wireline perforation gun in the p a operation on platform was an ultrahazardous activity.
the district court granted summary judgment motion and dismissed these claims after refusing to classify wireline perforation as ultrahazardous under louisiana law because it is a common activity in the oilpatch that can be and indeed generally is performed safely.plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court a motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact an issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action in deciding whether a fact issue has been created,we must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party 
determination whether an injured worker is a seaman under the jones act is a mixed question of law and fact if reasonable persons,applying the proper legal standard,could differ as to whether the employee was a member of a crew,it is a question for the jury nonetheless,summary judgment or a directed verdict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.our review of such a mixed question is plenary.
the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for judgment as a matter of law thus,the court must review all of the evidence in the record,but make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence in reviewing all the evidence,the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,and should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmoving party as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached 
seaman status under the jones act 
the district court grant of cardinal motion for summary judgment was grounded in the determination that roberts was not a seaman,and thus not eligible to recover under the jones act.this conclusion was based on the court finding that roberts did not have the requisite substantial connection to a vessel or an identifiable fleet of vessels under cardinal common ownership or control.
the jones act provides that any seaman who sustains personal injury in the course of his employment may maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of a trial by jury the act does not define seaman,and therefore leaves to the courts the determination of exactly which maritime workers are entitled to admiralty special protection.when congress enacted the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca in,it furnished some content to the term seaman,albeit indirectly.the lhwca provides a remedy for maritime workers who are injured during their employment,but the act explicitly excludes from its coverage a master or member of a crew of any vessel.in chandris,latsis,the supreme court reiterated that the jones act and the lhwca are mutually exclusive compensation regimes,and that the lhwca reference to a master or member of a crew is a refinement of the term seaman in the jones act.thus,the inquiry into seaman status for jones act purposes requires a determination whether the injured plaintiff is a master or member of a crew of any vessel.
in chandris,the supreme court clearly articulated the test to apply when making this determination 
first,an employee duties must contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.second,and most important for our purposes here,a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature 
the purpose of the test stated by the court in chandris and reaffirmed in harbor tug barge company papai is to 
separate the maritime employees who are entitled to jones act protection from those workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation,and therefore whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea 
with respect to the inquiry into whether the injured worker connection to a vessel is substantial in terms of both duration the temporal prong and nature the functional prong,the chandris court emphasized that the test is conjunctive,stating that we think it is important that a seaman connection to a vessel in fact be substantial in both respects.the chandris court further clarified the application of the temporal prong of the test when it offered the following guidance for determining whether a plaintiff connection to a vessel is substantial in duration 
generally,the fifth circuit seems to have identified an appropriate rule of thumb for the ordinary case a worker who spends less than about percent of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman under the jones act.this figure of course serves as no more than a guideline established by years of experience,and departure from it will certainly be justified in appropriate cases nevertheless,we believe that courts,employers,and maritime workers can all benefit from reference to these general principles.and where undisputed facts reveal that a maritime worker has a clearly inadequate temporal connection to vessels in navigation,the court may take the question from the jury by granting summary judgment or a directed verdict 
synthesizing these refinements leads to the understanding that the plaintiff who fails to show that his connection to a vessel in navigation is substantial in duration will be precluded from recovering as a seaman under the jones act,and that,as a general rule,he must show this by demonstrating that percent or more of his time is spent in service of that vessel.
the percent floor does not change when an identifiable group of vessels in navigation is at issue,rather than just one vessel.in addressing the case before us in romain industrial fabrication and repair service,we summarized our ruling in hufnagel omega service industries,observing,
we held that hufnagel did not qualify as a seaman because he could not establish a substantial connection to either a single vessel or to an identifiable fleet of vessels our decisions after bertrand have reaffirmed the essential principle that to qualify as a seaman an employee must establish an attachment to a vessel or to an identifiable fleet of vessels 
we have left no doubt that the percent threshold for determining substantial temporal connection must be applied,regardless of whether one vessel or several are at issue.
finally,the court has constructed the framework for determining the presence of an identifiable group of vessels.in chandris,reviewing the development of the substantial connection requirement,the court discussed our modification of the test for seaman status when more than a single vessel is involved 
soon after robison,the fifth circuit modified the test to allow seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connection with an identifiable fleet of vessels,a finite group of vessels under common ownership or control.
subsequently,in papai,the court expounded further on this point 
we adverted to the group of vessels concept in chandris.we described it as a rule allow ing seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connection with an identifiable fleet of vessels,a finite group of vessels under common ownership or control.
in deciding whether there is an identifiable group of vessels of relevance for a jones act determination,the question is whether the vessels are subject to common ownership or control 
for purposes of the plaintiffs jones act claims against cardinal,the issue of seaman status turns on whether roberts satisfied the temporal prong of the substantial connection test.the plaintiffs insist that the district court erred in its application of the percent guideline when it counted only the time that roberts spent on cardinal liftboats and disregarded the time that he spent on other cardinal vessels and on vessels owned by third parties.according to a breakdown of roberts work time,he spent percent of his time in a shop on land,percent of his time performing p a work on platforms with no vessel involvement,percent of his time performing p a work on platforms with vessels alongside,percent of his time performing p a work on platforms with a cardinal liftboat alongside,percent of his time in transit on cardinal vessels,and percent of his time performing p a work on the cardinal,a vessel.the district court stated that roberts only spent of his time assigned to cardinal boats.
roberts contends that his time in transit and his time on the cardinal should be included,and,more significantly,that the time he spent on platforms with an adjacent vessel should be included as well.if only roberts transit time and cardinal time were to be added,he would still fall short of the percent threshold,aggregating a total of but percent only if his vessel time were counted would his total time on board vessels of common ownership or control rise above percent,to percent 
the plaintiffs contend that the work time involving vessels should be counted.they declare that the temporal connection establishing a percent rule of thumb is meant to determine whether an employee is versus.it is not meant to be applied to the fleet requirement.it is generally true,as we noted above,that the fundamental purpose of the inquiry is to separate the maritime employees who are entitled to jones act protection from the employees who must find a remedy under the lhwca.the plaintiffs are flatly wrong,however,when they assert that the percent guideline is not meant to be applied to the fleet requirement.indeed,application of the percent test is the very means by which a substantial temporal connection is determined,regardless whether a single vessel or a group of vessels is at issue.and,when a group of vessels is at issue,a worker who aspires to seaman status must show that at least percent of his time was spent on vessels,every one of which was under his common ownership or control.as recently as hufnagel,we reaffirmed our commitment to this application of the percent test,and we do so yet again today 
we acknowledge chandris insistence that the percent threshold serves as no more than a guideline established by years of experience,and departure from it will certainly be justified in appropriate cases.we recognize as well that if all of roberts time aboard vessels were to be counted,he would come quite close percent to meeting the percent requirement.nevertheless,we do not perceive the instant case to be one that justifies an exceptional departure from the percent test.in wisner professional divers of new orleans the louisiana supreme court relied on our language in bertrand international mooring marine,and wallace oceaneering international to reverse a grant of summary judgment against a commercial diver.the wisner court classified the diver as a seaman,despite the fact that he did not have a substantial connection to a fleet under common ownership or control,because the diver faced regular exposure to the perils of the sea.specifically,the wisner court concluded,
in sum,the formulations or tests employed by the various courts are simply different ways to arrive at the same basic point the jones act remedy is reserved for maritime employees whose work regularly exposes them to the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go to sea in ships are subjected.
we consider the subsequent treatment by a louisiana court of appeal,curtailing the wisner opinion,to be apt.in the case of little amoco production company the state appellate court noted first that the united states supreme court interpretations are controlling in matters of federal law,clearly indicating that,in any disagreement between the application in wisner and the test adopted in chandris and papai,the test enunciated in the latter controls more substantively,the court of appeal posited that wisner could be classified as falling within a exception to the general percent substantial connection requirement the exception,as defined by language in our decision in bertrand,would be that jones act coverage should not be withheld because the vessels are not under the employer common ownership or control,when claimants are continuously subjected to the perils of the sea and engaged in classical seaman work.the court of appeal in little,still highlighting the wisner court reliance on our language,noted that a diver work necessarily involves exposure to numerous marine perils,and is inherently maritime because it can not be done on land.it is not,like so many offshore field occupations,an art developed in land work and transposed to a maritime setting.
in romain industrial fabrication and repair service,we refused to classify a p a worker like roberts as a seaman when he failed to establish that he had a substantial connection to an identifiable fleet of vessels this holding alone is conclusive but if any doubt remained because roberts time aboard cardinal vessels comes close to the percent threshold,the little court reconciliation of wisner with united states supreme court precedent extinguished that doubt as well.
even though a professional diver is to the perils of the sea and thus may,under special circumstances,qualify as a seaman without showing the requisite degree of temporal connection,a p a crewman,who practices an art developed in land work and transposed to a maritime setting,can not.the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the presence of all elements of the conjunctive test for roberts seaman status,and their attempt to bring him within a possible exception to the rule fails.accordingly,we see no reason to depart from our rule,as reaffirmed in hufnagel and romain,that a worker who fails to show that at least percent of his time is spent on vessels under the common ownership or control of his employer is precluded from recovering as a seaman under the jones act.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of cardinal.
use of wireline perforation gun an ultrahazardous activity under louisiana law.
the plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of,dismissing their claims for vicarious and strict liability under louisiana civil code and.they assert that the district court erred when it determined that independent contractor,cardinal,was not engaged in an ultrahazardous activity while using the perforating gun in conducting the p a job for.the plaintiffs focus particularly on the district court refusal to include wireline perforation within the ultrahazardous category of blasting with explosives.agreeing that wireline perforation is not congruent with blasting with explosives as that term is used in,and being convinced that wireline perforation does not satisfy louisiana broader jurisprudential test for ultrahazardous activities,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs claims under and.
the article claim.
before we proceed to analyze the plaintiffs negligence and vicarious liability claims against,an abbreviated review of the application of louisiana basic tort provision,appears to be in order.that article states that e very act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.classically,a tort in louisiana comprises four indispensable elements act,damage,cause,and fault.the louisiana supreme court observed in langlois allied chemical that f ault is the key word in.in construing fault in,langlois further explained,the courts go to the many other articles in our code as well as statutes and other laws which deal with the responsibility of certain persons,the responsibility in certain relationships,and the responsibility which arises due to certain types of activities.in particular,noted the langlois court,there is sound jurisprudential authority that liability for dangerous and hazardous activities of man flows from civil code article by analogy with other civil code articles.
in our review of louisiana law in perkins we took cognizance of the louisiana courts adherence to the structure established in langlois,most notably,for purposes of the instant case,the imposition of liability for ultrahazardous activities under by analogy to as we also noted in perkins,however,the louisiana supreme court,in kent gulf states utilities later seemed to cast liability for ultrahazardous activities directly upon alone,without relying,either directly or by analogy,on any other codal sic article.referred to as absolute liability,or liability without fault,this concept is perhaps more easily understood when viewed as legal fault or fault supplied by law.thus,fault element is imputed,supplied by law,when designated persons elect to engage in particularly activities,even though they perform them lawfully,skillfully,and free of negligent or intentional fault in the usual sense to date,the jurisprudential list of such activities includes only aerial crop dusting,storing hazardous materials,pile driving,and blasting with explosives.
activities ultrahazardous de jure 
within this framework,the plaintiffs claims against must be analyzed against the backdrop of vicarious tort liability under louisiana law.a general rule under louisiana law is that a principal is not liable for the delictual or offenses torts committed by an agent who is an independent contractor in the course of performing its contractual duties there are,however,two equally exceptions to this rule a principal may be liable if it maintains operational control over the activity in question,or if,even absent such control,the activity engaged in by the independent contractor is ultrahazardous.given the plaintiffs concession that did not retain the requisite operational control over cardinal,could only be held liable in tort for damages caused to the plaintiffs when cardinal wireline perforating gun discharged accidentally if that independent contractor use of the device constituted an ultrahazardous activity and produced the injury.thus,the dispositive question here is whether cardinal use of the wireline perforation gun in the p a activity that it was performing for,being the activity that inflicted injury on roberts,was ultrahazardous 
under louisiana law,an activity may be ultrahazardous either as a matter of law or by classification under the test that has been created judicially.again,activities that have been categorized in louisiana as ultrahazardous as a matter of law are storage of toxic gas,crop dusting with airplanes,pile driving,and blasting with explosives as the louisiana supreme court observed in kent gulf states utilities,each of these four undertakings is an activity that can cause injury to others,even when conducted with the greatest prudence and care.
this concept is embodied in the jurisprudential test for ultrahazardous activities that we outlined in perkins under the perkins test,an activity is ultrahazardous if it relates to land or to other immovables causes the injury,and the defendant was directly engaged in the activity and does not require the substandard conduct of a third party to cause injury 
the plaintiffs insist that wireline perforation is a manifestation of blasting with explosives,and should therefore be classified as an ultrahazardous activity as a matter of law.we disagree.in fontenot magnolia petroleum the case that decreed blasting with explosives to be an ultrahazardous activity,the louisiana supreme court reversed a judgment in favor of defendants whose geophysical exploration activities on the property of one owner caused damage to the plaintiffs homes on adjoining land.the geophysical operations involved the intentional detonation of charges of nitramon s at a depth of approximately feet below the surface,and the damage to the plaintiffs homes including cracks in walls and ceilings,and broken cement foundations was alleged to have resulted from the vibrations and concussions radiating in the soil from the point of the explosions conducted by defendants.the fontenot court observed 
it has been universally recognized that when,as here,the defendant,though without fault,is engaged in a lawful business,conducted according to modern and approved methods and with reasonable care,by such activities causes risk or peril to others,the doctrine of absolute liability is clearly applicable 
stated differently,even though the blasting may have been conducted responsibly and according to the latest accepted methods,the defendants were nonetheless accountable for any unavoidable damage that flowed from the activity.
subsequently,in schexnayder bunge we characterized fontenot as involving purposeful subterranean explosions in connection with oil exploration,and approved the trial court jury instruction on ultrahazardous activities,which stated that a n activity is an activity which sic,even when conducted with the greatest of care and prudence,could cause a foreseeable harm or damage to those in the neighborhood.thus,for over a we have adhered to the louisiana supreme court reasoning in fontenot for classifying the subsurface detonation of explosives as ultrahazardous foreseeably,such an activity could cause unavoidable collateral damage to neighbors,even if conducted with due care.
lowering a perforation gun down a well on a wireline and firing it to pierce drill pipe or tubing in an oil and gas well simply does not fit within this rubric.in sharp contrast to the damage incurred by the neighbors in fontenot,which was inflicted on structures located off the owners premises by the inevitable,underground shock waves produced by the intentional blasting on the owners premises,the injuries incurred by roberts were caused by the accidental detonation of the ammunition of the perforation gun,not downhole as intended but at the surface of the owner premises,on the fixed platform.as we have noted,a perforation gun shaped charges fire only in the direction toward which their open,conical ends are pointed.when conducted according to modern and approved methods and with reasonable care,a perforating gun is lowered down a well to a predetermined depth,is fired in one or more predetermined directions,produces a force sufficient only to pierce the tubing or casing,and,at most,a matter of but several additional inches of the adjacent formation.the firing of the shaped charges causes virtually no incidental damage to the gun or the wellbore,and no collateral damage whatsoever by way of vibrations,even to the owner premises,much less to adjoining property,no matter how proximate.
in the unfortunate occurrence that injured roberts,the business end of the shaped the muzzle of a to be pointed in his direction at a time when the gun was at the surface rather than downhole.his severe injuries were a direct,primary result of the gun accidental firing,not collateral damage from shock waves or vibrations.and the unintentional firing of the gun was caused by an act of man,presumably the opening of the valve,in turn causing a spike in pressure.we therefore reject the plaintiffs contention that the wireline perforation activity during which roberts was injured is a variety of blasting with explosives and thus ultrahazardous as a matter of law.
ultrahazardous de facto 
wireline perforation also fails to meet at least one of the three conjunctive prongs of the broader perkins test for ultrahazardousness under louisiana law.the parties agree that wireline perforation of a well in connection with a p a operation relates to land or to other immovables,and we shall assume arguendo that,through cardinal,its independent contractor,was directly engaged in the wireline perforation activity even though the requisite control over cardinal had not been retained by thus,we are concerned here only with the third prong of the perkins test,whether wireline perforation is an activity that can cause injury to others,even when conducted with the greatest prudence and care.for essentially the same reasons that distinguish the perforation activity from blasting with explosives,we hold that the former is not a manifestation of the latter.
first,there is ample evidence in the record to support the contention that wireline perforation,whether employing electrically or firing heads to detonate the shaped charges,can be,and indeed generally is,safely performed thousands of times a year.there is further evidence suggesting that when the infrequent accident does occur in connection with wireline perforation,it is directly traceable to human error,either in the initial choice to employ a device in a particular well,or in the failure correctly to follow safety procedures.these features of wireline perforation are similar to the transmission of electricity over power lines which was the challenged activity in kent.regarding that activity,the kent court stated that the transmission of electricity over isolated high tension power lines is an everyday occurrence in every parish in this state and can be done without a high degree of risk of injury.the same can be said with equal certainty of wireline perforation of oil and gas wells.we therefore conclude that,unlike the stereotypical ultrahazardous activities recognized by statutes and courts of louisiana,wireline perforation is likely to cause damage only when there is substandard conduct on someone part.none can dispute that this declaration is applicable to the sequence of events that transpired in the instant accident it apparently occurred when someone opened the downhole valve,which increased the pressure,causing the perforation gun to fire while it was at the surface rather than hundreds of feet down the wellbore,as intended.
this position is consistent with our prior decisions.in ainsworth shell offshore,we concluded that drilling operations do not satisfy the third element of the perkins test,holding that such activities were not ultrahazardous as observed by the district court and reiterated above,wireline perforation is performed frequently in conjunction with both enhancing the flow of oil and gas in a well and plugging and abandoning particular strata or entire wells.this comports with the intermediate appellate court observation in bergeron blake drilling workover,that a well can not produce oil or gas unless it is perforated.thus,perforation is an internal and indispensable element of every well.wireline perforation is therefore easily classifiable as a drilling operation,and thus not ultrahazardous under ainsworth.
we distinguish our holding today from the bergeron court holding which at first blush appears to be to the contrary.in bergeron,a louisiana court of appeal stated,even if one found that perforating was not ultrahazardous,a finding that perforating is a sic inherently and intrinsically dangerous work is unavoidable.as the district court in the instant case correctly noted,however,the bergeron court stopped short of classifying wireline perforation as an ultrahazardous activity,characterizing it instead as inherently dangerous,in the law of louisiana a distinctly different term of art.here,the district court continued 
by holding liable under article for an inherently dangerous activity,this court would be expanding the louisiana supreme court policy behind ultrahazardous activity as announced in kent.in kent,the louisiana supreme court held that the ultrahazardous activity classification was created for the rare instances in which the activity can cause injury to others,even when conducted with the greatest prudence and care.this court does not find that an inherently dangerous activity fits within the special category of ultrahazardous liability 
we adopt this reasoning,adding only the observation that the perforating gun in bergeron had a firing head that was activated by electricity,not by pressure as in the instant case in contrast to electrical firing of some perforation guns,only the external application of sufficient psi of pressure can detonate a firing head like the one involved in roberts injury.thus,the difference between an activity that is inherently dangerous and one that is ultrahazardous serves to distinguish bergeron from the instant case,and the difference in the risk of accidental discharge between the firing devices involved in the two cases distinguishes them even further.
in summary,when we view the operable facts of the instant case in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as,we are satisfied that use of a wireline perforation gun in a p a operation can not be held to be an ultrahazardous activity,either de jure or de facto.not only is such perforation factually distinguishable from blasting with explosives,an actuality that would render such perforation an ultrahazardous activity as a matter of law were it not distinguishable wireline perforation also fails to satisfy the third prong of the perkins test,which requires the activity to be one that is likely to cause injury to others,even when conducted with the greatest prudence and care.this simply can not be said of wireline perforation,which is conducted routinely in oilfield drilling,completing,producing,and plugging operations and in which even the extremely infrequent accident is traceable to substandard human conduct.
the imposition of liability on a principal for acts of an independent contractor is permitted only in narrow circumstances.like the district court before us,we are not willing to increase the range of circumstances when the courts and legislature of louisiana have not seen fit to do so.our pronouncement in cng producing remains as true today as when it was uttered we would not subject this activity to strict liability without certain directions from the louisiana courts to which we would add,or the legislature.
the article claim 
the plaintiffs do not make altogether clear whether they assert two completely separate and distinct strict liability claims against,one for vicarious tort liability under,and another for ownership liability under or they assert but one claim,in which they merely seek to analogize strict liability for blasting with explosives on the premises with vicarious liability for its independent contractor wireline perforation with the gun shaped charges.as the district court made a discrete ruling under,however,we shall address the plaintiffs strict liability charge on the assumption that they asserted such a claim separately under.when we do so,we discern two distinct reasons why the plaintiffs can not recover under,one substantive and the other jurisdictional.
the substantive reason should by now be obvious the foregoing analysis exhaustively demonstrates why downhole wireline perforation for either completing an oil or gas well or plugging and abandoning one does not equate with blasting with explosives.that applies with equal force when that activity is tested under the exclusive list of but two ultrahazardous activities that are exceptions under,blasting with explosives and pile driving.as wireline perforation is not a manifestation of blasting with explosives for tort law purposes in louisiana,that very same activity can not logically be ultrahazardous for purposes of.therefore,injury resulting from wireline perforation operations on premises can not subject,as proprietor,to liability without fault under,so the plaintiffs can not prevail on their claims under that article.thus they have failed to state a cause of action under that code article.
second,the plaintiffs have no right of action under jurisdictionally,they do not have standing to sue as the proprietor of the platform which is not only estate but is also the same immovable on which roberts was working when he was injured.roberts was not on adjacent or adjoining property neither was he a neighbor deprived of the enjoyment of his own estate.yet clearly requires those elements to be present for a plaintiff to have standing to sue a proprietor for damages caused by even an ultrahazardous activity lawfully conducted on his immovable the activity on the defendant premises must damage the neighbor or the neighboring estate.
differing from louisiana tort doctrine which is established in et in book iii title v,entitled obligations arising without agreement,appears in book ii,title iv,entitled predial servitudes specifically,in section,limitations of ownership,of chapter,legal servitudes.the basic term,servitude,is not defined in the civil code but is generally understood to be an obligation owed by one estate,referred to as the servient estate,either to designated persons or to another estate,referred to as the dominant estate.there are two kinds of servitudes,personal and predial a personal servitude is a charge on a thing for the benefit of a person,of which there are but three usufruct,habitation,and the right of use in contrast,a predial servitude is a charge on a servient estate for the benefit of a dominant estate,which two estates must belong to different owners the two immovables that constitute the two and not be contiguous or within any given proximity and the predial servitude itself is an immovable,albeit incorporeal 
among predial servitudes are included natural servitudes,such as drainage,legal servitudes,which are those established by law,and conventional servitudes,which are established by contract.article is applicable to legal servitudes and covers such obligations of neighborhood as keeping buildings in repair building projections across property lines building encroachments on adjoining property common walls and right of passage to and from an enclosed estate article is aptly titled limitations on use of property.
in distinguishing actions under on the one hand and those under and on the other,professor yiannoupoulos has written 
the question arises,therefore,as to the interrelations of articles,and.specifically,does the broadened notion of fault under article render the notion of liability without negligence under articles and unnecessary it is submitted that this is not the case the two sets of provisions may overlap in part but continue to establish distinct grounds of responsibility.article establishes responsibility under the law of delictual obligations for all injuries to persons and property.articles and establish specifically responsibility for damage to property and persons in the context of neighborhood,namely,under rules of property law.it is conceivable that liability may rest on either ground exclusively or on both cumulatively.indeed,a plaintiff may satisfy the terms and conditions of both sets of articles and may have two distinct causes of action for a single recovery,one resting on the precepts of the law of obligations and the other on precepts of the law of property or he may have a cause of action either under article or under articles and 
although courts and commentators disagree about the nature of the interest that a plaintiff must have to bring an action under,all appear to agree that the plaintiff must have some interest in an immovable near the immovable.for example 
e.who can bring the action 
to be a neighbor one need not be an adjoining landowner as article says,it suffices that they the lands be sufficiently near,for one to derive benefit from the servitude on the other.because article appears among those dealin
