john raplee challenges the dismissal of his federal tort claims act ftca complaint as untimely.in compliance with state law,raplee initially filed a medical malpractice claim with maryland alternative dispute resolution agency.although he filed with the state agency within the ftca limitations period,he did not file a complaint in federal court until well after that period had passed.raplee contends that by filing a required state administrative claim,an action is begun for the purposes of the ftca limitations period.b.alternatively,he asserts that equitable tolling principles excuse his failure to comply with the limitations period.because an action is begun under the ftca only by filing a civil action in federal district court,raplee claim was untimely.further,he has not demonstrated any extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in september,raplee underwent surgery at the national institutes of health,an operating division of the united states department of health and human services hhs.raplee alleges that the surgeons negligently position ed him while he was under anesthesia,resulting in permanent damage to the muscles and nerves in his left foot.
the ftca renders the united states liable for the torts of its employees,including the surgeons in this case,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.the ftca requires a plaintiff pursuing a tort claim to follow a process.first,a plaintiff must file his claim with the appropriate federal agency,which then has the power to settle or deny it.b,a.the plaintiff may file a civil action against the united states only if the agency has denied the claim.a.
in november,raplee retained the law firm ashcraft gerel,llp to represent him in his medical malpractice claim against the united states.on september,ashcraft gerel,through martin trpis,filed raplee claim with hhs.
trpis had left ashcraft gerel by may while raplee claim was still under administrative review at hhs.although lawyers from the firm continued to represent raplee,no one notified hhs of trpis departure,and no other attorney from ashcraft gerel filed an appearance with hhs.
on june,hhs mailed its notice of final denial by certified letter to trpis at ashcraft gerel.section b of the ftca bars any tort claim against the united states unless the action is begun within six months after the federal agency mails notice of its denial of the claim.b.therefore,raplee had until december,to begin an action pursuant to the ftca.
the letter hhs sent to trpis at ashcraft gerel was returned to hhs as undeliverable.the envelope containing the letter was stamped returned to sender with a handwritten note explaining that trpis was no longer at this company.hhs confirmed that it had sent the letter to the correct address,but it made no further attempt to send notice of its denial.the record contains no evidence that raplee,trpis,or anyone else inquired as to the status of raplee claim.
because the ftca merely waives sovereign immunity to make the united states amenable to a state tort suit,the substantive law of the state where the tort occurred determines the liability of the united states.b see,levin united states.accordingly,as the parties agree,maryland plaintiffs wishing to bring medical malpractice claims against the united states under the ftca must comply with maryland requirements.
on november,raplee,represented by an ashcraft gerel lawyer but not trpis,filed a claim with maryland health care alternative dispute resolution office.under maryland law,a plaintiff must submit a medical malpractice claim to this state agency before filing the claim in court.code,cts.jud.proc.a,a i west.a plaintiff must then submit an expert report certifying that the claim is meritorious within ninety days.id.b i.once a claimant has submitted an expert report,he may waive arbitration and proceed to court.id.a.
although raplee filed his initial claim with the maryland agency in november approximately one month before the ftca filing deadline in december he did not file his expert report until february.and he did not waive arbitration until march.raplee finally filed a complaint with the federal district court on may,nearly five months after expiration of his time to begin an action under b.
the united states moved to dismiss raplee claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion because,at the time,we considered the ftca limitations period to be jurisdictional.see,gould dep of health human,cir.en banc.on appeal,we held the case in abeyance while the supreme court resolved that very issue.in united states kwai fun wong,the court held that the ftca limitations period is not a jurisdictional rule but a rule that allows for equitable tolling.in light of this decision,we remanded raplee case so that the district court could decide whether raplee was entitled to equitable tolling.the district court concluded that he was not,reasoning that raplee failed to show that extraordinary circumstances had prevented him from filing in a timely manner.
on appeal,raplee contends that his claim was timely because,by filing his claim with the state agency,an action was begun under b of the ftca.he also contends that,even if his claim was untimely,he is entitled to equitable tolling.we consider these arguments in turn.
in order to determine whether raplee claim was timely,we must decide when an action is begun under b.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.stone instrumentation lab,cir.
when construing a statute,we start with its text.lamie.if the meaning of the text is plain in other words,if it bears only one reasonable interpretation that meaning controls.id.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.
the word action in b has only one reasonable meaning it refers to a federal civil action.the language of the statute and the context in which it occurs confirm this.
action has a settled technical meaning in the law action means a lawsuit.see black law dictionary ed.the legal and formal demand of one right in a court of justice.this meaning of action has an ancient lineage.see ex parte milligan,wall,in any legal sense,action,suit,and cause,are convertible terms and i n law language a suit is the prosecution of some demand in a court of justice.quoting cohens virginia,wheat.
moreover,the supreme court settled any question about the term current meaning when the court promulgated the federal rules of civil procedure in.the federal rules famously abolished distinctions between various types of judicial proceedings like the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity by announcing that t here shall be one form of action to be known as civil action.fed.civ.the advisory committee made clear that this innovation in terminology sought to bring uniformity both to federal civil procedure and the united states code.id.advisory committee note to adoption reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed in these rules.
congress adopted the language of b against this backdrop,and the statutory context supports the conclusion that all references to action in the ftca refer to a judicial civil lawsuit.for example,a the text immediately preceding b provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years.a emphases added.the next sentence provides an exception the action of any person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues may be commenced within three years after the disability ceases.id.emphasis added.as another example,provides that any action against the united states under section shall be tried by the court without a jury.id.emphases added.
thus,both the text and statutory context indicate that the word action in b refers only to a civil action filed in court.
