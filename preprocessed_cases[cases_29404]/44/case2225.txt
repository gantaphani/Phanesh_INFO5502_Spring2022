plaintiff ronald ellison,was awarded in compensatory damages after a jury trial of his claim under,alleging a violation of his fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.the case arises out of a search of plaintiff residence and seizure of various property pursuant to a search warrant applied for by defendant denise balinski,an investigator for the detroit police department.defendant now raises three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in denying her motions for judgment as a matter of law,either because the warrant was supported by probable cause or because she is protected by qualified immunity whether the district court erred in denying her motion for remittitur of the jury verdict as against the weight of the evidence and whether the district court abused its discretion in its award of attorney fees.rejecting all of defendant arguments,we affirm.
this case begins with a rent dispute involving to this litigation.in february,zotis and kimberly harris began renting a residential property at grandville avenue,in detroit,michigan.after the couple initially viewed the home and decided to rent it,raynard anderson,a man identifying himself as the property manager,presented them with a lease already signed by owner asia thomas,whom the couple briefly met that day.soon after the harrises moved in,a dispute over the payment of rent arose.this dispute eventually resulted in two suits filed in court,where thomas sued harris for nonpayment of rent.both suits were dismissed,the first on procedural grounds and the second after the court found insufficient documentation proving thomas ownership of the property.four days after the first suit dismissal,zotis harris walked into the detroit police department and stated he wanted to file a fraud report.harris related the couple recent victory in court and further alleged that,in july,an unknown man knocked on the couple door and accused the couple of squatting on property that,he alleged,was not actually owned by their landlord,thomas.
the case was then assigned to defendant balinski,an investigator for the detroit police department.unable to locate thomas,defendant first attempted to identify the owner of the grandville property by obtaining a deed from the wayne county register of deeds.she discovered a deed reflecting the conveyance of the property from myabrooke properties,llc to thomas for the price of,and a previous deed reflecting a conveyance to myabrooke properties by one kimberly green,for the price of one dollar.defendant determined that myabrooke properties was owned by plaintiff ellison,and also discovered a similar transaction involving another property,louis avenue,which myabrooke properties sold to thomas for after originally purchasing it,again,for one dollar.
these,the fact that two properties were bought by myabrooke for one dollar and sold to thomas for the suspicion of defendant,who,based apparently on previous experience with fraudulent deeds,thought something was wrong and suspected fraud.in an effort to find the closing documents related to the sale of that property by myabrooke to thomas,defendant contacted plaintiff and asked him whether he owned the grandville property he responded that he had sold it.defendant then requested that he bring her documents proving this transaction,and refused to answer when plaintiff inquired about the reason for the investigation.plaintiff subsequently ignored further phone messages from defendant repeating her request for the documents,and never provided them to defendant.
armed with this allegedly suspicious transactions,the harrises two victories in court,and plaintiff refusal to provide her with requested applied for a warrant to search plaintiff residence,which records at the michigan department of labor and economic growth identified as the location of myabrooke properties.the affidavit in support of the warrant indicated that defendant was investigating a fraud complaint,and related the history of the litigation and harris report about the man accusing them of squatting.then,turning to plaintiff role in the investigation,defendant provided 
writer in the meantime was still investigating this case in attempt to find out who the owner of the property was.writer contacted ronald ellison president and owner of myabrooke properties who sold the property according to the wayne county register of deeds to asia thomas on for the amount of.the property had previously been quit claimed from kimberly ivory green to myabrooke properties for the sum of,according to the wayne county register of deeds.writer has contacted ellison many times by phone in an attempt to get paperwork on this property.ellison has refused to cooperate in this investigation.his company sold the property yet he refuses to show this writer any paperwork in regards to this purchase and sale.
defendant then related the similar transaction involving the louis property and stated that she was unable to obtain any information regarding loans or title companies from either property.as the areas to be searched,the warrant specified plaintiff entire residence,including any vehicles.as the items to be seized,the warrant specified 
any and all computers,computer accessories,any software,any and all paperwork pertaining to myabrooke properties,llc,and or ronald ellison or grandville,any and all documents relating to the property at louis,any and all documents regarding asia thomas,raynard anderson,or indicia of any crime.
the warrant was reviewed and signed by both a wayne county prosecutor and a district court judge.defendant and unknown police officers then executed the warrant at plaintiff residence.plaintiff arrived when the search was in progress,was advised he was not allowed to enter,and waited outside for at least minutes,where he anxiously observed several curious neighbors and drivers of passing cars watching the events.at some point,plaintiff wife and young daughter drove by the residence,but,seeing plaintiff there with the police,drove away.the combination of the wide authority granted in the warrant and the apparent disorganization of plaintiff home office gave the searching officers some difficulty in determining which of plaintiff documents to seize.during the search,defendant herself seized a large plastic bin found in plaintiff bedroom closet containing clothing and shoes,emptied it of its contents,and began filling it with documents as she testified at trial,there was so much stuff we just started gathering things up.officers also seized plaintiff desktop computer,and,after plaintiff arrival on the scene,a laptop computer discovered after a search of his car.
plaintiff then commenced this action.by the time the case went to trial,plaintiff case was narrowed to two claims against defendant balinski,in her individual capacity a claim for the violation of plaintiff fourth amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures,and a state law claim for libel and slander.the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff on the fourth amendment claim,awarding him in compensatory damages but declining to award any punitive damages,and a verdict for defendant on the state law claim.
defendant then moved for judgment as a matter of law,or,in the alternative,for a new trial or remittitur of the jury damage award,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and.the district court denied these motions.plaintiff moved for attorney fees pursuant to,and the district court,granting in part and denying in part that motion,awarded in attorney fees to plaintiff.defendant now appeals.
whether the district court erred in denying defendant balinski motion for judgment as a matter of law,either because the search warrant was supported by probable cause,or because defendant balinski is entitled to qualified immunity 
on appeal,defendant maintains that the warrant was supported by probable cause.the fourth amendment provides that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend iv.in determining whether probable cause exists to
