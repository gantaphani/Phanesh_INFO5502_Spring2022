solvita mcmillan,an attorney in the cleveland office of the equal opportunity employment commission,sued her employer in federal court alleging gender discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of and a failure to pay her in accordance with the equal pay act of.at the close of mcmillan case in chief,the district court determined that it would decide mcmillan claim of wage discrimination,but would submit her title vii claim to the jury.on december,the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the commission on mcmillan title vii claim.on september,the district court entered judgment in favor of the commission on mcmillan equal pay claim.mcmillan now appeals,asserting that she was denied her right to a fair trial when the district court allegedly abused its discretion by questioning her in a hostile and biased manner,and also that the district court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the term similarly situated.based upon a review of the entire record,we conclude that although the district court conduct came dangerously close to tainting the fairness of mcmillan trial,a new trial is not warranted.we also conclude that the district court committed no reversible error in instructing the jury regarding the similarly situated concept.
mcmillan,a white female,began her employment at the cleveland regional office of the equal employment opportunity commission in as a trial attorney at the level.she was promoted to the level in.in july,the commission general counsel,gregory stewart,determined that trial attorneys at regional offices around the country who were doing work that was significant,complex,and difficult should be promoted and paid at the level.on july,stewart issued a memorandum outlining the rules for promotion from the level to the level.the commission headquarters in washington,retained authority for final approval of promotions.the cleveland regional office was headed by a regional attorney,larry watson.beneath watson were two supervisory trial attorneys,lawrence mays and john sargent.watson testified that mays and sargent were to identify and recommend attorneys reporting to them for promotion to the level.sargent was mcmillan immediate supervisor.in august,based on the memorandum,mcmillan asked sargent to submit a promotion recommendation on her behalf because,according to her testimony,she had been performing level work since the.mcmillan testified that sargent agreed and said he would consult with watson.according to mcmillan,she followed up with sargent who informed her that he did not have authority to act on the matter.thereafter,mcmillan periodically followed up with sargent to see if he would prepare a recommendation for her.
in may,mcmillan learned that back in december an individual named jeffrey stern had been recommended for a promotion to the level by his immediate supervisor,mays.despite the submission,watson did not send the recommendation to headquarters for final approval.upon discovering that a promotion recommendation had been prepared for stern,mcmillan confronted sargent and again requested that he recommend her for promotion.mcmillan testified that sargent informed her that the commission failure to promote her was not a result of any inaction on his part,and within a few days he prepared and submitted a memorandum to watson recommending mcmillan for promotion.mcmillan requested a meeting with watson to discuss the matter at which she testified watson informed her that he would send her promotion recommendation to headquarters,but would not make the request retroactive because she was not emotionally ready to be a at the time the slots were first authorized.
watson thereupon concurred in sargent recommendation of mcmillan and forwarded it to headquarters along with mays recommendation of stern.before the promotions were approved,however,a freeze went into effect.approximately a year later,on june,stewart issued another memorandum,this time allowing the regional attorney,watson,to sign off on promotions of attorneys from the to the level.mcmillan and stern were again recommended by their respective immediate supervisors watson approved mcmillan promotion in august and approved stern promotion several months later.
mcmillan title vii claim was essentially that she and stern were similarly situated and she was discriminated against based on her gender when stern received consideration for promotion in december and she was not considered until may,despite the fact that she ultimately received her promotion before stern.
mcmillan also asserted a claim under the equal pay act of based on a disparity in pay for allegedly equal work by her and charles guerrier,a attorney in the office.in,a position was created by the commission for the cleveland office and charles guerrier was promoted to fill the position.the basis of mcmillan equal pay claim is that from approximately through,she and guerrier were doing the same work for unequal pay and that the equal pay act required the commission to create another position or reduce the complexity of her work.
district court conduct during mcmillan testimony 
on appeal,mcmillan claims that the district court questioning of her during the trial was hostile and biased and therefore an abuse of discretion that denied her right to a fair trial.according to mcmillan,the district court belittled her and interrupted her answers and misrepresented the evidence in a way that was biased against her.mcmillan points to several pages in the transcript where the district court extensively questioned her regarding the facts of her claims,and specific instances where the district court appeared.for example,the district court cut mcmillan answers short on occasion,asserting that it was merely asking a simple question.the district court also questioned whether it and mcmillan were speaking the same language,ended a line of questioning with t hat it that your case,and once suggested that mcmillan attorney had keyed her in on an answer.the morning following mcmillan testimony,her counsel moved for a mistrial based on the district court onerous interrogatories.mcmillan asserted that the district court move d into the role of an advocate rather than the judge.the district court responded that s he would answer my question,told counsel that i t a matter of interpretation,is it and overruled mcmillan motion.
