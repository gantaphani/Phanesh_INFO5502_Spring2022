in early,plaintiff shawn massey was released from a north carolina prison after a state court in mecklenburg county struck five verdicts that had been rendered against him in.following his release,massey initiated this civil action against officers of the charlotte mecklenburg police department under and north carolina law,alleging,inter alia,that they had fabricated evidence that led to his arrest,convictions,and incarceration.the three named defendants officers ojaniit,gerald esposito,and tom ledford successfully moved in the district court for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.massey has appealed the court judgment,and,as explained below,we affirm as to ojaniit and esposito and dismiss the appeal as to ledford 
on september,massey filed his complaint in the western district of north carolina,alleging claims for violation of due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,unreasonable seizure and malicious prosecution under the fourth and fourteenth amendments,and conspiracy to contravene his constitutional rights.the complaint also asserts state law claims for obstruction of justice,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,and conspiracy.officers ojaniit,esposito,and ledford separately answered the complaint in november,and shortly thereafter each moved for a rule c judgment on the pleadings.in their motions,the officers contended that the complaint failed to state any claim against them upon which relief could be granted,and that they were entitled to qualified immunity.although a magistrate judge recommended granting ledford rule c motion and denying those of ojaniit and esposito,see massey ojaniit,cv,ecf the report,the district court granted all three motions and dismissed the complaint in its entirety,see massey ojaniit,cv,ecf the order 
in conducting its analysis,the district court recognized that rule c motions are governed by the same standard as motions brought under rule b.order citing edwards city of goldsboro,cir.as such,the court deemed itself obliged to accept as true all allegations and to view the complaint in a light most favorable to massey.id.quoting mylan,matkari,cir.the court also observed,however,that it need not accept allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit.id.quoting blankenship manchin,cir.

as the complaint,the trial transcript,and other exhibits reflect,emerald bay apartments resident samantha wood contacted the charlotte mecklenburg police department on may,and reported that she and her two young children had arrived home at about to find an armed man at the doorway of their apartment.the man held a gun to wood daughter head,pushed the family inside the apartment,and attempted to rape wood.because wood was menstruating,the man ceased that pursuit and proceeded to search for money,inducing wood to hand over sixty dollars from her purse.on then exiting the apartment,the man warned wood that if she called the police,he would kill her and her family.the man spent approximately thirty minutes in the apartment.
despite her assailant threat,wood called the police,and officers ojaniit and esposito were promptly dispatched to the crime scene.ojaniit documented wood description of the culprit as a,pound black man who wore his hair pulled back from his face and small braids on the back of his head.may,report of ojaniit attached as exhibit to officers answers.the report further reflects that wood described the man as wearing a red shirt and blue denim shorts.
the following day,the two officers returned to the unit apartment complex in search of witnesses.the property manager,theresa savall,reported that she had encountered a black man in his twenties,approximately and at least pounds,as she was walking around the complex between and the previous day.because savall stated that the man approached her after exiting from the rear patio area of unit c,officer esposito sought to interview the resident of that apartment,april pride.after esposito misinformed pride that he was investigating a noise complaint,pride advised esposito that her friend shawn massey had spent the previous night in her apartment.according to esposito report,pride described massey as being years old and wear ing his hair pulled back with or braids.may,report of esposito attached as exhibit to officers answers.that description was almost verbatim the same description that wood had given of her assailant hairstyle.compl.
officer ojaniit thereafter transported wood to the police station to review a array that had been prepared by officer ledford and that included a mug shot of massey taken at the time of a previous arrest.see photographic lineup attached as exhibit to officers answers.ojaniit showed wood the lineup,and wood selected massey photo as looking the most like her assailant.compl.emphasis added.ojaniit wrote in his report,however,that wood said that massey photo looked like the suspect except that the suspect had longer hair with braids and he did not have a beard.emphasis added may,report of ojaniit attached as exhibit to officers answers.three days later,on may,ledford presented the same array of photos to savall,who identified massey as the person who had spoken to her at the apartment complex on the morning of may,
based on the witnesses photo identifications of massey and pride statements placing him near the crime scene,officer ledford secured arrest warrants on july,charging massey with one count each of robbery with a dangerous weapon and felonious breaking and entering,plus three counts of kidnapping.see arrest warrants attached as exhibit to answers of officers ojaniit and esposito.on september,a grand jury in mecklenburg county returned five indictments against massey.see id.at indictments attached as exhibit to answers of ojaniit and esposito.massey was tried on the consolidated indictments about a year thereafter,beginning on september.
during the trial,the prosecution witnesses included wood,savall,pride,and officers ojaniit and esposito.wood detailed the events of may,and described her assailant as having braids in his hair,with five hanging down.prompted by the prosecutor to specify whether the braids went all through his hair or were just on the back or just on the sides,wood testified that the braids went through.id.at.in other words,wood indicated that her assailant hair was braided in what are commonly known as cornrows.see compl.she also stated that her assailant wore a red,shirt with hurricane symbols on it.wood then made a positive identification of massey as her assailant.according to wood,although massey now had short hair,she recognized him from his facial features,height,and voice.
savall described to the jury the man who had approached her at the emerald bay apartments on the morning of may,explaining that he was acting kind of hyper and made comments to her such as,could we go out,and baby,you look good.savall testified that the man was wearing an jersey with long pants similar to jeans not the red jersey and denim shorts that wood said her attacker wore.savall did not notice the man hair during their encounter because he was wearing a hat.more specifically,she did not recall any braids.id.at.savall was fairly certain that she had accurately recognized the man in the photo lineup,id.at,and she made a positive identification of massey.
pride testified next for the prosecution,confirming that massey,her friend of about ten years,had stayed in her apartment on the night of may,and was still there when she left for work the next day,at approximately.while being by the defense,pride could not recall massey ever having braids and stated that massey wore a low,or short,haircut,including on may.see.pride evidence thus conflicted with officer esposito report of his may,interview with pride,insofar as the report indicated that pride described massey as having hair in four or five braids.on redirect examination by the prosecutor,pride testified that she did not recall having so advised esposito when he interviewed her.for his part,esposito testified that he would not have recorded pride as describing massey with braids if pride had not said that in her interview.the trial court gave a limiting instruction with respect to esposito report the jury could consider it for the purpose of corroborating pride testimony,if indeed it does corroborate her testimony,but not for other purposes.id.at.
later,during his direct and,officer ojaniit was questioned about wood identification of massey in the photographic lineup of may.ojaniit acknowledged that,although his report reflected that wood chose massey photo as looking like the suspect,wood had actually said that the photo looked the most like her assailant.see.the defense challenged the notion that looking the most like someone is a positive,prompting ojaniit to respond that that a question you have to ask wood.id.at.
after the prosecution rested,the defense recalled pride to the witness stand.she testified that she was positive that massey did not have braids in his hair on may,and she reiterated that she had not made any contrary statement to officer esposito.see.in addition to pride,the defense called four of massey friends and family members to testify that massey never wore braids.another defense witness was brady dorsey,the bookkeeper for massey employer,dorsey concrete.dorsey,who had known massey since massey was a small child,also testified that massey had never had braids or long hair.
additionally,relevant to the alibi that massey sought to establish,dorsey produced a payroll journal showing that massey worked eight hours on may,beginning at around dorsey elaborated that he had transported massey from graymont road where dorsey and massey separately resided to the job site.according to dorsey,he and massey departed graymont sometime between and dorsey evidence was thus inconsistent with pride testimony,which placed massey in her apartment several miles from graymont at about 
on september,the jury convicted massey on all five charges.the trial court thereafter sentenced massey to to months in prison for robbery with a dangerous weapon,plus a consecutive term of to months for the remaining four offenses.massey convictions and sentences were later affirmed by the court of appeals of north carolina.see state massey,no,attached as exhibit to rule c motions of officers ojaniit and ledford.
in the mid,the wrongful conviction clinic at duke university the clinic began investigating massey case.see compl.the clinic obtained a series of mug shots of massey taken on seven occasions between april,and may.each of the photos including one taken on march,showed massey with short hair.after examining the photos,two professional barbers made affidavits that massey could not have grown his hair long enough to have it braided in cornrows between march,and the date of the crimes against wood and her children,may.furthermore,according to the barbers,if massey had cornrows on may,the lines in his scalp left by the braiding would have been visible in his may,photo,but no such lines were apparent.the clinic also interviewed wood and discovered that,despite her unequivocal identification of massey during the trial,she had expressed doubt to the prosecutor that massey was her assailant after she first saw him in court,before hearing him speak and further observing him at a pretrial hearing.wood initial reservations were not conveyed to defense counsel.
the clinic presented its investigation to the district attorney of mecklenburg county.as a result,on may,the prosecutor moved in state court to set aside the jury verdicts against massey and have him released from custody.the motion explained that the evidence uncovered by the clinic made it likely that a jury would conclude that although there is substantial evidence placing massey in the area and identifying him as the perpetrator,there is reasonable doubt about whether he committed the offense.motion attached as exhibit to officers answers.in granting the prosecutor motion,the court concluded that,g iven the totality of the circumstances that now exist in this case,if the jury had all the facts that are now available,it can not be said with certainty that the jury would have reached the same conclusion.state massey,crs l,slip op.at.may,attached as exhibit to officers answers.the court therefore struck the five verdicts against massey and ordered that he be released immediately from custody.massey was freed that same day.
in these civil proceedings,the crux of massey and state law claims is that he was wrongfully arrested,convicted,and incarcerated as a result of the officers fabrication of evidence.specifically,massey claims are based on two allegedly falsified reports,both of may,officer esposito report that pride described massey as wear ing his hair pulled back with or braids,and officer ojaniit report that wood stated that massey photo looked like the suspect,id.at.by his report of august,addressing the officers rule c motions,the magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of massey claims against officer ledford,explaining that the complaint was completely devoid of any factual allegations that would support claims of wrongdoing with respect to him.see report.the magistrate judge further recommended,however,that the rule c motions of ojaniit and esposito be denied,as massey had stated plausible allegations of constitutional violations perpetrated by those two defendants,and it would be premature to grant their requests for judgment.id.
pursuant to b c and rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,officers ojaniit and esposito timely objected to the report.massey responded to ojaniit and esposito objections,urging the district court to allow his claims against those defendants to proceed.massey response explicitly renounced any objection,however,to the magistrate judge recommendation that the claims against officer ledford be dismissed.massey therefore asked the court to adopt the report in full.
for the reasons explained in its order of march,the district court opted instead to grant all three rule c motions and dismiss massey complaint in its entirety.the court determined,applying the standard of rule b,that massey had failed to state a claim against officer ojaniit or officer esposito on which relief can be granted.accordingly,the court concluded that those officers were entitled to qualified immunity under the first step of the procedure spelled out in saucier katz,under that step,a court must decide whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right.see pearson callahan,citing.b,c.without addressing massey acquiescence to the dismissal of his claims against officer ledford,the district court similarly ruled that ledford was entitled to qualified immunity in the absence of any colorable claim being stated against him.finally,again applying the rule b standard,the court dismissed the state law claims against all three defendants for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.
massey timely noted this appeal from the district court judgment,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.he challenges the dismissal of his claims against not only officers ojaniit and esposito,but also officer ledford.
we begin with massey attempt to revive his claims against officer ledford.as noted above,massey unequivocally advised the district court that he did not object to the report insofar as the magistrate judge recommended the granting of ledford motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.massey nevertheless now maintains that he can appeal the district court entry of judgment in ledford favor.our precedent,however,is replete with warnings that the consequence of failing to file objections to a magistrate judge report is waiver of the right to appeal.wells shriners hosp,cir listing cases.
it is no help to massey that the district court conducted a de novo review of the magistrate judge recommendations with respect to officer ledford,because such review can not cure the failure to properly and timely object.the supreme court decision in thomas arn,is instructive.there,the court held that a court of appeals may exercise its supervisory powers to establish a rule that the failure to file objections to the magistrate report waives the right to appeal the district court judgment.thomas,at.the court also affirmed the sixth circuit application of such a rule to thomas,who was deemed to have waived appellate review by failing to object to a magistrate judge report,even though the district court had conducted a subsequent de novo review of the entire record and dismissed thomas habeas corpus petition on the merits.see id.at.we likewise conclude that massey has waived his right to appeal the judgment in ledford favor.accordingly,we dismiss massey appeal as to ledford.
next,we review the district court disposition of the rule c motions of officers ojaniit and esposito.as a threshold matter,we address massey contention that the court consideration of the officers exhibits particularly the transcript of the criminal trial went far beyond the narrow circumstance in which a court can rely upon documents attached to pleadings without converting a rule c motion into one for summary judgment.br.of appellant.notably,prior to issuing his report,the magistrate judge had denied massey request to strike the officers exhibits or,alternatively,to convert their rule c motions to summary judgment motions.
massey primary grievance with respect to the district court reliance on the trial transcript is that the transcript is neither a fact,nor was it construed in the light most favorable to him.br.of appellant quoting clatterbuck city of charlottesville,cir.we recently reiterated in clatterbuck that,in disposing of a rule c motion,courts may consider relevant facts obtained from the public record,so long as these facts are construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff along with the allegations of the complaint.at internal quotation marks omitted citing.d.contrary to massey assertion of error,the district court consideration of the trial transcript did not run afoul of clatterbuck or rule d.rather,the court viewed the transcript as a complete account of the testimony and evidence offered at trial,order,and recognized that the transcript presence in the record meant that certain facts the nature of the testimony and evidence offered at trial are not in dispute,id.at.significantly,the court refrained from deciding any issue of the trial and form ed no judgment as to the credibility of any witness.see id.at.moreover,massey does not dispute the accuracy or authenticity of the transcript rather,he extensively quotes from it in his complaint.see compl.
in these circumstances,we approve of the district court consideration of the trial transcript,as well as other exhibits to the officers answers and rule c motions,discussed supra part indeed,as part of our de novo review of the court rule c rulings,see butler united states,cir,we independently consider those same documents.philips pitt cnty.mem l,cir in reviewing a rule b dismissal,we may properly take judicial notice of matters of public record.we may also consider documents attached to the complaint,as well as those attached to the motion to dismiss,so long as they are integral to the complaint and authentic.citations omitted.
turning to the merits of the district court award of rule c judgments on the pleadings to officers ojaniit and esposito,our de novo review requires us to apply the standard for a rule b motion.see butler,at.in so doing,we are mindful that a rule c motion tests only the sufficiency of the complaint and does not resolve the merits of the plaintiff claims or any disputes of fact.drager pliva usa,cir.like the district court,we are required to accept all allegations of massey complaint as true and draw all reasonable factual inferences in his favor.see edwards city of goldsboro,cir.nevertheless,we are not obliged to accept allegations that represent unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments,or that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit.blankenship manchin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in applying the foregoing standards,the complaint will survive only if it states a plausible claim for relief.see ashcroft iqbal.because officers ojaniit and esposito have asserted qualified immunity with respect to massey claims,our inquiry is whether massey has plead ed factual matter that,if taken as true,states a claim that the officers deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights.see id.at.that is,we must take the qualified immunity analysis into account,assessing whether the facts that massey has alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right,and,if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the officers alleged misconduct.see pearson callahan,internal quotation marks omitted.
like the district court,we conclude under the first step of the qualified immunity analysis with respect to each of massey claims that he has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted,and thus do not proceed to the second step.we also agree with the district court that massey has not pleaded any colorable state law claim 
the claim in count i of the complaint alleges violations of massey right to due process,and thus concerns the alleged use of fabricated evidence at trial to obtain his convictions the fourteenth amendment protects against deprivations of liberty accomplished without due process of law.baker mccollan,internal quotation marks omitted.we have recognized a due process right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigating capacity.washington wilmore,cir quoting zahrey coffey,cir see also,halsey pfeiffer,cir b y fabricating evidence for use in a criminal prosecution,a state actor would violate a defendant fourteenth amendment due process rights regardless of whether or not the state actor violated other constitutional rights of the defendant.
fabrication of evidence alone is insufficient to state a claim for a due process violation a plaintiff must plead adequate facts to establish that the loss of liberty,his conviction and subsequent incarceration resulted from the fabrication.see washington,at citing zahrey,at.the plaintiff must also be able to show that,despite any intervening acts of independent,the conviction was a reasonably foreseeable result of the initial act of fabrication.id.at citing,inter alia,jones city of chicago,cir a prosecutor decision to charge,a grand jury decision to indict,a prosecutor decision not to drop charges but to proceed to trial none of these decisions will shield a police officer who deliberately supplied misleading information that influenced the decision.as judge motz explained in evans chalmers,constitutional torts,like their common law brethren,require a demonstration of both and proximate causation,cir.
beginning with officer esposito,we take as true that he fabricated the portion of his may,report recording pride statement that massey wore braids.we thus consider whether massey has pleaded adequate facts to support a causal connection between that fabrication and his convictions.
at the outset,we must reject the main premise of massey case against the officers that if he did not wear his hair in cornrows on may,he could not have been the armed black man who robbed and kidnaped wood and her children.see br.of appellant see also id.at asserting that massey was exonerated in may,when the equivalent of nonbiological dna excluded him as a suspect in the crimes.the problem for massey,as the district court observed,is that he 
raises to the level of cer
