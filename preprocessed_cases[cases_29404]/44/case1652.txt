cleavenger healthcare insurer removed the case to federal court under and,asserting that the claims against it and related defendants were completely preempted by a of the employee retirement income security act erisa.the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court on the ground that their claims challenged mixed decisions of plan administration and patient treatment and that,under pegram herdrich,d,such claims are not preempted by erisa.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand because their claims against the healthcare insurers challenged purely administrative decisions under the plan and were thus completely preempted by erisa.the district court then considered the merits of plaintiffs preempted claims,which it treated as erisa claims,and entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs on those claims.finally,the court remanded the remaining claims to state court.

robert cleavenger was employed by mountaineer retreading,in clarksburg,west virginia,and in connection with his employment,mountaineer retreading provided cleavenger employee benefits,including healthcare benefits through a preferred provider organization plan a ppo plan insured by health assurance.for the premiums paid,health assurance agreed to pay mountaineer retreading employees for of the costs of medical care provided to them by participating healthcare who agreed to offer healthcare pursuant to a fee of the costs of care provided by nonparticipating providers.cleavenger ppo plan,which detailed the scope of coverage as well as its limitations,provided coverage for mental illness,including coverage for days in an inpatient mental health facility and outpatient psychiatric consultations.
health assurance subcontracted with managed care services mainstay of central pennsylvania,mainstay to manage the behavioral healthcare component of its ppo plan.this subcontract required mainstay to provide certain mental health and chemical dependency outpatient and inpatient professional and technical services and related provider contracting and credentialing,utilization management and quality improvement services.these services that mainstay undertook to provide included determinations of employee eligibility,the medical necessity of services,the resolution of grievances,and claims payment.mainstay provided these services to employees through case managers whom they designated in connection with each claim.in this case,mainstay designated shelley watters as the case manager to perform utilization review services in connection with cleavenger treatment.
in october,while covered by his employee benefit plan,cleavenger was hospitalized at the william sharpe.hospital sharpe hospital in weston,west virginia,after he attempted suicide by ingesting three bottles of pills and slitting his wrist.his suicide attempt came shortly after he assaulted his wife upon learningthat she was having an affair with another man.he wrote a suicide note describing his inability to bear the pain of his wife rejection.cleavenger was rushed to the emergency room,treated,and involuntarily committed to sharpe hospital for monitoring and treatment.
at sharpe hospital,cleavenger received four days of inpatient treatment for depression.after he was admitted,mary ann iquinto,a sharpe hospital nurse,called cleavenger insurer to determine cleavenger insurance coverage,as she routinely did for newly admitted patients.health assurance referred iquinto to mainstay and to shelley watters.after learning of cleavenger suicide attempt and behavior,watters authorized payment to sharpe hospital for cleavenger inpatient services.she also told iquinto that because sharpe hospital was not a participating provider under cleavenger insurance policy,cleavenger would be responsible for a.
the next day,october,watters called iquinto to inquire about cleavenger condition and was advised that cleavenger remained on a suicide watch and that sharpe hospital planned to continue to monitor him closely to see if he would stabilize and to increase his social interaction.during the conversation,watters authorized payment for cleavenger continued inpatient care.
ahmed aboraya,cleavenger treating physician at sharpe hospital,observed that over the next two days cleavenger was doing fairly well,and he stopped the checks made as part of the suicide watch.he also noted cleavenger was neither delusional nor psychotic and that he no longer posed a risk of harm to himself or others.
after the first couple of days in the hospital,cleavenger began to express concern to aboraya that if he stayed in the hospital too long he would lose his job.aboraya noted that it was cleavenger will and his request that he want ed to go home and continue to his job and continue the therapy as an outpatient.based on cleavenger improved condition,aboraya did not believe that the hospital could keep cleavenger against his will.aboraya met with a team of nurses and a social worker,explained that cleavenger requested discharge,and asked whether there were any concerns about releasing him.everybody on the team agreed that,under west virginia law,there was no basis for holding cleavenger against his will,and so aboraya noted on cleavenger chart,discharge the patient on friday october.pollard,a sharpe hospital doctor who observed cleavenger and who had the authority to override aboraya discharge decision,agreed with aboraya decision.
cleavenger was released on friday,october,from sharpe hospital.florence hatton,the social worker on the unit at that time,wrote up a psychological assessment of cleavenger and a plan for his outpatient care.aboraya had only specified that cleavenger needed a psychologist who specialized in marital problems,and he did not specify where cleavenger should go for outpatient care.he left that decision to florence hatton.although both valley community mental health center,valley center and university health associates at chestnut ridge hospital university associates were options for outpatient both were,in aboraya estimation,similar clinics hatton noted that cleavenger stated he did not want to go to valley center,even though it was the facility closer to cleavenger residence.hatton thus contacted university associates and set up an appointment for cleavenger for october.
watters,who had learned that cleavenger was being released,sent cleavenger a letter,introducing herself as his case manager and indicating that she would continue to follow his treatment after discharge and contact him by telephone to assess his status.she also learned that sharpe hospital had set up an appointment for cleavenger at university associates for october.after october,watters called cleavenger to determine whether he had kept his appointment at university associates,but cleavenger never returned her call.watters october notes indicate that university associates told her that cleavenger kept his first appointment,although university associates doubts that they would have communicated that information,as cleavenger never showed up.watters continued to attempt to reach cleavenger but to no avail.having not heard from him and assuming that cleavenger was keeping his appointments,watters closed her file on cleavenger.
in fact,on the day of his release from the hospital,cleavenger contacted university associates to change his outpatient appointment that was scheduled for october because it conflicted with his return to work.cleavenger also postponed his next appointment on october in order to take his son to the dentist.one day later,on october,cleavenger killed his wife and daughter with a knife,injured his son,and committed suicide by jumping head first from a second story window of the family home.
the plaintiffs,who are representatives of the estates of cleavenger,his wife,and his daughter,as well as the guardian of his surviving son,commenced this action for damages in state court,asserting various claims of negligence and vicarious liability against doctors,healthcare organizations,and insurance related entities based on the decision to release cleavenger from the hospital to outpatient care.in their complaint against watters,the plaintiffs alleged that she was negligent in 
a failing to adequately monitor robert cleavenger during his treatment b failing to obtain or otherwise cause the readmission of robert cleavenger to the sharpe hospital or other inpatient facility once it became apparent that robert cleavenger was with treatment services designed to monitor his recovery from his mental illness and c failing to provide adequate warnings to robert cleavenger family members,who were foreseeable victims of robert cleavenger mental illness,as to signs and symptoms of robert cleavenger remission.
their complaint against mainstay alleged only that mainstay was vicariously liable for watters negligence.plaintiffs sought damages for funeral and medical expenses,pain and suffering,and lost earnings,among other things.
after health assurance,with the consent of the other defendants,removed this case to federal court on the ground that the claims against it as well as mainstay and watters were preempted by erisa,plaintiffs filed a motion to remand this case to state court,arguing that mainstay and watters had an active role in the decision as to the type and quality of health care robert cleavenger received in october of and that such mixed decisions involving both eligibility for coverage and treatment were not subject to preemption under erisa,but rather were subject to malpractice jurisprudence.the district court rejected that argument and denied plaintiffs motion to remand,concluding that because plaintiffs case against mainstay and watters related to the administration of plan benefits,and not to the provision of medical care,it had to be brought under erisa,if at all.the court concluded 
p laintiffs can not escape the facts that mainstay never purported to provide cleavenger with medical services,that cleavenger treating physicians were fully insulated from the utilization review procedures performed by mainstay,and that watters never spoke directly with cleavenger physicians and had no input into cleavenger referral to outpatient care.cleavenger was discharged and referred to outpatient therapy not because of a mainstay policy that determined level of care,but because his treating physicians concluded that was the most appropriate level of treatment.it was the treating physicians at sharpe who were the arrangers of cleavenger care,not mainstay or shelley watters.mainstay was performing a purely administrative role.
at bottom,plaintiffs claims against shelley watters and mainstay attack the administration of cleavenger benefits.plaintiffs essentially complain that the administration of the ppo plan led to cleavenger being referred to outpatient care.these claims go to plan administration,not provision of medical services.
the district court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish a claim under erisa and entered summary judgment against them.
from the district court orders denying remand and granting summary judgment to mainstay and watters,the plaintiffs filed this appeal.
plaintiffs principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in concluding that their claims against mainstay and watters were preempted by erisa and in denying their motion to remand this case to state court on that basis.they contend that erisa does not preempt their claims against mainstay and watters because these claims challenge mixed eligibility and treatment,decisions in which plan administration and medical judgment are inextricably intertwined.such mixed eligibility and treatment claims,they assert,remain claims and are not preempted by erisa under the rationale of pegram herdrich,d holding that a claim of fiduciary breach by an hmo physician making a mixed decision of eligibility and treatment boil s down to a malpractice claim,and the fiduciary standard could be nothing but the malpractice standard traditionally applied in actions against physicians so that erisa would not govern such a claim.
we begin by reviewing the nature and scope of erisa preemption generally.erisa was enacted to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by,among other things,establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employment benefit plans,and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b.its regulation extends to plans that provide medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits for plan participants or their beneficiaries through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d quoting erisa.recognizing the reservation to federal authority of the sole power to regulate the field of employee benefit plans as erisa crowning achievement,the legislation sponsors emphasized both the breadth and importance of the preemption provisions to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,a of erisa provides that erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.this broad and expansive preemption clause,pilot life,at,thus provides a federal law defense to all causes of action that relate to an employee benefit plan,unless erisa expressly excepts the cause of action from erisa preemption provision,id.at.
having preempted a field defined by claims relating to an erisa plan,erisa precludes the prosecution of preempted claims that are not otherwise saved from preemption under b a unless they fall within the scope of the exclusive civil enforcement mechanism provided by a of erisa,a,in which case they must be treated as federal causes of action under a.section a authorizes participants or beneficiaries to file civil actions to,among other things,recover benefits,enforce rights conferred by an erisa plan,remedy breaches of fiduciary duty,clarify rights to benefits,and enjoin violations of erisa.thus,if a claim preempted by is not included within the scope of a,the claim is susceptible to a defense,whether it is brought in state or federal court.but if a claim falls within the scope of a,it is completely preempted and therefore treated as a federal cause of action.see metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.
stated otherwise,under the scheme established by congress,erisa preempts a field defined by claims relating to employee benefit plans regulated by erisa that are not otherwise subject to erisa saving clause and,once having occupied that field,limits civil enforcement to claims provided in a.any claim falling within the field but not within the scope of a is preempted and must be dismissed,and any claim falling within the scope of a becomes exclusively a federal cause of action.thus,simple preemption under precludes prosecution of the preempted claim,but complete preemption exists when the preempted claim falls within the scope of the exclusive civil enforcement mechanism of,in which case the claim is converted into a federal cause of action removable to federal court.metropolitan life,at.see also in re healthcare,cir it is important to distinguish complete preemption under a of erisa,which is used in this sense as a jurisdictional concept,from express preemption under a of erisa,which is a substantive concept governing the applicable law warner ford motor,cir
