in this personal injury action,livonia shropshire brought suit against defendant laidlaw transit,on behalf of her daughter,hannah for injuries sustained in an automobile accident that occurred when she was five years old.because our jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship,we apply state substantive law.michigan automotive insurance scheme governs this case,and requires a plaintiff to show the existence of a serious impairment of body sic function to recover noneconomic damages.the statute further provides that,for a plaintiff such as hannah,who alleges she suffered a injury,whether she is seriously impaired is a question for the jury if a physician testifies under oath that the plaintiff may have a serious neurological injury.in the district court,plaintiffs sought to introduce an affidavit satisfying this provision,but the court ruled it inadmissible.without it,plaintiffs had no evidence that hannah had suffered a serious impairment of body function,and the district court consequently granted summary judgment to defendant.plaintiff appealed,and we now affirm the decision of the district court,though upon different reasoning 
a brief overview of michigan insurance scheme.comp.laws,will allow for a better understanding of the relevance of the underlying facts.michigan has partially abolished tort liability for noneconomic damages arising out of automobile accidents.comp.laws b.plaintiffs recovery for such damages is limited to accidents in which they suffer death,serious impairment of body function,or permanent disfigurement.comp.laws.at issue in the appeal before us is the serious impairment of body function exception,defined in the statute 
as used in this section,serious impairment of body function means an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person general ability to lead his or her normal life.
the statute further instructs courts that for a injury,a question of fact for the jury is created if a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician who regularly diagnoses or treats injuries testifies under oath that there may be a serious neurological injury.comp.laws a ii.it is this provision specifically that plaintiff invokes to avoid summary judgment and bring her case before a jury.
on may,hannah mother livonia picked her up at school,along with her two sisters and her brother.hannah was five years old at that time,nearing the end of kindergarten.livonia drove a van with three rows of seats and hannah,wearing a seatbelt,sat in the row immediately behind her mother.after picking up the children livonia headed towards the parking lot exit,driving alongside a row of school buses parked to her right.as she did so,a bus owned by defendant laidlaw pulled away from the curb and struck the right rear passenger side of the van.
the accident caused hannah to hit her head against the van window.livonia,unaware of this,quickly stopped the van and checked on her children,each of whom said he or she was okay,a message livonia conveyed to the police when they arrived on the scene.it is undisputed that hannah mother did not seek medical treatment for her the day of the accident,and hannah never showed any physical signs of an injury from the accident.
within a few days,however,hannah began to experience headaches,and when,a week after the accident,she also developed a fever and began vomiting,her mother took her to see william heath,her pediatrician.heath found no physical evidence of an injury,but at the request of livonia referred hannah to a neurologist for a more complete examination.the examining neurologist,marianne majkowski,came to the same conclusion as heath,finding no physical evidence of a head injury.over the next five years,hannah would visit with majkowski and heath numerous times,in addition to seeing three other doctors and a neuropsychologist,with the net result of one electroencephalogram known better as an eeg indicating some abnormality in hannah brain.otherwise,no objective test ever confirmed that hannah suffered from a brain injury as a result of the accident.based on the sole abnormal eeg,charise valentine,who performed that test,submitted an affidavit stating,in pertinent part 
that hannah shropshire suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on the day of may.
that hannah shropshire manifests seizures attributable to the aforementioned motor vehicle accident and resulting closed head injury.
as a licensed allopathic physician who regularly diagnoses and treats closed head injuries,it is my opinion that the motor vehicle accident aforementioned caused hannah shropshire to sustain a closed head injury resulting in a serious neurological injury.
in her deposition,hannah testified as to what her general life has been like since the accident,and in this testimony she appears normal for a girl her age.she goes swimming,has friends at school,plays computer games and basketball,watches television with her two older sisters,rides her bike,and over the last summer got to do all the fun stuff that she wanted.she enjoyed third grade and her classes,but was not eager to return to school.her mother also testified that hannah grades remained good throughout the years following the accident,with the exception of her handwriting grade,but that was apparently low before the accident as well.
in the district court,plaintiff sought to introduce valentine affidavit in opposition to defendant motion for summary judgment.plaintiff argued there,as she does here,that this affidavit satisfies subsection a ii of the scheme and therefore it is now a question for the jury whether,as a result of the accident,she has a serious impairment of body function.for various reasons that we need not address,the district court found the affidavit inadmissible,and determined that without it plaintiff had not produced evidence sufficient to satisfy subsection a ii.nor,the court concluded,had plaintiff shown that her injury satisfied the generic definition of serious impairment of body function contained in subsection.therefore,the district court granted defendant motion for summary judgment.
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.lockett suardini,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
in diversity actions,we apply state substantive law but federal procedural law,erie tompkins,and a central dispute in this appeal concerns this distinction.comp.laws a ii apparently requires different things of a plaintiff at this stage of litigation than does.c,and this case requires us to determine whether this provision of michigan law is substantive and therefore applicable in federal court,or procedural,in which case it is supplanted by rule.we conclude that the michigan provision at issue is procedural,and therefore a plaintiff is not entitled to argue her case to a jury merely because she has satisfied its requirements.instead,plaintiff must produce evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact,as required by rule c.here,plaintiff has failed to do so,and as a result defendant motion for summary judgment must be granted.
as an initial matter,laidlaw failed to raise this issue in the district court.however,as this court has recognized,we may affirm on a ground not relied upon by the district court,dismas charities,united states doj,cir.
whether we apply the injury provision in federal court turns on whether that provision is substantive or procedural.erie,at.for some time now,it has been clear that a substantive law is one that gives rise to rights and obligations or is otherwise bound up with these rights and obligations in such a way that its application in the federal court is required.byrd blue ridge rural,d.viewed with that in mind,the subsection containing the injury provision states,in its entirety 
a the issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following 
i there is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person injuries.
