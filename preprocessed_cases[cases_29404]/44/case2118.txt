on petition for rehearing,we amend our opinion by deleting part,titled zimmer can not pay for medical services promptly,and thereby fails the msp statute requirement for a plan,in its entirety,and deleting,in part,the italicized portion of the following sentence although we agree with the district court determination that zimmer is not liable under the msp statute because it could not be reasonably expected to pay promptly for loftin medical care,we also agree with the other district courts that have concluded that an alleged tortfeasor who settles with a plaintiff is not,ipso facto,a under the msp statute.
these withdrawn portions of the opinion addressed the holding of the district court that the tort ad hoc settlement agreement entered into between zimmer and loftin in the course of loftin lawsuit against which the government was seeking reimbursement under the msp statute was not a plan within the meaning of b a ii,because the purported plan could not have been expected to pay promptly for loftin healthcare services.as that part of the opinion was an alternative holding,our withdrawal of these portions of the opinion does not affect the central holding of our decision that the government lacked authority under the msp statute to seek reimbursement from the zimmer.
notwithstanding the foregoing withdrawals,we remain convinced that the plain language of the msp statute makes the reasonable expectation of a prompt payment a requirement for the government collection from those primary plans listed in b a ii,including a plan.in short,under the language of b b i,which expressly b a i ii,absent an expectation of prompt payment,the government has no cause of action to collect from a plan,or from any of the other primary plans enumerated in b a ii.
as a result of arguments made for the first time in the government petition for rehearing,however,we concede that it is arguable that this plain language of the statute produces an absurd result the msp statute seeks to cast medicare as the secondary payer in virtually all situations in which there is any other insurance,providing a cause of action for reimbursement to medicare from such insurance funds and allowing the government to intervene in litigation between the beneficiary and the primary insurer when the primary insurer is disputing the beneficiary claim.yet,at the same time,the plain language of this statute requires a reasonable expectation of prompt payment from the primary insurer.as a practical matter,this requirement precludes the right to reimbursement from any disputed or potentially disputed funds.furthermore,the plain language of the msp statute permits a reimbursement action with respect to the primary plans enumerated in b a ii only in situations in which medicare usually would not make conditional payments,that is,when it is reasonably expected for payment to be made promptly by the primary plan.
because our holding with regard to the prompt payment requirement was an alternative holding,and because there is no necessity for us to grapple with whether the arguably absurd results may somehow militate against enforcing the plain language of the statute,we delete the portions of the opinion.in all other respects,the opinion remains unchanged.
finally,we reiterate that the courts are not in the business of amending legislation.if the plain language of the msp statute produces the legislatively unintended result claimed by the government,the government complaint should be addressed to congress,not to the courts,for such revision as congress may deem warranted,if any.
except as provided in this order,the petition for rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied.this court opinion,cir,is hereby withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted 
tommy thompson,secretary of the united states department of health human services government appeals from the district court dismissal of complaints against zimmer,zimmer,pursuant to.b,and bernice loftin and her attorney,stephen goetzmann,by summary judgment in their favor.the government had filed suit against all three,seeking reimbursement for medicare expenditures related to loftin medical treatment.this was the same treatment that was the genesis of loftin retaining goetzmann to sue zimmer,the manufacturer of her artificial hip prosthesis,which suit was settled prior to trial.concluding that the government complaint is without any basis in law and that there is no legal right of recovery against these three parties,we affirm the district court dismissal of the government action.
facts proceedings 
in june,loftin underwent surgery to replace her hip joint with a prosthesis manufactured by zimmer.that procedure was paid for by the government through the medicare program.complications arose,requiring loftin to undergo a second surgery.thereafter,loftin continued to experience medical problems related to her hip prosthesis.medicare paid approximately for loftin two surgeries and subsequent medical treatment.
representing loftin,goetzmann filed suit against zimmer for products liability,alleging defective design of the hip prosthesis.loftin claims included the medical expenses paid for by medicare.loftin and zimmer settled in lieu of going to trial.without admitting liability,zimmer paid loftin the unitemized lump sum of.zimmer disbursed the full amount of the settlement to goetzmann,who,after deducting his contingency fee,distributed the balance to loftin.the entire settlement was paid by zimmer no part was paid from insurance.
in october,the government filed suit against goetzmann,loftin,and zimmer under the medicare secondary provider msp statute which authorizes the government to seek reimbursement from entities providing primary insurance coverage for medical services previously paid by medicare.among other things,the msp statute authorizes the government to obtain reimbursement from a firm or entity that has a plan.
the government alleged that zimmer was for its liability to loftin,which,as a putative tortfeasor settling loftin action against it,had paid loftin a substantial sum of money.this payment,insisted the government,was ostensibly for loftin medical expenses,which were originally paid for by the medicare program.claiming entitlement to relief under the msp statute and its implementing regulations,the government sought reimbursement from goetzmann and loftin,and double damages from zimmer.
zimmer moved to dismiss the government complaint against it under rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.zimmer asserted that its tort settlement with loftin was not tantamount to maintaining a plan,as defined in the msp statute.zimmer argued,in the alternative,that its inability to pay for loftin medical services promptly,as required by the msp statute,precluded it from meeting the definition of a plan.the district court declined to determine,on a motion to dismiss,whether zimmer settlement agreement with loftin met the statutory definition of a plan.the district court nonetheless ordered the government complaint dismissed,holding that,as a matter of law,zimmer could not have paid for loftin medical services promptly,as required by the msp statute.
goetzmann and loftin subsequently moved for summary judgment,arguing that they were not required to reimburse medicare because they did not receive payment from an insurer or entity.agreeing with goetzmann and loftin that the msp statute predicates their reimbursement liability on their receipt of payment from,inter alia,a plan that would pay promptly for medical services,the district court granted summary judgment to both goetzmann and loftin.the government timely filed a notice of appeal from the court dismissals of zimmer,goetzmann,and loftin.
ii.analysis 
background.
although the government has litigated similar cases in several district courts around the country,we are the first appellate court to address the issue of an alleged tortfeasor reimbursement liability under the msp statute.notably,the government prior efforts have proved uniformly court that has heard its arguments on this issue,including the district court in the instant case,has rejected the government expansive interpretation of the msp statute.
in this case,the government retreads the same unsuccessful arguments that it has advanced in these prior cases.as we conclude that the statutory analyses performed by the district courts in the prior cases are sound,that the law has not changed,and that the government has not adduced any new facts that require us to reconsider the meaning or scope of the msp statute,we affirm the district court decision in this case.we shall first discuss the government claims against zimmer,because the liability of goetzmann and loftin is predicated on determining whether zimmer qualifies as having a plan under the msp statute.
zimmer reimbursement liability under the msp statute.
standard of review.
a district court order dismissing a complaint under rule b is reviewed de novo on appeal,we must liberally construe the complaint and assume that all facts pleaded therein are true keeping in mind that such dismissals of complaints are viewed with disfavor.we must also remain mindful of the supreme court injunction that a rule b motion should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.
zimmer settlement agreement with loftin is not a plan under the msp statute.
the government contends that zimmer is liable for reimbursing the government medicare expenditures by virtue of zimmer having a plan because zimmer was required or responsible to make payments to loftin,a medicare recipient.the government argument for holding zimmer liable under the msp statute is relatively straightforward the legislative history reflects that the purpose of the msp is to reduce medicare expenditures,the statute achieves this purpose by requiring reimbursement of payments from any plan,an entity is if it is required or responsible for making payments to a medicare recipient and the msp statute provides a right of recovery to the government in seeking reimbursement from such plans that have paid monies to medicare recipients in this case,the plan is alleged by the government to exist by virtue of zimmer payment to medicare recipient loftin under the terms of their settlement agreement.thus,the government concludes,zimmer as well as goetzmann and loftin must reimburse the government for its medicare expenditures because this is in accord with the legislative intent underlying the msp statute.
in assessing whether the msp statute applies to zimmer settlement agreement with loftin,we must start with the actual words of the msp statute for it is the words of the statute that set the metes and bounds of the authority granted by congress thus,we need,indeed,should to legislative history when the statute is clear on its face.when the language of the federal statute is plain and unambiguous,it begins and ends our enquiry.
the terms and structure of the msp statute aptly reflect its general purpose.in enacting this law,congress laudably sought to reduce medicare costs by making the government a secondary provider of medical insurance coverage when a medicare recipient has other sources of primary insurance coverage the msp statute states,in pertinent part,that 
payment under the medicare program may not be made with respect to any item or service to the extent that 
i payment has been made,or can reasonably be expected to be made,as required under a group health plan,or 
ii payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly as determined in accordance with regulations under a workmen compensation law or plan of the united states or a state or under an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan including a plan or under no fault insurance.
in this subsection,the term primary plan means a group health plan or large group health plan,to the extent that clause i applies,and a workman compensation law or plan,an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan including a plan or no fault insurance,to the extent that clause ii applies 
the msp statute also authorizes the government to make conditional healthcare payments when a medicare recipient already has coverage provided by a primary insurance plan and the government has a right of action in reimbursement to recover these conditional healthcare payments from such primary plans 
i primary plans 
any payment under this subchapter shall be conditioned on reimbursement to the appropriate trust fund established by this subchapter when notice or other information is received that payment for such item or service has been or could be made under such subparagraph 
ii action by united states 
in order to recover payment under this subchapter for such an item or service,the united states may bring an action against any entity which is required or responsible directly,as a administrator,or otherwise to make payment with respect so such item or service or any portion thereof under a primary plan,or against any other entity including any physician or provider that has received payment from that entity with respect to the item or service,and may join or intervene in any action related to the events that gave rise to the need for the item or service 
thus,the structure of the msp statute is relatively simple.if a medicare recipient has medical insurance provided through a primary plan,then medicare is precluded from paying for medical services except to provide secondary coverage.stated differently,medicare serves as a insurance plan to cover that which is not paid for by a primary insurance plan.
a primary plan is defined as a group health insurance plan,or as any another type of insurance plan,such as workman compensation,liability insurance,or a plan,that may reasonably be expected to pay for services promptly.promptly is defined by the health care financing administration hcfa regulations as payment within days after the earlier of the date the claim is filed,or the date the service was provided or the patient was discharged from the hospital if the medicare program chooses to make conditional payments when a medicare recipient has coverage under a primary plan,then the government may seek reimbursement for these payments by suing the insurance entities that provide the primary coverage.
to entice us to consider the lengthy and abstruse legislative history of the msp statute,the government urges us to agree with it that the statute is ambiguous however,we decline to find ambiguity where none exists as ably pointed out by zimmer and amici curiae,the term plan,as used in the msp statute,is not only clear in its meaning it plainly does not apply automatically to alleged tortfeasors,such as zimmer,who settle with plaintiffs.we also agree with the other district courts that have concluded that an alleged tortfeasor who settles with a plaintiff is not,ipso facto,a under the msp statute.we are compelled to draw this conclusion when we apply several canons of statutory interpretation.
first,the term plan does not exist in a vacuum within the msp statute.rather,it is predicated on the term primary plan.as the msp statute plainly provides,medicare is a secondary provider of insurance if and only if a medicare recipient has another source of medical coverage under a primary plan.the term primary plan is pivotal to the applicability of the msp reimbursement provisions are not triggered unless a medicare recipient source of recovery meets the definition of primary plan,regardless of whether that source is a group healthcare plan,workman compensation,liability insurance,or a plan.
the government asks us to accept its interpretation of plan without reference to the more fundamental requirement of the msp statute that this type of insurance plan constitute a primary plan.to do so would violate the most basic principle of statutory construction unless indicated otherwise in a statute,its words are to be given their ordinary meaning,which can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which they are used.this maxim is particularly apposite here because the msp statute does not define the term plan neither does it define a primary plan beyond listing some examples of various types of plans that are deemed primary.
we must,accordingly,look to the ordinary meaning of these terms a plan denotes a method for achieving an end or a detailed formulation of a program of action.an insurer is the party to a contract of insurance who assumes the risk and undertakes to indemnify the insured,or pay a certain sum on the happening of a specified contingency.therefore,in the sense used in the msp statute,a primary plan of requires an entity ex ante adoption,for itself,of an arrangement for a source of funds and procedures for disbursing these funds when claims are made against the entity recognizing that t he term had no precise legal meaning,a leading insurance treatise nonetheless confirms this definition of,noting that 
to meet the conceptual definition of,an entity would have to engage in the same sorts of underwriting procedures that insurance companies employ estimating likely losses during the period,setting up a mechanism for creating sufficient reserves to meet those losses as they occur,and,usually,arranging for commercial insurance for losses in excess of some stated amount 
thus,according to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the msp statute,it is wrong for the government to contend that an entity negotiating of a single settlement with an individual plaintiff is sufficient,in and of itself,for such entity to be deemed as having a plan.
in addition,the regulations promulgated under the msp statute by the hcfa reflect the ordinary meaning of a plan.the hcfa regulations define a plan as any arrangement,oral or written,by one or more entities,to provide health benefits or medical care or assume legal liability for injury or illness.the regulations further define a plan as a plan under which an individual,or a private or governmental entity,carries its own risk instead of taking out insurance with a carrier.it is clear from the regulations implementing the msp statute that the existence of a plan requires that there by some form of creation ex ante of a fund and distribution making potential payments to a set of prospective claimants.the hcfa regulations even speak in prospective terms.for example,defines a plan as an arrangement to provide health benefits or assume legal liability.such language contemplates a and makes sense only if a creates or maintains a fund or source and establishes rules for making disbursements therefrom in covering the future risk,when one acts as an insurance carrier for oneself 
furthermore,the interpretative canon,expressio unius est exclusio alterius the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another confirms that the government is advocating an unreasonably broad interpretation of the msp statute.the msp statute explicitly speaks in terms of insurance plans that provide primary medical coverage.nowhere does the msp statute mention or even suggest that an alleged tortfeasor who settles a single claim with a single plaintiff falls within the ambit of the statute category of a plan.the failure of congress to include in the msp statute a right of action for reimbursement of medical expenditures against tortfeasors indicates that this statute plainly intends to allow recovery only from an insurer.
this application of expressio unius to the msp statute is further supported by the canon that instructs courts to adopt harmonious interpretations of statutes addressing similar subjects in this respect,the medical care recovery act mcra explicitly provides for the right of action that the government is attempting to read into the msp statute.the mcra expressly arms the government with a right to recover medical payments that it has made under circumstances creating a tort liability upon some third person.in such instances,the government may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third person who is liable for the injury or disease for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses or lost pay in express terms,then,the mcra affords the government the legal right of recovery that it is urging us to read into the msp statute,which is silent on the point.the express inclusion of recovery from tortfeasors in the mcra supports the conclusion that congress omission of tortfeasors from the list of those potentially liable under the msp statute was knowing and intentional 
recognizing the government attempt to fold the mcra into the msp,the in re diet drugs court noted that 
u nlike the mcra,the msp does not mention a right by the government to recover from a tortfeasor.rather,the express wording of the msp statute creates a cause of action only against insurers and their payees under the government construction of the msp statute,every tortfeasor that used its general assets to fund a tort settlement with persons who had received federal health care benefits would be potentially liable under the msp.there is simply no support for this extremely broad construction of the msp statute 
when faced with two statutes on similar subjects,courts must,whenever possible,interpret them so as to give effect to both yet,if we were to adopt the broad construction of the msp statute urged by the government in this case,we would,in effect,eliminate the need for the mcra,or at least condemn some of congress language in the mcra to the scrap heap of surplusage.this would be unacceptable,particularly when a completely reasonable interpretation of the msp statute is offered by the plain terms of the statute itself.as a district court noted in rejecting another government attempt to read mcra authority into the msp statute i t is clear that congress did not intend msp to be used as an across the board procedural vehicle for suing tortfeasors.
by its plain terms,the msp statute and the hcfa regulations predicate reimbursement liability on the existence of a primary insurance plan.in its first amended complaint,the government obfuscates this fact when it cabins the msp statute requirements as applying to those entities that have only primary payment responsibility.more important,in its specific count against zimmer,the government never alleges that zimmer paid goetzmann and loftin according to a plan it asserts only the conclusions that zimmer was responsible to pay for defendant loftin medical expenses and that zimmer was for its liability to loftin.as the district court noted in granting a motion to dismiss by a similarly situated defendant corporation in a parallel case in fact,the complaint does not even allege the existence of any elements of a primary plan,such as a plan or arrangement.
even when we liberally construe the government complaint,as we must,we see that the msp statute and its implementing regulations require a primary insurance plan.but zimmer has only negotiated a discrete settlement with a single plaintiff and paid that plaintiff accordingly.it is simply a non sequitur for the government to infer from payment responsibility in tort a primary plan of.in considering the government allegations against zimmer under the msp statute,we are compelled to pose the rhetorical question,where the plan beyond oblique references to zimmer responsibility to pay loftin,the existence of a primary plan is nowhere to be found in the government complaint against zimmer.
on appeal,the government repeatedly but in isolation quotes the msp statute phrase that an entity which is required or responsible for paying for a medicare recipient healthcare expenses is liable to reimburse the government.ergo,the government urges,zimmer is arguably liable under the msp statute,or at least there is a basis for inferring potential liability sufficient to survive a rule b motion to dismiss.yet,litigants can not particular phrases out of statutory schemes simply to justify an exceptionally of a statute as the district court held only one year ago in a similar case litigated by the government under the msp statute,msp liability attaches only to an entity that is required or responsible to pay under a primary plan.as we already noted,nothing in the government pleadings can be read to support the conclusional allegation that zimmer maintained such primary plan of for paying claimants such as loft
