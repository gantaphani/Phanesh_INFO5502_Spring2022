the plaintiffs,gerard,a dockworker,and his wife lisa appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york leo glasser,judge granting the defendants motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint to allege additional causes of action under new york state law.
brought suit under the jones act.supp,and the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,et.lhwca,for injuries he sustained while employed by defendant collazo contractors,collazo to help repair piers along the waterfront in staten island,new york.defendant weeks marine,weeks,the general contractor on the project,deployed two barges to assist with the reconstruction,and engaged employer collazo as a subcontractor.alleges that he sustained personal injuries while working aboard one of these barges.
we affirm the dismissal of jones act claims because we agree with the district court that he does not qualify as a seaman within the meaning of the act.we hold,however,that the evidence suffices to create a triable issue of fact with respect to lhwca claim against weeks,and also should be factored into the district court analysis of whether to permit leave to replead to add state law claims.we therefore vacate and remand in part for the court further consideration of these issues.
central to our analysis is allegation,which we must credit on appeal from the grant of summary judgment,that he had been working under the direct supervision of a weeks employee at the time of his injury.we conclude that if the trier of fact ultimately credits this allegation,it could render weeks liable for injury under the federal duties of care articulated by the supreme court in scindia steam navigation de los santos,d,and,perhaps,under new york state law also.
background 
on june,weeks entered into a general contract with the new york city department of transportation to repair and reconstruct certain parts of the staten island ferry maintenance facility.on november,weeks subcontracted with collazo for the latter to repair stone bulkheads on a wharf at the facility ferry terminal.in april,collazo hired,a member of the dockbuilder union,to work as a dockbuilder on the project.
weeks deployed two barges to be used in connection with the project a materials barge used to store supplies and equipment,and a crane barge,which held and transported the crane used at the construction site.neither was weeks initially transported them to the site with tugboats.subsequently,workers on the pier,including,moved the barges short distances within the construction site using winches and pulleys in order to place them where needed.on the date of accident,both barges were moored to bulkheads on the pier neither had been moved for some two months.
alleges that he was assigned to the crane barge during the five months in which he worked on the project.he testified that m ore than half of his working time was spent working on either the crane barge or the materials barge.pl.aff.dated.duties,ordinarily carried out at the direction of his foreman,a collazo employee,included transporting and assembling construction supplies.
on or about september,a bundle of forms steel partitions used for poured into the water when a sling on the crane that had been transporting them broke.the next day,according to weeks statement of undisputed material facts,helped divers recover and clean these forms.
testified that because of the substantial weight of the forms,the crane would ordinarily have been used to lift them,but on the day he was injured,september,t he crane was not available.pl.aff.dated.leo nobiger,a weeks employee supervising the construction,therefore told to move the forms by hand.id.alleges that while performing this job without assistance,he strained himself severely and sustained a hernia with serious complications.id.
on september,filed suit against weeks and collazo under the jones act and the lhwca in the united states district court for the eastern district of ney york on june,the court leo glasser,judge granted weeks motion for summary judgment on jones act claim because it concluded that the barges did not constitute vessels in navigation and that did not qualify as a seaman under the jones act.weeks marine,i.weeks and collazo subsequently moved for summary judgment on the lhwca claims.submitted a memorandum in opposition to that motion in which he raised for the first time the possibility that weeks might be liable to him under new york labor law.the district court construed this passing reference to state law as a motion seeking leave to amend the complaint.on october,the court granted summary judgment to weeks on lhwca claim and denied leave to amend his complaint.weeks marine,wl,dist.lexis,ii this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.tenenbaum williams,cir,cert.denied,d.a district court must grant summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c accord matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.a fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is genuine where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.
ii.overview of the statutory scheme 
a.the jones act 
the jones act confers a cause of action on a ny seaman who suffers a personal injury in the course of his employment.a supp.congress enacted the act in in order to remove barriers to the right of seamen to recover damages for injuries caused by their employers negligence.chandris,latsis,d see also mcdermott int l,wilander,d chronicling congressional attempts to create a negligence action for seamen,culminating in the jones act.the jones act provides heightened legal protections to seamen because of their exposure to the perils of the sea.chandris,at.citations omitted.while maritime can recover from their employers for injuries only through scheduled compensation schemes,the jones act gives seamen an express right of action in tort because of their status as wards of the admiralty who are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate,exposure to perils,and exhausting labour.id.at.quoting harden gordon,cas,story.
b.the lhwca 
the lhwca establishes a comprehensive federal workers compensation program that provides longshoremen and their families with medical,disability,and survivor benefits for injuries and death.howlett birkdale shipping,d accord gravatt city of,cir.employees eligible for lhwca benefits include any person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and.but the lhwca expressly excludes,inter alia,a master or member of a crew of any vessel.id.g.under the lhwca,an employer is one whose employees are employed in maritime employment,in whole or in part,upon the navigable waters of the united states.id.
the lhwca entitles employees to compensation payments for injuries.as with most other workers compensation schemes,this entitlement displaces the employee right to bring an action in tort against his or her employer.the lhwca limits employer liability to the provision of scheduled compensation payments.id,a.an injured lhwca employee may,however,sue a third the owner or charterer of the vessel on which he or she sustained the negligence.id.a accord gravatt,at.
the lhwca and the jones act complement one another.the jones act allows seamen to recover for negligence against their employers the lhwca authorizes maritime workers other than seamen to recover for negligence,but only against parties other than their employers.see chandris,at.describing these two acts as mutually exclusive compensation regimes.indeed,while the jones act does not define seaman,its definition begins where the definition of the term employee in the lhwca ends.southwest marine,gizoni,d comparing the two statutes.it is therefore odd but true that the key requirement for jones act coverage now appears in another statute.chandris,at.quoting wilander,at.
iii.jones act claims 
procedural posture 
brought claims in the district court under the jones act against both collazo and weeks.at oral argument before us,however,counsel represented that his client intended to appeal the dismissal of his jones act claim against collazo only.
the district court dismissed jones act claims against both collazo and weeks because it concluded that the barge on which sustained his injury was not a vessel in navigation under the test set forth in chandris,at.and that did not qualify as a seaman within the meaning of the jones act.i.at.contests these conclusions on appeal.collazo argues that we should affirm the district court order on the ground that neither alleged nor produced evidence to show that collazo acted negligently.
because the district court dismissed both of jones act claims upon weeks motion for summary judgment,in which collazo declined to join,i.at,the district court had no occasion to consider the issue of collazo negligence in connection with the jones act claims.nor did the parties litigate this issue in connection with lhwca claims,because conceded that he could not bring an lhwca action for negligence against collazo,his employer.ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
we need not and do not reach the issue collazo urges upon lack of negligence.neither must we decide whether the district court correctly concluded that the weeks barges were not vessels in navigation.because we agree with the court that does not qualify as a seaman under the jones act,we affirm on that ground.
status as a seaman 
only seamen are entitled to sue for damages under the jones act.harbor tug barge papai,d.to prove seaman status,an employee must establish his or her connection,to a vessel in navigation.tonnesen yonkers constructing,cir quoting wilander,at.the district court concluded that failed to establish either element.i.at.
an connection to a vessel exists if two conditions are satisfied first,the worker duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission second,the worker connection to the vessel must be substantial in both its duration and its nature.tonnesen,at citing chandris,at.
the former inquiry focuses on the plaintiff employment at the time of the injury.fisher nichols,cir.the putative seaman need not aid in navigation or contribute to the transportation of the vessel,but a seaman must be doing the ship work.wilander,at.this standard is liberal.the supreme court has said that a ll who work at sea in the service of a ship are eligible for seaman status.chandris,at.emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the second inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff derives his livelihood from activities.fisher,at.the court has described this inquiry as status based maritime workers do not become seamen because they happen to be working on board a vessel when they are injured,and seamen do not lose jones act protection when the course of their service to a vessel takes them ashore.chandris,at.the jones act does not protect workers with only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation.id.at.
whether an employee qualifies as a seaman is a mixed question of law and fact.papai,at.summary judgment is appropriate where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.wilander,at.see also chandris,at.noting that summary judgment should be granted where undisputed facts reveal that a maritime worker has a clearly inadequate temporal connection to vessels in navigation.
we conclude that fails the second part of the test for determining whether he had an connection to a vessel the extent to which he derive d his livelihood from activities.fisher,at.connection to the vessel qua vessel was insufficiently substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature,chandris,at,to support the conclusion that he qualifies as a seaman.
to be sure,spent more than half his working hours during a period aboard the barges,but he spent all of that time performing tasks related to repair of the staten island pier,while the barges were secured to the pier.belonged to the dockbuilders union.he held no coast guard license or other seaman papers.he never spent the night aboard a barge.neither did he ever operate a barge or otherwise assist in its navigation.see papai,at.t he inquiry into the nature of the employee connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee duties take him to sea.chandris,at.clarifying that seaman status is a function of the worker relationship as such to the vessel and its operation in navigable waters internal quotation marks and citation omitted.finally,no evidence suggests that had an connection to another vessel.
even assuming the barges were vessels in navigation,thus produced no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he derives his livelihood from activities.fisher,at.at most,the evidence establishes that had a transitory or sporadic connection to the weeks barges,the relevant vessels in navigation,in their capacity as vessels in navigation.such a minimal connection does not suffice to confer seaman status on him.chandris,at.because does not qualify as a seaman within the meaning of the jones act,we affirm the dismissal of his jones act claims.
iv.claims under the lhwca 
a.the scindia duties.
brought his lhwca claim against weeks under,which provides in pertinent part 
in the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel,then such person may bring an action against such vessel as a third party if such person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring services,no such action shall be permitted if the injury was caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the vessel.
the lhwca does not define negligence for the purpose of actions against vessel owners under b.but in scindia steam navigation de los santos,d,the supreme court articulated federal standards to guide judicial determinations of liability under this subsection.see id.at.these scindia duties,recently summarized in gravatt,at,establish duties of care owed by vessel owners to stevedores and their employees,and to other contractors and harbor workers.
the turnover duty.first,before turning over the ship or any portion of it to the stevedore or other contractor employing harbor workers,the vessel owner must exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety.id.at quoting scindia,at.this turnover duty also imposes on vessel owners and others falling within the statutory definition of vessel a duty to warn stevedores or other contractors of hazards of which the vessels know or should know and which are unknown or would not be obvious to the stevedore.howlett,at.
the active control duty.second,once stevedoring operations or other operations by a contractor have begun,the vessel owner and others falling within the statutory definition of vessel will be liable if it actively involves itself in those operations and negligently injures a longshoreman or other harbor worker,or if the owner acts negligently with respect to hazards in areas,or from equipment,under the active control of the vessel during the stevedoring or contractor operation.gravatt,at quoting scindia,at.emphases omitted.
the duty to intervene.third,w ith respect to obvious dangers in areas under the principal control of the stevedore,the vessel owner and others falling within the statutory definition of vessel must intervene if it acquires actual knowledge that a condition of the vessel or its equipment poses an unreasonable risk of harm and the stevedore or other contractor is not exercising reasonable care to protect its employees from that risk.id.citing scindia,at.
weeks potential liability.
the district court found no evidence that weeks breached its scindia
