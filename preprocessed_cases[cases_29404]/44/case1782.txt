in this interlocutory appeal filed pursuant to a,southern scrap material,southern scrap,contends that the district court erred by entering an order partially lifting modifying the injunction it had previously issued in this limitation of liability action to allow the united states of america the united states to pursue a claim against southern scrap outside of the context of the limitation of liability act of the limitation act,app,revised at et.the united states claim against southern scrap is brought pursuant to the wreck act,which is part of the rivers and harbors act of the united states seeks to hold southern scrap personally liable for the full amount of the wreck removal expenses it incurred when it removed southern scrap sunken drydock from the inner harbor navigational canal the industrial canal in new orleans,louisiana,after hurricane katrina the cost of this removal far exceeded the value of the wrecked drydock.the united states asserted during the limitation proceeding that it should be allowed to file its claim as a civil action against southern scrap outside of the limitation proceeding because the limitation act does not apply to claims brought by the united states under the wreck act.southern scrap opposed the united states motion to lift or modify the injunction in the district court,arguing that the wreck act does not authorize a statutory action to hold southern scrap,as the owner of the drydock,personally liable for expenses,and even if it does,southern scrap liability under the wreck act is limited by the limitation act to the drydock value.
the questions presented in this appeal are therefore twofold whether the united states claim under the wreck act states a claim upon which relief can be granted and if so,whether the limitation act applies so as to limit the united states recovery on its wreck act claim.viewing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to the united states,as we must at this pleading stage,we conclude that,as a result of the amendments to the wreck act,the united states may bring a statutory action under the wreck act to hold southern scrap personally liable for the cost of removing its sunken drydock,and that the claim is not subject to the limitation act.we therefore affirm the district court judgment insofar as it is consistent with this opinion.in so holding,we intimate no view as to the ultimate merits of the united states claim or the defenses or counterclaims that may be asserted by southern scrap against it.
factual background 
the following facts are taken from the allegations of fact contained in the claim filed by the united states in the limitation proceeding.when hurricane katrina struck new orleans,louisiana,on august,southern scrap was the owner operator of a buoyant drydock located at its facility on the industrial canal inside the city.katrina surge caused the drydock to break free from its moorings and partially sink in the industrial canal against the florida avenue bridge fender system the united states army corps of engineers the corps considered the sunken drydock to be a hazard to navigation in the industrial canal,which it considers to be part of the navigable waters of the united states,and,accordingly,determined that it should be removed in order to eliminate the hazard.on september,the corps allegedly contacted southern scrap and advised it that the drydock was a hazard that needed to be removed.the corps contends that southern scrap responded that it did not have the resources to remove the drydock in a timely manner but that it would provide blueprints to facilitate the drydock removal.the corps then hired boh.construction boh to remove the drydock from the industrial canal,and operations commenced on september.boh completed removal of the drydock on december,thereafter,pursuant to,the corps demanded payment for its removal costs,which it estimated to be about,from southern scrap,as the owner operator of the drydock that impeded navigation in the industrial canal.to date,southern scrap has refused to pay the amount requested by the united states for the cost of removing the drydock from the industrial canal.
ii.procedural background 
on april,southern scrap filed a petition for limitation of liability in the eastern district of louisiana pursuant to the limitation act,by which it sought to limit its liability to the value of the drydock,which it stipulated to be.that same day,in accordance with the limitation act,the district court issued an order restraining the filing,commencement,and further prosecution of any legal proceedings against southern scrap arising out of the sinking of its drydock outside of the limitation action.the district court order also required any party with a claim against southern scrap based on the damage or costs caused by the sunken drydock to file that claim as part of the limitation action by july.five parties did so,including the united states,which filed its claim pursuant to the wreck act.
on december,the united states filed a motion asking the district court to lift or modify its april,limitation order so that the united states could pursue its claim for the entirety of its wreck removal expenses under the wreck act against southern scrap outside of the context of the limitation proceeding.on april,the district court granted the united states motion,thereby allowing it to bring an unlimited personal liability claim under the wreck act outside of the context of the limitation proceeding against southern scrap for the entirety of the wreck removal expenses.southern scrap then timely filed this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.see complaint of mucho k,cir holding that the modification or dissolution of an injunction in a limitation of liability proceeding is appealable as a matter of right under a.
iii.standard of review 
because we must decide whether the united states is able to state a claim under the wreck act in order to resolve whether the district court properly granted the united states motion to lift or modify the injunction in the limitation proceeding,we treat this matter as if it comes to us in the form of a denial of a rule b motion brought by southern scrap.we review a district court determination of a rule b motion de novo.abraham singh,cir.when reviewing a motion to dismiss,we must accept all facts as true and view them in the light most favorable to the party.baker putnal,cir.as the supreme court recently emphasized,the f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact and the party must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.this standard simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary claims or elements.id.at.
furthermore,this court reviews a district court statutory construction de novo.see kaluom stolt offshore,cir see also kemp searle,cir questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law and thus reviewed de novo.
iv.discussion 
a.the united states has sufficiently alleged a claim against southern scrap upon which relief can be granted under the wreck act.
the rivers and harbors act,an assertion of the sovereign power of the united states over its navigable waterways pursuant to article i,of the constitution,was obviously intended to prevent obstructions in the nation waterways.wyandotte transp.united states,d.the supreme court has consistently found the rivers and harbors act coverage to be broad,and it has found that a principal beneficiary of the act,if not the principal beneficiary,is the government itself.id.at.the wreck act,which is comprised of certain provisions of the rivers and harbors act,and,addresses the problem of obstructions caused by sunken vessels.of texas med.branch at galveston united states,cir.its purpose is the protection of other vessels plying the same waters as the sunken vessels.united states raven,cir.congress sought to ensure that navigable waterways remained free of obstructions,including sunken vessels.of texas med.branch at galveston,at.three sections of the wreck act are relevant to this case and.
section specifically addresses the problem of obstructions to navigable waterways caused by sunken vessels the supreme court and this court have construed as having three separately operative clauses the first clause prohibits the sinking,or permitting or causing the sinking,of vessels or other craft in navigable channels.the second clause provides that the owner,lessee,or operator of a vessel sunken in a navigable channel must mark it with a buoy or beacon by day and a light at night.the third clause provides that the owner,lessee,or operator of a vessel sunken in a navigable channel shall commence the immediate removal of the vessel and prosecute the removal diligently,or else be considered as having abandoned the vessel,subjecting it to removal by the united states as provided for in and,inter alios 
sections and expressly authorize the government to remove vessels sunken in navigable waterways and to recover removal costs when the owner,lessee,or operator fails to prosecute immediate removal diligently as required by the third clause of.section a provides that whenever a navigable waterway has been obstructed by a sunken vessel for more than days,or when the abandonment of the obstruction is legally established,the secretary of the army may have the obstructing vessel broken up,removed,sold,or otherwise disposed of.section a is similar to a,except that it authorizes the united states through the secretary of the army,in an emergency,to take immediate possession of a sunken vessel that stops,seriously interferes with,or specially endangers navigation in any navigable waterway of the united states,and to remove or destroy such sunken vessel so as to eliminate the obstruction.
section b provides that the owner,lessee,or operator of a sunken vessel removed from a navigable waterway pursuant to a by the government shall be liable to the united states for the cost of removal or destruction and disposal of the vessel as provided for in a.section c similarly provides that the owner,lessee,or operator of a sunken vessel shall be liable to the government for the costs of removal on an emergency basis under a,except that in such case the removal costs shall include administrative expenses.
applying the foregoing statutory provisions to the facts alleged by the united states in this case,we conclude that the government can state a claim upon which relief may be granted to it under the third clause of when read together with a b or a c.
specifically,the united states alleges that southern scrap was the owner and operator of a drydock that,by virtue of its being swept away and sunken by hurricane katrina,became a significant hazard to navigation in the industrial canal,one of the country navigable waterways,and that the drydock was a sunken vessel,which under federal law had to be removed from the industrial canal in order to eliminate its hazard to navigation.the united states further alleges that,upon contacting representatives of southern scrap less than two weeks after hurricane katrina struck,it was advised that southern scrap was unable to remove its drydock from the industrial canal in a timely manner.moreover,the united states alleges that,in the opinion of the corps the drydock obstruction stopped,seriously interfered with,or specially endangered navigation and that the secretary duly exercised his discretion to have the sunken vessel removed from the channel.consequently,the united states avers,the corps proceeded to have the sunken drydock removed for a cost of over million,which greatly exceeds the value of the wrecked drydock.accordingly,the united states alleges,southern scrap,as owner of the removed vessel,is liable to the united states for the cost of the sunken vessel removal or destruction and disposal.
the foregoing facts alleged by the united states are sufficient to state the essential elements of a claim under of the wreck act,that southern scrap vessel was wrecked and sunk in a navigable channel that it was southern scrap duty as its owner to commence the immediate removal of the same that southern scrap failed to do so and thereby abandoned the craft and subjected it to removal by the united states as provided for in and of the wreck act that the government removed the sunken drydock from the navigable channel in accordance with these statutory provisions and that southern scrap as owner and operator of the sunken drydock is liable to the united states for the cost of removal or destruction and disposal of that vessel.
contrary to our interpretation of the foregoing statutory provisions,however,southern scrap contends that the wreck act affords the government the right to recover removal costs only in the event the owner,lessee,or operator of a vessel negligently causes it to sink in a navigable waterway.this follows,southern scrap argues,because the object of the amendments was merely to codify the supreme court decision in wyandotte transp.united states holding vessel owners liable for the government costs in removing their negligently caused wrecks,not to enable the united states to recover its full expenses of wreck removal from vessel owners,lessees,and operators.we can not agree.southern scrap interpretation of the current statute can not be squared with the plain words of the amendments,the evident objects of the amendments,and the basic structure and scheme of the wreck act left intact by them.
as originally enacted,the first clause of of the wreck act prohibited voluntarily or carelessly sinking a vessel in a navigable channel.based on that language,the supreme court in wyandotte held that the united states could recover its costs of removing such wrecks from those channels from persons who negligently sank them.if congress in the amendments had intended merely to codify wyandotte and restrict the united states to that negligence cause of action,it would have preserved the terms voluntarily or carelessly and probably would have elaborated upon the negligence theory in the first clause of or elsewhere in the statute.the amendments,however,took a tack away from negligence theory by deleting the words voluntarily or carelessly from the first clause of and by amending and affecting other provisions of the wreck act so as to expand the potential for vessel owners liability without fault for governmental wreck removal costs.
the third clause of,unlike the first clause,has always imposed a direct duty on owners whose vessels sank in navigable channels to remove them or else risk the consequence of having the government remove them as provided for in and of the wreck act originally,and only imposed upon such owners in rem liability for the government removal costs up to the value of the wrecked vessel and its cargo.but in the legislation,and were amended to provide that the owners,lessees,and operators of vessels sunken in navigable channels shall be liable to the united states for its costs in removing such sunken vessels that exceed the in rem value of the wreck.in other words,the legislation,in essence,amended and of the wreck act to provide that,in addition to a sunken vessel owner former in rem liability under those sections,an owner,lessee,and operator shall also be liable to the united states for the actual cost of a wreck removal which exceeds the in rem value of the wreck.
for these reasons,we conclude that the amendments to the wreck act were not designed to codify wyandotte or the negligence cause of action it discovered in the act as southern scrap contends,but were intended to grant the united states the substantive statutory right to hold vessel owners,lessees,and operators personally liable for the government removal costs when they fail to comply with their duty to remove sunken vessels from navigable waters under of the act accordingly,we also conclude that the united states can state a personal liability claim against southern scrap under the wreck act for the recovery of its actual cost of removing the drydock from the industrial canal without alleging that the vessel owner negligently caused the sinking.
b.the limitation act does not apply to limit the united states recovery of wreck removal costs under the wreck act.
this court in university of texas held that the limitation did not apply to the united states civil suit under of the wreck act for expenses against parties negligently responsible for the wreck.at.while the university of texas court was not called upon to address the impact of the limitation act in the context of a of course was decided under the version of the wreck underlying principles when combined with the plain words and evident objects of the amendments compel us to conclude again that the limitation act does not apply to limit the united states recovery under the wreck act in this case 
first,congress made a clear policy choice in the amendments to supersede with unlimited personal liability the in rem liability limitation that vessel owners had enjoyed under the previous versions of and of the wreck act.thus,it is very unlikely that congress intended for vessel owners to be able to cancel out this legislative decision by relying on the similar in rem protection of the limitation act.permitting southern scrap to invoke the limitation act in this case would nullify the effect of the new b and c,which we have determined impose unlimited personal liability upon a vessel owner for governmental removal costs,when the owner fails to comply with its obligation to remove its sunken vessel from a navigable waterway.see in re transporter marine,cir explaining that wreck act claims arise from statutory authority creating an independent statutory duty on the part of the shipowner and that to subject such claims to limitation would thwart the expressed intent of of sunken vessels that are hazards to navigation of texas med.branch at galveston,at disallowing application of the limitation act there because it would merely reinstate at another level the limitation on a negligent party liability that wyandotte had removed by authorizing an in personam suit.
second,in concluding that the wreck act implicitly limits the scope of the limitation act,at,the university of texas court applied the longstanding principle that when two statutes irreconcilably conflict,the more recent statute controls.id.at this is not to say that the limitation act no longer has any vitality.it is rather to say that its force succumbs to that of a later statutory enactment which,when still later construed by the supreme court in a manner that wars with the policies of the limitation act,must prevail over the earlier act.under the version of the wreck act,the conflict,or wide breach,as the university of texas court called it,between the wreck act and limitation act arose from wyandotte determination that the united states could sue the negligent owner personally for wreck removal expenses even though the latter had abandoned his vessel.id.at thus,the university of texas court found that i n order fully to effectuate the policies of the wreck act as interpreted by the supreme court in wyandotte,then,it is impossible to give full effect to the limitation act.see also in re chinese.trust,cir the limitation act must be construed,however,in the light of subsequently enacted legislation and regulations designed to insure that our country navigable waterways will be kept free of obstructions.following the amendments,the conflict between the two statutes is even more pronounced,for the owner is no longer able to automatically limit his liability under either or simply by abandoning his vessel.rather,the new b and c now permit the united states to hold a vessel owner personally liable for the total amount of governmental wreck removal costs when it fails to remove its sunken vessel as required by the third clause of.by contrast,the language of the limitation act provides for a limitation on the total of all recoverable damages in a marine accident to the value of the ship and its cargo,no matter how many claimants there may be.tug,united states,cir citing app.a.clearly,then,the two statutes irreconcilably conflict in respect to the nature and scope of a vessel owner liability when the united states sues to recover wreck removal costs.were we to hold otherwise,that the united states right to recover such costs expressly set forth in b and c can still be limited by the owner of a sunken vessel under the limitation act,we would effectively render the new clauses meaningless,thereby violat ing the canon of statutory construction that discourages courts from adopting a reading of a statute that renders any part of the statute mere surplusage.id.at citing bailey united states,d 
finally,this court in university of texas persuasively explained,through detailed reference to the legislative history of the limitation act,why that act should not be extended to cases involving the united states recovery of wreck removal expenses pursuant to the wreck act.see of texas med.branch at galveston,at.we noted that the stated purpose of the limitation act was to place this country mercantile marine upon the same footing as that of great britain.id.at quoting cong.globe,sess.remarks of davis,february.yet,throughout the nineteenth century and,indeed,until recently,the law of great britain has been that the limitation of liability afforded shipowners does not extend to shipowners liability for wreck removal expenses.id.accordingly,we concluded that it is doubtful that congress,in or in,specifically intended the limitation act to apply where its english counterpart did not.id.at.
for these reasons,we conclude,as we did in university of texas,that in this case the limitation act does not wreck the wreck act and the wreck act is not limited by the limitation act.id.at.
conclusion 
accordingly,the judgment of the district court lifting and modifying its injunction so as to allow the united states to bring its personal liability claim against southern scrap for the recovery of its actual costs in removing southern scrap drydock from the navigable waters of the industrial canal,without alleging that the vessel owner negligently caused the sinking,is affirmed insofar as it is consistent with the foregoing opinion.

according to southern scrap limitation complaint,the drydock measured feet long by feet wide by feet deep and displaced long tons.
during the pendency of removal operations,two tows struck the drydock while passing through the industrial canal.on october,barge,which was being towed by the wendy c,struck the drydock and sustained damage.on november,mmi,a tank barge which was being towed by the bethesda,struck the drydock and sustained damage.the owners of both vessels have filed claims against southern scrap,but their claims are not relevant to the issues presently before the court on this interlocutory appeal.
