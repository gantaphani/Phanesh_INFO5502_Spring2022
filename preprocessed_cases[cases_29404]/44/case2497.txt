eric and heather thomas,bring this appeal following the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city of chattanooga police department in a municipal liability action under.the appellants claim that the chattanooga police department had a policy,custom,or practice of condoning the use of excessive force against suspects.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
a.the shooting 
on may,at approximately,one of eric thomas neighbors called the police to report a disorder at thomas home,because thomas and his father had been loudly arguing.when the police arrived,however,the dispute had been resolved.later that night,at around,thomas was driving home from a friend house when the muffler and exhaust pipe fell off his truck.thomas became upset and continued to drive home,dragging the muffler and exhaust pipe on the street and squealing his tires as he entered his driveway.thomas entered his house,and he noticed that some of the firearms from his gun collection had been moved from where he left them earlier that day.he went out his side kitchen door,yelling to his wife,heather,who was next door at her parent house,w here all the guns she yelled back that his mother had moved them.heather then returned home,found the guns,and placed them on the kitchen table.
meanwhile,a neighbor called the police to report a domestic disorder and told the dispatcher that a man and woman were screaming at each other.officer abernathy who knew nothing of the earlier domestic disorder call was first to respond,and was told by the dispatcher that there was a guy riding up and down the street in a truck hollering and screaming,burning rubber in the street,and that the man had a baseball bat.upon arriving at the neighborhood,officer abernathy was told by an elderly man in the street that thomas house was the scene of the domestic disorder.the officer walked toward thomas house and heard two people screaming at each other from inside the house.he radioed for backup and then continued to walk toward the porch.dogs were barking in the backyard as he entered the porch and he could see into the kitchen through a window in the top half portion of the door.
officer abernathy saw a man and woman thomas and his wife facing each other,but he could not hear what they were saying.according to the officer,the man was facing a hallway and the woman was next to the kitchen cabinets.he observed two rifles on the kitchen countertop and saw that the man had a handgun in each hand.the officer saw the man take a staggered step with his left foot towards the hallway,and the woman reach for the kitchen door,presumably to unlock it.officer abernathy then saw the man begin to turn towards the woman.at this point the officer vision was partially obstructed.in his deposition,officer abernathy stated that w hen thomas was turning to his right,i lost sight of the gun in his left hand which i felt traveled up to a point at her.officer abernathy believed that the man and woman had some sort of exchange,and then he saw thomas start to back up and it looked like she had her hands down to her side.officer abernathy claims that the man swayed in the direction of the woman and he saw an almost surprised expression on her face.at that point,officer abernathy claims that there was no doubt in his mind,based on her expression and her body language,that she was in imminent danger,and that he was in secondary danger if the man saw him through the window,or knew of his presence because of the loud barking by the dogs.based on his belief that eric thomas was an immediate threat,the officer fired seven continuous rounds through the glass in the kitchen door at thomas left arm.thomas and his wife both claim that they were merely putting away the guns and that thomas had started to walk away from his wife when he was shot.
officer abernathy does not believe that he announced himself as a police officer before the shooting because he did not think there was enough time.it is unclear whether either thomas or his wife saw the officer on their porch.officer abernathy also stated that he did not stop to reevaluate the scene after firing one or two shots because he did not see thomas drop the guns and thus he believed that the threat had not been subdued.thomas was hit with seven bullets in his back and in his left arm.thomas survived the injuries,but is now partially disabled.
b.the internal investigation 
the internal affairs division of the chattanooga police department,headed by captain janet crumley,conducted an investigation of the shooting.based upon her review of sergeant russell investigative report,crumley determined that the shooting was justified.at the time of the report,thomas and his wife were unwilling to give crumley their statements.crumley noted the relevant facts in the report,but included that officer abernathy had issued a verbal warning through the closed door.crumley concluded that officer abernathy fired his weapon to protect heather thomas from what he reasonably believed to be an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death,and that h is actions were in compliance with department policy.crumley determination was reviewed and approved by the chief of police.upon later questioning,crumley was told that officer abernathy might not have announced himself or issued a warning prior to shooting thomas.crumley maintained that the shooting was justified because the facts still indicated that officer abernathy perceived thomas as an immediate threat to his wife.in her deposition,crumley was asked how she would decide,hypothetically,ten separate cases that were each identical to thomas situation,and crumley responded that she would decide each case the same way she decided this case.
eric and heather thomas did not sue officer abernathy in any capacity rather,they chose to sue the chattanooga police department under a municipal liability theory.the city of chattanooga moved for summary judgment against the thomases.in response,the thomases relied on affidavits from their expert witness,phillip davidson,who had experience with police operations.the city supported its motion with three affidavits from police officials familiar with the department policies and practices.all of these officials denied the existence of any policy in the department condoning the use of unlawful excessive force.the district court determined that the plaintiffs had not presented a genuine issue of any material fact and granted the city motion for summary judgment.
municipal liability under 
we apply a de novo standard in reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment.mclean ontario,cir.summary judgment is proper where the movant shows through the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.the nonmovant must rebut such a showing by presenting sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for him a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to meet this burden.mclean,at.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,this court views the factual evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.

there are at least four avenues a plaintiff may take to prove the existence of a municipality illegal policy or custom.the plaintiff can look to the municipality legislative enactments or official agency policies actions taken by officials with final authority a policy of inadequate training or supervision or a custom of tolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations.pembaur city of cincinnati,d stemler city of florence,cir doe claiborne county,cir.
in the present case,the thomases alleged that the city of chattanooga had an unwritten policy,practice,or custom of condoning the use of excessive force against potential suspects.in doe,this court articulated the requirements for a municipal liability claim made on the basis of an inaction theory,where a policy of tolerating federal rights violations is unwritten but nevertheless entrenched.we stated that,under such a theory,the plaintiff must show 
the existence of a clear and persistent pattern of illegal activity 
notice or constructive notice on the part of the defendant 
the defendant tacit approval of the unconstitutional conduct,such that their deliberate indifference in their failure to act can be said to amount to an official policy of inaction and 
that the defendant custom was the moving force or direct causal link in the constitutional deprivation.
the city of chattanooga moved to dismiss the thomases claim on the theory that the thomases had failed to present a genuine issue of material fact indicating that the police department had a policy or custom of condoning the excessive use of force.the city relied primarily on three affidavits from sergeant charles russell,captain mike williams,and lon eilders.sergeant russell,of the internal affairs division,stated that there have never been any complaints of excessive force against officer abernathy,that the department did not have any policy,custom or practice allowing police officers to use excessive force on any suspect,and that no official of the city has ever authorized or condoned any policy or custom of using excessive force.captain williams,who is in charge of the chattanooga police department training division,stated that officer abernathy received proper training regarding use of deadly force that to his knowledge,the city did not have a policy,custom or practice of training its police officers to use deadly force on any suspect unless the officer clearly believed deadly force was immediately necessary and that the city has never authorized or condoned excessive force,nor did it fail to train its officers due to any deliberate indifference.finally,eilders,who manages the accreditation and standards for the police department,stated that he is familiar with the customs and practices within the police department as they existed in may of,and that it did not have a policy,custom or practice of allowing its officers to use unwarranted excessive force.
in rebuttal,the thomases presented affidavits from their witness,phillip davidson,regarding the police department practice of condoning the use of excessive force by its officers.davidson first affidavit was two pages and the relevant portion in its entirety stated 
based on my experience with other cities in cases similar to this one,the number of formal civil cases alleging use of excessive force by police officers filed against the city of chattanooga indicates that chattanooga police department uniformed officers acted within an informal,unwritten policy,practice,or custom wherein the unlawful use of use of excessive tolerated.in my experience,this culture must necessarily have been known to chattanooga police department illustrated by the fact that crumley recommended that officer abernathy shooting of thomas be carried as justified.
a few days later,davidson submitted a second affidavit,which essentially reiterated his first affidavit and added that he had reviewed statistical evidence,consisting of some of the complaints and civil cover sheets from the suits filed against the chattanooga police department alleging use of excessive force since july of.davidson had not examined the details of any of these suits beyond merely looking at the complaints.finally,in a supplemental affidavit,davidson stated that he inferred a policy,practice,or custom of condoning excessive force in the police department based on the fact that officer abernathy was found justified in shooting thomas,and that crumley stated in her deposition that she prepared her investigative report in the customary way,and would have decided the case the same way if she had to do it over again.davidson essentially argued that there must have been a policy or custom of condoning excessive force in the chattanooga police department because there had been several complaints of excessive force against the department in the past,and because here,in davidson opinion,officer abernathy had violated the department written use of force policy and yet his actions were deemed justified by the department.
the previous complaints against the department as evidence of a policy 
the district court determined that davidson inference that the police department had an unwritten policy condoning excessive force was conclusory,because davidson never set forth the basis or reasoning behind his opinion.the civil complaints which davidson evaluated ranged from a shooting to a broken fingernail,but davidson did nothing to inform the court as to whether most of the complaints were serious or frivolous.davidson also failed to explain how one could evaluate the mere number of complaints in a vacuum to come to a conclusion about the department policies.moreover,davidson failed to present any data upon which the court could compare or contrast the number of excessive force complaints made by citizens of chattanooga with the number of excessive force complaints in cities or in cities with a similarly sized police force.we agree with the district court finding that davidson opinion was conclusory because he did not explain how he drew his conclusions from the list of complaints made against the department.
first,appellants argue that the lower court improperly dismissed davidson testimony because the court disagreed with davidson conclusion that the number of complaints against the city in and of themselves demonstrated an unwritten policy of condoning excessive force.appellants point to a portion of the district court opinion which states that if the chattanooga police department finds a complaint of excessive force to be justified or approximately every months,it obviously does not have a policy of denying all excessive force claims or sweeping them under the carpet.although this type of assumption by a district court would not be appropriate,given the context of the opinion,it is clear that the court was not disagreeing with davidson expert opinion rather,the court was pointing out that the statistics upon which that opinion was based are meaningless because davidson did not produce any data showing what a normal number of excessive force complaints would be.consequently,we find that the court did not disagree with davidson conclusion it simply could not accept the basis behind it.
next,appellants argue that the court made a negative credibility determination regarding issue that should have survived summary judgment and gone to a jury.this argument misunderstands the district court opinion.the court did not make a credibility determination because the issue was not davidson credibility the issue was whether davidson could substantiate his opinion where necessary.
this argument brings us to the crux of appellants case.appellants argue that,based on davidson vast expertise and experience alone,the district court should have denied summary judgment because davidson surmised that there must have been an unwritten policy of condoning excessive force.additionally,appellants argue that because this case does not involve a hard science,the traditional daubert factors which the courts use to evaluate the reliability of an expert testimony,are not readily applicable.
to some degree,appellants are correct.the supreme court has held that the principles articulated in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,apply to all expert testimony,although the lower courts have flexibility in the application of the factors,because it may not make sense to apply some of the daubert factors,such as the rate of error analysis,to testimony.see kumho tire carmichael,d.in this case,appellants believe that because we are dealing with testimony,davidson may rely solely on his experi
