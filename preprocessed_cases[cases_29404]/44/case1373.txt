ida daniels daniels,widow of charles daniels daniels,sued her husband former employer,thomas betts corporation,for breach of fiduciary duty,delay in providing erisa plan documents,and attorney fees.she alleged inter alia that materially misled daniels into believing that he had times his annual salary in supplemental life insurance in addition to the one times annual salary life insurance provided daniels as an employment benefit.
the district court granted daniels motion for summary judgment as to liability on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.it further held,however,that there were genuine issues of material fact as to the type of equitable relief that should be awarded as a result of that breach.the district court also granted daniels summary judgment on her claim that failed for days to provide her plan documents in violation of b of erisa,b.it awarded her the maximum statutory penalty of per day,or.
the district court referred the determination of equitable relief on the breach of fiduciary duty claim to an arbitrator who subsequently awarded daniels.thereafter,the district court approved an attorney fees award of and entered final judgment in the amount of,plus interest and taxable costs.appeals.we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
daniels worked for from until his death from cancer in.prior to,daniels received life insurance in the amount of one times his annual salary at expense as an employment benefit.also prior to,daniels elected to supplement this insurance by purchasing group life insurance having a face value of times his annual salary.the premiums for this supplemental insurance were the same without regard to the employee age and were deducted from the employee paycheck.
changed its insurance carrier and,concomitantly,the structure of its life insurance benefits,effective january.under the new plan the metlife plan,continued to provide at its expense life insurance in the amount of one times annual salary as an employment benefit.employees could continue to purchase supplemental life insurance,but now only in whole rather than fractional multiples of salary.moreover,the premiums for this supplemental coverage were so that they increased with the employee age.
in the fall of,daniels became ill and took a medical leave from.in early december,sent daniels a number of documents explaining the life insurance benefits changes that would become effective on january.the information packet began with a memorandum from john schierer,manager of employee relations,to all office employees.with regard to life insurance,the memo stated that 
life insurance maximums will be increased to a maximum of five times base salary on sic whichever is less.thomas betts will continue to provide one times base salary free of charge.additional multiples will be available on an basis.details are attached.
the first attached document is entitled,open enrollment group term life insurance effective january.the document again explains that will provide salaried employees one times their base salary in group term life insurance to a maximum.the document then sets forth the following two paragraphs which give rise to this suit 
if you currently have supplemental coverage,you will be grandfathered up to your current amount.if your current coverage amount is less than times base salary,you then have the option of electing an additional times base salary up to an incremental without additional proof of insurability.
employees who do not currently have supplemental coverage will be guaranteed coverage for times base salary up to.proof of insurability will be required for the additional coverage chosen in excess of times.
an additional document,entitled life insurance,further explains employees supplemental life insurance benefits as follows 
in addition to your basic life insurance,you may purchase supplemental life insurance by enrolling in the program and paying the required premium.
amount of coverage 
you may purchase supplemental life insurance in amounts of one,two,three,four or five times your base salary.
on december,daniels met with schierer.daniels asked a number of questions about his benefits,none of which related to supplemental life insurance.in the context of his health care benefits,daniels expressed an interest in increasing his pay in light of the layoff had warned him he would soon face.at some point during the conference,daniels executed a group insurance form.the form provided an option for your supplemental life insurance and stated,i wish to purchase supplemental life insurance in the amount indicated below.the possible choices were none,time,times,times,times,and times my annual earnings.the asterisk footnote stated i understand that i may have to provide medical evidence of insurability before this coverage becomes effective.daniels placed an x in the blank next to none.
in her deposition,daniels testified to statements daniels made after the december meeting that tended to show what he thought he had done with respect to his supplemental life insurance.daniels testified that after the terminal nature of her husband condition became known in january,he told her four or five times that she would receive times his salary in life insurance benefits.she further testified that subsequent to the new benefits plan becoming effective,her husband reviewed his payroll deductions for a supplemental life insurance entry and,finding one,told her that it was in order.
after daniels death,daniels received payment of,representing one times her husband annual salary.daniels son,charles,asked schierer if the family was entitled to any additional life insurance benefits in light of the supplemental life insurance his father had been electing.schierer produced the form on which daniels had marked none and informed the daniels that there were no additional life insurance benefits.daniels then obtained counsel who,on september,wrote to and requested all benefit plan document sic or plan summaries which explain any and all plan terms,benefits,and procedures applicable to benefits available to daniels.did not respond to daniels attorney request until july,days later.
the district court held that,as the administrator of an erisa plan,had a fiduciary duty not to materially mislead those to whom the duty of loyalty and prudence are owed.app.at quoting from in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir.a misrepresentation,it explained,is material if there is substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee into making a decision to his or her detriment.id.does not dispute that it had a fiduciary duty it does dispute that it breached that duty.
the district court concluded that made a material misrepresentation to daniels.as the court succinctly put it 
the court concludes that defendants made a material misrepresentation to daniels when they stated in documents sent to him to explain the change in benefits if you currently have supplemental coverage,you will be grandfathered up to your current coverage amount.esposito,exh.f.black law dictionary defines grandfather clause,in relevant part,as provision in a new law or regulation exempting those already in or a part of the existing system which is being regulated.id.on its face,defendants statement conveyed that employees who already had supplemental insurance coverage would be exempted from the changes to defendants policy.
there is no elaboration on this grandfather clause anywhere in the remainder of the explanatory memorandum where that sentence is found or in the other information defendants provided to daniels,the cover memorandum,the enrollment form,and the information schierer says he conveyed to daniels at the december,meeting.
defendants statement that i f you currently have supplemental coverage,you will be grandfathered up to your current coverage amount was a material misrepresentation.esposito,exh.f.in fact,employees who already had supplemental insurance were not grandfathered up to their current coverage amounts.instead,they had to elect to be grandfathered up to those amounts 
in the district court view,this finding of a material misrepresentation by an erisa fiduciary was sufficient alone to warrant summary judgment against as to its liability.app.at.the court made no finding as to whether daniels actually relied on misrepresentation.instead,it concluded that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the type of equitable relief that should be awarded.in the course of so concluding,the district court acknowledged that daniels may not have relied upon the misrepresentation at all instead,daniels may have purposely elected not to continue to pay for supplemental insurance.on the other hand,the court observed,the evidence would support an inference that the grandfathered misrepresentation led daniels to believe that he did not have to do anything to continue his existing supplemental insurance and that he should check none on the enrollment form to indicate that he did not wish to purchase any additional supplemental insurance.
the arbitrator explicitly acknowledged that the district court had yet to find reliance this case boils down to the following questions.did the grandfather clause cause the decline of the supplemental plan under the new policy and if so what is the remedy having recognized the unresolved reliance issue,the arbitrator stated cursorily,considering the pros and cons of each party argument makes this a case which should be decided equitably.the arbitrator then summarily awarded daniels or percent of her desired recovery plus costs.
with respect to appellees claim that violated b by refusing to comply with a request for the instruments under which an erisa plan is established or operated,the district court held that a request from the attorney of a participant or beneficiary triggers the statutory duty to respond and daniels was a beneficiary as defined in erisa at the time of her attorney request even though she had previously received all of the insurance proceeds she was entitled to receive under the metlife plan.the district court then noted that had offered no excuses for its failure to provide the documents other than the legal arguments the court had just rejected and pointed out that there had not even been a response to daniels asserting these legal positions.as a result,it imposed penalties of per day for the days had refused to respond.
both sides claim to be entitled to summary judgment with respect to liability on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.moreover,insists that,even if it is not entitled to such a summary judgment,the issue of liability must be tried.in order to resolve these contentions and the arguments addressed in support of them,we must determine whether there is a material dispute of fact as to whether made a material misrepresentation whether detrimental reliance is an essential element of daniels case on liability and,if so,whether there is a material dispute of fact as to whether daniels relied on the grandfathered statement and whether summary judgment could properly be entered against on the liability issue in the alleged absence of any evidence tending to show that it was aware of confusion on daniels part.
daniels claim is that breached its fiduciary duty by misrepresenting that existing supplemental insurance would be grandfathered.we have reviewed the elements of such a claim in two recent decisions,adams freedom forge,cir,and in re unisys.retiree medical benefit erisa litigation,cir hereinafter unisys iii.in adams,we stated 
an employee may recover for a breach of fiduciary duty under erisa if he or she proves that any employer,acting as a fiduciary,made a material misrepresentation that would confuse a reasonable beneficiary about his or her benefits,and the beneficiary acted thereupon to his or her detriment.
id.at see also unisys iii,at quoting adams and noting that it elucidates the elements of a breach of fiduciary claim.following adams and unisys iii,it is thus clear that,in order to make out a breach of fiduciary duty claim of the kind here asserted,a plaintiff must establish each of the following elements the defendant status as an erisa fiduciary acting as a fiduciary a misrepresentation on the part of the defendant the materiality of that misrepresentation and detrimental reliance by the plaintiff on the misrepresentation.
like the district court here,we explained in adams that a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making a decision regarding his benefits under the erisa plan.see id.summary judgment on the question of materiality is appropriate only if reasonable minds can not differ.fischer phila,cir quoting from tsc,northway,d.
material misrepresentation 
the portion of explanatory materials on which daniels primarily bases her case is set forth again in the margin for the reader convenience daniels emphasizes that this portion advises someone in daniels position that his existing supplemental coverage will be grandfathered up to your current amount.this clearly connotes,in her view,that existing supplemental insurance would continue unaffected by the new plan and that it would do so without further action on the part of the employee.while she acknowledges that this advice is followed by information about proof of insurability,she points out that everything following the first sentence expressly refers only to additional supplemental coverage or to employees who do not currently have supplemental coverage.she insists that the notion that no action was required on the part of an employee who wished to continue only existing coverage was confirmed by the fact that the election form signed by daniels provided an opportunity to elect coverage of only,or times earnings but provided no way to elect continuation of coverage of,or times earnings.this aspect of the form clearly suggested that its purpose was to provide an opportunity to purchase supplemental insurance in addition to existing coverage,a suggestion that is supported by the footnote indicating that,whichever election was made,it might be subject to proof of insurability.
counters by insisting that,in the context of its material as a whole,there was no significant risk that a reasonable employee would receive the understanding for which daniels contends.it emphasizes that under the old program,as well as the new,the basic life insurance provided at expense was the only thing that was automatic and that supplemental insurance at the employee expense had to be elected annually by him or her.it points out that schierer covering letter,which explains supplemental coverage and its cost to the employee,begins by stating,it is once again time to make your benefit choices for.please note that you will have the following choices effective.app.at.further notes that in the accompanying materials,the basic life insurance is the only thing described as automatic,and supplemental coverage is consistently described as elective the term grandfathered appears only once in this overall general context of elective supplemental coverage and then only in the specific context of proof of insurability.as a result,argues that no reasonable employee was likely to conclude from its materials that supplemental insurance under the old program was being imposed on employees at their own expense with no opportunity provided on the form for opting out.the reasonable inference to be drawn from the materials,insists,is that grandfathered referred to a right to elect to continue existing coverage without proof of insurability and that the only opportunities available for supplemental coverage were those provided for on the form,with those employees who had existing supplemental coverage being entitled to elect supplemental coverage without proof of insurability not to exceed existing supplemental coverage,in daniels case,times earnings,since times earnings would exceed his existing supplemental coverage of times earnings.
we conclude that the message conveyed by the materials as a whole is a matter about which reasonable minds could differ.accordingly,we conclude that summary judgment was entered contrary to the teachings of fischer.
detrimental reliance 
daniels claims that she is in a worse position than she would have been in if had not made its grandfathered statement and seeks relief on that basis.consistent with the above discussion of the elements of such a breach of fiduciary duty claim and contrary to the conclusion of the district court here,she is not entitled to relief unless she can establish that her failure to receive more than was attributable to daniels reliance on the alleged misrepresentation,that he wished his times earnings coverage to continue and failed to effectuate that wish because he was misled by grandfathered statement.see also unisys iii,at.it necessarily follows that the district court erred in entering summary judgment against on the issue of its liability for breach of fiduciary duty without the required finding of uncontroverted evidence of detrimental reliance.
asks that we remand with instructions to enter summary judgment in its favor because there is no competent evidence from which a trier of fact could find detrimental reliance by daniels.finding that there is a material dispute of fact on this issue,we decline to so instruct the district court.
we believe that a trier of fact,having concluded that grandfathering statement held a substantial risk of misleading one in daniels position,could infer from this record that he intended for his supplemental insurance to continue and failed to effectuate that intent because the grandfathering statement led him to check none on the form and to take no other steps to elect new supplemental coverage under the metlife plan.daniels testimony that her husband assured her in january of that he had coverage amounting to times earnings and that the deduction from his pay for supplemental insurance was in order would clearly support the conclusion that he desired to have his supplemental coverage continue and that he believed it was continuing.this could be viewed as consistent with his having checked none only if he mistakenly believed that the election form was directed to additional supplemental insurance and that continuing existing coverage required no further action on his part.since this mistaken belief is precisely the risk that the trier of fact would have previously found inherent in grandfathered statement,a conclusion of a causal connection between the two could naturally follow.
on the other hand,a conclusion of detrimental reliance is not mandated by this record.it would also support an inference that daniels,facing a period of unemployment,wanted to reduce the deductions from his pay and checked none in order to accomplish that objective.
knowledge of confusion 
insists that it can have no liability for a breach of fiduciary duty in the absence of evidence of knowledge on its part that daniels was confused when he declined to purchase supplemental life insurance.appellants br.at.finding no such evidence,urges us to direct the entry of summary judgment in its favor.
again,as the above discussion of the elements of daniels breach of fiduciary duty claim indicates,if an employee proves that an employer,acting as a fiduciary,made an inaccurate statement holding a substantial likelihood of misleading a reasonable employee into making a harmful decision regarding benefits,and that he relied to his detriment on that statement in making such a decision,the employee is entitled to equitable relief.if the statement creates a substantial risk of misleading a reasonable employee,it is foreseeable that an employee will be misled to his detriment.that foreseeability and reasonable reliance by a beneficiary are all that is required.see unisys iii,at.in such circumstances,we have never required a showing that the employer had actual knowledge that a particular employee was about to be misled.
as we noted in unisys iii,there are situations in which the employer knowledge of an employee knowledge and understanding is important to the liability issue.most frequent are those situations in which an employer has not affirmatively misled the employee but has failed to provide the employee information which the employer knows the employee needs in order to protect himself from harm.see bixler central.teamsters health welfare fund,cir finding a fiduciary duty on the part of an employer to communicate to the beneficiary material facts affecting the interest of the beneficiary which the employer knows the beneficiary does not know and which the beneficiary needs to know for his protection.in such a situation,harm to the beneficiary may not be reasonably foreseeable in the absence of employer knowledge of the employee knowledge and understanding.see unisys iii,at.where the fiduciary makes an affirmative statement that creates a substantial likelihood of injury to a reasonable beneficiary,however,any harm occasioned by the detrimental reliance on the affirmative misrepresentation is foreseeable and gives rise to liability.
contrary to suggestion,neither international union,united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers,skinner engine company,cir,nor in re unisys.retiree medical benefit erisa litigation,cir hereinafter unisys ii,holds that knowledge of employee confusion is an element of a breach of fiduciary duty claim like that made by daniels.those cases,like bixler,involved situations in which the plan administrator allegedly failed to provide complete and adequate information when it knew that such information was necessary to avoid harm to beneficiaries.the portions of the opinions in those cases to which directs our attention do not involve claims of affirmative misrepresentation.see,skinner,at t here is no competent evidence which suggests that the company made any affirmative misrepresentations concerning the duration of retiree benefits.id.at,characterizing the plaintiffs as arguing that the defendant breached its fiduciary duty by failing to inform them that the cbas did not provide lifetime welfare benefits and by failing to correct the retirees mistaken belief emphasis added unisys ii,at,w e hold that the district court did not err as a matter of law in concluding that the duty to convey complete and accurate information that was material to its employees circumstance arose from these facts since the trustees had to know that their silence might cause harm.
section b of title provides in relevant part that t he administrator shall,upon written request of any participant or beneficiary,furnish a copy of the instruments under which the plan is established or operated.insists that the judgment entered by the district court against it must be reversed because a written request from an attorney purporting to represent a participant or beneficiary does not trigger the duty to respond unless it is accompanied by written authorization from the client daniels was not a beneficiary,as that term is used in erisa and the amount of the penalty imposed constitutes an abuse of discretion.
sufficiency of the request 
as we noted in bruch firestone tire and rubber,cir,erisa legislative history makes clear that congress intended the provisions to enable claimants to make their own decisions on how best to enforce their rights.we conclude that this objective will be best served by a rule that a representation by an attorney that he is making a request on behalf of a participant or beneficiary triggers the duty to respond under b when the administrator has no reason to question the attorney authority.in the rare case where the administrator has reason to question that authority,it can respond by requesting further evidence.the objective of the statute would be ill served,however,by permitting administrators to refuse to respond with no indication that authority is even an issue.we believe the facts of this case forcefully compel that conclusion.
has asked that we defer to the interpretation of b that it finds in the department of labor advisory opinion letter.that letter addressed a request for documents by a third party.in that context,the department gave the following advice 
i f information is required to be furnished to a participant or beneficiary under section b b,the information must also be furnished to a third party where the partici
