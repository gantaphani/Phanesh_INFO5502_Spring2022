consumers union of united states,consumers union is a corporation that regularly conducts performance testing of consumer products.at a press conference on august,consumers union announced the results of its tests of the isuzu trooper,a sport utility vehicle built by isuzu motors isuzu consumers union called the trooper not acceptable because of its tendency to roll over in certain situations,and recommended that isuzu halt sales of the trooper and recall vehicles already sold,and that owners of the trooper drive it only when necessary.consumers union also criticized isuzu limited response to the test results,suggesting that isuzu was putting consumers at risk in the name of profits.
following the august announcements,consumers union published a article in its magazine,consumer reports,which also described its test results.the article offered further warnings on the trooper,urging consumers not to purchase troopers and recommending that the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa begin a defect investigation.over the next year,despite protests from isuzu and criticisms from nhtsa,consumers union continued to warn of the trooper dangers.consumers union announcements and articles referred only to the trooper and its manufacturer,isuzu none mentioned emerito estrada de,emerito,the exclusive distributor of the trooper in puerto rico and at least two of the virgin islands.
nonetheless,on december,emerito filed suit against consumers union in the federal district court in puerto rico,claiming that it had been injured by consumers union disparagement of isuzu and the isuzu trooper.emerito sought damages for lost sales on three separate theories defamation count i product disparagement count ii and intentional interference with emerito business relations count iii.in its final count,emerito sought a declaratory judgment that consumers union statements about the trooper were false count iv.
consumers union moved to dismiss,and converting the motion to one for summary judgment,see garita hotel.partnership ponce fed.bank,cir,the district court granted summary judgment against emerito.as to all of the damages claims,the district court held that the first amendment barred recovery because each claim turned on injurious falsehood but,in the district court view,none of the alleged falsehoods were of or concerning the plaintiff emerito.the district court added that the defamation claim failed under puerto rico law for the same reason,and that the intentional interference claim failed because the complaint did not identify any specific existing relationships interfered with by the consumers union statements.
on appeal by emerito from the grant of summary judgment,our review is de novo.banco popular de puerto rico,cir.at the forefront is the district court constitutional ruling.starting with new york times sullivan,d,the supreme court has prescribed,as first amendment requirements,numerous substantive and procedural limitations on defamation and certain related torts.here,the district court thought that one such prescribed constitutional rule is that defamation be of and concerning the plaintiff.we are less certain.
traditionally,the of and concerning requirement has been shorthand for a common law rule that a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statement referred to the plaintiff,either explicitly or by implication,geisler petrocelli,cir.conceivably defamation of one person could cause harm to another person who was not defamed for example,a wife might suffer emotional distress because her husband was libeled.but at common law only the defamed person could sue.keeton,dobbs,keeton owen,prosser and keeton on torts,at,ed 
to what extent this of and concerning requirement is also imposed by the first amendment is a different question.the most familiar elements in the new york times line of authority are now.whatever state law might otherwise dictate,a public official or general purpose public figure can not recover for defamation or certain related torts unless the plaintiff shows a falsehood published with actual malice by the defendant meaning a knowing falsehood or one made recklessly.the burden of proof,also prescribed by the supreme court,is on the plaintiff and the showing must be made by clear and convincing evidence.a reviewing court does not accord ordinary deference to the fact finder but reviews the evidence in a more searching manner.somewhat less demanding regimes apply where the plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure or not a public figure at all 
just how the of and concerning requirement enters into constitutional history is a curious story.in new york times,a jury awarded a large libel judgment against the newspaper and in favor of a county commissioner for a civil rights advertisement carried by the paper.at.the advertisement generally criticized the actions of police in montgomery,alabama.id.at.the court main basis for setting aside the libel award was that it failed to conform to the court newly announced actual malice requirement for defamation actions brought by public officials.id.at.but the court then went on to describe a second respect in which the evidence was constitutionally defective it was,said the court,incapable of supporting the jury finding that the allegedly libelous statements were made of and concerning the plaintiff.id.at.
under alabama law,the of and concerning requirement already existed,and the supreme court may have meant only that the evidence to show that the advertisement was of and concerning the plaintiff did not meet the demanding evidentiary requirement that the court had just adopted for free speech cases.however,whether or not new york times intended to adopt of and concerning as a constitutional rule,some such requirement was thereafter made constitutional in rosenblatt baer,d.precisely what baer meant is a more difficult question.
in baer the court was concerned with a newspaper column that criticized generally the management of a county recreation facility without mentioning the plaintiff official.in overturning the jury damage award,the court said that the jury instructions 
permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of the plaintiff relationship to the government agency,the operations of which were the subject of the column discussion a theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government,and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.
baer,at.emphasis added.similarly,new york times had condemned the verdict as punishing criticism of government by transmuting such criticism,however impersonal it may seem on its face,into personal criticism,and hence potential libel,of the officials of whom the government is composed.at.
perhaps new york times and baer,taken together,adopt in full the common law of and concerning requirement as a constitutional norm.moreover,because there exists ample precedent for applying new york times requirements to falsehood claims beyond defamation,a constitutional of and concerning rule could mean that any recovery for falsehood regardless of the label can be only by the person identified in the falsehood.hustler magazine falwell,d extending new york times standards to claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress time,hill,d same for claims regarding a right to privacy.
this is more or less what the district court thought,and its view is supported by a leading decision of the california supreme court,albeit over a dissent,blatty new york times,cal d,en banc,cert.denied,d,and by a leading treatise writer on defamation,albeit in a treatise taking a broad view of constitutional protections,sack baron,libel,slander,and related problems,ed.the california supreme court view,in turn,has been followed by several federal district courts,isuzu motors consumers union of united states,d,auvil cbs minutes.
however,there is reason to be cautious.the supreme court in new york times and baer was concerned with libel directed against government activities where the plaintiff was
