frederick stallings contracted metal fume fever while welding for his employer,newport news shipbuilding dry dock company newport news.stallings filed a claim for partial disability benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,and the administrative law judge alj awarded stallings per week on a continuing basis for loss of capacity and in a lump sum for accumulated loss of wages.on reconsideration the alj denied newport news request for relief under f of the lhwca the alj characterized stallings award as nominal and held that f can not as a matter of law apply to nominal awards.section f limits an employer compensation liability to two years of benefits when a preexisting disability substantially aggravates a injury.the benefits review board the board affirmed the partial disability award.the board also said that the award was not nominal,but nevertheless held that newport news was not entitled to f relief because the award was so small in fact.because stallings has suffered a loss in capacity,we affirm the benefits award.we also hold that a small award,based on an actual loss of earning capacity,does not as a matter of law preclude an employer from seeking relief under f.as a result,we vacate the order denying f relief and remand for the agency to reconsider whether newport news meets the requirements of that section.
stallings has worked as a welder for newport news since.until june he worked mostly in enclosed areas,either aboard ships or in the shops.on june,while stallings was on the job welding,he experienced fatigue,shortness of breath,and dizziness.he was promptly diagnosed with metal fume fever,a injury caused by the inhalation of welding fumes.he was unable to return to work until september,and in the meantime he filed a claim for lhwca benefits.newport news agreed to a compensation award that required it to pay temporary total disability benefits to stallings for the period of missed work.
when stallings returned to work in september,his doctor,ellis maxey,a pulmonary specialist,advised him to avoid inside welding.after a while,however,stallings was assigned to work inside in close proximity to several other welders.the inside welding caused stallings to feel somewhat rundown after work,and he reported this to maxey during an office visit on september.the doctor again warned stallings to avoid inside welding and confirmed that stallings medical restriction to outside work was permanent.newport news accepted this restriction,and stallings began welding only on outside jobs.since stallings has been restricted to outside work,he has missed an occasional day of work due to bad weather.on those days he was passed out of work sent home early and paid for four hours.on the bad weather days stallings could not be reassigned to work inside,unlike welders without his medical restriction.
on eight days of bad weather between november,and february,stallings was passed out because he could not work outside.this prompted stallings to file another lhwca claim for permanent partial disability benefits for wages already lost from work missed because of his medical restriction and for an ongoing loss of capacity.newport news opposed the claim,but requested f relief in the event of an award.the director of the office of workers compensation programs of the department of labor the director,on behalf of the special fund,gave notice that he had no objection to f relief if there was employer liability.the alj awarded stallings permanent partial disability benefits of for past wages lost.in addition,because stallings injury had permanently diminished his capacity,the alj awarded him continuing benefits of per week.
newport news moved for reconsideration.the director likewise moved for reconsideration and,in addition,withdrew his concession that newport news was entitled to f relief the director argued that an employer is not entitled to f relief when nominal benefits are awarded.on reconsideration the alj made no changes in the benefits award but agreed with the director and held that newport news was not entitled to f relief because the award was nominal or de minimis.the board affirmed the alj award of benefits.the board also concluded that the award could not be characterized as nominal because it was based on actual loss of capacity.nevertheless,the board held that newport news was still not entitled to f relief because the award was so small in fact.newport news petitions for review.
before turning to the issues,we will briefly recite our standard for reviewing a board decision.on factual issues we determine whether the board observed its standard for reviewing the alj factual findings.newport news shipbuilding dry dock director harcum ii,cir.according to the lhwca,the alj factual findings shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.b.on legal issues t he board adjudicatory interpretation of the lhwca is entitled to no special deference,and is subject to our independent review.however,a reasonable interpretation of the lhwca by the director should be respected.zapata haynie barnard,cir citation omitted.
newport news first argues that stallings is not entitled to disability benefits because he has not sustained any loss of capacity.the record compels us to disagree.
an employee covered by the lhwca is entitled to compensation for a disability resulting from a injury sustained on the navigable waters of the united states,which include any adjoining pier,terminal,or other area used to load,unload,build,or repair ships.see a.disability,as the supreme court has said,is a measure of earning capacity lost as a result of injury.metro.stevedore rambo rambo ii,d.compensation is authorized not for the physical injury itself but for the economic harm arising out of the worker diminished capacity.see id.
stallings metal fume fever has left him with a permanent partial disability.his lhwca compensation is equal to of the decrease in his capacity for as long as his disability continues.see c.the lhwca equates a partially disabled worker capacity with actual earnings only if the actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent capacity.id.h.otherwise,a reasonable capacity is set,having due regard to the nature of the worker injury,the degree of physical impairment,his usual employment,and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition,including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.id.
the alj found that a welder without restrictions at newport news can be reassigned from outside to inside work on days of bad weather.stallings can not work inside,however,because the medical restriction resulting from his disability limits him to outside work.this led to the alj ultimate finding stallings has suffered a loss in capacity because on days of bad weather newport news has no work for him within his restriction.newport news denies that stallings lost any capacity,and it makes several arguments in support of its position.
first,the company argues that there is no evidence in the record to support the alj finding that stallings disability caused him to lose wages on days of bad weather.this finding is easily supported by substantial evidence when the record is considered as a whole.stallings submitted an affidavit recounting the days when,because it was raining,his employer did not offer him work within his restrictions due to his injury.in his affidavit and in his testimony before the alj,stallings said that he was passed out on these days.in addition,the manager of human resources for newport news testified that welders can be transferred between outside and inside work.stallings,of course,could not be reassigned to inside work during foul weather.
second,newport news argues that the possibility of being forced away from a full day work applies equally to all welders.pet r br.at.the company did not offer evidence to support this argument,and stallings evidence recounted above refutes it.in short,the record supports the alj finding that stallings,in contrast to welders who can work inside,loses wages on days when he is sent home because of bad weather.
third,newport news argues that because stallings actual wages have increased since his injury,he has not lost capacity.this argument is without merit.capacity is determined by actual wages only if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent the worker capacity.h.see also rambo ii,at.randall comfort control.here,stallings actual wages do not represent his capacity because his actual wages have increased for a reason unrelated to capacity he has worked more overtime hours since his injury.it was therefore proper for the alj to find that stallings lost wages on specific days of bad weather when he could not work,even though his earnings are higher overall than before.the point is that if stallings was free of his disability,he would be able to earn more than he does now.see universal.serv.wright,cir.
finally,newport news argues that stallings disability is temporary,manifesting itself only in isolated situations.we reject this argument as well.stallings disability is permanent because his injury has permanently restricted him to working in outdoor areas.the alj finding on this point is supported by substantial medical evidence,including an opinion from stallings doctor.furthermore,u nder the lhwca any reduction in capacity greater than zero is compensable.randall,at.stallings has suffered a compensable injury even though his disability only causes him economic harm on those few days when the weather is too bad for outside work.
in conclusion,the record establishes that without his disability,stallings would have the opportunity to work indoors on days of bad weather and to earn a full day pay.as a result,the alj finding that stallings sustained a loss of capacity is supported by substantial evidence.the award of benefits is therefore affirmed.
newport news second argument is that the board erred in denying the company f relief.the company says that it is entitled to seek f relief because it can show that stallings prior medical conditions substantially contributed to any present disability.if f is applicable,newport news will be responsible for only the first two years of stallings disability benefits,and the company will avoid liability for any increase however substantial in benefits in the future.the director argues that because the disability award is nominal or very small,newport news is barred from seeking f relief.the arguments of newport news and the director with regard to f raise several questions.is stallings award of per week for his permanent partial disability a nominal award if it is,is f relief available in the case of a nominal award finally,if stallings award can not be characterized as nominal because it reflects an actual loss of capacity,is the company precluded from seeking f relief because the amount of the award is so small before we answer these questions,we need to know more about f and to understand what part of its language sparks the argument in this case.
a maritime employer is normally liable for all of the compensation payable to its employees under the lhwca.see a.section f of the act,however,limits the employer liability in the following circumstance.when an injured employee has a permanent partial disability that is found not to be due solely to the injury and the overall disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the injury alone,the employer is only required to pay compensation for the first weeks.see id.f.thereafter,the benefits are paid out of a special fund administered by the director and sustained by employer contributions.see id.f a.the chief purpose of f is to encourage employers to hire and retain disabled workers.see director newport news shipbuilding dry dock langley,cir.without f,employers would have a disincentive to hire disabled workers for fear of having to pay for the entirety of their injuries if their disabilities were to be aggravated at work.director newport news shipbuilding dry dock carmines,cir.see also director bath iron works,cir.section f thus offers protection to employers who are willing to hire disabled workers.this protection comes in the form of a limit on an employer lhwca liability when an employee preexisting disability seriously compounds a injury.see newport news shipbuilding dry dock howard,cir.
to obtain f relief,the employer must prove three things that the employee ultimate disability is not caused solely by the injury,but is also caused in part by a partial disability that the disability was manifest to the employer prior to the injury and that the ultimate permanent partial disability materially and substantially exceeded the disability that would have resulted from the injury alone that is,without the condition.carmines,at footnote omitted.see also f.
newport news proffered evidence that stallings suffered from at least two preexisting medical conditions,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and hypertension.at this stage,newport news and the director are not arguing about whether the company can meet f first and second requirements.rather,they dispute whether newport news can satisfy the third requirement of f,namely,whether stallings ultimate disability materially and substantially exceeds the disability that would have resulted from metal fume fever alone.specifically,the director argues that,as a matter of law,a cumulative disability measured by a monetary award that is either nominal or very small can not be materially and substantially greater than the disability which would have resulted from the injury alone.f.
this brings us back to two of the questions mentioned.did stallings receive a nominal award and,if he did,would that automatically bar f relief the director urges us to apply the rule adopted in todd shipyards director porras,cir,which held that when a nominal award is granted,f relief is precluded because that section third requirement is not met as a matter of law.specifically,the porras court decided that when a disability resulting from both a preexisting condition and a injury is measured by a nominal award,the overall disability can not be materially and substantially greater than the disability caused by the last injury alone.id.at.before we decide whether to apply the rule in porras,we must answer the first question,that is,whether stallings received a nominal award.
a nominal disability award is a mechanism for taking future effects of disability into account when present ability remains undiminished.rambo ii,at.the concept of a nominal award is based on the act method for determining capacity,which may take into account the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.h.see also fleetwood newport news shipbuilding dry dock,cir.a nominal award does not represent an actual loss in capacity.instead,it is arbitrarily set at a very small sum,often at about one percent of present capacity.see,porras,at.the function of the nominal award is to allow the partially disabled employee to avoid statute of limitations problems pending a future and expected decline in capacity.an injured maritime worker must generally bring his disability claim within one year of injury.see a.a losing claimant may file a request to modify a decision rejecting his claim within one year of any rejection.see id.betty b coal director,owcp,cir.a winning claimant may file for a modification of his benefits at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation.if a partially disabled claimant with no present loss of earning capacity was denied benefits outright,he would have to file a modification request every year in order to keep his case alive until his earning power declined.see rambo ii,at.the potential pitfalls for this claimant are avoided by use of the nominal award,which provides the claimant with ongoing compensation payments.this positions him to take advantage of the rule allowing for a modification request at any time up to one year after the last payment of benefits.a nominal award therefore serves as a placeholder to keep the partially disabled employee compensation case alive for purposes of mod
