this is an environmental case.warren smith,et collectively referred to as appellants,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment for carbide and chemicals,et collectively referred to as appellees.appellants brought claims for intentional trespass,permanent private nuisance,and strict liability based on contamination caused by imperceptible particles,claiming harm to their real property.after briefing and oral argument,we determined that kentucky law was unsettled regarding a claim of intentional trespass.accordingly,we certified the following questions to the kentucky supreme court 
is proof of actual harm required to state a claim for an intentional trespass 
if the plaintiffs can prove a diminution in their property values due to an intentional trespass,do they have a right of recovery under kentucky law 
the kentucky supreme court answered the first question no.the answer to the second question,as will be explained,requires that the district court decision granting summary judgment on appellants intentional trespass claim be reversed because a factual dispute exists as to whether appellants suffered actual injury.as to appellants nuisance and strict liability claims,we also find that there are genuine issues of material fact and therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on these claims.
background 
factual.the paducah gaseous diffusion plant 
the paducah gaseous diffusion plant pgdp is a,uranium enrichment facility located in mccracken county,kentucky,approximately ten miles west of paducah,on acres,of which are within a security fence.although there is no single exhibit in the record that accurately details the pgdp boundaries or the appellants properties in relation to the plant boundaries,there is a schematic which provides a general overview.see at.
pgdp is the only operating uranium enrichment facility in the united states the plant was designed to enrich natural and recycled uranium for use in domestic and foreign commercial power reactors.the plant was constructed in the early and its operations began in.over its more than operating lifetime,the plant has enriched more than one million tons of uranium.
carbide and chemicals corporation now union carbide corporation was the original site contractor and operated the plant for the atomic energy commission from the beginning of operations in until march.lockheed martin energy systems,formerly martin marietta energy systems,replaced carbide and chemicals corporation as the operating contractor effective april,and continued its operations until june.the energy policy act of created the united states enrichment corporation usec,one of the first steps in the process of privatizing the government uranium enrichment enterprises.on july,usec leased portions of pgdp from the department of energy,assumed responsibility for uranium enrichment activities,and contracted with lockheed martin utility services,formerly martin marietta utility services,for operation and maintenance of enrichment activities.lockheed martin utility services,operated the facility between july,and may.usec assumed direct operation of pgdp in may and continues to operate the plant today.
the uranium enrichment process 
the process of enriching uranium at pgdp involves conversion of uranium hexafluoride,to compressed gas,which is in turn fed through a series of diffusion stages.pgdp has more than diffusion stages.the diffusion process generates an enriched uranium product the enrichment process produces air emissions through stack releases,as well as liquid discharges and waste.release of low levels of radioactive particles is expected during the uranium enrichment operations in fact,it is specifically permitted and regulated by the federal government.at all relevant times for purposes of this case,pgdp conducted environmental monitoring to detect and measure any releases of radioactive and other materials.air monitoring stations are located within the pgdp boundaries and.surface water in the area surrounding the facility is routinely sampled and tested for contaminants.testing also is performed on sediments,vegetables,deer,and fish for potentially hazardous substances.
contamination caused by pgdp 
groundwater contamination 
in august,a state of kentucky agency discovered groundwater contamination outside the boundaries of,contamination by trichloroethylene tce and in a plume of groundwater flowing northwest from the facility.levels of tce exceeding regulatory limits were detected in a few wells.the concentrations were below proposed regulatory limits.pgdp provided a temporary water supply to residents in the area that might be affected by the groundwater contamination.residents who actually were affected by contaminated groundwater were provided with a continuing temporary water supply and eventually the united states department of energy provided them with municipal water at no cost pgdp routinely sent informational mailings to residents near the plant regarding the contamination and the facility began holding public briefings about the groundwater contamination.
on march,a second plume of tce groundwater contamination was detected extending northeast from the boundaries of pgdp at an average depth of feet below the surface.pgdp conducted a neighborhood notification survey of all local residents and held public briefings about the newly detected contamination.in total,approximately billion gallons of contaminated water were spreading off the site as of april,when the united states general accounting office gao issued a report regarding the contamination and cleanup efforts.
surface water contamination 
in,elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs were found in fish taken from a drainage ditch on pgdp site and the nearby big bayou creek.seven of fish caught from big bayou creek had pcbs above the food and drug administration fda action level of two parts per million.the fda advises that pcbs in fish tissue at two parts per million or above may present a health risk to humans the state of kentucky posted signs advising people to limit consumption of fish caught in the big bayou creek.
soil contamination 
surface soils within and outside the pgdp boundaries were contaminated by water runoff,spills,and buried waste.soil samples revealed the presence of,inter alia,and pcbs.
investigation and cleanup efforts 
under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,the department of energy and the environmental protection agency epa developed an administrative consent order,effective november,that established a schedule to investigate and remediate offsite groundwater contamination.in,the epa placed pgdp on its national priorities list,the agency list of contaminated sites designated as highest priority for cleanup.from through,the department of energy spent about million on efforts to identify and remove contamination in the groundwater,surface water,and soils within and outside pgdp boundaries.the april gao report estimated the cost of completing the cleanup at billion from fiscal year through fiscal year.
procedural background 
appellants are sixteen persons who reside own real property within ten miles of pgdp they filed suit on january,claiming a diminution of property values based on radiological contamination caused by the operation of pgdp.appellants concede that they have sustained no physical bodily injuries as a result of appellees operations at pgdp.appellants contend that groundwater and soil contamination constitute an intentional trespass and a permanent private nuisance that has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the use and enjoyment of their property and has decreased their property values.they also claim that appellees are liable for the contamination under a strict liability theory based on restatement second of torts.appellants also bring an outrage claim against appellees,arguing that appellees are liable to them for severe emotional distress they have suffered as a result of appellees outrageous conduct.
appellants moved for class certification.the district court denied the motion.appellees filed a motion for summary judgment and appellants filed a motion for partial summary judgment.the district court granted appellees motion,denied appellants motion,and dismissed the case.specifically,the district court noted in its decision that the appellants have adduced evidence to show contamination of their properties by imperceptible radionuclides.the district court also noted that appellants demonstrated that their property values have suffered as a result.the district court,however,held that kentucky law requires that appellants claims be based on proof that the contamination is at a level that is harmful to their health,something the appellants could not prove.accordingly,based on this holding,the district court held that summary judgment was proper with respect to appellants claims of intentional trespass,permanent private nuisance,and strict liability.with respect to appellants outrage claim,the district court held that appellants failed to satisfy their burden of proof for purposes of bringing an outrage claim under kentucky law 
ii.analysis 
intentional trespass claim 
as noted above,we certified two questions to the kentucky supreme court.the kentucky supreme court answered the first question of whether proof of actual harm is required to maintain a claim for intentional trespass no.thus,it is now settled that appellants may bring a claim for intentional trespass without proof of actual harm and the district court contrary conclusion can not stand.as to the second question,whether a diminution in property values gives appellants a right of recovery for the intentional trespass,the kentucky supreme court stated that the question confuses the right to recover with the measure of damages as a substitute for proof of actual harm.smith carbide and chem.in other words,the kentucky supreme court said that the diminution in value is a recognized measure of damages which can be used once an actual interference with an owner use of the land,id.at been established.the kentucky supreme court went on to explain what is meant by an actual injury,and offered the following guidance 
property owners are not required to prove contamination that is an actual and verifiable health risk,nor are they required to wait until government action is taken.an intrusion or encroachment which is an unreasonable interference with the property owner possessory use of property is sufficient evidence of actual injury.
when the parcel groundwater is contaminated whether by imperceptible particles or visible particles,to the extent that it can not be used for consumption by humans,animals,or crops,there is an actual injury.when ponds and streams have to have signs posted to prevent swimming,fishing,drinking,or other otherwise normal uses,there is an unreasonable interference with one use and enjoyment.the amount of harm,if any,to the individual parcels,and the corresponding measure of actual or compensatory damages will depend upon the proof introduced at issue of fact.
id.at emphasis added.
following the kentucky supreme court decision,the parties submitted supplemental briefs.appellants contend that the record contains evidence of actual injury sufficient to survive summary judgment and require a trial on their intentional trespass claim.we agree.indeed,while the key inquiry is obviously whether appellants suffered actual injury,the emphasized language instructs that this is a factual inquiry for trial.
with respect to the record,eight of the appellants had their water wells capped or have been prevented from digging wells.the department of energy has provided all appellants with free municipal water as a result of the groundwater contamination,and appellants affirmed that they have stopped raising livestock,gardening,and consuming fish from nearby streams.appellants also presented an expert report from bernd franke,who examined actual radiation monitoring records and prepared a dispersion model.franke determined the amount of radiation exposure and contamination and concluded that the soil contamination exceeded epa standards.appellants also offered affidavits from some of the property owners as to financial harm caused by the contamination,including a diminution in property values,clouds on their title,and the denial of mortgages because of the contamination.
appellees argue that the record does not contain sufficient evidence that appellants suffered an actual injury as a matter of law.they do,however,concede that the eight property owners whose property is located above the plumes are potentially impacted.they also take issue with appellants expert conclusions and reports on property values,citing their own expert conflicting reports.appellees interpretation of the record is better directed to a fact finder and does not,in our view,indicate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to actual injury.
thus,appellants have satisfied their burden of showing a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issue of actual injury to their properties under kentucky law.this requires the case to go to trial on their claim of intentional trespass.in so holding,we express no opinion regarding the amount of damages to which appellants may be entitled.
nuisance claim 
as to appellants nuisance claim,they raise the issue of whether,under kentucky law,a nuisance claim based on imperceptible particles requires proof of contamination.the district court conclusion that the only way for appellants to proceed on their negligence claim is to show that appellees contamination constituted a health hazard is inconsistent with kentucky law as interpreted by the kentucky supreme court.
a nuisance is a class of wrong that arises from the unreasonable,unwarrantable,or unlawful use by a person of his own property and produces such material annoyance,inconvenience,discomfort,or hurt that the law will presume a consequent damage.city of somerset sears,quoting.nuisances.the essence of a private nuisance is an interference with the use and enjoyment of land.the ownership or rightful possession of land necessarily involves the right not only to the unimpaired condition of the property itself,but also to some reasonable comfort and convenience in its occupation.keeton,et,at.under kentucky law,
a permanent nuisance shall exist if and only if a defendant use of property causes unreasonable and substantial annoyance to the occupants of the claimant property or unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of such property,and thereby causes the fair market value of the claimant property to be materially reduced.
the measure of compensatory damages for a permanent nuisance is the reduction in the fair market value of the claimant property caused by the nuisance,but not to exceed the fair market value of the property.id.at.damages may not,however,be awarded for annoyance,discomfort,sickness,emotional distress,or similar claims for a private nuisance.id.at.
the district court adopted the reasoning of rockwell intern.wilhite,in concluding that kentucky law requires a demonstrable health hazard to recover under a nuisance theory for contamination of real property by imperceptible particles.the wilhite court held that the plaintiffs could not recover on a theory of permanent nuisance because 
w hile it is true that the presence of pcbs on land may cause a reasonable person to stop using that land because of health risks pcbs pose,it is only the case when a significantly higher concentration of pcbs is present.at the concentrations present on the lands in question,a person of ordinary health and sensitivities would experience no interference with his or her use of the property.there is no scientific basis for concluding that these lands should not be used for their ordinary agrarian purposes.any annoyance or interference sustained by the landowners here is the result of an irrational fear of pcbs.the law does not allow relief on the basis of an unsubstantiated phobia.
wilhite,at.
unlike wilhite,appellants here have not suffered a ny annoyance or interference based solely on an irrational fear of the contaminants.indeed,as discussed above,they have suffered interference with the enjoyment of their real propert
