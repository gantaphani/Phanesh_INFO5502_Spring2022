leroy johnson johnson sustained injuries while working as a seaman for cenac towing,cenac.he sued cenac in federal court for negligence under the jones act,unseaworthiness,and maintenance and cure benefits.following a bench trial,the district court denied maintenance and cure because johnson willfully concealed his preexisting physical problems from cenac,but the court awarded him damages under the jones act.cenac appeals.we must vacate and remand for further consideration of johnson possible contributory negligence,but otherwise affirm the court rulings.
background 
johnson worked as a tankerman for cenac from may to may and from may to december.before each period of employment with cenac,he filled out an employment application and underwent a physical examination.on both his and applications,he indicated that he had never suffered any injuries and that he did not have any physical conditions which might interfere with or hinder his job performance.for cenac physicals,johnson completed medical history questionnaires in which he indicated that he had never hurt his back and never received disability compensation.he did acknowledge that he had undergone surgery,but only for a shoulder injury in.
johnson answers on his applications and questionnaires were not truthful.before he applied to work for cenac,he had been twice injured while working for other offshore companies.in,johnson injured his neck and back in an accident,which left him disabled for at least ten months.he underwent neck surgery almost a year later as a result of the accident.in,johnson injured his back again in an accident and was disabled for about thirteen months.he received steroid injections to treat his back injury and experienced other ongoing urological problems as a result of the accident.after each accident,johnson obtained compensation benefits,sued his employer,and collected damages.he intentionally concealed all of these prior accidents,injuries,and claims from cenac during the hiring process.the doctor who administered johnson two physical examinations on behalf of cenac stated that had he known of johnson prior accidents,he would not have approved him for employment because of the possibility of further endangering himself in any kind of way in this case his neck and his back and to try to protect others around him.
on december,johnson injured his back again while working as a tankerman aboard a cenac vessel that was towing barges near mobile,alabama.johnson and coworker louis celestine were carrying a hose aboard one of the barges when celestine tripped and dropped his part of the load.suddenly bearing a heavier weight,johnson exclaimed that he had hurt his back.he immediately reported the accident and his injury to the crew.
for several months,johnson was treated for low back pain and urological problems.the district court found that these injuries resulted from an aggravation of johnson back condition stemming from his accident.johnson incurred in medical expenses.some of the expenses inexplicably were paid by the blue cross blue shield group health insurance plan that cenac offers to cover only employees injuries cenac pays one hundred percent of its employees insurance premiums for the plan.
johnson filed suit against cenac for negligence under the jones act,unseaworthiness under general maritime law,and maintenance and cure.cenac countered that johnson was not entitled to recover either damages or maintenance and cure because he willfully concealed his prior injuries during cenac hiring process.at a minimum,it asserted,any damages awarded to johnson should be reduced because the concealment rendered him contributorily negligent.cenac also argued that if johnson were awarded damages for past medical expenses,the company should receive a for the health insurance payments made by the blue cross plan,which it established and fully funded.
after a two day bench trial,the district court denied maintenance and cure awarded judgment as a matter of law for cenac on unseaworthiness found cenac entirely at fault for johnson injuries awarded johnson in jones act damages,including all past medical expenses and ruled that payments made by blue cross were a collateral source not subject to against johnson award.on appeal,cenac argues that the district court erred in holding that johnson intentional concealment of material medical facts did not bar his jones act negligence claim finding that johnson was not contributorily negligent for concealing his prior injuries and denying its request to deduct health insurance payments johnson received from his damage award for past medical expenses.
discussion 
mccorpen defense and the jones act 
generally,an employer must pay maintenance and cure to any seaman who becomes ill or suffers an injury while in the service of the vessel,regardless of whether either party was negligent.bertram freeport mcmoran,cir internal quotation marks omitted.an employer,however,is allowed to rely on certain legal defenses to deny a claim for maintenance and cure.brown parker drilling offshore,cir citing mccorpen cent.gulf,cir.among these,the mccorpen defense applies when an injured seaman has willfully concealed from his employer a preexisting medical condition.id.to establish a mccorpen defense,an employer must show that the seaman intentionally misrepresented or concealed medical facts the facts were material to the employer decision to hire the seaman and a connection exists between the withheld information and the injury complained of in the lawsuit.id.
in this case,the district court found that all three elements of the mccorpen defense were satisfied and accordingly denied recovery for maintenance and cure.cenac argued that its mccorpen defense should also bar johnson claim under the jones act,which holds an employer liable to a seamen for injuries resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of the employer or its employees or agents.gautreaux scurlock marine,cir en banc but the district court disagreed,stating that the existence of the mccorpen defense does not automatically taint a jones act claim.
cenac continues to urge that the mccorpen defense should extend to any damages sought by a seaman for only the aggravation of his prior and intentionally concealed medical condition.this legal argument,which we review de novo on appeal,is foreclosed by precedent.the supreme court decision in still norfolk western railway,d,makes clear that a seaman is not barred from suit under the jones act because he conceals a material fact in applying for employment.gypsum carrier,handelsman,cir still,at.at holding that a railroad can not escape liability under fela by proving that an injured employee has obtained his job by making false representations upon which the railroad rightfully relied in hiring him the district court correctly concluded that mccorpen does not bar a jones act claim.
contributory negligence and the jones act 
although the mccorpen rule is not applicable to a jones act negligence claim,contributory negligence is an affirmative defense that diminishes recovery in proportion to the seaman fault.see norfolk southern ry.sorrell,d.to establish that a seaman is contributorily negligent,an employer must prove negligence and causation.see sorrell.at see also gautreaux,at.
a seaman is negligent if he fails to act with ordinary prudence under the circumstances.see gautreaux,at.the circumstances of a seaman employment include not only his reliance on his employer to provide a safe work environment but also his own experience,training,or education.the reasonable person standard,therefore,in a jones act negligence action becomes one of the reasonable seaman in like circumstances.id.emphasis in original.the standard of causation in jones act cases is not demanding see,gautreaux,at t he supreme court has used the term slightest to describe the reduced standard of causation between the employer negligence and the employee injury in fela cases.to establish causation,an employer must show that a seaman negligence played any part,even the slightest,in producing the injury.chisholm sabine towing transp,cir citing rogers missouri pacific,d.see also sorrell.at holding that the same causation standard applies to employer negligence and employee contributory negligence in fela cases.even under the jones act,however,a party must establish more than mere but for causation.see gavagan united states,cir the negligence must be a legal cause of the injury.
the district court held that johnson was not contributorily negligent for willfully concealing his previous injuries during cenac employment application process.the court cited brown parker drilling offshore,supra,as the fifth circuit confirmation that the existence of the mccorpen defense does not automatically taint a jones act claim.the court then rejected cenac argument that if not for johnson misrepresentations,this accident would not have happened.it found that the condition of johnson back and neck did not contribute to causing the accident,and the fact that johnson sustained injuries three years before his december accident did not make him contributorily negligent.
in a bench tried admiralty case,a district court findings concerning negligence and causation are findings of fact reviewable by this court only for clear error.see gavagan,at.we entertain a strong presumption that the court findings must be sustained even though this court might have weighed the evidence differently.this said,the court decision on contributory negligence,which is fully paraphrased above,is hard to square with its recitation of facts elsewhere in the opinion.the district court found that johnson pain caused by the accident was an aggravation of a back condition stemming from his maritime accident.both injuries,as the court noted,affected his intervertebral disc.going further,in its discussion of the mccorpen defense,the court found a clear connection,a causal link,between johnson preemployment misrepresentations to cenac and his current injury.
it is likely true,as the court found,that johnson weakened back did not cause celestine to drop the hose they were both carrying.but it also seems likely that johnson would never have been employed by cenac had he revealed the previous injuries,and,having misrepresented himself onto the payroll,he set himself up for the sort of aggravating injury found by the district court.both this court and the supreme court have previously considered the contributory negligence ramifications of preemployment deception.in still,the supreme court reversed and remanded for trial after rejecting the proposition that a concealed preemployment physical defect bars fela relief as a matter of law.still,at.at.nevertheless,the court noted the relevance,in appropriate circumstances,of such a condition to ascertaining 
whether the injury complained of was caused by the railroad negligence in whole or in part by tending to show either that the worker was not injured by the railroad at all,if injured,the railroad was not responsible for the full extent of the injury,or that damages should be diminished by the jury for contributory negligence.
still,at.at.similarly,in savoie otto candies,cir,this court upheld a finding of contributory negligence on the part of a seaman who 
knowingly exposes himself to conditions of employment while aware of an illness or disability which makes those conditions unsafe to him,or where a seaman has the possibility of securing relief from unsafe conditions by informing his superiors of them,but continues to work without doing so 
see also gavagan united states,cir upholding one hundred percent contributory negligence of seaman who concealed from his prospective maritime employer the limited use of his hand due to surgery and proceeded to it while trying to open a valve on a tanker.
from these cases,it appears that contributory negligence may be found where a seaman has concealed material information about a injury or physical condition from his employer exposes his body to a risk of reinjury or aggravation of the condition and then suffers reinjury or aggravation injury.in this case,we are unsure whether the court fully analyzed the potential for contributory negligence,because of the tension between its findings of a no causal connection between johnson employment misrepresentations and the accident,and b the causal link between the misrepresentations and johnson injury.moreover,at another point in its opinion,the court observes that johnson performed heavy labor for over a year for cenac without suffering an injury.this fact may ameliorate the tension,although it seems somewhat inconsistent with the causal link finding.we do not instruct how the court should ultimately rule on whether cenac has proved johnson causative contributory negligence in deliberately exposing himself to heavy labor with a weakened back,but we must remand for the court to reevaluate its findings on this issue.
c.the collateral source rule 
the collateral source rule bars a tortfeasor from reducing the damages it owes to a plaintiff by the amount of recovery the plaintiff receives from other sources of compensation that are independent of or collateral to the tortfeasor.davis odeco,cir phillips western of north america,cir t he collateral source rule generally denies to a tortfeasor a reduction in its liability by any amounts the plaintiff receives from a source collateral to,or independent of,the tortfeasor.the district court ruled that because the blue cross health insurance plan was a collateral source,its benefits could not be deducted from his damage award.cenac argues that the district court erred.we review de novo the district court conclusion that the blue cross payments are a collateral source.davis,at.
one purpose of the collateral source rule is to ensure that tortfeasors bear the costs of their own conduct.see davis,at.properly understood,however,the rule also prevents tortfeasors from paying twice for the same result that would achieve both overdeterrence and overcompensation.id.another purpose of the collateral source rule is to protect plaintiffs who have the foresight to obtain insurance.phillips,at.see also davis,at.if tortfeasors could set off compensation available to plaintiffs through collateral sources,then plaintiffs who pay their own insurance premiums would suffer a net loss because they would derive no benefit from any premiums paid.davis,at.additionally,such plaintiffs might be left exposed to other misfortunes once their insurance coverage was depleted by the tortfeasors negligence.davis,at citing phillips,at.
in most cases,identifying whether a source of compensation is independent of a tortfeasor is not a difficult task.phillips,at.for example,insurance policies and other forms of protection purchased by a plaintiff can not reduce a damage award,because the tortfeasor has no connection with these types of benefits.id.at.but when an funds a benefit plan,like the group health insurance plan at issue here,the justifications for denying a setoff become less compelling.id.at.
generally,however,when an employee has bargained for a fringe benefit like health or life insurance as additional consideration for employment,compensation received by the employee under that fringe benefit should not be deducted from damages awarded to the employee as a result of the employer negligence.davis,at.since the employee is already contractually entitled to that benefit,allowing the employer to deduct such compensation would both undercompensate the employee and provide the employer with an undeserved windfall.id.to evaluate whether a benefit derives from a collateral source,we ordinarily assess whether that benefit is in the nature of a fringe benefit or deferred compensation or instead reflects a tortfeasor effort to indemnify itself against potential legal liability.see davis,at phillips,at.
phillips listed some factors that may assist courts in distinguishing between fringe benefits and benefits intended to respond to legal liability.those factors are whether the employee contributes to the benefit plan whether the benefit plan stems from a collective bargaining agreement whether the plan covers both and injuries whether payments under the plan correlate with the employee length of service and whether the plan contains sp
