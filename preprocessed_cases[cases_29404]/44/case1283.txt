franklin prescriptions,is a small pharmacy in philadelphia specializing in fertility medications.in,the company began marketing its niche products on the internet via an website.the website allows franklin prescriptions customers to survey available products and pricing,but does not enable the online purchase of prescription drugs.franklin prescriptions only accepts drug orders by way of mail,telephone,fax,or in person,and only then with a doctor prescription.
on october,the new york times published an article entitled,a web bazaar turns into a pharmaceutical free for all.the article addressed the risks of purchasing fertility drugs on the internet.it described unscrupulous and cloak and dagger websites that process online orders for controlled drugs without prescriptions.franklin prescriptions was not mentioned in the text,but the article contained a graphic insert with an image of the franklin prescriptions website that identified franklin prescriptions by name.the insert was placed next to a labeled safety tips for buying that warned readers to a void sites that fail or refuse to provide a united states address and phone number.although franklin prescriptions website did,in fact,list the company address and telephone number,the partial image reproduced for the article omitted this information.significantly,the published image also omitted part of the website that stated in language must have doctor prescription from a physician licensed in the united states to purchase viagra.
franklin prescriptions sued for defamation.the district court denied the new york times motion for summary judgment,finding a genuine issue of material fact on whether the newspaper published the article with reckless disregard for its falsity.the case went to trial,and the jury found the article false and defamatory.but it awarded no damages,finding franklin prescriptions suffered no actual harm caused by the publication.
before the jury was charged,franklin prescriptions submitted proposed jury instructions on presumed damages and defamation per se.neither proposed instruction was given to the jury.the parties dispute whether franklin prescriptions objected to the lack of a presumed damages instruction.franklin prescriptions submits that it did the an in camera charging conference held in chambers.the new york times disputes this contention,maintaining that the presumed damages instruction was not discussed at the chambers charging conference.in its memorandum opinion and order,the district court rejected franklin prescriptions assertion,stating that the court terminated the conference before addressing plaintiff presumed damages instruction.franklin prescriptions,v.the new york times,wl,at.whether or not an objection was raised at the charging conference,it is undisputed that franklin prescriptions never entered an objection to the lack of a presumed damages instruction.
in denying the motion for a new trial,the district court held that franklin prescriptions failed to object to the lack of a presumed damages instruction under.c,which provides that a party objecting to jury instructions must do so on the record.additionally,the district court held that under pennsylvania law franklin prescriptions was not entitled to a jury instruction on presumed damages.franklin prescriptions,wl,at.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction under.we have appellate jurisdiction under.our standard of review turns on whether franklin prescriptions properly objected to the relevant jury charge.where a party properly objects to a jury instruction under,we exercise plenary review to determine whether the instruction misstated the applicable law.cooper distrib,amana refrigeration,cir citing walden,cir.where a party fails to object properly,we may review for plain error in the instructions affecting substantial rights.d.under the discretionary plain error standard,we will reverse the trial court only where a plain error was fundamental and highly prejudicial,such that the instructions failed to provide the jury with adequate guidance and our refusal to consider the issue would result in a miscarriage of justice.ryder westinghouse,cir.
the district court held that franklin prescriptions failed to preserve its presumed damages objection under federal rule of civil procedure c,which provides that a party objecting to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.notwithstanding the plain language of rule,franklin prescriptions contends it preserved its objection by submitting a formal request for a presumed damages charge and by pressing for that instruction during the in camera charging conference.
merely proposing a jury instruction that differs from the charge given is insufficient to preserve an objection.abuan level communications,cir caruso forslund,cir advisory committee note to.many cases hold that a proper request for a jury instruction is not alone enough to preserve the right to appeal failure to give the instruction.as the advisory committee note to rule explains,challenges to the failure to give a proposed jury instruction must be renewed by objection.
nor does franklin prescriptions purported charging conference objection preserve the issue.franklin prescriptions cites to smith borough of wilkinsburg,cir,where a party submitted a proposed jury instruction and later objected to its omission at an in camera charging conference.we found the objection preserved under rule because the district court was fully apprised of the party position,and it would serve no purpose to require counsel to have formally reasserted the objection after the charge had been given to the jury.id.at.
but smith is unavailing here.the premise of smith was that the trial court was fully apprised of the party objection and nevertheless rejected it.both the parties and the district court in smith agreed there had been an objection and a definitive ruling on the issue.that is not the case here.franklin prescriptions alleged objection is disputed by the new york times.more importantly,it is flatly contradicted by the district court,which stated that franklin prescriptions recollection of the march,conference is inaccurate the court terminated the conference before addressing plaintiff presumed damages instruction.wl,at.unlike smith,there is no consensus that the district court was fully apprised of franklin prescriptions objection and no indication of a definitive trial court ruling on the matter.d b excusing a party failure to object on the record where the court made a definitive ruling on the record rejecting the request.
furthermore,prior to charging the jury,the parties here were provided with a written draft of the court proposed instructions and explicitly invited to lodge exceptions for the record.the record reveals no objection to the omission of a presumed damages instruction.franklin prescriptions entered certain objections to the charge but remained silent on the issue of presumed damages.nor did franklin prescriptions object to the relevant aspects of the special verdict form,which instructed the jury that it could not award damages absent a showing of actual harm.the verdict form,like the proposed instructions,precluded an award of presumed damages.franklin prescriptions failure to object to either the court instructions or the verdict sheet constitutes a failure to preserve its presumed damages objection.neely club med mgmt,cir en banc.
but there is a more fundamental reason to reject franklin prescriptions presumed damages plain language of federal rule of civil procedure.the foregoing chain of events,and the factual dispute the parties continue to press on appeal,i
