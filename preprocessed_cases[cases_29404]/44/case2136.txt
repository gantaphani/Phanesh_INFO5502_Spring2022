the opinion of the court issued on september,is withdrawn and the following is substituted.
diane carr carr appeals the trial court denial of her motion for new trial,following a jury verdict finding in favor of stores,on carr negligence claim.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for a new trial.
facts and procedural background 
on the morning of march,carr was shopping at a in jenna,louisiana.while walking along an aisle,she was struck on the left side of her head by two attached plastic trash containers,which had fallen from the top shelf.at the time of the accident,on an aisle immediately adjacent to the aisle where carr was struck,three employees were installing a shelf on the center piece that divides the two aisles.one week after the accident,carr sought treatment from her orthopedic surgeon,robert po po,complaining of injury to her right knee.after two months of treatment,she underwent total knee replacement surgery.
thereafter,carr brought an action against for negligence,asserting that the falling containers exacerbated her knee injury.the parties consented to a trial by jury conducted by a magistrate judge.at the conclusion of trial,the magistrate judge submitted a verdict form to the jury containing the following interrogatories 
do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant,stores,was negligent in causing the accident yes no 
if your answer is yes,proceed to question number.if your answer is no,please sign the verdict form and return to the courtroom.
do you find that stores,negligence caused injury to carr yes no 
although the members of the jury answered no to question,they nonetheless went on to answer no to question as well.when the jury returned the forms,the magistrate judge stated obviously there also an irregularity in that the jury answered question even though it should not have been answered,but that has caused no harm and is not an inconsistent verdict.neither party objected to the court determination.following the judgment in favor of,carr moved for a new trial,contending that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.in her motion,carr only challenged the jury answer to interrogatory.carr contends that she only disputed the answer to question because she interpreted the magistrate judge comment that the verdict was not inconsistent to mean that the answer to question flowed logically from the answer to question,and thus,a successful challenge to the jury verdict on question would eliminate the basis for the jury answer to question.
in his ruling on carr motion,the magistrate judge stated that t he direct and circumstantial evidence in the case was overwhelming that the employee more probably than not was shaking the shelf and caused the trash containers to fall onto carr head.thus,he concluded that the jury verdict finding that was not negligent in causing the accident was contrary to the great weight of the evidence and was erroneous.nonetheless,the magistrate judge determined that carr was not entitled to a new trial.specifically,he found that,while the jury was not required,and in fact should not have answered interrogatory,the fact that it did answer it reflects its unanimous belief as to the proper response to the question.the judge stated that i t is unnecessary to require a new trial in this case where it is obvious that the unanimous jury has considered the issues and has found the evidence as to causation lacking.
carr filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the jury response to interrogatory was compelled by its response to interrogatory.the magistrate judge denied the motion,and this appeal follows.

discussion 
negligence claim 
a merchant duty to protect customers from injury caused by falling merchandise is set forth in louisiana revised statute annotated a.the statute provides,in germane part,that 
a merchant owes a duty to persons who use his premises to exercise reasonable care to keep his aisles,passageways,and floors in a reasonably safe condition.this duty includes a reasonable effort to keep the premises free of any hazardous conditions which reasonably might give rise to damage.
stat.ann.a west.
louisiana courts have held that this duty encompasses the responsibility on the part of store employees to place the merchandise safely on the shelf in such a manner that the merchandise will not fall.mannina stores,so d,citation omitted.in order to prevail in a falling merchandise case against,carr was required to prove she did not cause the merchandise to fall another customer in the aisle at the time the accident occurred did not cause the merchandise to fall and the merchant negligence was the cause of the accident.carr must have shown that either a store employee or another customer placed the merchandise in an unsafe position on the shelf or otherwise caused the merchandise to be in such a precarious position that eventually,it fell.davis stores,so d.an unreasonably dangerous condition on premises is shown only if carr has negated the first two possibilities and demonstrated the last.id.citing smith toys r us,so d.
in smith,the plaintiff was alone in an aisle when a large toy fell from the top shelf.she sustained wrist injuries and,as a result,she brought a falling merchandise cause of action against the merchant.so d at.applying the three elements necessary to sustain a falling merchandise claim,and relying solely on the plaintiff testimony,the district court found that the plaintiff demonstrated that her injuries were caused by the negligence of the merchant,even in absence of a direct explanation as to why the merchandise fell id.at.
in its memorandum ruling,the magistrate judge found that the jury no response to interrogatory was against the weight of the evidence.specifically,he found that w hile the employee did not directly push the merchandise over onto carr the direct and circumstantial evidence in this case is overwhelming that the employee more probably than not caused the garbage cans to fall onto carr head.we agree.
applying smith to the instant case demonstrates that the jury verdict was erroneous.first,has not presented any evidence refuting carr testimony that she did not cause the accident.second,carr testified that there were no other customers in the area at the time the accident occurred.further,jesse berry berry,a employee,who was installing the shelf around the time the accident occurred,testified that when he heard the trash containers fall,he ran to the aisle where carr was struck,and did not see anyone other then carr in the area.lastly,the evidence clearly establishes that a employee caused the containers to be in such a precarious position that they ultimately fell.
during trial,berry admitted that the trash containers fell on carr.in addition,at oral argument,conceded that there is no dispute that the containers fell off the shelf and struck carr.furthermore,berry testified that,although it is was possible that the installation of the shelf caused the containers to fall,he did not recall shaking the center piece while installing the shelf.however,berry conceded that when the accident took place,he believed that the containers fell as a result of his installation of the shelf.carr trial counsel then asked berry,o ther than what you were doing,was there anything else happening that you could see or hear to that shelf that you could say,that what caused the garbage can to fall berry responded n o,sir.in addition,terry knapp,a assistant manager,who was supervising the installation on the shelf,stated that it was possible that berry shook the shelf causing the garbage containers to fall and that he did not know whether the containers were secure on the shelf at the time carr was struck.
the evidence presented at trial strongly indicates that carr has proven the elements necessary to sustain a falling merchandise cause of action.carr submitted evidence that she did not cause the containers to fall,there were no other customers in the area,and a employee caused the merchandise to be in an unstable position which resulted in it eventually falling.further,has not pointed to any concrete evidence contradicting carr assertions.thus,the magistrate judge properly found that the jury determination that was not negligent in causing the accident was against the great weight of the evidence.
ii.inconsistent jury instructions 
the seventh amendment fashions a federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions.atlantic gulf stevedores,ellerman lines,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the courts must attempt to reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis if necessary.ellis weasler eng g,cir citing gallick baltimore,d.if the answers to the interrogatories seem to conflict,the court is obligated to reconcile the answers,if possible,in order to validate the jury verdict.white grinfas,cir.when reconciling conflicts,it must be determined whether the answers may fairly be said to represent a logical and probable decision on the relevant issues as submitted.id.citation omitted.
in the instant case,the court so actively reconstructed the jury verdict so as to move beyond merely validating the jury verdict.after the jury rendered its verdict,the magistrate judge commented that obviously there an irregularity in that the jury answered question even though it should not have been answered,but has caused no harm and is not an inconsistent verdict.emphasis added.however,in ruling on carr motion for new trial,the magistrate judge remarked that the jury answered no to interrogatory apparently finding that any negligence of did not cause injury to the plaintiff.the judge explained that even though the jury finding that was not negligent was against the great weight of the evidence,the jury went on to find that any negligence of did not cause injury to the plaintiff.accordingly,the judge concluded that it was unnecessary to require a new trial in this case where it is obvious that the unanimous jury has considered the issues and has found the evidence as to causation lacking.after the court made its ruling,carr filed a motion for reconsideration.the magistrate judge denied the motion.
on appeal,carr maintains,as she did in her motion for reconsideration,that in considering her motion for new trial,the trial court adopted an interpretation of the jury verdict that created a literal inconsistency.notes that the magistrate judge constitutional mandate to create consistency requires that we look beyond the face of the interrogatories to the court instruction as well.alverez ray mcdermott,cir citation omitted.the instructions given by the magistrate judge provided,in relevant part 
plaintiff bears the burden of proving both the existence of an injury and the cause and effect relationship between the accident and the injury.you should answer this question by deciding whether plaintiff would probably not have suffered the claimed injuries in the absence of the defendant conduct.if plaintiff probably would not have suffered the claimed injuries in the absence of defendant conduct then you must conclude defendant conduct did play a part in plaintiff injury and you may proceed to the next element.
argues that these instructions made clear that the jury obligation was to determine whether carr injuries were caused by conduct that is,whether her injuries were caused by the accident.thus,maintains that it is probable that the jury response to interrogatory was not merely a reiteration of its response to interrogatory,but rather,a distinct finding that carr knee injury was not caused by the accident.therefore,it asserts that the magistrate judge properly applied the jury answer to interrogatory to give effect to the jury ultimate conclusion that did not cause carr injuries.we disagree.
although we disagree with assertion,we acknowledge the district court wide discretion in deciding whether the jury answers to the court questions are clear.richard firestone tire rubber,cir see white grinfas,cir.in accord with that discretion,there is a longstanding principle that a judge has a duty to harmonize inconsistent jury responses.see gallick baltimore ohio,d.in this case,however,the district court findings fell outside of that wide scope of discretion as defined by our circuit precedent.
in a case procedurally similar to this one,we addressed the effect that answers to interrogatories,given in violation of the court expressed instructions,have on the verdict.see white grinfas,cir.in white,the district court submitted nineteen interrogatories to the jury.id.at.the instructions following interrogatory stated i f you have answered we do not to special interrogatory,then do not answer any of the following special issues.id.at.the jury answered no to interrogatory,but nonetheless,continued to answer the remaining interrogatories.id.at.on appeal,this court held 
because all the questions subsequent to question were predicated on an affirmative response to that question,the subsequent answers had to conflict with the answer to question,regardless of whether they were also in conflict with each other.
to effectuate best the intent of the jury,we hold that if the district court has correctly found that the jury answer to a question that was supposed to terminate further inquiry is clear and disposes of the legal issues,on review we must ignore the jury necessarily conflicting answers to any other questions.the subsequent questions are by definition irrelevant in these circumstances,and can not be used to impeach the jury clear verdict.
we find that white is persuasive in the instant case.similar to the situation in white,the jury was instructed that i f its answer to interrogatory number is yes,proceed to interrogatory number.if your answer is no,please sign the verdict form and return to the courtroom.the jury answered no to interrogatory,and proceeded to answer no to interrogatory as well.noting that there was an irregularity in the verdict in that the jury answered interrogatory in violation of the instructions given,the magistrate judge,nonetheless,accepted the jury response to interrogatory as dispositive of the negligence issue,and determined that the jury additional response to interrogatory was harmless.however,in ruling on carr motion for new trial,the trial court sua sponte adopted the jury response to interrogatory and used it as a basis for denying carr motion.by concluding that the jury gave an erroneous answer to question but that the same jury gave a reasoned answer to question in violation of their charge,the judge did not effectuate the best intent of the jury,consistent with white,but rather used the unnecessary answer to impeach the foundation of carr motion for a new trial.the additional response to question was hardly harmless.
the supreme court held in gallick baltimore ohio that when the jury answers interrogatories inconsistently,the judge has a duty under the seventh amendment to harmonize or reconcile them,d.we have concluded that a district court does not abuse its discretion in reconciling
