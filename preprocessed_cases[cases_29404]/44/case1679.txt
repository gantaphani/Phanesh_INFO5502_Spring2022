rafael medina was arrested by agents of the immigration and naturalization service ins and subjected to deportation proceedings,which the ins subsequently dismissed.after exhausting his administrative remedies under the federal tort claims act,b,ftca,medina brought suit in the eastern district of virginia on the theory that the ins agents involved had arrested him without probable cause,thereby committing various torts under virginia law.the district court granted summary judgment to the government,and medina appeals.because we conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case,we vacate the summary judgment and remand with instructions that medina complaint be dismissed.
medina was a resident of virginia and a venezuelan diplomat assigned to the embassy of venezuela in washington.in september,medina former fiancee accused him of various crimes,and he was indicted in virginia for attempted rape,sexual battery,burglary,petit larceny,and simple assault and battery.over medina objections,venezuela refused to waive his diplomatic immunity and instead recalled him to venezuela.determined to defend himself against the charges,medina renounced his diplomatic status and surrendered to the jurisdiction of the circuit court for the city of alexandria.on may,medina was acquitted by a jury of all charges except the misdemeanor of simple assault and battery under virginia code,for which he was fined and ordered to pay the state costs of prosecution.in considering the charge,the jury was instructed that,under virginia law,simple assault and battery is any bodily hurt,however slight,done to another in any angry,rude or vengeful manner.
because of the unusual circumstances surrounding medina case,the washington post published an article about the verdict,noting that,although he had been acquitted of most charges,medina was convicted of misdemeanor assault of his former fiancee.j.the article also stated that t he misdemeanor conviction is unlikely to affect medina immigration status.when ins special agent stephen adaway read the newspaper article,however,he was unconvinced by the post legal conclusions.adaway decided to pursue an inquiry into whether medina had committed a crime involving moral turpitude cimt within the meaning of a a i,rendering him subject to deportation.upon examining the record of medina state court conviction,adaway concluded that medina had committed a cimt based on the nature of the relationship between medina and the victim,his fiancee,and the nature of the associated charges.after reaching this conclusion,adaway requested,through proper channels,an arrest warrant from the ins assistant district director of investigations.the assistant director reviewed and approved adaway request,issuing an ins warrant on june,for medina arrest.see a authorization for assistant director to issue arrest warrants.
adaway and other ins agents executed the warrant at medina residence in arlington,virginia,on the morning of july.medina surrendered peaceably and was detained until later that afternoon,when he posted a bond.on july,medina filed a motion to terminate the deportation proceedings on the ground that simple assault and battery was not a cimt.the ins eventually agreed with medina,and on august,it filed a nonopposition to medina motion.soon thereafter,an immigration judge granted medina motion and terminated the proceedings.
on november,medina filed an administrative claim for damages pursuant to the ftca,which the ins denied on april,thereafter,medina,on october,filed his complaint in the district court.the four bases for recovery embodied in the complaint were assault and battery false arrest malicious prosecution and infliction of emotional distress.the court,by its june,order,granted summary judgment to the government,concluding that probable cause existed to believe that plaintiff was deportable on the basis of being convicted of a crime of moral turpitude.because each of the counts in this lawsuit emanates from the assumption that adaway lacked probable cause each count fails as a matter of law.medina now appeals,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
the ftca represents a limited congressional waiver of sovereign immunity for injury or loss caused by the negligent or wrongful act of a government employee acting within the scope of his or her employment.the statute permits the united states to be held liable in tort in the same respect as a private person would be liable under the law of the place where the act occurred.b harris united states,cir.the ftca does not create new causes of action instead,it serves to convey jurisdiction when the alleged breach of duty is tortious under state law,or when the government has breached a duty under federal law that is analogous to a duty of care recognized by state law.goldstar panama united states,cir.since the ins officials alleged torts occurred in virginia,the substantive law of virginia applies.see united states neustadt,d.
before we reach the merits of medina claim,we must be assured that congress has waived sovereign immunity.medina asserts a cause of action under b.however,provides for various exceptions to the ftca.if any of those exceptions apply,we are constrained to dismiss medina though the government has not raised the as the united states is immune from suit without the consent of congress.united states bankers ins,cir quoting block north dakota,d.because the government potential immunity from suit affects our jurisdiction,we first consider whether congress has waived sovereign immunity in this instance.see presidential gardens assocs.united states,cir t he government past failure to raise the defense of sovereign immunity in no way prevents this court from considering the issue now.united states bein,cir s overeign immunity advances a jurisdictional bar which the court may raise sua sponte.suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir we believe that,because of its jurisdictional nature,a court ought to consider the issue of eleventh amendment immunity at any time,even sua sponte.
pursuant to h,certain types of intentional torts are exempted from liability under the ftca.three of medina four claims for and battery,malicious prosecution,and false implicate these exemptions.however,the h exemptions do not apply to and the government may be liable for these torts when committed by federal investigative or law enforcement officers.we are satisfied that the ins agents involved meet this definition.see caban united states,cir ins agents are investigative or law enforcement officers within the meaning of h.compare h definition of investigative or law enforcement officer with powers of ins agents.
we nevertheless conclude that all of medina claims fall within another exemption in.although the provisions of this subsection,a,have also not been raised as a defense or a jurisdictional bar by the government,a provides that the united states has not consented to liability for 
a ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation,whether or not such statute or regulation be valid,or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.
thus,pursuant to its provisions,a establishes two possible exceptions to the ftca general waiver of sovereign immunity if the ins officials exercised due care in the execution of their powers under or if the ins officials were performing a discretionary function or duty in arresting medina.because we conclude that the ins agents were carrying out such a discretionary function,we need only address and answer the second inquiry.
federal courts have struggled somewhat in deciding the types of conduct the a discretionary function exception protects and whether and how to apply the exception in cases brought under the intentional tort proviso found in h.the supreme court has provided guidance in unraveling the former mystery the latter question,on the other hand,remains unsettled.still,we tread through thi
