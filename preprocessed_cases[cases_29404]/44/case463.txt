these are in a title vii religious discrimination case.a jury found spencer press of maine liable for the harassment of its employee albert johnson on account of his religion and awarded compensatory and punitive damages,respectively and,the sum of which was reduced to the statutory cap of.b d.ann.tit,b e iv.johnson was repeatedly harassed over the course of his employment in spencer press janitorial department by his supervisor,steven halasz.
spencer press appeals from the denial of its new trial motion,arguing that the evidence did not show that the harassment was because of johnson religion and did not show that it was severe and pervasive.spencer press also challenges the punitive damages award and the jury instructions.we reject these contentions and affirm.
johnson the district court holding that he was not entitled to any back pay or front pay after he was fired from his next job,after leaving spencer press,for misconduct.he also argues that the district court erred in rejecting the contention that he was unable to get a subsequent job because he was psychologically disabled,and that spencer press is responsible for this disability because it stems from the harassment he endured while he was an employee there.
we affirm the limitation on johnson front pay and back pay,but we do so on alternative grounds.we hold that it is error to cut off,as a matter of law,the ability of a successful title vii plaintiff to receive further back pay or front pay once he is fired for misconduct from the position he takes after leaving the discriminatory employer.as a result,we reach a second issue on which johnson ultimately fails johnson was unable to work because he was totally disabled and the evidence was insufficient to support johnson claim that this disability was attributable to the harassment he endured at spencer press.we affirm.
on april,plaintiff albert johnson filed suit against his former employer,spencer press of maine,alleging that he had been discriminated against and harassed on the basis of,inter alia his religion in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and the maine human rights act.ann.tit,et.west the complaint sought all available forms of relief,including compensatory and punitive damages and front and back pay.spencer press promptly moved for summary judgment on these claims.the district court denied the motions as to johnson underlying discrimination and harassment claims and as to the availability of punitive damages,but held,as a matter of law,that johnson was not entitled to any front pay or back pay for any time after december.johnson was fired for misconduct on that date from hannaford brothers,his employer immediately after he left spencer press.
the case proceeded to trial before a jury on april,and lasted four days.the testimony presented at trial,which is recounted in the light most favorable to johnson,city of providence,cir,established the following account.
johnson received a in bible studies from valley forge christian college in and served as a pastor at the beech ridge assembly of god church from may to october.in,johnson resigned from his position at the church and found a new job at the paul dever state school for the mentally retarded,which he stayed in until july.despite leaving his official position at the church,johnson remained very active in religious activities.
in november of,johnson began working as a custodian at spencer press,a printing company.after johnson started at spencer press,he expressed to both his supervisor at the time and his a desire to have sundays off from work.although johnson had to work most sundays,his first few months at spencer press were.
stephen halasz became the supervisor of the custodial department at spencer press in may of.some time shortly thereafter,johnson expressed to halasz a desire to have sundays off,if possible.johnson had also had discussions with in which he revealed his religious beliefs.starting either in late or early,halasz began asking johnson about his religious views.halasz testified that he understood the reason that johnson did not like to work on sundays was because he wanted to go to church.halasz also testified that he was aware that johnson was religious before he found out in that johnson used to be a minister.
soon after halasz was promoted to the position of supervisor,he started making inappropriate and lewd comments to johnson.johnson recounted one incident in late in which halasz told him to help hold my dick and another incident in which halasz said johnson looked tired and told a that if al fucks like he works,then he must be slow as a nigger.halasz made multiple other inappropriate and sexually explicit comments to johnson throughout and.
at least two of these remarks specifically targeted johnson religious beliefs.at one point,halasz tried to show johnson a playboy magazine and said that he must be catholic because he got flustered whenever halasz made comments about sex.johnson said that on another occasion in,halasz proclaimed to another custodian that al does fuck,drink or smoke,he must be a catholic.halasz admitted to making derogatory remarks to johnson and teasing him for being catholic.he also said that he remembered calling johnson a catholic when he refused to look at a playboy magazine.
upset by halasz treatment of him,johnson started in to keep notes of significant events that he considered hostile or demeaning.johnson kept notes of numerous instances of harassment by halasz that occurred from until may,when johnson left spencer press.these included halasz comments that johnson should suck halasz dick,that halasz hoped a deer would run out of the woods and suck his cock,and that johnson should give his boss a blow job.halasz did not make comments like these to any of the other custodians at spencer press.one of johnson former,patrick hubbard,confirmed that halasz consistently and frequently called johnson names such as fucking queer,fucking cock sucker,and fucking lazy.hubbard testified that he never heard halasz call any other workers by these names.
a significant percentage of the derogatory comments that halasz made from to involved johnson religion.halasz called johnson a religious freak and told johnson that he was tired of his religious bullshit.according to johnson,halasz told him that because of his religious beliefs he was out basically getting pussy.on april,a day before johnson tendered his resignation to spencer press,halasz told johnson that he was getting real tired of hearing that johnson could work overtime on sundays,that he was involved in church and classes,and that halasz did like it.halasz then asked johnson if you could work overtime and make or love jesus,what would you do when johnson answered that he would love jesus,halasz screamed well,why do you take mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.
halasz derogatory remarks involving religion were also corroborated by the testimony of johnson former.karen hart,who worked with johnson as a custodian in,testified that halasz harassed johnson about his religion and called him a religious freak.hart recalled halasz telling johnson that i do want to hear about your religious bullshit and,on another occasion,that he should go work with people that are jehovah witnesses and keep your comments to yourself because i do want to hear about the religious stuff.halasz also told johnson that johnson job was more important than his church affairs.halasz made these comments,according to hart,on a daily basis while she was working at spencer press.hart testified that she was so distraught by these comments that she told halasz that he should be harassing johnson about his religion.
johnson testimony that halasz consistently harassed him about his religious beliefs was also corroborated by norma crawford,a friend of johnson.crawford testified that johnson frequently called her from work when he was upset and told her that he was being harassed at work because of his religion.on several of these occasions,according to crawford,johnson was crying when he called her.crawford testified that johnson told her about halasz comment regarding the virgin mary.
johnson also testified about several instances in which halasz threatened to kill him with a hand grenade,run him over with a car,and shoot him with a bow and arrow.at one point,halasz took a knife out of its sheath and put the point of it under johnson chin.
johnson complained to the human resources department about the treatment he was receiving from halasz about six different times over the course of his employment.each time,he was told that there was nothing that could be done and,that if he did not like the treatment he was receiving,he could leave the company.at one point,the human resources person to whom johnson complained told him that she could not pursue his complaints about halasz because if she did she would be fired.johnson also filed several requests to transfer into another division within spencer press,each of which was denied.
on april,halasz resigned his position from spencer press.he had been experiencing frequent panic attacks at work,and at one point he had needed to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance as a result of a panic attack.he also had suffered from severe depression.on may,he began another job at hannaford brothers,a supermarket chain.
johnson subsequently filed a complaint with the maine human rights commission and the equal employment opportunity commission.after johnson filed these complaints,halasz came to johnson house and threatened to beat him up if he maintained his complaints.he also told johnson that as a result of the complaints,he had been forced to take harassment classes at spencer press and that he had learned that he had discriminated against johnson on the basis of his religion.
on may,a jury returned a verdict in which it concluded that spencer press harassed johnson because of his religion or religious beliefs and that johnson was constructively discharged from spencer press because of that harassment.the jury also found that spencer press had not independently taken any specific adverse employment action against johnson on the basis of his religion.the jury awarded johnson in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.spencer press did not file a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.
spencer press did move for a new trial pursuant to fed.civ.proc,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.that motion was denied,and judgment was entered in favor of johnson on the harassment claim.pursuant to b d,the sum of compensatory and punitive damages was capped at.johnson was also awarded in back pay,which represented johnson wage loss between may,and december,the period he was employed at hannaford brothers.
spencer press appeals both the district court denial of its motion for a new trial and the underlying judgment.johnson the district court ruling limiting the availability of front and back pay.
ii.direct appeal 
denial of spencer press motion for a new trial 
we review the district court denial of spencer press motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion marrero goya of,cir.in doing so,we recognize that motions for a new trial are generally directed to the trial court discretion and th e remedy is sparingly used.dall coffin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a district court should only grant such motions if the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.ramos davis geck,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the jury found in favor of johnson on his workplace harassment claim based on religion.spencer press argues that there was no causal link to religion and that the harassment was not severe and pervasive.to prevail on a harassment claim based on a supervisor conduct,johnson needed to carry his burden that he was a member of a protected class he was subject to uninvited harassment the offending conduct was because of his religion the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect the terms and conditions of employment the offending conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive and there was a basis for employer liability.rivera aqueduct sewers,cir,at.spencer press argues that the jury conclusion in favor of johnson was against the clear weight of the evidence on both prongs and.
in advancing the claim that any harassment was not due to religion,spencer press relies heavily on rivera,in which we noted a conceptual gap between an environment that is offensive to a person of strong religious sensibilities and an environment that is offensive because of hostility to the religion guiding those sensibilities.at although spencer press admits that there may have been several isolated incidents in which the harassment manifested itself in comments implicating religion,it argues that this was not sufficient for the jury to conclude that johnson was harassed because of his religion.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a new trial.soon after halasz was promoted to custodial supervisor,he became aware that johnson was a religious person.at approximately the same time,he started making extremely inappropriate and lewd comments to johnson.at first,only some of these remarks explicitly targeted johnson religion halasz repeatedly said that johnson must be catholic because he did not want to do certain things.gradually,though,the harassment came to focus unabashedly on johnson religious views.halasz repeatedly called johnson a religious freak,told him not to talk about religious bullshit,said that because of his religion he was not getting sex,and told him to take the virgin mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.
almost all of the inappropriate comments concerning johnson religion focused on a consistent theme that johnson was too chaste and sober for halasz taste and that this was because of johnson religious beliefs.halasz did not make similarly inappropriate and offensive comments to other spencer press employees.given the consistency of the harassment that specifically invoked johnson religion and the more frequent harassment that did not,the jury could easily have concluded that the underlying the same for each.the jury also could have easily concluded that this motivation stemmed from halasz animosity towards johnson religious beliefs indeed,halasz explicitly attributed johnson chastity and sobriety to his religious convictions.as explained in rivera,conduct need not be explicitly religious to constitute harassment because of religion.at see venters city of delphi,cir religious harassment can be established through indirect comments that are not on their face about religion banco popular de puerto rico,cir alleged conduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may,in appropriate circumstances,be considered along with more overtly discriminatory conduct in assessing a title vii harassment claim.
for similar reasons,we reject spencer press argument that it was against the clear weight of the evidence for the jury to find that the harassment endured by johnson was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect a term,condition,or privilege of employment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.whether the harassment was severe or pervasive must be answered by reference to all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.marrero goya of puerto rico,cir quoting harris forklift,d.subject to some policing at the outer bounds,it is for the jury to weigh those factors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the description of facts set forth earlier provides more than ample support for the jury conclusion.halasz repeatedly and continuously insulted johnson and mocked his religious convictions.the harassment occurred throughout johnson work day,including when he was attempting to perform his custodial duties.on multiple occasions,halasz threatened johnson with violence and once he actually placed the point of a knife under johnson chin.in sum,there was more than ample evidence to support the jury conclusion that the harassment was severe and pervasive.see white dep t of,cir finding that disgusting comments and conversations that occurred everyday could support a finding that harassment was severe and pervasive.
spencer press challenge to the punitive damages award 
spencer press argues that the jury did not have sufficient evidence to award punitive damages because halasz was not acting in a managerial capacity during the course of johnson employment.kolstad am.dental ass n,d.spencer press admits that the jury rationally could have rejected its affirmative defense to an award of punitive damages that it had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur.id.at.
the availability of punitive damages is not a live issue.the jury awarded johnson in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.acting pursuant to b d and.ann.tit,b e iv,both of which cap the sum of punitive and compensatory damages for employers with over employees,the district court entered judgment for johnson for because the compensatory damages award was itself greater than the statutory cap,the award would have been the same regardless of whether the jury awarded any punitive damages.see quint staley,cir declining to address whether a compensatory damages award was excessive because the award of punitive damages exceeded the statutory cap hogan bangor aroostook,cir avoiding the issue of punitive damages because the jury award of compensatory damages was the same as the statutory cap.
spencer press challenge to the jury instructions on the severe or pervasive requirement 
spencer press argues that the district court erred in its explanation to the jury of the requirement that the harassment be severe or pervasive.spencer press preserved the objection.
the district court instructed the jury that,to succeed on his harassment claim,johnson must show 
that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment 
religiously discriminatory remarks,innuendos,ridicule,and intimidation can be sufficiently severe or pervasive in their accumulated effect to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.but offhand comments,rudeness,occasional teasing and isolated incidents are not alone sufficient.this is not a general civility code for the workplace.
spencer press argument is that this instruction was flawed because it did not include a statement that the conduct must be extreme.this argument is premised on the supreme court statement in faragher that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment.at.emphasis added.
we review the district court choice of language in instructing the jury for an abuse of discretion.gray genlyte group,cir.the district court did not abuse its discretion in omitting the word extreme from its instructions to the jury.it is the district court prerogative to craft the particular verbiage that it will use in its jury instructions.febres challenger caribbean,cir.so long as that language properly explains the controlling legal standards and is not unduly confusing or misleading,it will not be on appeal.see brown trustees of boston,cir see also webster third new international dictionary one definition of extreme is marked by great severity.there is no requirement that the word extreme be used in instructing the jury on a harassment claim.
iii.johnson regarding damages 
johnson the district court summary judgment and determinations that,as a matter of law,he is not entitled to any back pay or front pay for any period beyond december.spencer press raises no questions about johnson preservation of these issues for appeal.
the availability of back pay and front pay is not affected by the cap on compensatory and punitive damages.both federal and maine law clearly exclude awards of back pay from the statutory cap on the sum of compensatory and punitive damages.see b.ann.tit,b d.and the supreme court has recently clarified that the same rule applies to awards of front pay.pollard du pont de nemours,d.
an award of back pay compensates plaintiffs for lost wages and benefits between the time of the discharge and the trial court judgment.see lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law cane,et,ed.front pay,by contrast,is money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.pollard,at.see lindemann grossman,at.front pay thus compensates plaintiffs for lost wages that may accrue after the conclusion of the trial.both back pay and front pay are authorized by g,which provides 
if the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint,the court may order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without back pay payable by the employer,employment agency,or labor organization,as the case may be,responsible for the unlawful employment practice,or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the commission.interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.
during the back pay period,individuals have an obligation to exercise reasonable diligence in finding alternative suitable employment.see g ford motor eeoc,d an unemployed or underemployed claimant,like all other title vii claimants,is subject to the statutory duty to minimize damages set out in g carey desert island,cir.thus,awards of back pay are offset by any wages that could have been earned with reasonable diligence after the illegal discharge,regardless of whether they were actually earned.see g quinones candelario postmaster of united states,cir.failures to mitigate damages can take a variety of forms,including not looking for new employment,see,hansard metro.bottling,cir,finding new employment but voluntarily quitting,see,eeoc delight wholesale,cir,or,as in this case,finding new employment and getting discharged for misconduct,see,brady thurston motor lines,cir.
the supreme court laid out the basic standards for awarding back pay in albemarle paper moody,d.that opinion clarified that in cases of unlawful discrimination,back pay should be denied only for reasons which,if applied generally,would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.id.at.despite its equitable nature,back pay is therefore a presumptive entitlement of a plaintiff who successfully prosecutes an employment discrimination case.thurman yellow freight,cir.in this circuit,juries are generally entrusted with decisions on back pay when the jurors are already resolving issues of liability and compensatory damages see,cir.
awards of front pay,by contrast,are generally entrusted to the district judge discretion and are available in a more limited set of circumstances than back pay.see lussier runyon,cir.front pay should not be awarded unless reinstatement is impracticable or impossible.wildman lerner stores,cir.even then,awards of front pay are discretionary,in part because they necessarily involve predictions of events yet to come.see lussier,at.for these reasons,district court decisions as to front pay are generally afforded more deference than decisions as to back pay.
the district court ruled that johnson stopped mitigating his damages about seven months after he left spencer press,when he was fired on december,from his subsequent job at hannaford brothers,a major supermarket chain in maine.johnson had started that job only a few days after leaving spencer press.johnson was found eating food for which he had not paid,in violation of hannaford company rules.this failure to mitigate damages,held the district court,eliminated the availability of either back pay or front pay for any time period after december moreover,the district court found that there was insufficient evidence that the mistreatment johnson endured at spencer press was causally responsible for his being fired from hannaford.the court concluded that johnson own lay testimony to this effect did not create an issue of fact and that johnson expert was not specific enough on the link between johnson disability and his misbehavior at hannaford 
johnson does not dispute the conclusion that spencer press was not responsible for his termination from hannaford.instead,johnson basic argument is that the district court misunderstood the implications of his being fired from hannaford for the availability of both front and back pay.johnson argues that his termination from hannaford only tolled the availability of back pay until he was able to find another job,and that the district court erroneously held that the availability of back pay was permanently cut off at that point.johnson makes a similar argument as to front pay,claiming that the district court still had discretion to award front pay even after he was fired from hannaford.furthermore,johnson says that he was unable to find a job after he was fired from hannaford because he was psychologically completely disabled and spencer press is responsible for this disability.as a result,johnson argues,spencer press is liable for back pay after he was fired from hannaford because it was responsible for his inability to end the tolling period.similarly,johnson says that the district court could also have awarded front pay on this rationale.the analytical issues as to back pay and front pay are similar.
review of the legal principles used by the district court in determining the availability of back pay is de novo.reich cambridgeport air,cir.johnson appeal raises a number of difficult issues.as johnson notes,the district court final holding was that once johnson was fired from hannaford,he was no longer eligible for any back pay 
the district court was correct that once johnson was fired from hannaford for misconduct,he was no longer mitigating his damages,as was required.but that did not mean that the possibility of back pay was permanently cut off.although the district court did not explicitly endorse,or even give reasons for,such a rule,its holding necessarily relied on this supposition of law we hold that this was error.
in fact,at least two circuit courts have found that back pay awards can accrue for periods after an employee is terminated from an employer b when the job at employer b was serving to mitigate damages arising from discriminatory conduct by employer see delight wholesale,at back pay period was temporarily tolled after plaintiff voluntarily quit for personal reasons and began to run once she found a new job brady,at back pay is temporarily tolled after an employee is fired for misconduct in the course of mitigating damages from a previous illegal discharge and begins again once the employee finds another job.these holdings stem,at least in part,from the nlrb rule on the issue,first articulated in knickerbocker plastic,wl 
we further find that,as a result of such quitting,each of these claimants shall be deemed to have earned for the remainder of the period for which each is awarded back pay the hourly wage being earned at the time such quitting occurred.therefore,an offset computed on the appropriate rate per hour will be deducted as interim earnings from the gross back pay of each of these claimants.this offset shall be made applicable from the date of the unjustified quitting throughout the remainder of the back pay period for each particular claimant.
emphasis added.because title vii back pay language was expressly modeled on the analogous remedial provision of the national labor relations act nlra the principles developed under the nlra generally guide,but do not bind,courts in tailoring remedies under title vii.ford motor,at.internal citations omitted.
we hold that back pay is not permanently terminated when an employee is fired for misconduct or voluntarily quits interim employment this view comports with the purpose of the back pay remedy as articulated in albemarle.albemarle taught that back pay is a presumptive entitlement of a victim of discrimination and that the discriminating employer is responsible for all wage losses that result from its unlawful discrimination,at least until the time of judgment at.had there been no discrimination at employer a,the employee would never have come to work or have been fired from employer the discriminating employer employer a should not benefit from the windfall of not paying the salary differential when the employee is by employer further,the use of per se rules is contrary to the general principle that the necessary balancing of the equities requires a approach,cir en banc t he hallmark of equity is the ability to assess all relevant facts and circumstances and tailor appropriate relief on a case by case basis.medlock ortho biotech,cir,cert.denied,d.
ultimately,we need not craft general principles for how back pay should be calculated when an employee who has been discriminated against is fired from intervening employment.but our holding does require us to reach a second issue.here,once johnson was fired from hannaford,he never sought out employment before trial in a further attempt to mitigate damages.johnson explains that he did not seek further employment because he was unable to work as he suffered from a total psychological disability indeed,johnson received a percent connected disability rating from the veteran administration.some courts have adopted a rule that if a plaintiff is unable to mitigate damages due to a disability not caused by the discriminatory employer,that disability cuts off back pay liability lathem dep t of children youth,cir c ourts exclude periods where a plaintiff is unavailable to work,such as periods of disability,from the back pay award.starceski westinghouse,cir a s a general rule an employer who has discriminated need not reimburse the plaintiffs for salary loss attributable to the plaintiffs and unrelated to the employment discrimination.internal quotation marks omitted.here,johnson does not argue that a disability arising independently of the discriminatory employer does not cut off back pay,so we do not rule on the issue.johnson does,however,argue that there was evidence that his disability was caused by the harassment he endured at spencer press.if it was,he says,then both back pay and front pay should have been available even after he was fired from hannaford for misconduct.
johnson is correct that several courts have held that an employee who is unable to work due to a disability is not precluded from receiving back pay when the employer caused the disability.this court has,applying massachusetts law,endorsed that rule.see blockel penney,cir.we now extend that holding to title vii an employee who can not mitigate damages because of the unlawful actions of the employer can still receive back pay.see lathem,at a title vii claimant is entitled to an award of back pay where the defendant discriminatory conduct caused the disability.durham life ins.evans,cir because the employer conduct affirmatively impaired the employee ability to mitigate her damages,it would be inequitable to reduce her back pay award in this case.this rule is merely a logical corollary of the principle that the victims of discrimination should be restored,so far as possible to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.albemarle,at.if the employer unlawful conduct caused the employee inability to mitigate damages,then the employer should be liable for the resulting consequences.
nonetheless,the evidence provided by johnson does not allow him to take advantage of this rule.that evidence does no more than create an issue regarding whether the harassment at spencer press was one among numerous other independent and significant cont
