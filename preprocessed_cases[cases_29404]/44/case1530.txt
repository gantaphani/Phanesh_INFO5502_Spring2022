marion and vivian johnson appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on their claim that defendants violated various consumer protection laws when purchasing the johnsons home.the johnsons argue that the purported sale of their home actually created an equitable mortgage under virginia common law,thereby obligating defendants to comply with federal and state lending laws,namely the truth in lending act,et,and the virginia mortgage lender and broker act.because we find that the transaction was an absolute sale that did not give rise to any debt between the parties,we conclude that it did not create an equitable mortgage.we likewise find no merit in the johnsons claim of fraud.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
we view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the party.in december,marion and vivian johnson paid approximately to purchase a home in norfolk,virginia.in or,they refinanced their mortgage with novastar mortgage,novastar.in,they fell two months behind in their mortgage payments and sought to refinance again.by this time,plaintiffs claim the home had appreciated to,with the johnsons holding about in equity in the home and the remaining representing the outstanding balance on the novastar mortgage.in hopes of refinancing,and johnson contacted warren robinson,a mortgage broker and the president of d d home loans corporation,who told them it would be difficult to refinance because of their poor credit history and previous bankruptcy filings.
in may,robinson referred the johnsons to jason washington,a private investor.when washington met with the johnsons,he presented them with an offer to purchase real estate that stated that washington would purchase the home for.the couple signed this document without reading it.they then met with washington on june,for a real estate closing,at which they signed a settlement statement and a deed conveying title to washington.
to finance his purchase of the house,washington took out two mortgages from finance american,which were secured by deeds of trust on the property.of the total sales price,washington used to pay off the johnsons novastar mortgage.he gave the johnsons a check for,which was listed as the amount to seller in the settlement statement.
one week later,washington and and johnson signed a contract for deed of real property contract that gave the johnsons an option to repurchase the property within thirteen months for.this amount included an initial down payment of and a final payment of.the contract also provided that the johnsons would remain at the home in return for making monthly payments of for twelve months,with the first payment due on august.the contract provided that the johnsons would lose the option to repurchase after thirteen months,and that the contract would become a lease agreement if their monthly payments were over five days late.washington used most of the johnsons monthly payment amount to satisfy his payments on the finance american mortgages.and johnson continued to live at the property and make monthly payments to washington,but they stopped making payments in february or march.
in march,the johnsons filed a complaint against robinson,washington,and d d home loans corporation,alleging inter alia fraud,breach of contract,violations of the truth in lending act,et,and predatory lending practices under the virginia mortgage lender and broker act.they claimed that the transaction with washington,despite being clothed in the form of an absolute sale,actually gave rise to an equitable mortgage that required washington to comply with federal and state consumer protection statutes.they also alleged that robinson and washington had misled them about the nature of the transaction by making statements such as washington does not want your house and by telling them they could refinance again in twelve to thirteen months.
following discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.johnson d d home loans,wl.the court held that the transaction did not give rise to an equitable mortgage because the johnsons were never indebted to washington and t here was no penalty if they chose not to exercise their repurchase option.id.at.the court also rejected the plaintiffs fraud claims,finding that washington and robinson statements were either true or were statements of opinions and expressions of desire,not statements of fact.id.at.the district court further held that the johnsons fraud claim was precluded because they had fail ed to read any of the documents they were signing.id.this appeal followed.
the johnsons central claim is that the transaction with washington gave rise to an equitable mortgage under virginia common law,thereby obligating washington to comply with federal and state consumer protection statutes.we disagree.because there was no preexisting or contemporaneous debt between the parties,there is no basis for finding an equitable mortgage.even assuming some debt did exist,the relevant circumstances in this case do not justify invoking equity to contradict the plain terms of the transaction.
the johnsons raise claims under both the truth in lending act tila and the virginia mortgage lender and broker act mlba.the tila is a federal statute that requires clear disclosure of terms in consumer credit transactions.et.its protections apply only to loans,not to sales.similarly,the mlba governs the practices of licensed lenders and brokers,but does not apply to real estate sales.therefore,to show that defendants were required to comply with these laws,the johnsons must show that their transaction in fact created a lending relationship.
under virginia law,a deed that is absolute on its face is presumed absolute unless the party challenging the presumption can prove by clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence that it is not.in re seven springs,citing pretlow hopkins.the johnsons therefore bear the burden of showing that the transaction,which purported to transfer ownership of the house from them to washington,actually created an equitable mortgage.
in assessing whether an equitable mortgage exists,courts ask two questions.first,they ask whether the parties enjoyed a relationship,signified by the presence of a debt secured by title to the property.seven springs,at.the existence of a debt is the test.holladay willis.this debt must have existed before the transaction or be created contemporaneously with it.snavely pickle.if a court finds that a debt existed,it then asks whether circumstances warrant finding an equitable mortgage.see seven springs,at listing relevant circumstances.
the requirement of a debt between the parties is more than a formality.as the supreme court of appeals of virginia noted in holladay,a mortgage without a debt to support it is a legal solecism,and neither the intention of the parties nor their express contract can change the essential nature of things.at quoting turner kerr.this rule is especially important in the context of equitable mortgages.because such mortgages are an exception to the general rule that parole evidence is inadmissible to contradict the terms of a contract,the proof necessary to sustain them must be so convincing as to leave no doubt on the mind that a mortgage,and not an absolute conveyance,was intended.id.at.mere statements of intent can not meet this burden rather,the presence of debt between the parties is necessary to show the intent to create a mortgage and a promise to repay,tuggle berkeley.
in addition,absent some debt between the parties,the grantee washington has no personal recourse against the grantor the johnsons if the property later sells at a loss or the grantee can not otherwise recover on his investment.as the court noted in holladay,this lack of recourse clearly shows that the parties lacked a relationship.at.and because purchase and arrangements such as the johnsons are so common,allowing courts of equity to find equitable mortgages based on the testimony of one party party who later regrets the potentially convert any number of real estate sales into equitable mortgages.
the johnsons acknowledge that the court must find some debt between the parties.but the
