opinion of the court 
the rule is a policy of the federal courts that i n all cases of concurrent jurisdiction,the court which first has possession of the subject must decide it.smith mciver,wheat.this rule permits the district courts,in their discretion,to stay,transfer or dismiss cases that are duplicates of those brought previously in other federal fora.see,cedars sinai med,et,shalala,cir.today,we are asked to review the contours of this rule and the discretion of the district courts under it.
this appeal is but a facet of procedurally intricate litigation concerning the alleged misuse of the pesticide dibromochloropropane dbcp on banana farms throughout central america.litigation has been ongoing in various federal and state courts for decades.appellants more than two hundred foreign agricultural workers allege they were exposed to dbcp beginning in the and ending sometime in the.they maintain that improper exposure to this pesticide is to blame for the numerous health problems they have endured.litigation began in with the filing of a putative class against the dole food company,and other related companies in texas state court.to our knowledge,no court federal or state has ever reviewed the actual merits of appellants claims.instead,these matters have continued in various courts around the country on purely procedural questions.not surprisingly,the procedural history associated with these cases is labyrinthine.here,however,we confine our discussion to the procedural history of dbcp litigation that was recently undertaken in two states louisiana and delaware.
a.the louisiana action chaverri et dole food,inc,et.
numerous suits were filed in june of in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana against dole and others among other things,this lawsuit alleged claims sounding in negligence,strict liability,and breach of implied warranty.the suits were consolidated and dole moved for summary judgment.
on summary judgment,dole argued that the appellants claims were under louisiana statute of limitations.see.ann.west,westlaw through regular session.the district court agreed and on september,granted dole motion for summary judgment.the matter was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit on october.the appeal was actively prosecuted,with oral argument taking place on september.on september,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the louisiana district court in an unpublished,per curiam opinion.see chaverri dole food,fed.app x cir.
delaware federal litigation the subject of this dispute.
meanwhile,on june,while dole motion for summary judgment was pending in louisiana district court,the appellants filed several actions in the united states district court for the district of delaware.these delaware actions were brought against the same defendants listed in the louisiana litigation and contained the same causes of action importantly,appellants admit that the actions filed in delaware were materially identical lawsuits to those filed a year earlier in louisiana.appellants br.
dole food company filed a motion to dismiss the delaware lawsuits on june,arguing for the application of the rule.this motion was joined by dole fresh fruit company,standard fruit company,standard fruit steamship company,and amvac chemical corporation hereinafter dole appellees.the district court agreed with the dole appellees and held that the rule applied to the delaware cases.it then was faced with the discretionary decision whether to stay or dismiss the proceedings.the delaware district court dismissed the actions on august,reasoning that appellants filed in delaware notwithstanding their choice to file first in louisiana.decisions have consequences one fair bite at the apple is sufficient.app.
the day after the delaware district court dismissed dole,appellees occidental petroleum,del monte produce,dow chemical,and shell oil hereinafter occidental appellees likewise moved for dismissal based on the rule.on march,the district court granted the occidental appellees motion as well.although final judgment had been entered in the district court for louisiana,the district court reasoned that the rule still applied because the case was on appeal to the court of appeals for the fifth circuit.
while appellants appeal was pending in the court of appeals for the fifth circuit,appellee chiquita brands international,moved to dismiss,arguing a lack of personal jurisdiction.chiquita brands llc and chiquita fresh llc moved for a dismissal pursuant to.b and to dismiss based on res judicata and statute of limitations grounds the delaware district court dismissed the claims against chiquita brands international on may,finding a lack of personal jurisdiction.later,on september,the delaware district court dismissed the remaining two chiquita defendants chiquita brands,llc and chiquita fresh llc based on the rule and closed the case.
we review the district court decision to apply the rule for an abuse of discretion.of,cir this means we can not disturb the district court decision unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.hanover potato,shalala,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we see no clear error of judgment here and will affirm the district court.
a.the first filed rule 
the rule counsels deference to the suit that was filed first,when two lawsuits involving the same issues and parties are pending in separate federal district courts.of,at.we have been clear where there is federal concurrent jurisdiction over a matter,the court which first ha d possession of the subject must decide it.id.quoting crosley hazeltine,cir internal citations and quotations marks omitted.appellants concede that they filed duplicative actions in the delaware district court,stating that the delaware cases were materially identical to those they previously filed in louisiana.appellants br.therefore,the pivotal question becomes whether concurrent jurisdiction existed at the time the delaware actions were filed.we hold that it did.
claims against the appellees were filed in louisiana district court on june,and those same claims were filed against the same appellees on june,in delaware district court.therefore,concurrent jurisdiction existed on june,when the duplicative actions were filed.
the appellants place great emphasis on the fact that the louisiana cases were on appeal when the delaware district court dismissed the claims against the occidental appellees and two of the chiquita appellees.they argue that by the time the delaware district court dismissed the actions,concurrent jurisdiction no longer existed.but,as we see it,the procedural posture of the case on the date the actions were dismissed,is irrelevant to the analysis.the relevant is the filing date of the duplicative action.if concurrent jurisdiction exists at that time,and the actions are truly duplicative,the rule can be invoked.this is what we meant when we held that the court which first has possession of the subject must decide it.crosley hazeltine,cir quoting smith,at of,at.
a court obtains possession of a case through the filing of a complaint and the date of that filing,therefore,is the relevant inquiry under the rule.see,collegiate licensing american cas.of reading,cir the rule provides that when parties have instituted competing or parallel litigation in separate courts,the court initially seized of the controversy should hear the case.internal citation omitted alltrade,uniweld products,cir t he rule,which allows a district court to transfer,stay,or dismiss an action when a similar complaint has already been filed in another federal court emphasis added.analyzing a case under the rule requires a district court,in a sense,to take a of the cases at a particular moment in time the date of the filing of the second complaint.if,on the date of the filing of the complaint,the matters are duplicative,that is,materially on all fours,then a district court has the discretion to stay,transfer,or dismiss the matter.here,materially identical cases against these same appellees were pending in louisiana district court on june,the date the appellants filed duplicative lawsuits in the delaware district court.therefore,concurrent jurisdiction existed in june of.
b.the district court discretion and the dismissal of the delaware actions 
the appellants next argue that,even if the rule was applicable,the delaware district court should have stayed or transferred the delaware cases,and that dismissing them with prejudice instead was an abuse of discretion.our dissenting colleague agrees with this argument.we,however,do not because such a position is in tension with the purposes of the rule and would result in a wrongful limitation on the scope of a district court discretion to fashion an appropriate response to a action.the scope of the district court discretion is very broad in these circumstances.as we said earlier,we will not find an abuse of discretion under the rule unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.hanover potato,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the rationale underlying the rule is to encourage sound judicial administration and to promote comity among the courts in the federal system.of,at.the import of the rule is commonsensical i t is of obvious importance to all the litigants to have a single determination of their controversy,rather than several decisions which if they conflict may require separate appeals to different circuit courts of appeals.crosley,at.the delaware district court actions in this case are in line with the purposes of the rule.by dismissing these cases,the delaware district court avoid ed burdening the federal judiciary and prevent ed the judicial embarrassment of conflicting judgments.of,at citations omitted.nor did the delaware district court act woodenly,inflexibly,or mechanically in its application of the rule.id.at.instead,by dismissing these duplicative cases,the district court avoided the waste of judicial time and energy.crosley,at.
also,dismissal with prejudice is an appropriate response to the appellants own litigation strategy.three days after filing the delaware lawsuits,the appellants counsel informed the louisiana district court that the decision to file the duplicative law suits in delaware district court was strategic and that counsel recognized that the general rule is that duplicate cases in different federal judicial districts should not both proceed.app.at citations omitted.counsel then asked for the louisiana district court indulgence over the next several months,and did not move to stay or dismiss the actions pending in louisiana federal court.id.the appellants felt it was imperative to preserve and protect their claims in louisiana by filing duplicate cases in delaware,admitting to the louisiana district court that they had also filed suit in delaware because 
the louisiana supreme court is expected to conclusively determine the opt out issue later this year and before the delaware supreme court is likely to have the opportunity to squarely address the matter.if the louisiana supreme court rules that the plaintiffs cases are not prescribed,the plaintiffs would elect to proceed in louisiana because the prescription issue would have been conclusively determined.but if this court and the louisiana supreme court determine that the cases are in fact prescribed,then plaintiffs can continue to pursue the merits of their claims in delaware.
app.at.by their own acknowledgement then,appellants were forum shopping.they wanted to keep the same litigation going in two different federal fora simultaneously to see in which one they would fare better.if the louisiana supreme court ruled in their favor,then the appellants would elect to proceed in louisiana because that issue would have been settled.however,if the louisiana district court and the supreme court of louisiana ruled against them on the statute of limitations issue,they would then continue their litigation in delaware.the appellants could have asked the delaware district court to stay their claims,but they did not.just as we have held that forum shopping is a basis for departing from the rule,see of,at,it can also be a basis for enforcing the rule.here,the appellants not only filed first,but filed second as well.this duplication of litigation was of their own making and it was not an abuse of discretion for the delaware district court to dismiss their complaint with prejudice,instead of staying the matter.
we are also concerned that finding error in the delaware district court dismissal here could create a no dismissal rule for these type of cases.that is,when faced with a action,a district court would only have discretion to stay or transfer while the action is pending.such a rule,we believe,is inconsistent with our current jurisprudence,which clearly states that application of the rule be guided by principles of fundamental fairness and dictates the need for fashioning a flexible response to the issue of concurrent jurisdiction.of,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.dismissing a matter with or without prejudice is part of a flexible response.therefore,because the rule is flexible in nature,it does not proscribe the remedy of dismissal,nor does it mandate the remedy of a stay or transfer.in fact,our jurisprudence far from imposes such rules.we have instructed that a district court is merely bound to acknowledge these equitable principles but the term discretion denotes the absence of a hard and fast rule.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court acknowledged the relevant considerations of the rule,and was persuaded to dismiss the actions.the district court weighed heavily that the appellants were blatantly forum shopping and were attempting to get a second bite at the proverbial apple.we can say then,that the delaware district court calculation of fundamental fairness was guided by what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law,especially in light of the fact that the appellants attempt to evade louisiana law violates the equitable basis for the rule.id.at.
further,it is well within a district court discretion to dismiss a action because a district court has an inherent power to control its docket and dismiss a duplicative action.see in re fine paper antitrust,cir we will not interfere with a trial court control of its docket except upon the clearest showing that the procedures have resulted in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.quotation marks omitted curtis citibank,cir stating that a district court,a s part of its general power to administer its docket may stay or dismiss a suit that is duplicative of another federal court suit.and,finding that the district court abused its discretion here would require us to determine that it made a clear error in judgment,that it acted outside the scope of its discretion.hanover potato,at.to do so,we believe,would require us to retroactively limit the scope of a district court discretion when faced with a action.
while the rule does admit some exceptions,there are none present in this case that warrant a departure from the rule.see of,at surveying the proper bases for departing from the rule and noting that the letter and spirit of the rule are grounded on equitable principles.appellants bring several arguments as to why their delaware actions should be exempt from the rule,but they are all unavailing.first,appellants argue that they should be exempted from the rule because invoking it would frustrate their choice of forum.this argument is nonsensical.appellants chose to file in louisiana first.indeed,the delaware district court honored the appellant choice of forum louisiana.the appellants also argue that the rule does not apply because they filed both the louisiana and delaware themselves.it is true that most rule issues arise where a plaintiff files in one district and then the defendant in another or,for example,seeks a declaratory judgment in the second district.there is no authority,however,which holds that the rule only applies in cases where the filings are initiated by different parties.for the rule to apply,all that is necessary is for the later filed action to involve the same parties and issues that are already before another federal court.of,at citing triangle conduit cable products,cir.it does not matter that the cases were commenced by the same party,in this case,the appellants.further,the principal reason for the rule is the avoidance of duplicative litigation,so it can not matter whether the same party brought both matters is whether the second suit is duplicative of the first.
next,appellants maintain that the rule should not apply here because litigating this matter in delaware makes eminent sense.appellants br.at.perhaps there is some sense in litigating this matter in delaware,but the appellants chose not to do so,instead filing their complaint in louisiana.as we have already determined,the appellants filed a second,duplicative case in delaware to hedge their bets against an unfavorable outcome in louisiana.this is forum shopping,which never makes eminent sense.id.
finally,appellants argue that their duplicative delaware filing is a reasonable response to the appellees history of delaying tactics.a review of the record could reasonably leave one with the impression that the appellees took full advantage of any opportunity to procedurally stall delay these lawsuits over the decades.however,that is not a reason to abandon the rule.when reviewing the rule,we concern ourselves only with the two cases at issue not any other procedural issues or history of related,but irrelevant litigation.
appellee chiquita brands international and personal jurisdiction 
in a separate order,the delaware district court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over appellee chiquita brands international,and granted its motion to dismiss.we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction,eurofins pharma holdings bioalliance pharma,cir,and we review the district court decision denying the appellants request to conduct jurisdictional discovery for an abuse of discretion.id.at.we hold that the district court did not err by dismissing appellee chiquita for lack of personal jurisdiction and denying the appellants jurisdictional discovery.
two types of personal jurisdiction exist general and specific.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d.general jurisdiction is present when a plaintiff claim arises out of the defendant continuous and systematic contacts with the forum state.general jurisdiction can exist even if the cause of action is unrelated to the defendant activities in the forum state.specific jurisdiction exists when the plaintiff claim arises out of the defendant activities within the forum such that the defendant could reasonably anticipate being hauled into the state courts.yetrotex certainteed consl.fiber glass prods,cir.appellants make no argument that the district court had specific personal jurisdiction over chiquita brands.
recently,the united states supreme court reviewed the requirements to establish general jurisdiction in daimler ag bauman,d.there,the supreme court noted that when determining general jurisdiction,the appropriate consideration is whether a defendant affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum state.id.at quoting goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,d alteration in original.the supreme court pointed out that for a corporation,the place of incorporation and principal place of business are where it is at home and are,therefore,the paradig m bases for jurisdiction.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.goodyear,therefore,makes it incredibly difficult to establish general jurisdiction in a forum other than the place of incorporation or principal place of business.monkton ins.services,ritter,cir citations omitted.chiquita brands international argues that it was never at home in delaware,and we agree.the company is not incorporated in delaware and does not maintain an office there.nor,we note,does the company supervise its business from that state.indeed,as the delaware district court found,chiquita is a national company and its products are found across the country.in goodyear,the supreme court seems to reject the idea that national corporations are subject to general jurisdiction throughout the country.goodyear.at 
nothing on the record suggests that chiquita brands international is any more active in delaware than it is in other states.nor do any of its activities in moving and selling its products lead to a finding that its principal place of business is delaware.the district court,therefore,correctly dismissed this appellee for a lack of personal jurisdiction 
in the end,we simply can not say that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing this case with prejudice.a district court discretion is necessarily broad so as to handle the concerns associated with forum shopping and the rule.this discretion must include the ability to dismiss a case with prejudice,especially in a case such as this one where a party forum shopping is so clearly on display.therefore,and in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the delaware district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the appellants actions in favor of the litigation in louisiana.we also find no error in the delaware district court dismissal of appellee chiquita brands international for a lack of jurisdiction.therefore,for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the delaware district court orders.
more than two hundred plantation workers brought this suit alleging their employers and certain chemical companies knowingly exposed them to toxic pesticides over a period of many years.as a result,they say,they have injured kidneys,are infertile,and are at heightened risk of cancer.twenty years after first bringing suit,no court has heard the merits of their claims.because the louisiana court dismissed on procedural grounds,the delaware district court dismissal of the plaintiffs claims with prejudice effectively ends the plaintiffs lawsuit.the majority affirmance of that decision,the dismissal with prejudice of a duplicate claim filed in a second court,is not supported by our caselaw and is contrary to the decisions of the only other courts of appeals to have addressed the issue 
i agree with the majority opinion that the rule applied to the plaintiffs successive filing in delaware,and,as such,that the district court should have given the louisiana suit priority.but i do not agree that the rule is a basis to terminate a claim that otherwise may be prosecuted.that is not something we have ever held before it is contrary to our positions on successive litigation and concurrent litigation in other contexts and it is inappropriate in light of the supreme court command that we must adjudicate properly presented cases not heard elsewhere on the merits.as our sister circuits have done in like cases,i would vacate and remand for further proceedings 
in crosley hazeltine we adopted the rule a policy that,when two federal courts possess the same case at the same time,the action filed first has priority in university of pennsylvania,we elaborated on crosley and discussed various scenarios where,for equitable reasons,that presumption should not apply these decisions have a clear,but limited,applicability to this appeal.they mean that the district court correctly concluded that the louisiana suit should have priority.
the difficult question here,however,is not whether the rule applies.once we determine the rule applies,we must still decide whether it is permissible solely on the basis of the policy to dismiss the plaintiffs claims with prejudice rather than stay the action or dismiss it without prejudice as the majority opinion acknowledges,the claims were not heard on the merits in and,under ordinary preclusion principles,are otherwise free to proceed in delaware nor,likely,were the plaintiffs claims in delaware under delaware statute of limitations 
having concluded that the rule applied,the district court believed the possible options available to it were transfer to the eastern district of louisiana,stay,or dismissal.the majority op
