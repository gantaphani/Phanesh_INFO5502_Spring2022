opinion of the court 
this appeal arising under the false claims act involves a dollar cancer drug,avastin,which was developed by appellee genentech.relator gerasimos petratos,who was head of healthcare data analytics for genentech,filed a qui tam action soon after leaving the company.he alleged that genentech suppressed data that caused doctors to certify incorrectly that avastin was reasonable and necessary for certain medicare patients.the district court dismissed petratos suit for failure to state a claim.although we disagree with the district court grounds for dismissal,we will affirm because petratos failed to satisfy the false claims act materiality requirement.
a widely prescribed cancer drug that has accounted for billion a year in medicare reimbursements,avastin is approved by the fda to treat several types of cancer.petratos alleged that genentech concealed information about avastin health risks.specifically,he claimed the company ignored and suppressed data that would have shown that avastin side effects for certain patients were more common and severe than reported.according to petratos,such analyses would have required the company to file reports with the fda,and could have resulted in changes to avastin fda label.genentech also allegedly suppressed information regarding avastin side effects for patients with renal failure despite a request to disclose that information by a key opinion leader,a recognized industry expert who influence s peers medical practice,including but not limited to prescribing behavior.john mack,a kol by any other name,pharm.mktg.news.
petratos claimed genentech data suppression was part of a formal campaign,dubbed optimizing data value,during which the company avoided certain analyses and data sets that might yield negative results to mitigate its business risk.app.petratos asserted that he tried to bring the safety risks inherent in this strategy to the attention of upper management,but was told to stop any further work in the area,app,and had his job threatened,app.
as a consequence of genentech strategy,petratos claimed the company caused physicians to submit medicare claims that were not reasonable and necessary.in the opinion of one oncologist,if genentech had properly disclosed avastin for certain patients,the standard of care would have been to prescribe a lower dose of avastin,a lower frequency of doses,or no dose at all.app.
initially filed in,this case was heard by three judges of the united states district court for the district of new jersey.soon before his retirement,judge cavanaugh dismissed petratos initial complaint in part,but granted a stay of the order so petratos could amend his complaint.the case was reassigned to judge wigenton,who rejected genentech argument that an amendment would be futile and held that petratos sufficiently alleged causes of action under the false claims act.app.finally,the case was transferred to judge arleo,who took a different tack than judge wigenton and reasoned that medically reasonable and necessary is a determination made by the relevant agency,not individual doctors.app.because petratos theory relied on the doctors as part of the reasonable and necessary determination,judge arleo deemed the complaint fatally deficient and dismissed all claims.app.petratos filed this timely appeal.

petratos claims implicate three interlocking federal schemes the false claims act,medicare reimbursement,and fda approval.we begin by briefly outlining each scheme.
the false claims act is meant to reach all types of fraud that might result in financial loss to the government.cook cty.united states ex rel.chandler,quoting united states.a false claims act violation occurs when a person knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a a.a claim is legally false when it does not comply with a statute or regulation the compliance with which is a condition for government payment.wilkins,at 
the allegedly false claims in this case were submitted to the medicare program,which reimburses the health care costs incurred by program beneficiaries.the medicare statute provides that no payment may be made for items and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury.a a.because a claim can be false if it does not comply with statutory conditions for payment,the claims at issue here are false if avastin was not reasonable and necessary.see id.
one important factor considered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to determine whether a prescribed drug is reasonable and necessary is whether it has received fda approval.indeed,cms guidance explains that with some exceptions,a drug must have final marketing approval from the fda to be considered reasonable and necessary.medicare benefit policy manual,cms pub,ch,part a.in most instances,the drug must also be used for a medically accepted indication meaning that it has been deemed appropriate for the particular treated condition.t.an indication is medically appropriate if it has been approved by the fda or supported by research in certain authoritative compendia.see.
a false claims act violation includes four elements falsity,causation,knowledge,and materiality.universal health,united states ex rel.escobar,materiality wilkins,at falsity,causation,knowledge.the district court focused on the falsity element,concluding that the disputed claims were not false because they were reasonable and necessary as a matter of law.
the district court reached its conclusion by conflating two separate standards from the medicare statute.first,the court noted that provides that a drug is used for a medically accepted indication when it has been approved by the fda or listed in authoritative compendia.t a.it then adopted the rule from another district court case that this medically accepted standard is coterminous with the reasonable and necessary standard in a a.app.citing united states ex rel.simpson bayer,wl,at aug.consequently,the district court held that because avastin is approved by the fda and supported by compendia listings,petratos can not argue that prescriptions for avastin were not reasonable and necessary.app.citations omitted second alteration in original.the court explained that its decision aligns with the principle that reasonable and necessary is a determination made by the relevant agency,not individual doctors.app.
we disagree with the district court reading of the statute.in our view,its analysis was premised on a false choice,namely,that this dispute comes down to whether medically reasonable and necessary is assessed by doctors individually or is defined by the regulatory scheme.app.but these two options do not account for all possibilities.as petratos and the united states argue,a third possibility exists that the reasonable and necessary determination is a process involving the fda,cms,and individual doctors.indeed,cms guidance,other medicare provisions and regulations,and canons of statutory construction lead us to conclude that this is the best reading of the statute.
first,cms guidance makes clear that the reasonable and necessary determination does not end with fda approval.the claim at issue must also be reasonable and necessary for the individual patient based on accepted standards of medical practice and the medical circumstances of the individual case.medicare benefit policy manual,ch,emphases added.the manual provides examples of when a drug treatment could be approved by the fda and used for a medically accepted indication,but still not be reasonable and necessary.for example,a drug treatment is not reasonable and necessary for medicare part b if standard medical practice indicates that oral administration as opposed to injection is effective and is an accepted or preferred method of administration,or if the administration of injections exceed s the frequency or duration of injections indicated by accepted standards of medical practice.united states br.quoting medicare benefit policy manual,ch.
second,other medicare provisions and regulations underscore the critical role of the physician in medicare payment and reimbursement scheme.the regulations provide that t he physician has a major role in determining utilization of health services furnished by providers.the physician decides upon admissions,orders tests,drugs,and treatments,and determines the length of stay.a.under medicare parts a and b,it usually is a condition for medicare payment that a physician certify the necessity of the services and,in some instances,recertify the continued need for those services.id.indeed,physicians prescribing avastin often must submit cms form along with a claim for reimbursement,wherein the doctor certifies that the drug was medically necessary and personally furnished by me or my employee under my direct supervision.united states br.quoting cms form.in addition,the medicare statute contains a separate section that outlines the obligations of physicians when providing services to plan beneficiaries,including the obligation to provide services economically and only when,and to the extent,medically necessary.a.
third,principles of statutory construction show that medically accepted and reasonable and necessary are not coterminous.t he use of different words or terms within a statute demonstrates that congress intended to convey a different meaning for those words.race tires,hoosier racing tire,cir.citation omitted.and once this erroneous premise is removed from the district court decision,its analysis falters.see app.reasoning that because the reasonable and necessary standard is coterminous with the medically accepted requirement,petratos can not concede that avastin is approved by the fda and supported by compendia listings and still argue that prescriptions for avastin were not reasonable and necessary.
the cases cited by the district court do not hold that the reasonable and necessary decision is decided exclusively by federal agencies.rather,these cases show that federal agencies retain ultimate control over the decision and that government approval is a necessary component of the determination.see,united states ex rel.bodnar secretary of health human,cir.and none of the cited cases purports to eliminate the treating physician from the process.indeed,other courts of appeals have recognized that congress intends the physician to be a key figure in determining what services are needed and consequently reimbursable.goodman sullivan,cir.citing rush parham,cir.
from a practical perspective,this interpretation makes sense.cms and the fda are best positioned to make policy decisions such as issuing national coverage determinations and drug approvals.these general approvals demarcate what treatments can be considered reasonable and necessary,and are thus a necessary condition for reimbursement.meanwhile,the doctors are best suited to evaluate each patient and determine whether a treatment is reasonable and necessary for that individual patient.see medicare benefit policy manual,ch,emphasis added.for example,avastin is approved by the fda to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and such prescriptions are reimbursable by cms.but if a doctor determined that a colorectal cancer patient had five hours to live and would best be treated with palliative care,then prescribing avastin in that situation may not be reasonable and necessary.
although we disagree with the district court reasoning,we may affirm its judgment on any ground supported by the record.see,guthrie lady jane collieries,cir.our review of the record leads us to conclude that petratos can not establish materiality,which the false claims act defines as having a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the payment or receipt of money.b.
just last year in universal health services united states ex rel.escobar,the supreme court confirmed that a misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory,regulatory,or contractual requirement must be material to the government payment decision in order to be actionable under the false claims act.the court described this standard as demanding and rigorous,id.at,and explained that a material misrepresentation is one that goes to the very essence of the bargain,id at citations omitted.this requirement helps ensure that the false claims act does not become an antifraud statute or a vehicle for punishing breaches of contract.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court also provided guidance as to how the materiality requirement should be enforced.it explained that a misrepresentation is not material merely because the government designates compliance with a particular statutory,regulatory,or contractual requirement as a condition of payment or because the government would have the option to decline to pay if it knew of the defendant noncompliance.id.materiality may be found where the government consistently refuses to pay claims in the mine run of cases based on noncompliance with the particular statutory,regulatory,or contractual requirement.id.on the other hand,it is very strong evidence that a requirement is not material if the government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated.id.finally,materiality can not be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.id 
petratos allegations do not meet this high standard.as the district court noted there are no factual allegations showing that cms would not have reimbursed these claims had these alleged reporting deficiencies been cured.app.petratos does not dispute this finding,which dooms his case.simply put,a misrepresentation is not material to the government payment decision,when the relator concedes that the government would have paid the claims with full knowledge of the alleged noncompliance.see universal health,at emphasis added.similarly,we think that where a relator does not plead that knowledge of the violation could influence the government decision to pay,the misrepresentation likely does not have a natural tendency to influence payment,as required by the statute.see b.at a minimum,this would be very strong evidence that the misrepresentation was not material.universal health,at.
the supreme court guidance in universal health services also militates against a finding of materiality.the mere fact that is a condition of payment,without more,does not establish materiality.see id.in addition,petratos not only fails to plead that cms consistently refuses to pay claims like those alleged,see,but essentially concedes that cms would consistently reimburse these claims with full knowledge of the purported noncompliance.nor has he cited to a single successful claim under involving drugs prescribed for their uses or a court decision upholding such a theory.
petratos allegations are much like the sort of minor or insubstantial noncompliance that the supreme court explained should not be litigated under the false claims act.see id.petratos does not claim that genentech reporting violated any statute or regulation.he acknowledges that the fda would not have acted differently had genentech told the truth.app.and as we have explained,he does not dispute that cms would reimburse these claims even with full knowledge of the alleged reporting deficiencies.
in fact,petratos admits that he disclosed material,evidence of genentech campaign of misinformation to the fda and department of justice in and.app.since that time,the fda has not merely continued its approval of avastin for the populations that petratos claims are adversely affected by the undisclosed data,but has added three more approved indications for the drug.nor did the fda initiate proceedings to enf
