in applying for increased life insurance coverage,michael mclachlan submitted blood and urine samples to his insurer,new york life.although the results indicated elevated levels of two chemicals,phosphatase and creatinine,new york life mentioned only the former in its letter to mclachlan,explaining that it would issue a policy,but with a higher premium given the elevated phosphatase.mclachlan was later diagnosed with kidney failure.mclachlan sued new york life under general louisiana negligence law,complaining of the failure to advise him of the elevated creatinine.the district court dismissed the case,concluding that new york life neither owed a duty to disclose nor assumed such a duty.we affirm.
michael mclachlan had life insurance with new york life.after his first child was born in july,mclachlan applied for increased benefits.as part of the application,new york life required him to submit blood and urine samples so that it could determine the appropriate premium.the samples were forwarded to a laboratory contracted for by new york life.that lab reported to new york life that mclachlan had high alkaline phosphatase levels and an elevated creatinine level of 
new york life wrote to mclachlan that it had accepted his application,but at a rate due to the high alkaline phosphatase levels,which increased his risk for several diseases.mclachlan completed the application process and coverage began.he told his gastroenterologist of the alkaline phosphatase levels,which they both began to monitor.his gastroenterologist never screened for creatinine,a decision the louisiana medical review panel later concluded was not professionally inappropriate.new york life never informed mclachlan of his elevated creatinine levels.mclachlan did not request a copy of the test results and none was sent to him.
mclachlan creatinine levels continued to rise unchecked,until a subsequent test in december found a creatinine level of.doctors told the year old mclachlan that the increasingly elevated creatinine indicated irreversible kidney damage,necessitating a transplant.in pursuing a malpractice claim against his doctors,mclachlan subpoenaed the test results from new york life in and discovered the early indication of the problem.
mclachlan and his wife sued new york life in a louisiana federal district court with diversity jurisdiction over their louisiana law negligence claim.the claim is that the kidney damage could have been prevented had new york life disclosed the test results when it issued the policy,and that new york life either had a duty to disclose initially the test results for creatinine or assumed such a duty when it disclosed only his alkaline phosphatase levels.new york life filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and motion for judgment on the pleading under rule c,contending that new york life owed no relevant duty here,even given the facts of the mclachlans complaint.the district court granted the motion to dismiss.
the mclachlans appeal.we review the district court ruling de novo,taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true and affirming only if it appears that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations.
this appeal turns on whether new york life owed a relevant duty to the mclachlans we note first that the mclachlans do not rely on louisiana insurance law.and they can not,because it creates no duty to disclose in the current situation rather,the mclachlans rely on general louisiana negligence law,codified in.and.
under louisiana law,the existence of a duty,and the corollary issue whether the duty extends to protect a particular plaintiff from a particular harm,are questions of law usually determined together,in answering these questions,louisiana jurisprudence looks to moral,social,and economic factors,including whether the imposition of a duty would result in an unmanageable flow of litigation the ease of association between the plaintiff harm and defendant conduct the economic impact on society and similarly situated parties the nature of the defendant activity moral considerations,particularly victim fault precedent and the direction in which society and its institutions are evolving 
the mclachlans make two claims here that new york life had an affirmative duty to disclose the creatinine information because it was important,and that it assumed a duty to disclose that information when it disclosed the alkaline phosphatase information.we address each in turn.
although there is no recognized affirmative duty to disclose in the exact situation presented here,louisiana provides a general negligent misrepresentation cause of action where there is a legal duty to provide correct information and the defendant fails to disclose or discloses misinformation however,in such cases a legal duty to disclose exists only where there was privity of contract or a fiduciary relationship between the parties under louisiana law,the relationship does give rise to a fiduciary and there was no privity of contract between the mclachlans and new york life in one case,barrie exterminators,the louisiana supreme court imposed a duty where there was no privity or fiduciary relationship.however,in barrie a termite inspector made a faulty report for a seller of a home,and the buyers,intended users of the report,sued.here,by contrast,new york life purchased the medical tests for its own purposes,not the mclachlans.
our conclusion accords with a similar made by this court in deramus jackson national life insurance company in deramus,the insurance company rejected deramus life insurance application after its required blood test found that deramus had hiv.the insurer told him that it had rejected his claim for medical reasons,but nothing more deramus tried to learn more,but he could not.after deramus died of aids three years later,his wife sued.the district court,in concluding that the insurer had no duty to disclose under mississippi law,considered many of the factors that louisiana courts consider.it observed that insurers mitigate risk,not protect life,and that their testing is only for their own purposes.in light of that,and the fact that the insurer did promise to warn deramus of any medical risks,the court concluded that deramus should have expected the insurer to warn him.the court also noted that the insurer did set the disease in motion.turning to the economic and social consequences of its holding,the court observed that holding insurers to the same standards of disclosure as doctors would require an expertise that insurers do not have.finally,the court noted that the overwhelming majority of courts to have considered this duty have rejected it the same reasoning applies here 
the mclachlans urge that insurers like new york life routinely run medical tests for the explicit purpose of discovering abnormal results,and it would be cheap and easy to either forward the complete results to applicants or simply notify applicants of anything labeled elevated or out of the ordinary,perhaps in the same letters the insurers send with the finalized premium,and that the risk of harm is great because applicants may not otherwise discover serious ailments.we are so sure.it difficult to foresee the practical impacts of imposing a duty insurers would have to test for or would have to disclose.the risk that applicants may not otherwise discover serious ailments is not a risk created or borne by the insurer 
we recognize that a recent tenth circuit opinion,pehle farm bureau life insurance company suggests a contrary conclusion.in pehle,the insurer failed to inform pehle of his status in its letter rejecting coverage based on blood results and advising pehle that it would disclose the results if he so wished.the court,applying wyoming law,held that the insurer had a duty to disclose to the applicant information sufficient to cause a reasonable applicant to inquire further.the court stated 
by encouraging the pehles to purchase life insurance through them,farm bureau purported to act with the pehles best interests in mind.in submitting to a procedure for extraction and consenting to an examin
