cheryl beaudry appeals the district court dismissal of her lawsuit under the fair credit reporting act fcra or the act.because fcra private right of action does not require proof of actual damages as a prerequisite to the recovery of statutory damages for a willful violation of the act,we reverse.
in,cheryl beaudry sued the defendants,a group of foreign corporations who provide services.according to beaudry,the defendants failed to account for a change in the numbering used by the tennessee driver license system,leading their systems to reflect incorrectly that many tennessee consumers,including beaudry,were.claiming that this error affected her and hundreds of thousands,if not millions,of other tennesseans,class action,she sought to represent a class of affected consumers,contending that the defendants willful failure to provide accurate information entitled the class members to declaratory relief,injunctive relief,statutory damages,punitive damages,attorneys fees,costs and expenses.id.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on two grounds that her complaint failed to allege that she had been injured by a fcra violation and that the statute of limitations had run.beaudry argued that neither ground for dismissal applied,and that in the alternative the statute permitted her to obtain injunctive relief.the district court granted the motion on the ground that she had not alleged any injury and that the statute does not authorize courts to grant injunctive relief.
we give fresh review to the district court dismissal of a complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.bowman united states,cir.in deciding whether a complaint has stated a claim on which relief can be granted,we construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff,accept the allegations of the complaint as true,and determine whether plaintiff factual allegations present plausible claims.id.
the fair credit reporting act,et,places a number of restrictions on consumer reporting agencies,meaning any individual or other entity who regularly assembl es or evaluat es consumer credit information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties.id.a b,f.one of the act many requirements is that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom a credit report relates.id.b.
to ensure compliance with its mandates,the fcra contains several enforcement mechanisms the federal trade commission may bring an administrative action against violators of the act,see id.s a federal executive agencies that regulate certain types of consumer reporting as the fdic,which has jurisdiction over depository enforce the act,see id.b state attorneys general may bring enforcement actions to recover damages and to enjoin future violations,see id.c and private individuals may obtain relief against willful or negligent violators of the act,see id.n.the last enforcement private right of us here.
the statute describes the willfulness private right of action in this way 
any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under the fcra with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of 
a any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than and not more than or 
b in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose,actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or,whichever is greater 
such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow and 
in the case of a successful action to enforce any liability under this section,the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.
id.a.the negligence action is worded similarly it provides that a ny person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under the fcra with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer.id.unlike a willfulness claimant,however,the statute permits a negligence claimant to recover only actual damages,costs and attorney fees.id.
the district court,beaudry claims,erred in dismissing her lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to allege that the fcra violation injured her.we agree.
beaudry,to start,alleged that the defendants violated b with respect to her,just as the statute requires.id.a.whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report,the provision says,it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.id.b.according to beaudry complaint,she has presented checks to businesses utilizing defendants check verification services,compl,and each time a transaction is processed by defendants,a new consumer report is generated,id.since tennessee changed the numbering system for its driver licenses in,those reports systematically have been based on inaccurate information because the new license numbers make consumers,including beaudry,appear as a check writer within the defendants systems.id.all that the defendants need to do to correct the problem,she claims,is to associate the old driver license number with the new driver license number.id.beaudry thus claims to have suffered the precise injury that the statute proscribes the defendants prepare d a consumer report about her but failed to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information it contained.b.
the defendants,however,insist that the statute requires something beaudry allege a different form of injury consequential damages.plaintiff,they note,has not had a check rejected or any other transaction terminated as a result of a telecheck recommendation nor has she suffered any harm with respect to the availability of credit.br.at.but the act imposes no such hurdle on willfulness claimants.the act does not require a consumer to wait for unreasonable credit reporting procedures to result in the denial of credit or other consequential harm before enforcing her statutory rights.it requires regulated companies to use reasonable procedures when prepar ing a consumer report with respect to a given consumer,and creates a cause of action in favor of the consumer when they do not.b,a.
section,which creates the cause of action for willful violations,also does not impose the requirement that defendants wish to add to the statute.any consumer,it says,may sue to recover any actual damages or damages of not less than and not more than from a ny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under the fcra with respect to that consumer.a a emphasis added.because actual damages represent an alternative form of relief and because the statute permits a recovery when there are no identifiable or measurable actual damages,this subsection implies that a claimant need not suffer or allege consequential damages to file a claim.a comparison with buttresses the point congress excluded the option in negligence cases.where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
case law in this and related areas backs up this interpretation.in murray gmac mortg,cir,the seventh circuit addressed the act prohibition on accessing a consumer credit score without her consent and the narrow exception created for lenders who are making a firm offer of credit to the consumer.see c b i.the court explained that issues did not preclude class certification because the class representative could seek statutory damages without proof of injury in lieu of actual damages.murray,at.other courts have reached the same conclusion when considering statutory damages suits premised on violations of other provisions of the act.see ashby farmers ins.of,no.cv,wl,at,holding that no actual harm need be proved in an action under a because congress has stated
