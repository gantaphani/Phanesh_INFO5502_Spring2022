this is a case.a jury returned a verdict for paloma rodríguez against señor frog de la isla,señor frog,for short in puerto rico federal district court.señor frog now appeals,challenging nearly every aspect of the district judge performance.unable to find any reversible error in the judge actions,we affirm.
how it all 
san juan,puerto rico,early in the morning of december.cruising in her mazda on the muñoz rivera expressway,year old rodríguez hit a collision that cost her two tires and killed the engine.but the worst was yet to come.
turning her hazards on,rodríguez somehow got her car to the side of the road,completely out of the way of oncoming traffic.a police officer patrolling that stretch of highway spotted her and pulled over.he left the cruiser flashing lights on.a driver also showed up,parked his truck in front of rodríguez car,activated the truck flashing lights,pointed a spotlight on the work area,and put out cones to caution drivers passing by.as the truck driver lowered the truck platform,rodríguez got back into the mazda either to grab some personal items or to do something to help out with the towing process.
that is when carlos estrada closed in,speeding in a mitsubishi mirage registered to señor frog.his headlights were off.he had a level nearly double the legal limit in puerto rico.and he smashed that mitsubishi right into the rear of rodríguez mazda.rodríguez was hurt,and apparently hurt badly.she was thrown inside the vehicle,the officer later said.covered in blood,she had no vital signs she appeared to be dead.but she survived and sued señor frog in district court under diversity jurisdiction,see,alleging negligence and negligent entrustment.she sued other defendants too including estrada,but they were later dismissed for reasons that are not important here,so we skip them.
the twists and turns of trial 
we to the trial,where counsel pulled out all the stops.for starters,rodríguez lawyer moved in limine to prevent señor frog from showing or arguing that estrada had owned the mitsubishi or that rodríguez had drunk a beer or two hours before the crash.the judge granted the motion.
also,rodríguez counsel told the jurors during his opening statement that the evidence would compel them to return a verdict in his client favor.señor frog lawyer asked for a mistrial but instead got a cautionary instruction telling jurors that they not the lawyers would decide the damage amount due rodríguez if any.
the attorneys later sparred over whether the parties were of diverse citizenship,and the judge ruled that they were,following an evidentiary hearing convened after rodríguez had rested her case.they also battled over the jury instructions.and the judge seemingly sided with rodríguez when she apparently refused to instruct the jurors on contributory or comparative negligence.we hedge with seemingly and apparently because señor frog failed to give us a transcript of the judge final charge a misstep that affects our analysis in several respects,as we discuss later in more detail.
the fighting spilled over into closing arguments too.rodríguez counsel said that his client sought damages for lost wages,which he conceded were not much,given that she was a college when injured.but she also sought compensation for pain and suffering,which he put at six figures.señor frog lawyer objected,and the judge sustained the objection.but she declined to tell the jury right then and there to disregard the value comment.i will instruct the jury at the end,she said,though we do not know if she did because,again,the record on appeal contains no transcript of the final charge.rodríguez attorney then mentioned a process that the jury could use to fix damages her pain was worth a day,he said,and she should live more years,so she should get over.the judge sustained an objection to this statement,adding that the jury will be able to evaluate what compensation,if any,rodríguez is due.sparks flew too when rodríguez lawyer said that his client had found herself under attack at trial objection sustained and that estrada had been deported to mexico as part of a plea agreement in a criminal case arising from the crash objection overruled.
finding señor frog liable,the jury awarded rodríguez.the verdict does not distinguish between the types of damages.but the parties who agree on little else concur that the bulk of this represented pain and suffering.
in any event,señor frog timely moved for a new trial or remittitur.the portion of its motion blasted rodríguez lawyer for his comments during opening or closing statements that suggested a specific damage number,accused the defense of attacking his client,and noted that authorities had shipped estrada back to mexico pursuant to a plea agreement.the remittitur section called the jury award grossly excessive.ultimately,the judge denied the motion in an unexplained order.
having set the stage,we turn to the legal issues on appeal,noting further facts as needed.
the diverse citizenship issue 
the statute empowers federal courts to hear and decide suits between citizens of different states,provided the amount in controversy is more than.see a.puerto rico is a state for purposes.see id.e.and señor frog is a citizen of puerto rico,see id.c,so rodríguez suit is untenable if she was a puerto rico citizen when she filed her december,complaint,see,hall curran,cir per curiam.señor frog argues that she was,though it did not press this argument until after rodríguez had rested her case.generally valentin hospital bella vista,f d,cir calling a motion to dismiss under.b the proper vehicle for challenging a court jurisdiction.but after an evidentiary hearing,the judge deemed rodríguez a citizen of california when she sued,and this conclusion survives review.see,e,padilla mangual pavía,cir noting that a district judge determination in this area is a mixed question of law and fact,which we review under the clearly erroneous rubric internal quotation marks omitted cantellops alvaro chapel,cir similar.
citizenship for diversity purposes is domicile,and domicile is the place where one is present and intends to stay.see,padilla mangual,at explaining that a person domicile is the place where he has his true,fixed home and principal establishment,and to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning quoting rodríguez díaz sierra martínez,cir internal quotation marks omitted garcía pérez santaella,cir similar see also hawes club ecuestre el comandante,cir adding that we require no minimum period of residency.as the party invoking diversity jurisdiction,rodríguez had to prove domicile by a preponderance of the evidence,see,padilla mangual,at garcía pérez,at and she did just that,presenting enough evidence to show that she was a domiciliary and thus a citizen of california.
rodríguez was the only witness at the hearing on the diversity issue señor frog called no one.rodríguez testified that she had moved from puerto rico to california in september,roughly three months before she filed this suit.she was pregnant,and she and her boyfriend adrian peralta wanted to start their lives together in the golden state.since they had very little money,the couple lived in a san francisco bay area home owned by peralta grandmother.and by the time she sued señor frog,she had fully relocated from puerto rico to california she was physically present in california with her clothes,books,furniture,household items,had opened up a california bank account she had no money in any puerto rico banks,had gotten a california driver license and job,and had hired a california lawyer to fight on her behalf.and though she had not registered to vote in california actually,she was not registered to vote anywhere and did not attend church there,she had settled on living in the golden state permanently.bank one,texas,montle,cir holding that factors that can help an inquiring court determine a party intent include where the party exercises civil and political rights,pays taxes,has real and personal property,has a driver or other license,has bank accounts,has a job or owns a business,attends church,and has club memberships for simplicity we call these the bank one factors.
events cast no doubt on the earnestness of rodríguez intent either.see generally garcía pérez,at holding that,even though they are not part of the primary calculus,happenings may bear on the sincerity of a professed intention to remain.rodríguez told the judge that she gave birth to a baby boy in california,turned to a california pediatrician to treat him,and put him in a california daycare for a spell.she also enrolled in three california community college courses and got a cell phone with a california area code she may have acquired the cell phone,but we can not tell for certain.true,starting in,rodríguez spent several semesters at the interamerican university in puerto rico she could get her bachelor degree faster if she studied there,she said,and she was still taking classes there at the time of trial.but she made clear that she returned to california whenever school was not in session during winter,spring,and summer breaks,for example,and she provided copies of plane tickets to prove that point.she also reaffirmed that she intended to live in california for the rest of her life she hoped to land a teaching job there once she got her degree.
having the exclusive ability to assess rodríguez demeanor and tone,the district judge was best positioned to separate true from false testimony.see,padilla mangual,at.the judge found rodríguez credible,and after carefully canvassing the testimony,she meticulously detailed findings of fact,which she supported with specific references to the evidence.because we can not say that these findings were clearly erroneous,her ruling that there was diverse citizenship must stand.
undaunted,señor frog insists that the district judge botched her ruling in several respects.for openers,señor frog protests that rodríguez did not have enough bank one factors on her side,given that she had not registered to vote in california and had no religious affiliation there.also,rodríguez produced no documentary evidence no bank statements,driving records,college transcripts,to support key claims,and,given the rule,see,the judge had no business accepting her comments about her intent to stay in california indefinitely.searching for a gotcha moment,señor frog notes too that rodríguez said at trial that she lived in mayaguez,puerto rico,all my life testimony it says should have caused the judge to dismiss the case for lack of diversity jurisdiction straightaway,without bothering with an evidentiary hearing.
we can not buy into these arguments.for one thing,a party need not check off every bank one factor to satisfy her burden,see,padilla mangual,at,and,in any event,rodríguez checked off more than enough of them the california bank account,driver license,job,and location sync up nicely with key bank one factors.
for another thing,the district judge did not blindly accept rodríguez statement that she intended to make california her home.rather,the judge sifted the testimony and grounded her ruling in facts that confirmed rodríguez intent claim.and señor frog theory changes nothing.with exceptions not relevant here,the rule requires a party trying to prove the content of a written document to introduce the document itself.see.think of a will contest where the will is not in evidence and a witness tries to discuss the document words from memory that is the sort of situation that the rule was designed to address.see generally united states diaz lopez,cir quoting leading treatises on the subject.but that is not our case.rodríguez never tried to give the exact terms of her california bank account,driver license,or college transcripts.she simply tried to prove,through her own direct testimony,certain facts that she had direct knowledge of that she had opened a california bank account,acquired a california license,and taken several california courses.consequently,this case falls outside the compass of the rule.see r r,visual scene,cir commenting that n o evidentiary rule prohibits a witness from testifying to a fact simply because the fact can be supported by written documentation see also simas first citizens fed.credit union,cir united states grossman,cir.
last but not least,rodríguez trial testimony in no way her claim.consider the context.thrilled beyond words that his daughter had survived the collision,rodríguez father hosted a christmas day party at his mayaguez home in roughly three weeks after estrada had rodríguez and one year before she filed this action.rodríguez was deeply depressed,he said,and he thought a small soirée with family and friends might lift her spirits.at trial,rodríguez counsel asked her whether any had come from san juan we are not sure why this mattered.no,she replied,i lived in mayaguez all my life,so most of my friends are from mayaguez.señor frog makes much of this language,suggesting that it proved her claim was a,the argument goes,the judge should have kicked her case to the curb without further ado.we think not.again,diversity of citizenship is determined as of the time of suit.see,bank one,at.and,fairly read,rodríguez testimony went to her living situation,which means that her statement could not and did not sabotage diversity jurisdiction.
that ends this phase of the case.standing by what we said moments ago that we can not call the judge conclusion clearly wrong we move,finally,to the other issues before us.
the evidentiary issues 
señor frog criticizes the judge in limine ruling barring evidence that estrada had owned the mitsubishi and that rodríguez had downed a couple of beers hours before the crash.we are unpersuaded.
we need not delve too deeply into the issue because,just before rodríguez rested,señor frog stipulated that it owned the mitsubishi mirage at the time of the collision.and the judge read the stipulation to the jury.fact stipulations like this speed up the trial process by eliminating the need for proving essentially uncontested facts,which helps preserve precious judicial resources.caban hernandez philip morris usa,cir quoting gomez rivera rodriguez,cir.so,obviously,stipulations of this sort are valued by litigants and judges alike,and once they bind the parties,the trial court,and the appellate court too.see,hackfeld united states,united states ex rel.miller bill harbert int l,am.title ins.lacelaw,cir fisher first stamford bank and trust,cir.consistent with these principles,señor frog stipulation undercuts the line of reasoning that it seeks to pursue here in other words,having freely stipulated to a key fact,señor frog must now live with the consequences.see generally miller,at explaining that one party to a stipulation need offer no evidence to prove it and the other is not allowed to disprove it internal quotation marks omitted.
nor is señor frog argument about the beer evidence particularly promising.as we see things,its proffer reduced to this from rodríguez drinking a beer or two hours before the collision,a jury could infer that a she drove impaired,which b caused her to hit a pothole that blew out her tires she would not have hit it otherwise,apparently and required her to pull over,which c put her in line to be by estrada as she sat in a parked car along the shoulder of the road,which,ultimately,d put her partly at fault for her injuries.señor frog proffered evidence did not show that rodríguez had been impaired,her lawyer argued,or that she had any role in estrada slamming into her while she was parked by the side of the road,totally out of the travel lane.the evidence,he added,had one purpose to convince the jury that she was a bad person for having a beer or two.
the judge agreed with rodríguez lawyer.rodríguez was not driving when estrada smash ed into her she was simply sitting there in the front seat of her parked car as the driver worked on getting her auto towed.rodríguez supposed beer drinking had no causal role,the judge ruled,so a bsent any other evidence to establish the alleged facts,the proffered evidence was excludable as more prejudicial than probative.see.
before taking up this issue we must iron out a wrinkle concerning our standard of review.if an in limine ruling excludes evidence unconditionally,the party need take no additional steps to preserve the issue for appeal,which means review will control.see,crowe bolduc,cir.but if the ruling is merely tentative and clear ly invit es the party to offer the evidence at trial under the ruling terms,that party must follow up on the invitation or else review will hold sway.see id.adding that counsel must clarify whether the in limine ruling was final or not if there is any doubt.the judge ruling here excluding the beer evidence unless circumstances at trial changed so that señor frog had to offer it again was final enough,see id.at,which makes abuse of discretion the proper test.
rule says that district judges may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by other considerations,including unfair prejudice.because they are on the front lines,district judges are better positioned than we to strike this balance,so they get a special degree of deference only in extreme circumstances will we reverse their judgment calls.see,united states tierney,cir.having thoroughly considered this matter,we see no reason to the judge ruling here.we explain briefly.
sitting as a diversity court,we must apply the substantive law of puerto rico.see,borges ex rel.serrano isern,cir citing,among other cases,erie tompkins.tort liability under puerto rico law requires both fault,marshall perez arzuaga,cir quoting jimenez pelegrina,and the requisite causal connection between the wrongdoing and the damages sustained,which is just another way of saying proximate cause,see vázquez filippetti banco popular de puerto rico,cir.the concept limits a party liability for hazards flowing from its negligence to those hazards that could be anticipated by a prudent person.marshall,at quoting pacheco puerto rico water res,offic.trans,quoting hernandez v.the capital.foreseeability holds the key a person is liable if the consequences of her wrongdoing were immediate and foreseeable,not if they were more remote and unlikely.see,irvine murad skin research,cir applying puerto rico law malave felix volvo car,cir applying puerto rico law.
clearly,then,speculation or conjecture will not cut it when it comes to proximate cause.see,malave felix,at citing widow of delgado boston insur,and saez municipality.and this is where señor frog falters the proffered evidence which we painstakingly portrayed five paragraphs ago depends on a chain of inferences far too strained and uncertain to have much probative worth,and certainly not enough to counterbalance its high potential for unfair prejudice.consequently,we can not conclude that the judge decision was so off the mark as to be an abuse of discretion.see generally lussier runyon,cir noting that,i n general,the abuse of discretion framework is not dopp pritzker,cir stressing that most appellants who consider themselves aggrieved by discretionary decisions of the district court are destined to leave this court.
the instruction issue 
señor frog criticizes the judge for refusing to give a instruction.we review that issue de novo if properly preserved,see,gray genlyte group,cir,reversing only if the rejected instruction was substantively correct,essential to an important issue in the case,and not substantially covered in the charge given,see,seahorse marine supplies,sun oil,cir.at the conference señor frog lawyer objected with reasons when the judge said that she would not give either instruction,which means that counsel did enough to preserve the point for appellate review.see.c d booker.dep t of pub.health,cir.but regardless,señor frog arguments have no traction.
puerto rico is a jurisdiction,see laws ann.tit,hence,a charge had no place here.on top of that,we can not tell whether the judge carried through her intention not to offer either instruction and that is because señor frog failed to give us a transcript of the instructions as read to the jury.the transcript it has provided ends with this at which time the jury instruction sic were given.parties pursuing appellate review must supply us with enough raw material so that we can do our job.see,campos orrego rivera,cir moore murphy,cir.because señor frog did not meet that most basic requirement,it can not prevail on this issue.see,campos orrego,at moore,at.
we hasten to add that even if it had given us a transcript that left no doubt about what the judge actually said in her final charge,señor frog would still lose.señor frog thesis is simple had the judge not wrongly granted rodríguez in limine motion on the beer issue,the record evidence would have obliged her to deliver the requested instruction.having already concluded that the judge did not gaffe the in limine ruling,we easily reject this thesis after all,a trial judge can not give an instruction if there is no evidence in the record to support it,see,kelliher transp.serv,cir sexton gulf oil,and that is the case here.
the new trial issue 
señor frog tells us that the judge also stumbled in denying its motion district judges,of course,do not have carte blanche to ignore the considered verdict of a properly instructed jury simply because they might have reached a different result in a bench trial,quinones pacheco am.airlines,cir emphasis added the underscored phrase is critical for reasons that we get to shortly.rather,judges may grant a new trial only if the verdict is against the law,against the weight of the credible evidence,or tantamount to a miscarriage of justice.crowe marchand,cir discussing.a and quoting casillas díaz palau,cir.and we review the denial of a motion under the standard.see,id.
señor frog attacks the judge order on three primary fronts.first,it argues that rodríguez counsel mention of either a lump sum or formula for computing damages during opening and closing statements constituted reversible error.we have outlawed both practices in this circuit see bielunas,at.but that gets señor frog only so far.to succeed,señor frog must also show that the error was harmful,that the error affected its substantial rights,which in turn depends on whether the error substantially swayed the jury verdict.see nieves villanueva soto rivera,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also seahorse marine supplies,at.certainly the fact that the jury gave rodríguez exactly what her lawyer asked for suggests prejudice.but that does not tell us all we need to know.the key here lies in the jury instructions.did the judge tell the jury to disregard the lawyer suggested numbers as she had promised if yes,were her words strong enough to draw all the sting from counsel comments see bielunas,at noting that such an instruction might be a sufficient salve in certain situations río mar,lp,se uhs of,cir noting the presumption that jurors follow the district judge clear instructions.also,what did the judge tell the jury about damages under puerto rico law and viewing the record through that legal lens,was the evidence so overwhelming that counsel remarks mattered not in the grand scheme of things we can answer none of these questions,however,because señor frog has not presented us with a transcript of the judge final charge,which means señor frog loses this aspect of its bid.see,campos orrego,at moore,at.
next,señor frog says that rodríguez counsel comment that his client had come under attack in court requires a new trial.not so.assuming purely for argument sake that counsel statement crossed a line which we in no way intimate,señor frog has not shown any prejudice.see,gonzalez marin equitable life assurance soc y,cir noting that district judges have considerable discretion when it comes to policing lawyers comments,stressing that w e will reverse only upon a showing of prejudice.counsel attack comment was a small and unrepeated part of a fairly lengthy summation.and the judge sustained señor frog objection right away.the judge probably also instructed the jury in the end that counsels statements in closing argument are not evidence,an instruction that can often lessen any potential harm.see,bielunas,f d at.but we can not our hunch against the transcript because señor frog did not give us what we need
