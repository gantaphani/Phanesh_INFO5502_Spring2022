this louisiana diversity case arises out of a merger gone sour.al copeland owned the controlling interest in companies that sought to acquire a chain of restaurants and retained wasserstein,perella,wasserstein to provide financial advice regarding the deal.after the corporation that resulted from the merger was forced into bankruptcy by creditors,copeland sued his investment banker,settled that lawsuit,and then sued wasserstein and one of its executive employees,charles ward.copeland appeals from the district court dismissal of his claims against wasserstein and ward,and they from the district court denial of their motion for sanctions.we affirm the district court dismissal of copeland claims we reverse the court denial of wasserstein and ward motion for sanctions and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
in june of,a corporation controlled by copeland,copeland enterprises,old ace,and its acquisition subsidiary,biscuit investments,biscuit,signed an engagement letter with wasserstein,a new york investment bank boutique.this agreement committed wasserstein to serve as the exclusive financial adviser to old ace and biscuit in connection with their prospective acquisition of church fried chicken cfc.acting chiefly through ward,its vice chairman,wasserstein devised a merger financing plan that contemplated finding an unsecured,subordinated lender that would commit to provide biscuit a bridge loan and underwrite or junk bonds to capitalize the merged corporation.as wasserstein lacked underwriting capacity,biscuit solicited proposals for the unsecured financing,eventually choosing merrill lynch merrill as the subordinated lender.merrill lent biscuit million to fund its tender offer for cfc.this loan was conditioned on copeland contributing specified recipe royalties and the franchising arm of old ace to biscuit.copeland testified in the instant litigation that this condition was agreed to and complied with in reliance on advice from wasserstein and ward.
the tender offer closed on march.biscuit acquired of cfc shares and paid wasserstein the balance of the fees owed under the engagement letter.
the terms of the bridge loan,which was by then in place,gave merrill the right to designate two individuals to serve on biscuit board of directors.six days after the closing of the tender offer,merrill copeland elected as ward and raymond minella,the lead merrill executive handling the merger.ward agreed to serve only after minella orally promised that merrill would indemnify ward for claims arising out of his service on biscuit board of directors.these two continued to serve on that board until september,when biscuit merged into cfc,which thereupon changed its name to al copeland enterprises,new ace.copeland was the ceo and chairman of new ace and owned all of its common stock.again on merrill designation,copeland elected minella and ward to serve as directors of new ace.ward served until january,when he resigned after learning that merrill would not indemnify him after all.
flash back to biscuit received a letter from merrill stating that merrill was highly confident that it could sell up to million worth of junk bonds to capitalize new ace however,merrill never took the bond issue to market.this lack of financing prompted new ace creditors,including merrill itself as the bridge lender,to put new ace into involuntary bankruptcy in.
the following year,copeland personally sued merrill,alleging negligence and breaches of contractual and fiduciary duties,and claiming damages resulting from the salary he lost,the royalties he had foregone,and the assets he had contributed to biscuit.merrill and copeland finally settled that litigation in merrill agreed to pay copeland a substantial sum of money copeland agreed to release all claims against merrill lynch,its past,present,and future officers,directors,employees,agents and representatives emphasis ours.
after settling with merrill,copeland filed the instant action against wasserstein and ward in louisiana state court.copeland alleged that wasserstein,as a financial adviser to the corporations,and ward,as a director of biscuit and its successor,new ace,had breached duties they owed to copeland individually,had failed to disclose material information to him,and had caused him to rely detrimentally on their negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations.the gist of copeland allegations was that wasserstein and ward knew or should have failed to disclose to,among other things,the merger and financing plans were unworkable or unsound,the merrill deal team had no experience,and the market had ceased to exist before biscuit acquisition of cfc closed.
both wasserstein and ward removed copeland suit to the eastern district of louisiana on diversity grounds and subsequently filed motions to dismiss pursuant to rule b.the district court granted wasserstein motion,holding that it owed no fiduciary duty to copeland personally and,alternatively,that his claims,which the court categorized as sounding in tort rather than in contract,had prescribed.the court denied ward dismissal motion,however,concluding that copeland had pled a claim that could support a claim and a claim that could support a nonderivative cause of action.
in,ward filed a summary judgment motion grounded in,inter alia,release,prescription,lack of standing,and absence of causation.in due course,the district court granted ward motion and dismissed copeland claims against him,stating that it primarily rel ied upon the threshold issue,and that is the effect of that settlement agreement between copeland and merrill lynch,in which copeland had released,among others,merrill representatives.in addition to dismissing all claims against both wasserstein and ward,the court awarded them costs.
ward and wasserstein had filed a motion for sanctions against copeland and his counsel on the theory that they knew when the case was filed that it was and otherwise meritless.after analyzing the motion from the bench,but discussing only the release issue in any detail,the trial court orally denied wasserstein and ward motion for sanctions.
after final judgment issued,copeland timely appealed the district court grants of wasserstein b motion and ward motion,as well as the award of costs.wasserstein and ward timely the court denial of their motion for sanctions.
analysisa.standards of review 
we examine a district court grants of 
both a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.in the former,the central issue is whether,in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the complaint states a valid claim for relief.in the latter,we go beyond the pleadings to determine whether there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
by contrast,we review the denial of sanctions and the allocation of costs for abuse of discretion 
fiduciary duty of wasserstein 
copeland appeals the district court dismissal of his claim that wasserstein breached a fiduciary duty.in the district court,the parties disputed whether an investment bank acting as a financial adviser owes a corporate client any fiduciary duty whether,if such a duty is owed,a controlling shareholder can maintain a cause of action for breach of such a duty to the corporation and whether a claim for the breach of such a duty prescribes in one year or in ten.the first two issues present novel questions of louisiana law,but we have often distinguished tort claims from contract claims for purposes of prescription.thus,the third louisiana law that is settled,invoking a line of cases that resolves this claim in wasserstein favor.as we conclude that copeland claims against wasserstein have prescribed,we do not address the first two questions.
even when we assume without deciding that wasserstein owed a fiduciary duty to biscuit and old ace,and copeland alleging a breach of wasserstein fiduciary duty would entitle him to sue wasserstein directly,we are convinced that this purported cause of action has prescribed.under louisiana law,a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty is generally personal and prescribes in ten years,and a negligence claim is delictual and prescribes in one year we have recognized this dichotomy in a long line of cases involving categories of fiduciaries,producing a general rule that if a plaintiff fails to allege,breach of the duty of loyalty,fraud,or breach of trust on the part of his fiduciary,the plaintiff claim sounds in negligence and is subject to a prescriptive period the district court relied on this line of cases for its conclusion that,because copeland claim against wasserstein was best characterized as tort in nature,a prescriptive period applied.
the trial court correctly characterized the gravamen of copeland case.his petition lays out in its count against wasserstein a litany of instances in which wasserstein allegedly knew or should have known,but failed to disclose,facts key to shaping copeland understanding of the transaction and his willingness to go forward with it.even if proven,however,these failures would be violations solely of wasserstein professional duty of care.in an effort to invoke louisiana period of liberative prescription,copeland has attempted to make out two conflicts of interest that would transmogrify these violations into breaches of wasserstein duty of loyalty.but the first alleged a contingency fee biased wasserstein toward pushing the deal too broadly,both because the engagement letter fully disclosed the fee arrangement and because such arrangements are common practice in the investment banking industry.the second alleged because wasserstein lacked underwriting capacity,it favored maintaining its business relationship with merrill over its duty to advise copeland not alleged in the complaint and presents a contention first raised on appeal,and therefore is not an argument that we will entertain 
to summarize,copeland failed to plead facts that would bring his claim under a prescriptive period.the district court thus properly dismissed this claim against wasserstein on louisiana period of liberative prescription for delictual claims.
detrimental reliance on wasserstein 
copeland also appeals from the district court rule b dismissal of his claim that he detrimentally relied on wasserstein assurances regarding merrill and the merger financing plan.the district court found that this claim too had prescribed in one year that because the claim was based on a failure to meet professional obligations or competence,it was rooted in tort.
consequently,even if under louisiana law copeland could justifiably rely on wasserstein representations regarding third parties,any claim arising out of the merger has prescribed.the prescriptive period is not determined by the label of the cause of action but by the nature of the transaction and the underlying basis of the claim.we acknowledge that in stokes georgia pacific we stated that an action based on a theory sounds in contract.stokes was a classic case,however,in which a supplier made substantial investments relying on a customer assurances of future purchases.jurisprudence of the supreme court of louisiana on prescription binds us in diversity,and that court reasoned in roger dufrene that i t is the nature of the duty breached that should determine whether the action is in tort or in contract.therefore,although non feasance in the performance of an obligation creates a cause of action that prescribes in ten years,mis feasance in the performance of a contract for professional services,such as those provided by a lawyer,doctor,accountant,or insurance agent,gives rise to a claim in tort,which prescribes in one year the roger court explained this distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance as follows 
the nature of certain professions is such that the fact of employment does not imply a promise of success,but an agreement to employ ordinary skill and care in the exercise of the particular profession.the duty imposed upon the insurance agent as well as the lawyer,doctor,and accountant upon whose advice the client or patient depends is that of reasonable diligence a breach of which duty results in an action in negligence 
we discern no valid reason to treat a financial adviser such as wasserstein differently.wasserstein can reasonably be thought to have promised only to advise old ace and biscuit diligently,in accordance with the standard of care among financial advisers.copeland claims that wasserstein advice fell short of that standard but this states a quintessentially delictual claim that prescribed years ago,regardless of whether he might now characterize it as a claim.
the district court also properly dismissed as prescribed copeland claims of negligent or intentional misrepresentation,which are also delictual having disposed of copeland claims against wasserstein,we now turn to his appeal of the summary judgment dismissal of his claims against ward.
release of ward 
copeland claim against ward arises solely from ward service on boards of directors of copeland biscuit and then new ace.the district court orally granted ward motion for summary judgment because in copeland settlement with merrill,he had released merrill representatives.the court found ward,the director,to have been a representative of merrill within the meaning of that release.it reads in part 
the settlement agreement hereby releases merrill lynch,its past,present and future officers,directors,employees,agents,and representatives and the predecessors,successors,partners,heirs,spouses,executors,administrators,successors and assignees of any or all of them hereinafter the releasees from any and all claims,known or unknown,of any every kind whatever,whether or not enumerated or plead in this action,or any and all claims that have arisen at any time prior to the date this settlement agreement is executed against releasees by copeland.
this settlement agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties and of any agents,successors,predecessors,assigns and subrogees of the parties.this settlement agreement creates no third party beneficiaries hereto,and it is not the intention of either party to create any such third party beneficiary rights.
we must construe this settlement transaction in the lexicon of the louisiana civil article 
transactions regulate only the differences which appear clearly to be comprehended in them by the intention of the parties,whether it be explained in a general or particular manner,unless it be the necessary consequence of what is expressed and they do not extend to differences which the parties never intended to include in them.
the renunciation,which is made therein to all rights,claims and pretensions,extends only to what relates to the differences on which the transaction arises 
the burden of proving the scope of a release falls on the defendant,because the essence of release is res judicata,an affirmative defense such proof can include reference to extrinsic evidence because,even though louisiana courts generally interpret a contract from within its four corners,they have crafted a special exception to the extrinsic evidence rule for compromise agreements.importantly,as the language of article suggests,if the releasor did not intend to release certain aspects of a claim,extrinsic evidence is admissible to establish whether unequivocal language in the instrument was intended to be unequivocal.thus in brown,the louisiana supreme court held that the plaintiff had not intended to sign away her ability to bring a action growing out of an accident in which her husband was mortally injured key to this holding were facts that suggested no intent to injure and a statutory scheme that sharply distinguished between and actions here,the law may distinguish between copeland causes of action against merrill and those against ward,but the facts confirm that,from the beginning,copeland himself thought of ward as a merrill representative.
two facts chiefly persuaded the district court that ward,during his service on the boards of biscuit and new ace,was a representative of merrill within the meaning of the settlement agreement release clause.first,ward stated that he served on the boards solely at the request of merrill and then on the con
