in this case a motorcyclist refused to stop for a sheriff deputy flashing blue lights and siren over the course of an eight mile pursuit.the pursuit ended when the deputy car and the motorcycle collided killing the motorist,gerald abney.abney estate brought suit under alleging,inter alia,that defendant deputy rodney coe used excessive force in violation of abney fourth amendment rights.the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment holding coe conduct would violate abney fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures,since abney did not pose a serious threat to others.because deputy coe conduct was objectively reasonable under scott harris,d,and necessary to stop conduct that put the safety of other motorists at significant risk,we hold that abney fourth amendment rights were not violated and reverse the judgment.
on august,deputy sheriff rodney coe was traveling north on old country farm road near asheboro,north carolina.he observed a motorcycle driven by gerald abney who was later determined to be driving under the influence of methamphetamine crossing double yellow lines while passing a vehicle on a curve.deputy coe turned around his patrol car and activated his blue flashing lights and siren in an attempt to pull abney over.abney did not stop,however.instead,abney went around a second in the opposite lane of ran thomas and dorothy white off the road.abney was then able to lose deputy coe,who turned off his lights and siren.
deputy coe caught up with abney at the intersection of caraway mountain and old lexington road.coe reactivated his lights and siren.instead of pulling over,however,abney took off.he passed yet another vehicle,again crossing over double yellow lines,and turned left onto green farm road.
the motorcycle and coe patrol car made brief contact shortly after the turn onto green farm road.the parties disagree about who hit whom.deputy coe relies upon bystander thomas whitman testimony that when abney made his left turn,he ran through a ditch c a me back out toward the road and r a n into the side of the cop car,knocking the mirror loose from the door.plaintiff contends,based on the observations of other witnesses,that coe intentionally struck the back of abney motorcycle.
after the collision on green farm road,abney returned to the roadway and took off again.deputy coe called in to report the collision and his continued pursuit of abney down green farm road.as coe followed,abney ran a stop sign while swerving around a van which was stopped at the sign.the driver of the vehicle,linda flecken,testified that while she was stopped she saw a motorcycle come flying around her,cross the yellow line,into the other lane of traffic,and pull out.
deputy jerry rozier responded to the scene for.he joined the pursuit from the opposite direction,traveling down old lexington road toward abney and coe.in an effort to stop abney,rozier parked his vehicle in the center of the in abney started to get out of his patrol car.abney,however,did not stop he swerved around deputy rozier and sped away.
abney continued to flee down old lexington road and the two deputies followed.the suspect crossed into the opposite lane of traffic while passing several vehicles on a sharp curve.abney then turned onto highway,running the stop sign,and causing several motorists to slow down quickly.the traffic on highway was fairly heavy and neither abney nor deputy coe exceeded the speed limit.
abney made a right hand turn onto mount shepherd road and deputy coe followed.a few seconds after the vehicles turned,coe patrol car and the motorcycle collided for the second time.the motorcycle was knocked off the road and into an embankment where the patrol car ran over it.gerald abney was pronounced dead on the scene.the parties offer conflicting versions of events surrounding the collision.deputy coe claims that abney lost control of his motorcycle during the turn.he contends that the motorcycle went into a skid directly in front of him and decelerated rapidly coe slammed on his brakes and swerved to miss abney,but was unable to avoid a collision.plaintiff,on the other hand,has a very different view.plaintiff alleges that abney never lost control of the motorcycle but that deputy coe intentionally rammed the rear of abney motorcycle.
abney estate brought suit against deputy coe,sheriff litchard hurley,and western surety company as the writer of an official bond as surety for defendant sheriff hurley pursuant to.the estate raised claims under federal and north carolina law based on the alleged use of unreasonable force.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to all claims against sheriff hurley,and plaintiff does not appeal that order.this appeal concerns plaintiff allegation that coe used excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.all of plaintiff claims rise and fall on this question.
adopting the magistrate judge recommended ruling,the district court denied summary judgment on the federal claims brought against coe in his individual capacity.the district court found that plaintiff evidence was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether deputy coe intentionally struck and thus seized abney.the court then held that,if abney had in fact been seized,deputy coe conduct would constitute deadly force and would violate abney fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures,because there was no evidence from which a reasonable officer could conclude that abney posed a serious threat to others.in the district court view,deputy coe was not entitled to qualified immunity because the state of the law at the time of the events gave deputy coe fair warning that his conduct was unconstitutional.the court also denied summary judgment as to plaintiff state law claims for gross negligence and wrongful death against deputy coe in both his individual and official capacities.coe now appeals.
plaintiff contends that deputy coe actions were unconstitutional because abney did not pose any risk to the public that justified using force that placed him at risk of serious injury or death.according to plaintiff,a chase of a suspect fleeing after a traffic infraction does not amount to the substantial threat of imminent physical harm that garner requires before deadly force can be used.plaintiff also argues that deputy coe is not entitled to qualified immunity because coe was on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.
in any qualified immunity analysis,we must first ask whether an officer violated a constitutional right at all.saucier katz,d.if he did not violate any right,he is hardly in need of any immunity and the analysis ends right then and there.in this case,the right involved is the right to be free from excessive force.a claim of excessive force in the course of a seizure is analyzed under the fourth amendment objective reasonableness standard.graham connor,d.
the reasonableness inquiry is a balance.it requires courts to weigh the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the governmental interests which prompted the intrusion in the first place.id.at.united states place,d same.the requirement of reasonableness does not,however,demand statistical precision it accords police officers latitude in exercising what are inescapably discretionary functions replete with close judgment calls.gooden howard county,cir en banc.accordingly,reasonableness is evaluated from the perspective of the officer on the scene,not through the more leisurely lens of hindsight.graham,at.milstead kibler,cir.
when public safety is the interest supporting a seizure,courts consider the risk of bodily harm that the officer actions posed to the suspect in light of the threat to the public that the officer was trying to eliminate.scott.at.an officer actions are reasonable when preventing possible harm to the innocent justifies exposing to possible harm the person threatening them.id.at.
the parties agree that plaintiff evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether deputy coe intentionally struck and thus seized abney see brower county of inyo,d a fourth amendment seizure occurs when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.emphasis omitted.thus,we assume that abney was seized,and turn to the threshold inquiry whether deputy coe conduct was reasonable under the fourth amendment.
plaintiff contends that deputy coe plainly violated the fourth amendment in attempting to bring the chase to a halt.abney had,after all,committed only a minor and thus presumably not dangerous traffic infraction.abney and coe were not engaged in a dangerous pursuit that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders,and deputy coe did not have probable cause to believe that abney posed a serious threat to others.thus,plaintiff asserts it is abundantly clear that the force coe applied was disproportionate to any public risk.
plaintiff,however,argues the facts as she wishes them,not as the record reveals them.the record is replete with examples of reckless driving designed to elude the police and executed with little consideration for the lives and safety of other motorists.deputy coe first noticed gerald abney when the motorcycle driven by abney crossed a double yellow line to pass a vehicle on a curve at an estimated ten to fifteen miles per hour above the speed limit.diane davis,who drove the front vehicle in a line of three or four vehicles passed by abney,testified that she was literally scared to death thought abney was going to hit her and felt in danger.
deputy coe turned on his blue flashing lights and no avail.abney did not stop.instead,he led coe on an eight mile chase during the course of which he committed numerous dangerous traffic violations.abney,for example,illegally passed vehicles by crossing double yellow lines on no less than five of which involved speed,sharp curves,or both.on one occasion,abney ran thomas and dorothy white off the road when he took a curve in the wrong lane of traffic.white testified that her husband jerked the car and ran off the road.and i looked up,and there was a motorcycle on our side of the road.while plaintiff argues that deputy coe did not actually see abney run the whites off the road,the incident amply confirms coe assessment of the nature and risks to others posed by abney conduct.
even the green farm road collision between abney motorcycle and deputy coe patrol car did not stop abney.he instead continued to flee,running two stop signs.at the first,abney not only refused to stop but also illegally passed a vehicle that was stopped at the sign.the driver of the vehicle,linda flecken,testified that,while she was stopped a motorcycle c a me flying around her,cross ed the yellow line,into the other lane of traffic,and pulled out.at the second stop sign,other witnesses testified that abney pulled straight into traffic,causing several vehicles to slow down quickly.when deputy rozier attempted to stop abney by placing his vehicle and his person directly in front of the motorcycle,abney again refused to pull over.instead,abney swerved around deputy rozier and sped away.
to review the record is to conclude that abney august,driving behavior put other motorists at substantial risk of serious harm.there is abundant and uncontradicted evidence supporting deputy coe conclusion that abney driving over the course of the pursuit was a danger for the life of others.it was,therefore,eminently reasonable to terminate the chase in order to avoid further risks to the lives of innocent motorists.
the supreme court held as much in scott harris,d.in that case,the court concluded that an officer attempt to stop a fleeing motorist from continuing his flight by ramming the motorist car from behind was consistent with the fourth amendment.id.at.in scott,a county deputy attempted to pull over victor harris for speeding.id.harris repeatedly refused to pull over and,unable to stop the suspect,deputy scott bumped harris vehicle.id.at.as a result,harris lost control,crashed,and was gravely injured.id.he then brought suit against deputy scott under alleging a violation of his fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures.id.
the eleventh circuit denied deputy scott motion for summary judgment.harris coweta county,cir.that court concluded that deputy scott was not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable juror could conclude that the deputy attempt to terminate the chase by forcing harris off the road constituted deadly force and was therefore unreasonable.id.at.
the supreme court reversed.it had little difficulty in concluding it was reasonable for scott to take the action that he did,scott.at,and la id down the sensible rule that a police officer attempt to terminate a dangerous car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the fourth amendment,even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death,id.at.
this case is similar to scott.indeed,plaintiff opening brief stated as much the harris case is very similar to this matter.in both cases,a motorist refused to stop for police after committing a routine traffic violation the police pursued the motorist the motorist employed various tactics to escape capture thereby endangering other motorists and bystanders a law enforcement officer terminated the chase and the motorist was injured.the fact that,unlike scott,abney did not accelerate to is not dispositive indeed,the narrow,winding,roads in this case all but prohibited such speeds.the fact that abney was driving during the day and harris in the dead of the night,scott.at,means only that abney had the opportunity to scare more motorists to death.similarly,the fact that abney was driving a motorcycle,rather than a car,does not require a different result since the probability that a motorist will be harmed by a precision intervention technique is high in either circumstance.see scott.at holding that although deputy scott clearly posed a high likelihood of serious injury or death to harris that risk was justified by the possibility that innocent bystanders or motorists might be killed.
in accordance with scott harris,d,we hold that deputy coe attempt to terminate a dangerous car chase that threaten ed the lives of innocent bystanders d id not violate the fourth amendment,even though it place d the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.id.at.because we hold that deputy coe conduct was reasonable,plaintiff can not prevail,see jones buchanan,cir,and we need not address whether deputy coe was entitled to qualified immunity for a constitutional violation.
plaintiff nonetheless contends harris notwithstanding deputy coe actions were not objectively reasonable,but unjustified and unwarranted.in plaintiff view,deputy coe is not entitled to judgment because a deputy coe actions were officer could simply have let abney go b it is a violation of randolph county sheriff department policy to use precision intervention techniques to halt a fleeing motorist and c eyewitness testimony creates genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether deputy coe acted reasonably.we find these contentions to be without merit.
plaintiff first argues that a precision intervention tactic was unnecessary because deputy coe had obtained abney license plate number and could have tracked him down at a later date.according to plaintiff,concern for the safety of other motorists did not justify stopping abney.any risk to other motorists caused by abney driving would have been eliminated if the police had simply abandoned the chase and let abney go.
we doubt that upon cessation of coe pursuit abney would have been transformed into a model driver.indeed,deputy coe began pursuing abney because abney was driving dangerously when coe first observed abney,the motorcyclist had just passed three or four cars on a curve against the double yellow lines.the driver of the first car estimated abney speed at ten to fifteen miles per hour over the posted limit and testified that she was literally scared to death.in sum,abney disregard for the rules of the road and lack of concern for the lives of fellow motorists needed no catalyst abney drove recklessly before anyone was giving chase.a
