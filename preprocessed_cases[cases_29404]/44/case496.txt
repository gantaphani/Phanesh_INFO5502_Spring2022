this case arises from the sinking of a clamming vessel off the coast of new bedford,massachusetts,causing the deaths of two crew members.appellant,the vessel owner filed a petition in admiralty seeking exoneration or limitation of liability under the limitation of liability act the limitation act,app.the district court rejected the petition and found that the vessel was unseaworthy,leaving appellant fully exposed to pending damage claims.we affirm.
background 
the cape fear had been on a routine clamming trip out of new bedford,massachusetts,in january when the vessel,fully loaded with ocean quahogs,ran into trouble in stormy weather as it headed back to port.the boat carried a crew of five captain steven novack,mate james haley,and deckhands steven reeves,paul martin,and joseph lemieux as the boat approached new bedford,the waves washing up on deck were not receding as they usually did.novack ordered the crew members to don survival suits,and,a few minutes later,ordered them to abandon ship.novack and reeves,with their survival suits only partially on,slid down the starboard side hull as the vessel rolled to port,but lemieux,with his suit unzipped at the neck,was thrown into the water on the port side of the now capsized vessel.those three had last seen haley and martin in the galley putting on their survival suits.
lemieux testified that,once he was in the water,he heard other crew members screaming.lemieux suit was filling up with water because it was not fastened at the neck,but haley soon approached with a board and told lemieux to grab onto it.haley and lemieux then swam to captain novack,apparently the closest other crew member.the three men heard reeves crying for help,but could not find him.after about ten minutes,reeves yelling stopped.
another clamming vessel,the misty dawn,approached and rescued novack,haley and lemieux.the misty dawn unsuccessfully searched for martin and reeves for thirty to minutes.the next day,martin body was found floating off a beach on buzzard bay,where the boat sank.according to the testimony of officer michael camire of the state environmental police,martin survival suit was on,but zipped only to his navel.his strobe light was in the off position.reeves body was never found.
the cause of the vessel sinking is the central dispute in this case.the district court concluded that the cape fear,as it began its return to port,was unseaworthy because substantially overloaded with clams in cages,a practice that had become common it found that the heavy load,which weighed the boat down and risked its stability,was the primary reason the boat capsized in the rough conditions it encountered on its last voyage.the court ruled that the overloading rendered the boat unseaworthy,and that appellant was strictly liable for damages resulting from that condition.the court listed additional factors that contributed to the boat unseaworthiness,including problems with safety equipment,but it did not rely on these in finding that the cape fear was unseaworthy.
appellant,however,argues that the cape fear sank because the crew members on that particular day negligently failed to close a hatch cover over one of the clam tanks,allowing water to build up in the lower level of the vessel and undermining its stability.a total of six clam tanks stood on the cape fear lower deck.they were arranged,forward to aft,running from bow to stern.the two most forward tanks were labeled as port and starboard,the two in the middle were port and starboard,and the last two were port and starboard.each tank had a separate hatch cover that was attached to a set of rails and was moved into place using a pulley system.a watertight longitudinal bulkhead separated the starboard clam tanks from the port clam tanks,but the transverse bulkheads separating the,and tanks on each side were not watertight.
lemieux undisputed testimony was that the port side tank cover was left open that day about three to five inches.there is a dispute,however,concerning the reason for that opening.lemieux reported that the hatch cover was prevented from closing completely by a problem with the rope that was used to pull the cover into place.the rope had broken on other occasions,he testified,and crew members would tie a knot in it until the line could be spliced.the knot,however,would interfere with the pulley system and leave the hatch cover partially open appellant,by contrast,maintained that the cover was left open improperly by the crew members responsible for closing it,unbeknownst to either captain novack,mate haley,or company president alexander.the opening created by the partially closed cover was a downflooding point and the district court concluded that it contributed to the vessel unseaworthiness as with the safety equipment,however,the court did not rely on the hatch cover to reach its unseaworthiness determination.
the evidence showed that another possible location for water to accumulate and contribute to flooding was the space between the and hatch covers on both the port and starboard sides.the hatch covers were about four inches below the hatch covers,and they slid beneath the and hatch covers on a separate set of rails.lemieux testified that,with the covers closed,about a gap remained 
appellant filed its petition for exoneration from limitation of liability on june,and submitted an appraisal reporting that the cape fear had no value and no pending freight under the limitation act,a vessel owner may seek to limit its liability for any maritime injury or loss to the value of the vessel and its pending freight,provided that the owner lacks privity or knowledge concerning the events that gave rise to the damage.lewis lewis clark marine,d hellenic bridgeline gas distribution llc,cir carr pms fishing,cir.in the process of seeking limited liability under the statute,a vessel owner also may request exoneration,or freedom from all liability.lewis,at.
after hearing six days of testimony,the district court found that appellant was entitled to neither exoneration nor limitation of liability.it ruled initially that limitation was unavailable because appellant failed to prove the value of the vessel,and then went on to find liability based on unseaworthiness.appellant argues on appeal that the court conclusion of liability was based on clearly erroneous factual findings.it further asserts that,even if the unseaworthiness determination is upheld,no liability should result because it lacked privity or knowledge of any unseaworthy condition.finally,appellant argues that,in the absence of privity or knowledge,its liability was capped by the value of the vessel after its sinking,and that that value was adequately proven to be zero.
our review of the record persuades us that the district court did not commit clear error in its finding of unseaworthiness.as we explain below,its rejection of limitation of liability also is,on the state of this record,unassailable.
ii.discussion 
a trial court findings after a bench trial are reviewed generously under a clear error standard,see carr,at,and w hen the proof supports plausible but competing inferences,the trier choice between them can not be clearly erroneous,id.at.with that standard in mind,we first consider the court conclusion that the cape fear was unseaworthy,which was the foundation for its finding that appellant was fully liable in damages to the claimants.we then turn to the limitation of liability issue.
a.the cape fear seaworthiness 
a ship owner has an absolute duty to provide a seaworthy vessel,and this duty extends beyond the physical integrity of the vessel and its equipment to such other circumstances as the procedures crew members are instructed to use for assigned tasks.underwriters at lloyd labarca,lst cir citing vargas mcnamara,lst cir,for the proposition that a jury could conclude that the vessel was unseaworthy due to the unsafe procedure crewm e n were directed to employ for cleaning the engine room.it is well established that the seaworthiness of a vessel includes its capacity to carry its intended cargo i f a vessel is loaded so heavily that she can not safely sail on the voyage contracted for,she is unsea
