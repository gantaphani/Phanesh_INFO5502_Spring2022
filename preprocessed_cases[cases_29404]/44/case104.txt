this is an appeal from a dismissal of an action for declaratory judgment.because,as a threshold issue,we have an obligation to ascertain sua sponte the existence of federal jurisdiction,we asked the parties for supplemental briefing on how or whether the claim in this action met the requirement for diversity jurisdiction.finding federal jurisdiction wanting,we remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss.
background 
in,ce design ce filed a class action suit in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,on behalf of itself and others similarly situated,against ernida,llc.the complaint alleged violations of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.comp.stat,and common law conversion.ce claimed that ernida had faxed unsolicited advertisements to ce and more than other recipients,without first obtaining their permission.ce sought damages,including statutory damages of for each violation of the tcpa,as well as costs,and any further relief the court deemed just and proper.the complaint specifically disclaimed any individual recovery in excess of after being notified of this suit,ernida insurer,american economy insurance company american,took up ernida defense in cook county,explicitly reserving its rights to withdraw from the defense and to deny coverage.
with the cook county action still ongoing,ce then filed suit in federal court against american,seeking a declaratory judgment on american duty to defend ernida in the cook county action and american responsibility to indemnify and pay any judgment entered in that action against ernida ernida is also a named defendant in the federal suit.ce asserted diversity jurisdiction under.
american moved to dismiss ce federal action for lack of a justiciable controversy and for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted alternatively,it asked the court to exercise its discretion under the declaratory judgment act,and decline to enter declaratory relief.the district court granted american motion,holding ce had not presented a justiciable controversy.applying illinois law,it found ce did not have a cognizable injury for standing purposes because an injured claimant generally has no direct rights against the insurer prior to a judgment of the tortfeasor liability,and the cook county court had yet to issue a judgment against ernida this appeal followed.
both parties filed appellate briefs,focusing on the issues addressed by the district court in its order granting american motion to dismiss.however,in an extended footnote,american raised a jurisdictional amount challenge,questioning whether ce claim met the requirement for diversity jurisdiction since ce had expressly waived any right to recover anything over in its cook county complaint.this jurisdictional challenge went unanswered in ce reply brief.during oral argument,we asked ce appellate counsel whether and how his client claim reached the requirement of.without a satisfactory answer,we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue.
in its supplemental brief,ce maintains federal jurisdiction exists because the object of this litigation is to obtain indemnity coverage,and the pecuniary burden on the insurer,american overall potential payout to all putative class in the cook county action exceeds the minimum jurisdictional amount.american now squarely contests jurisdiction,arguing ce claim does not meet the requirement because it waived all individual damages in excess of in the cook county complaint,and because it can not aggregate its claim with the claims of other putative class members in the cook county action to reach the required minimum 
discussion 
as a court of limited jurisdiction,we have a responsibility to police the border of federal jurisdiction.spielman genzyme,cir.even where no party has questioned whether the district court had jurisdiction to rule in a case,it is well established that we have a duty to ensure that federal district courts are not called upon to adjudicate cases which in fact fall outside the jurisdiction conferred by congress.esquilín mendoza don king,f d,cir.
when an action is brought in federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction,jurisdiction lies only where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.the burden is on the federal plaintiff to establish that the minimum amount in controversy has been met.abdel aleem opk biotech llc,f d,cir.a plaintiff good faith allegation of damages meeting the required amount in controversy is usually enough.id.and t he inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his bad faith or oust the jurisdiction.esquilín mendoza,at quoting paul mercury indem.red cab.however,where it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount,dismissal is required.id.quoting paul mercury indem,at.
amount in controversy is usually assessed from the viewpoint of the plaintiff.see,miles funk,app x,cir per curiam unpublished finding only three plaintiffs were involved in the litigation when assessing the value of the matter in controversy see also richard young,leventhal,cir considering the value of the object of the litigation in a case involving both declaratory and injunctive relief from the plaintiff perspective.the amount in controversy in actions seeking declaratory relief is the value of the right or the viability of the legal claim to be declared,such as a right to indemnification or a duty to defend.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.as a general rule,multiple plaintiffs can not aggregate their separate individual claims to meet the jurisdictional amount threshold.see zahn int l paper,superseded by on other grounds,as stated in exxon mobil allapattah,a limited exception to this rule exists where several plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right,in which they have a common and undivided interest.id.at quoting troy bank of troy,indiana whitehead.in that instance,it is enough if their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount.id.quoting troy bank,at internal quotation mark omitted.for this exception to apply,the interest must be both common and undivided.see everett.verizon wireless,cir a common interest in a litigation recovery thus represents a necessary,but by itself insufficient,ground to qualify claims for aggregation.courts have found that individually cognizable and calculable claims do not fit the exception.see,travelers prop.cas.good,cir w here the plaintiffs claims are cognizable,calculable,and correctable individually,they are clearly separate and distinct and may not be aggregated to meet the amount in controversy.citation omitted.
we first questioned the amount in controversy in this case at oral argument with the rule in mind.ce appeared to rely on the claims of the other putative class members in the cook county action,presumably because its individual claim can not reach.again,ce had expressly waived any relief over in the cook county complaint.
as the party seeking to invoke jurisdiction,ce has the burden of showing it has met the requirement.see spielman,at.recognizing the rule would otherwise bar jurisdiction,ce makes two distinct arguments as to why this rule is inapplicable in this case.first,ce argues the common and undivided interest exception to this rule applies here.second,ce argues we should not assess the value of the object of the litigation for our determination from the plaintiff viewpoint which would require the aggregation of its claims with those of the other putative class members in the cook county action,but rather from the defendant perspective.we are not persuaded by either argument.
as to the first argument,ce fails to show us how this case falls within the common and undivided interest exception.ce limits its exposition to the following ce design seeks to vindicate the class common and undivided interest in obtaining an affirmative declaration of coverage,the value of which far exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.without more,we can not do much.there is no explanation as to why this class shares a common and undivided interest.while each of the putative cook county class members might be asserting a similar claim against ernida in the underlying state court action,this alone does not make their interest undivided.see everett,at.each putative class member allegedly suffered a separate and distinct violation of the tcpa,and the amount of money each may be entitled to receive including statutory damages of per violation is readily discernible.
furthermore,ce,which filed its complaint here in federal court as an individual plaintiff,fails to tell us how it can represent the entire cook county class at the risk of oversimplifying,generally,a plaintiff can only assert claims premised on his or her own legal rights,not those of third parties subject to some exceptions,of course.see wilson hsbc mortg,cir discussing prudential concerns for standing.it is ce burden to show why it can assert claims on behalf of the other putative class members,see,and it has made no effort to do so.merely citing to the underlying state court complaint,which does not tell us whether the class action has been certified or whether ce has been appointed class representative,is not enough.accordingly,the common and undivided interest exception argument goes nowhere,and the general rule that ce can not aggregate its claim with the claims of other putative cook county class members to meet the jurisdictional amount threshold holds.
ce is now left with its argument.but this too fails to make the grade.ce urges us to assess the amount in controversy in this case from american perspective,the cost to american of the potential indemnity obligation to all the putative class members in the cook county action.although ce acknowledges the value of the object of the litigation has historically been assessed from a plaintiff perspective,it cites caselaw to suggest it is legally permissible to look at the amount in controversy from the defendant perspective.ce,however,does not cite anything,and fails to illustrate how the cited caselaw applies to this particular case.
from this circuit,ce references two footnotes in williams kleppe,cir,and in massachusetts united states veterans administration,cir particularly,footnote one in and footnote three in claiming they signal an openness to consider the defendant viewpoint in assessing the amount in controversy.ce maintains this is the appropriate case for us to finally employ this approach.but these footnotes,on their own,give us no reason to abandon our general rule,and ce,which merely cites to and quotes them,provides us with no analysis as to why these two footnoted comments should persuade us to adopt something new here.it did so at its peril.we need not bend over backwards to preserve ce right to a federal forum.travelers indem.dingwell,cir.but more importantly and viewed correctly,williams which involved a suit for declaratory relief alleging the unconstitutionality of a national park service regulation actually assessed the amount in controversy through a plaintiff lens.see at w e are unwilling to say on this record that the claimed interests of one or more plaintiffs may not exceed the jurisdictional amount.and massachusetts which involved a suit filed by a state alleging violations of the federal water pollution control act,as amended et and which was dismissed on a different jurisdictional basis does not give us much to go on due to the brevity of its discussion jurisdictional amount was not at issue.while the footnote reference to the pecuniary burden on the veterans administration appears to signal the application of a approach,it is hard to discern if that is what the court meant in light of the preceding sentence acknowledging massachusetts claim that the matter in controversy concerns pollution of interstate waters.at.read together,the court reference to the va burden may simply be its assessment of the value of the pollution,the court assessment of massachusetts the plaintiff minimal damages.in any event,the brief discussion in the massachusetts footnote is arguably the sort of jurisdictional ruling that the supreme court has instructed has no precedential effect.steel citizens for a better env t.as such,neither footnote aids ce.
as for cases cited by ce,two of them in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust litigation,cir,and in re ford motor citibank south dakota,cir actually weaken its argument.in these cases,both courts adamantly maintained that the rule could not be ignored simply by applying a approach.the court in in re brand name which involved consolidated class actions seeking,inter alia,injunctive relief held that a defendant cost to comply with each plaintiff claim for injunctive relief could not be aggregated to satisfy the requirement,expressly emphasizing that w hatever the form of relief sought,each plaintiff claim must be held separate from each other plaintiff claim from both the plaintiff and the defendant standpoint.the defendant in such a case is deemed to face multiple claims for injunctive relief,each of which must be separately evaluated.at citing snow ford motor,cir.likewise,in in re ford motor which involved multiple plaintiffs seeking to sue on behalf of six million putative class members the court stressed that the either viewpoint rule does not extend to class action suits regardless of whether the class has been certified and that logic would dictate that it should also not extend to multiparty complaints,noting 
w hile it may seem paradoxical to decline jurisdiction in the multiplaintiff setting,where the potential loss to defendants typically is well beyond the jurisdictional amount threshold,it is implicit in the rule that forbids aggregation of class members separate claims that it will sometimes be more difficult for a party asserting federal jurisdiction to establish the minimum amount of controversy in a multiplaintiff case than in a much smaller case.
at alterations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.the court explained that in these cases the either viewpoint rule must yield to the rule,inasmuch as aggregation is the threshold question,which must be resolved affirmatively before total detriment to the defendant can be considered.id.at alterations omitted citations omitted.according to the in re ford motor court,when each plaintiff is asserting an individual right,the test is the cost to the defendants of an injunction running in favor of one plaintiff.id.at citations omitted.therefore,if we follow the reasoning of in re brand name and in re ford motor,the amount in controversy in this case from american perspective is the amount it would have to pay one plaintiff,ce,not the total amount it would have to pay the putative cook county class members.and,we recall,ce individual damages claims can not exceed.
ce also misguidedly relies on meridian security insurance sadowski,cir,to support its contention that we should assess the amount in controversy from american perspective.while ce correctly asserts that the seventh circuit looked to the magnitude of an insurer potential indemnity obligation for an underlying junk fax lawsuit to determine the amount in controversy for a related insurance coverage declaratory judgment action,it misses a crucial point.unlike the situation here,in sadowski,the insurance company was the plaintiff,and it had filed suit against its insured.at.the insurance company was the party seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify its insured in a pending tcpa state court suit.id.accordingly,the seventh circuit assessing the amount in controversy from the plaintiff perspective found that the insurance company had not aggregated the claims of multiple parties because f rom its perspective there was only one claim by its insured,for the sum of defense and indemnity costs.id.at.here,american the insurance company similarly situated to the plaintiff in sadowski,in all but party status is not asking us to declare its contractual obligation with ernida the insured.quite the opposite,it is asking us not to do this.and ce does not explain why it should be able to stand in american shoes or
