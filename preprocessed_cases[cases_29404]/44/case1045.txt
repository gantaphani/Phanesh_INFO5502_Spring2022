decades of litigation over the effects of pervasive asbestos use have yielded a financial burden borne across an array of industries.today we must decide which of two companies will bear costs associated with a staggering number of asbestos claims.these companies a historical manufacturer of products and its insurer dispute the rightful allocation of losses under excess insurance policies.while the policies are dated,the consequences of our interpretation are immediate both to the parties at hand and to those insurers and insureds whose relationships are similarly governed.
the chief issue on appeal is whether a policy exclusion that disclaims losses arising out of asbestos will prevent a manufacturer from obtaining indemnification for thousands of negotiated settlements with plaintiffs who have suffered adverse health effects from exposure to its products.the answer hinges on whether the language of the exclusion is ambiguous.after a bench trial,the district court found that the phrase arising out of asbestos contained latent ambiguity because the exclusion could reasonably be read to exclude only losses related to raw asbestos,as opposed to losses related to products.we disagree.the phrase arising out of,when used in a pennsylvania insurance exclusion,unambiguously requires but for causation.because the losses relating to the underlying asbestos suits would not have occurred but for asbestos,raw or within finished products,we will reverse the judgment of the district court.
general refractories company grc is a manufacturer and supplier of refractory products that are designed to retain their strength when exposed to extreme heat.to serve this purpose,grc previously included asbestos in some of its products.grc use of asbestos brought about approximately lawsuits alleging injuries from exposure to products manufactured,sold,and distributed by grc dating back to.
grc insurers initially fielded these claims.during the and,grc had entered into primary liability insurance policies with a number of different insurers.grc also secured additional excess insurance policies to provide liability coverage beyond the limits of its primary insurance policies,including several excess policies issued by travelers surety and casualty company,formerly known as the aetna casualty and surety company.as the number of injury claims against grc began to grow,the primary insurers continued to defend and indemnify grc.but this arrangement came to a halt in when grc liabilities from thousands of settled claims far exceeded the limits of its primary insurance coverage.in,after years of continued settlements,grc tendered the underlying claims to its excess insurance carriers,including travelers,all of whom denied coverage on the basis of exclusions for asbestos claims.
grc commenced this action against its excess insurers seeking a declaration of coverage for losses related to the underlying asbestos claims,as well as breach of contract damages.refractories first state ins,supp.grc eventually settled with all of the excess insurance defendants except travelers by means of a stipulated dismissal with prejudice.id.travelers is the only excess insurer remaining in this litigation.
travelers contractual relationship with grc is governed by two substantively identical excess insurance policies providing coverage from to.each policy obliges travelers to indemnify grc against excess net loss arising out of an accident or occurrence during the policy period subject to the stated limits of liability and additional terms.in maintaining that it need not compensate grc for losses related to the underlying asbestos claims,travelers relies on an asbestos exclusion contained within the excess insurance contracts,which reads 
it is agreed that this policy does not apply to excess net loss arising out of asbestos,including but not limited to bodily injury arising out of asbestosis or related diseases or to property damage.
the policies do not define the terms arising out of or asbestos.refractories,supp.at.
at its core,the parties dispute the meaning of four words within the asbestos exclusion arising out of asbestos.the district court held a bench trial specifically to interpret this language.grc took the position that at the time the policies were drafted arising out of asbestos had a separate meaning than arising out of products.refractories,supp.at.in grc view,the term asbestos plainly referred to the raw asbestos mineral that is mined,milled,processed,produced,or manufactured for sale in its raw form.id.there is no dispute that grc made and sold refractory products that sometimes contained asbestos components.but the parties also agree that grc never mined,milled,processed,produced,or manufactured raw mineral asbestos.id.at.thus,grc argued that the exclusion did not encompass claims based on exposure to its finished products.
to support its narrow interpretation of the asbestos exclusion,grc presented several types of extrinsic evidence,including 
examples of comparable insurance policies that other insurers had issued in the late through,which explicitly excluded asbestos and products containing asbestos

the expert testimony of gene locks,a lawyer who represented over asbestos claimants and was the lead negotiator at the wellington meetings,in which locks explained that the terms asbestos and product had distinct meanings to the parties involved in asbestos litigation during the relevant timeframe.
on the other hand,travelers contended that the only reasonable interpretation of the asbestos exclusion is that claims for injuries related to asbestos in any form were excluded.travelers asserted that this is the natural,plain,and ordinary meaning of the terms,arising out of asbestos.id.at.thus,travelers asserted that grc losses associated with the underlying asbestos claims were precluded by the asbestos exclusion.for support,travelers presented grc corporate records,as well as its communications with travelers and its own insurance broker,as evidence of the parties intent to exclude or their awareness,belief,or knowledge that the purchased insurance did exclude all injuries related to asbestos in any form.id.at.
after weighing the evidence and arguments,the district court issued a memorandum and order concluding that the asbestos exclusion contained a latent ambiguity because the terms were reasonably capable of being understood in more than one sense.id.at.the district court agreed that grc interpretation of asbestos as referring only to the raw mineral asbestos rather than other finished products containing asbestos was consistent with the plain meaning of the written policy,and therefore objectively reasonable,and that travelers had not met its burden of showing that grc interpretation was unreasonable.id.
having found ambiguity,the district court observed that grc industry custom and trade usage evidence supported the assertion that d uring the relevant era,industry participants used the phrase to denote losses arising from mining,milling,producing,processing,or manufacturing the raw mineral,not from finished products.id.at.the district court found no evidence in the record contradicting this interpretation,and further rejected travelers characterization of its course of performance evidence.id.at.ultimately,the district court concluded that travelers had failed to show not only that its interpretation is reasonable,but also that grc interpretation is not reasonable.id.at.accordingly,the district court deemed the asbestos exclusion unenforceable to preclude indemnification to grc for its losses in the underlying lawsuits,and issued a memorandum and order to this effect.the parties subsequently stipulated that,under the district court interpretation of the exclusion,travelers must cover of grc losses the combined limit of the two excess insurance policies.the district court accepted this stipulation,awarded grc an additional in prejudgment interest,and entered final judgment for grc.travelers now appeals the district court interpretation of the asbestos exclusion.

we begin by deciding whether the language of the asbestos exclusion is ambiguous.pac.emp rs ins.glob.reinsurance of,cir.citing hutchison sunbeam coal.ambiguity exists where the language of the contract is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.madison constr,at quoting hutchison,at.after a bench trial,the district court found the language of the asbestos exclusion to contain latent ambiguity.we disagree with the district court penultimate conclusion because the court analysis overlooked the phrase arising out of,which has an established,unambiguous meaning under pennsylvania insurance law.
the district court properly began its analysis by determining whether the text of the asbestos exclusion,which precludes indemnification for excess net loss arising out of asbestos,was ambiguous.grc had asserted that asbestos refers only to mineral asbestos in its raw,unprocessed form.travelers,on the other hand,maintained that asbestos is a purposefully broad term which encompasses both asbestos in its raw form and products which contain asbestos such as those manufactured and sold by grc.
driven by the parties arguments,the district court largely focused on whether the word asbestos was reasonably susceptible of differing interpretations.after examining various dictionary definitions and grammatical uses of asbestos,it concluded that the term common usage reveal ed a latent ambiguity as to what it denotes.refractories,supp.at.without deciding which of the parties views was more reasonable,the district court found that both were consistent with the plain meaning of the language and objectively reasonable.because asbestos was reasonably capable of being understood in more than one sense,the district court held that the exclusion was ambiguous.id.at.
while the district court engaged in a thorough analysis of the breadth of the term asbestos,its focus was misplaced.the rest of the language at issue arising out of has an unambiguous legal meaning that renders any uncertainty concerning the meaning of the word asbestos immaterial.pennsylvania courts have long construed the phrase arising out of when used in the context of an insurance exclusion to m ean causally connected with,not proximately caused by.mccabe old republic ins,forum ins.allied,cir.a policy provision containing the phrase arising out of is satisfied by b ut for causation,a cause and result relationship.mfrs.cas.ins.goodville mut.cas.
recognizing that pennsylvania courts consistently interpret arising out of to require but for causation,we have previously observed that this formulation is,having been applied in numerous insurance law contexts.allstate prop.cas.ins.squires,cir.this understanding of the phrase is entrenched in pennsylvania jurisprudence.see,forum ins,at holding that arising out of requires but for causation in the context of an exclusion for injury or death arising in the course of employment smith united servs.auto.ass n.super.requiring but for causation in interpreting an uninsured motorist provision erie ins.exch.eisenhuth.super.automobile insurance policy tuscarora wayne mut.ins.kadlubosky.super.commercial general liability insurance policy roman mosaic tile aetna cas.sur.super.same.not only have courts applying pennsylvania law interpreted arising out of to require but for causation,they have also held that the phrase is unambiguous.see madison constr,at finding that arising out of language was not ambiguous mccabe,at same see also forum ins,at relying on mccabe in rejecting an argument that a policy exclusion containing the phrase arising out of his employment was ambiguous.
with this consistent interpretation in mind,we find that the plain language of the asbestos exclusion,disclaiming excess net loss arising out of asbestos,is unambiguous on its face and is not reasonably susceptible of different constructions.madison constr,at.the provision plainly encompasses losses that would not have occurred but for asbestos or which are causally connected to asbestos.pennsylvania law permits no other interpretation.
although we find the language of the policy to be clear on its face,our inquiry does not immediately end when the plain meaning of the provision is unambiguous.evidence of industry custom or trade usage is always relevant and admissible in construing commercial contracts,and does not depend on the existence of ambiguity in the contractual language.sunbeam liberty mut.ins.where it can be shown that words have a special meaning or usage in a particular industry,members of that industry are presumed to use the words in that special way,whatever the words mean in common usage and regardless of whether there appears to be any ambiguity in the words.id.
in the course of arguing that asbestos had a separate and distinct meaning from products,grc presented industry custom and trade usage evidence which was ultimately credited by the district court as supporting grc narrow interpretation of the exclusion.refractories,supp.at.while grc evidence may bear on the ambiguity of the word asbestos,it does not cloud the meaning of the phrase arising out of.grc even agrees that arising out of requires but for causation.in its brief,grc explains that its proffered interpretation of the asbestos exclusion itself utilizes a but for causation standard.appellee br.at.grc clarifies that its argument has been that the asbestos exclusion excludes losses related to or but for the mineral asbestos,as opposed to losses related to or but for grc products.appellee br.at.
this argument by grc incorrectly presumes that the meaning attached to asbestos would have a material effect on the outcome of this coverage dispute.but assigning but for causation to the phrase arising out of carries the important consequence of negating any material ambiguity that the term asbestos may introduce into the clause.even the narrowest interpretation of asbestos as referring only to raw mineral asbestos leads to the conclusion that coverage for losses associated with the claims against grc is disclaimed by the asbestos exclusion.while we express no opinion about whether the term asbestos is ambiguous here,if we were to credit grc theory that asbestos only referred to mineral asbestos in its raw,unprocessed form as the district court did the asbestos claims against grc would still fall within the asbestos exclusion.
