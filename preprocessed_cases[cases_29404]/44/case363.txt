this appeal arises out of a tragic series of events that culminated in the murder of philip mccloskey.the of the victim estate sought damages from both the federal government and the murderer,gary lee sampson.the district court dismissed their action.see mccloskey mueller,d.because there is no principled way that the frontiers of tort law can be expanded to encompass the theory of liability that the have premised on these horrific facts,we affirm the order of dismissal.
background 
because the district court disposed of this case on a motion to dismiss,see.b,we glean the relevant facts from the amended complaint assuming,without determining,that those facts are true,supplemented by certain undisputed items.
on july,sampson telephoned the boston office of the federal bureau of investigation fbi and spoke with an fbi employee,william anderson.sampson explained to anderson that he was in abington,massachusetts that he was wanted for armed robbery and that he wished to surrender to the authorities.anderson disconnected the call either accidentally or amended complaint contemplates both made no attempt to reconnect it,investigate it,or report it to any other law enforcement officer.
sampson never called back instead,after spending several hours fruitlessly awaiting the fbi arrival in abington,he embarked upon a killing spree.the spree began the next day when sampson abducted and murdered a complete stranger,philip mccloskey.before local authorities finally apprehended him on july,sampson had killed two other men as well.
sampson eventually pleaded guilty to a federal charge of carjacking resulting in philip mccloskey death.see.following a trial,the district court imposed a death sentence.see united states sampson,d.that sentence is currently on appeal.
after initially denying that a telephone call ever took place,anderson finally admitted the call occurrence.in due season,thomas and kevin mccloskey,of philip mccloskey estate,notified the united states,see a,and then commenced a civil action in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.they asserted damages claims under both the federal tort claims act ftca,b,and,against the united states,the fbi,robert mueller iii,in his official capacity as director of the fbi,and anderson collectively,the federal defendants they also advanced pendent claims for wrongful death against sampson.
the federal defendants filed an omnibus motion to dismiss.see.b.sampson likewise moved to dismiss the claims against him.the filed a timely opposition.
after pondering the matter,the district court dismissed the case in toto.see mccloskey,d at.the court held that,under the ftca,the united states was the only proper defendant and dismissed the tort claims against the fbi,mueller,and anderson for that reason.see id.at.it then concluded that it was without jurisdiction over the ftca claims against the united states because of the discretionary function exception,see id.at citing a,and,alternatively,because the government would not be liable under massachusetts law had it been acting as a private person in the same or similar circumstances,see id.at citing b.the court dispatched the section claims for failure to allege any action under color of state authority.id.at.once it had dismissed the federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims against sampson.id.at citing c.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we begin our analysis by acknowledging the applicable standard of review.we then address,in turn,the ftca and section claims.finally,we touch upon the dismissal of the claims against sampson.
standard of review.
the district court dismissed the ftca counts for want of jurisdiction and the section counts for failure to state an actionable claim.although these rulings derive from different subsections of rule b,compare.b,with.b,our standard of review sounds the same familiar refrain.
under either rule,we review the lower court dismissal order de novo,accepting the plaintiffs facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences to their behoof.see,dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir rule b dep t of hous.urban,cir rule b.we are not wedded to the lower court rationale and may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent by the record.see gabriel preble,cir.
b.the ftca claims.
it is beyond cavil that,as the sovereign,the united states is immune from suit without its consent.muirhead mecham,cir.the ftca embodies one instance of such consent.it comprises a limited waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity,shansky united states,cir,and grants federal courts jurisdiction over claims against the united states that fall within its ambit.this includes claims 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
here,the assert in substance that the federal defendants were negligent in failing to apprehend sampson after his attempted surrender that negligence,they posit,resulted in philip mccloskey death.although the name various federal defendants in these counts,the united states is the only proper defendant in such an action.see b,see also roman townsend,cir.consequently,the district court correctly held that no ftca claim can lie against the fbi,mueller,or anderson.
against this backdrop,we turn to the ftca claims against the united states to survive,an ftca claim must successfully surmount the jurisdictional hurdle erected by b.that section restricts the liability of the united states to circumstances in which a private person would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.id.since every relevant event in this case occurred in massachusetts,the substantive law of that jurisdiction constitutes the law of the place for present purposes.thus,the must identify some basis in massachusetts law for holding a private party liable in tort for acts or omissions comparable to those they attribute to the fbi and its functionaries.see bolduc united states,cir.
in appraising the height of this hurdle,it is important to frame the scope of our inquiry.the search for analogous liability is circumscribed by the explicit language of the ftca,which restricts that search to private liability.see sea air shuttle united states,cir.in other words,we must look for some relationship between the governmental employee and the plaintiff to which state law would attach a duty of care in purely private circumstances.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the flip side of this coin is that we are not at liberty to derive analogues from instances in which state law enforcement only state law enforcement be liable under state law.in the ftca milieu,the federal government does not yield its immunity with respect to obligations that are peculiar to governments or state actors and which have no private counterpart in state law.bolduc,at.
refined to bare essence,our obligation is to appraise the height of the section b hurdle through a narrowed lens and ask only whether,under massachusetts law,a private party who is approached by a fugitive seeking to turn himself in would be guilty of actionable negligence if he did nothing in response and the fugitive thereafter committed a series of violent crimes.on the pleadings before us which do not allege any special circumstances,we answer that isthmian question in the negative.
in massachusetts,a tort plaintiff must show that the defendant owed him a duty,the defendant breached that duty,the breach constituted a proximate cause of the ensuing harm,and the breach caused actual injury.fithian reed,cir.massachusetts courts have recognized the generic applicability of relevant restatement of torts principles to the first step of this quadripartite algorithm.see mosko raytheon,jean commonwealth,liacos,concurring see also rakes united states,d,aff,cir.it is on that step that our subsequent discussion will focus after all,if a private person under the same circumstances would owe no duty to a victim,there would be no liability and,thus,no jurisdiction over the ftca claims.see newlin new eng,deeming it settled that if the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff there could be no actionable negligence on the defendant part.
generally speaking,a defendant duty is more limited when negligence consists of an omission rather than an act of commission.see carrier riddell,cir applying massachusetts law.so too,as a general matter,t here is no duty to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another.restatement second of torts restatement see mosko,at.these generalities fairly describe the situation in the case at hand.that is not the end of the matter,however,because there are at least two exceptions to the general rule that can be distilled from these principles.the ftca claims necessarily stand or fall on the applicability vel non of these exceptions.
the first exception comes into play when a special relation exists between the actor and the plaintiff which gives the plaintiff a right to protection.restatement see jean,at liacos,concurring.emblematic of this type of special relation is the relationship of,say,a common carrier to a passenger or an innkeeper to a guest see restatement.this exception also may have some bearing when one takes custody of the plaintiff under circumstances that deprive the plaintiff of his normal opportunities for protection.id.that duty may well confer upon the custodian a duty to protect his charge from the conduct of third persons see id.
the second exception arises when a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person conduct.id.see jean,at liacos,concurring.traditionally,and relationships fit into this taxonomy see restatement.in the same vein,one may acquire a duty to control a third person if he takes charge of that third person and knows or should know that the third person is likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled.id.
in the absence of a special relationship sufficient to trigger one of these exceptions,a private party is not liable for failing,either intentionally or inadvertently,to exercise control over the actions of a third party so as to protect others from harm.id.cmt.b.this is so even if the prospective harm is substantial and the actor realizes that he has the ability to control the conduct of the third person,and could do so with only the most trivial of efforts.id.
it follows inexorably from the foregoing that,for a duty to attach here,the amended complaint must reveal the existence of a special relationship between either anderson and,thus,the fbi and philip mccloskey or between anderson and,thus,the fbi and sampson.
it is readily evident that,at the times material hereto,no special relationship had been forged between anderson or the fbi and the decedent.prior to his murder,philip mccloskey was a random member of the public at large.neither anderson nor the fbi had any reason to know that he existed.he occupied no special position that might be deemed even faintly analogous to a common carrier passenger or an innkeeper guest.nor did anderson or the fbi take custody of philip mccloskey in any way,shape,or form.
so viewed,this case is easily distinguished from mulloy united states,much bruited by the.there,an officer wife living on an army base was raped and murdered by an enlistee.the court,applying illinois law,recognized a special relationship between the army and the victim,given her status as the army invitee and a tenant on the base.see id.at.that relationship furnished a modicum of support for a theory by which the united states might be held liable under state law.see id.here,however,as we have said,neither anderson nor the fbi had any prior relationship with philip mccloskey,nor did he ever act in reliance on any invitation by them.
to say more on this point would be to paint the lily.we hold,without serious question,that no special relationship existed between anderson or the fbi,on the one hand,and philip mccloskey,on the other hand,sufficient to give rise to a duty under massachusetts tort law either to protect mccloskey or to ward off his slayer.
the relationship between sampson and anderson is not quite so easily dismissed.there is some semblance of a tie,as sampson telephone call to anderson linked the two men,however fleetingly and,thus,linked sampson and the fbi.we nonetheless conclude that this solitary link is inadequate to give rise to a duty on anderson part to control sampson.
anderson and sampson were not in a sustained relationship akin to that enjoyed by a parent and child,a master and servant,or a possessor and licensee.the question,then,boils down to whether it can be said,under the generous pleading standard applicable at the stage,that anderson and,thus,the fbi took charge of sampson in such a way or to such an extent that his activities could give rise to a duty to exercise control over sampson.sheridan united states,d recognizing possible liability under maryland law based in part on the government voluntary undertaking to provide care to a person who was visibly drunk and visibly armed.
while we have been unable to find a massachusetts case squarely on point,our analysis is informed by the state courts warm reception of applicable restatement principles.those principles counsel against finding a duty based on so fragile a connection as exists here.see restatement.moreover,four former justices of the massachusetts supreme judicial court which,at full strength,numbers seven justices have agreed that i n the absence of special assurances having been given,the law imposes no duty on a private individual carefully to extinguish a fire he did not cause,or carefully to remove an intoxicated motorist from the highway whose intoxication or presence on the highway he did not bring about.jean,at liacos,concurring alteration in original quoting cyran town of ware,concurring,with whom nolan and lynch,joined.it would seem to follow that a private individual who has refrained from giving any assurances has no legal duty to keep the public safe from a felon with whom he has had only the briefest contact.
no more need be said.we are confident,given these telltales and given the absence of any allegation that special assurances were offered,that anderson,if a purely private actor,would not have acquired a duty to control sampson merely by his reception of sampson brief telephone call.after all,anderson took no action aimed at taking charge of sampson.his failure to act,while lamentable,is too amorphous a foundation on which to erect a duty to control bergmann united states,cir concluding that,under restatement,the government did not take charge of a federally protected witness and,thus,had no duty to control the witness conduct.
the principal cases on which the rely do not mitigate the force of this reasoning.none of them involves a fact pattern that is substantially similar or even fairly analogous to the fact pattern here.by the same token,none of them evinces a connection between the parties as ephemeral as anderson and the fbi fleeting connection with sampson.see,marin united states,finding a special relationship between ins agents and a detainee whom they released from custody to act as an informant williams united states,concluding that hospital,knowing of patient propensity for violence and having agreed to notify local authorities upon his release,undertook a duty that it breached when it discharged the patient without notice and he committed a murder a day later.these cases depend upon the presence of numerous facts that are foreign to the record in the case at bar among these disparities,the most salient distinction is that,unlike the detained alien in marin or the hospital patient in williams,the instrument of harm here sampson was never in the government charge 
in a effort to stem the tide,the propose that the issue of whether government actors took charge of a third person must be decided by a trier of fact.that proposition is incorrect.when the raw facts are undisputed,t he existence of a duty is typically a question of law,not of fact.carrier,at.this case fits within that mold.we have taken the facts in the light most favorable to the those facts,even if entirely true,do not show the existence of an actionable duty.no more is exigible to sustain a dismissal of the ftca counts.see b.
c.the section claims.
the also contest the dismissal of their section claims against the federal defendants.that statute reach is limited to person s who act under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia.thus,to plead a viable section claim,a complaint must allege action under color of state law.see,at rogan city of boston,cir.given the nature of this requirement,a section claim ordinarily will not lie against a federal actor.see district of columbia carter,d recognizing that actions of the federal government and its officers are at least facially exempt from section proscriptions,at similar.
here,the relevant counts of the amended complaint assign fault to federal actors functioning as such.they contain no hint of any tortious activity under color of state authority,nor do they limn any extraordinary circumstances that might implicate the federal defendants in state action.hampton hanrahan,cir explaining that a section claim might lie against federal officers who are engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive the plaintiff constitutional rights.
when pressed,the confess that the amended complaint fails to allege any action by the federal defendants under color of state law.they asseverate,however,that the district court should have deferred ruling on their section claims until pretrial discovery had run its course.that asseveration puts the cart before the horse.
when evaluating a motion to dismiss,the trial court must decide in the first instance whether the plaintiff is entitled to undertake discovery at all.rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir.to reach this plateau,a plaintiff must carry an burden he must sketch,at least in outline form,the rudiments of a viable claim.see educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.if he succeeds in that endeavor,discovery should be allowed to give him an opportunity to put some flesh on the bare bones of that claim.but if he does not succeed in carrying his burden,that is the end of the matter.the purpose of pretrial discovery is not to allow a plaintiff to rummage about in search of a hitherto unexplicated cause of action.see bruno stillman,globe newspaper,cir.
in this instance,the have not proffered even the most hazy outline of a viable section claim.their attempts to do so,as framed in their amended complaint,fail to meet even the most abecedarian notice pleading requirements.see.a requiring that a complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.they are,therefore,not entitled to discovery.see nestor colon medina sucesores,custodio,cir noting that it is only after stating a valid claim that a plaintiff can insist upon a right to discovery.in the last analysis,plaintiffs should not be permitted to conduct fishing expeditions in hopes of discovering claims that they do not know they have.
even were we to recharacterize the constitutional claims under the framework crafted in bivens six unknown named agents of fbn,d,and thus sidestep the under color of state law requirement,the claims still would succumb to the federal defendants motion.the bivens doctrine allows constitutional claims against federal officials,in their individual capacities,for actions taken under color of federal law.see id.at.but the availability of that doctrine does not override bedrock principles of sovereign immunity so as to permit suits against the united states,its agencies,or federal officers sued in their official capacities.see ruiz rivera riley,cir.
here,the sued mueller only in his official capacity.and although they originally named anderson as both an and an defendant,the district court,on the parties joint motion early in the case,dismissed all claims against anderson in his individual capacity.having joined in the motion to dismiss,the can not now appeal the resultant order.see biw deceived local,indus.union of marine shipbuilding workers,cir recognizing general rule that a party who unreservedly consents to a judgment waives any right to appeal that judgment.consequently,no cognizable bivens claims lurk in the penumbra of the amended complaint.
iii.conclusion 
to recapitulate,we hold i that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the ftca claims and ii that the have failed to state any cognizable cause of action under.accordingly,the lower court properly dismissed all the claims against the federal defendants including the punitive damages claim,which has no independent footing.in so holding,we do not intend to place our imprimatur upon anderson failures.we are,however,bound both by the terms of the ftca,which,like all waivers of sovereign immunity,must not be enlarged beyond such boundaries as its language plainly requires,united states horn,cir,and by the circumscriptions of section.
we need go no further.without any federal claims left in the case,the lower court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims asserted against sampson.see c see also martinez colon,cir.
despite naming the fbi as a defendant,the amended complaint does not textually set forth any claim against the fbi all claims against the federal defendants are directed only to the united states,mueller,and anderson.based on other filings,the district court interpreted each of these claims as asserted against the fbi as well.see mccloskey,d at.because no party contests that interpretation,we treat the claims in a similar fashion.
to the extent that the alleged,and the district court dismissed,ftca claims based on theories of negligent supervision or inadequate technology,we consider any potential challenges abandoned.see united states zannino,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
although the ftca is mentioned explicitly only in count of the amended complaint,we treat the wrongful death claims against the federal defendants counts as coming under the umbrella of the statute.this recasting benefits the,as the ftca provides the exclusive remedy against the united states for wrongful death.see a b.
take,for example,an innkeeper,who may be said to assume a duty to use reasonable care to secure the demised premises and,thus,may be held liable for the harm done by a marauder if he defaults on that duty.see,fund hotel lenox of boston.
take,for example,a school,which may be said to assume a duty of care toward its students and,thus,may be held liable for foreseeable harm that comes to them if it defaults on that duty.see,marquay eno,collecting cases.
take,for example,a parent,who may be said to assume a duty of reasonable care to prevent his minor child from inflicting harm on others and,thus,may be held liable for the harm done by the child if he defaults on that duty.see,caldwell zaher.
take,for example,a jailer,who may be said to assume a duty of reasonable care to control a prisoner in his custody and,thus,may be held liable to one whom the prisoner harms if he the jailer defaults on that duty.see,buchler state,or.
because there is no special relationship here,we need not address the secondary issue of foreseeability.see restatement noting that the duty assumed by one who takes charge of a third person only accrues when he knows or should know that the person is likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled see also jean,at liacos,concurring acknowledging that a duty arising from a special relationship under restatement would only inure to the benefit of foreseeable victims.
