this civil enforcement action against scott gann gann,a stockbroker,arose out of gann trades placed on behalf of a client.the securities and exchange commission the sec alleged that gann violated section b section b of the securities exchange act of and rule rule promulgated thereunder by conducting trades in a number of mutual funds.gann claimed that his trades complied with the rules of the various funds and that,in any event,market timing is legal and his practices were not deceptive.at trial,the district court found gann not credible and determined that he had violated section b and rule.gann was ordered to disgorge his profits and pay a civil penalty.the district court also imposed a permanent injunction against future violations.
gann now asserts that the district court erred in finding that he made material misstatements with an intent to deceive,as is required to find a violation of section b and rule.additionally,he contends that,far from supporting a finding of scienter,the evidence demonstrates his lack of intent to deceive.finding no clear error,we affirm the district court judgment.
facts and proceedings 
in,gann and a at southwest securities,sws,george fasciano fasciano,put together a plan for a new customer,haidar capital management and capital advisor hcm,to trade mutual funds by timing the market.after hcm asked fasciano whether sws would be willing to place trades on its behalf,fasciano enlisted gann to work with him,and the two agreed to share all commissions 
market timing is not illegal,but many mutual fund companies prohibit this type of trading of shares of their funds.market timers typically buy and sell shares of a mutual fund quickly to take advantage of minute,differentials between a fund value and the value of the securities it holds.fund companies object that market timers gains come at the expense of investors and increase transaction costs,so such companies employ a number of strategies to discover and impede traders engaging in the practice.brokers who time the market sometimes receive block notices from funds in which they have bought and sold shares.a block notice typically informs the broker that he has run afoul of a fund restrictions and bars specified accounts controlled by the broker from future trades.brokers can be identified by their registered representative number clients can be identified by their account number or numbers.a block notice might bar trades under the broker number,the client account number,or the number attached to a brokerage or its branch office.despite the show of discouraging market timing,not all funds prohibit the practice 
intending to accept hcm business,gann and fasciano undertook an extensive survey of various fund companies rules and requirements.all involved recognized that the trades would have to occur under the radar of the various funds to avoid triggering block notices.sws then set up a trading desk to operate the hcm business.gann and fasciano opened accounts for nine hcm affiliates,albeit the investors in each were the same a third sws employee was responsible for ensuring that the trades complied with each fund rules and alerting funds to specific large trades when so required.
trading on hcm behalf began february.sws received the first block notice days later.after receiving a block notice,gann and fasciano would switch the identifier number they were using,enabling them to continue trading,at least temporarily.over seven months,they concluded trades million in aggregate the mutual funds of companies.during this period,they received block rate of about percent.gann earned for his work on behalf of hcm.
the sec filed a civil enforcement action against gann and fasciano in january,asserting that the hcm trades had violated section b and rule fasciano settled without admitting wrongdoing following a bench trial,the district court found that gann had made material misstatements with intent to deceive in violation of section b and rule.the court entered judgment against gann,requiring him to disgorge the profits earned from the hcm and to pay a civil penalty,as well as enjoining him from future violations.gann timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo we will find clear error if 
the findings are without substantial evidence to support them,the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence,and although there is evidence which if credible would be substantial,the force and effect of the testimony,considered as a whole,convinces the court that the findings are so against the preponderance of credible testimony that they do not reflect or represent the truth and right of the case 
gann unquestionably engaged in market timing.the question here is whether he did so in a manner that violated section b and rule the sec was required to show,by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant,made a misstatement or omission of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities with scienter to have acted with scienter,the defendant must have acted with a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.
as noted,gann first insists that there is no evidence that he made material misstatements and rather than demonstrating that he had the requisite mental state,the evidence proves his lack of intent to deceive 
material misstatement 
the material misstatements at issue are gann use of different and varying client account numbers to disguise the frequency and magnitude of hcm trading in the various funds.to commit securities fraud in violation of section b and rule,a defendant must act intentionally or with severe recklessness,which is defined as a highly unreasonable omission or misrepresentation.that omission or misrepresentation must be material that is,it must be reasonably calculated to influence the decisions of an or its trading in securities that which is reasonably calculated to influence the individual investor may not be reasonably calculated to influence an institutional investor,and vice versa.here,gann does not challenge the materiality of the alleged misrepresentations rather,he contends that there were no misrepresentations.the district court held that gann practice of switching identifying broker and client account numbers constituted materially misleading statements in violation of the securities laws.
gann claim of district court error in this regard essentially asks us to adopt his view of the facts.he contends that sws was in contact with the fund companies before and after the block notices were sent.as such,the fund companies were aware that gann continued trading and could not have been misled.in support of this,gann points to the testimony of a and of an hcm representative that the system sws put in place to run the hcm trades was meant to ensure that the trades would be compliant with the various funds rules.he also points us to his own testimony and that of the that the fund companies block notices were not the last word on what they would permit.and,he states that hcm was on notice that sws intended to comply with the funds regulations.these assertions ignore that,irrespective of whether sws had an elaborate notification system in place,the claim is that the funds were still misled.they also ignore that hcm view is irrelevant.what matters is the perception of the fund companies.notably,gann does not point to anything that indicates the fund companies were aware of sws notification system.
gann argument overlooks the standard of review in this case.even if we were persuaded that his might be the better view of the facts,this would be insufficient to permit us to reverse the district court.his view of the facts may be plausible,but that is not evidence of clear error when,as here,the district court interpretation is reasonable.
the sec proof that gann use of different numbers to conduct his trades demonstrates that he did not want the fund companies catching on to his trading practices.in one instance,fasciano traded a goldman sachs fund three times and received a block notice,yet he an
