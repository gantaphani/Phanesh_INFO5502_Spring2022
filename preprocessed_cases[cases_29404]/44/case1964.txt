rudy rodriguez rodriguez brought this diversity action against conagra grocery products conagra under the texas commission on human rights act tchra alleging disability discrimination on the basis of his diabetes.the district court denied rodriguez motion for partial summary judgment and granted conagra.we reverse,grant partial summary judgment to rodriguez,and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
rodriguez was diagnosed with type ii diabetes in.the general term diabetes encompasses a category of diseases,all of which are characterized by blood sugar from the difficulty of the body to eliminate sugar glucose from the blood stream.a healthy body produces insulin at adequate levels and uses that insulin to move sugar from the blood stream to within the body cells where the sugar is used for sustenance.a type ii diabetic like rodriguez typically has both a reduced ability to produce insulin and a reduced ability to use the insulin that his body does produce.as a result,sugar builds up in the blood stream,leading to hyperglycemia,one of the most significant dangers type ii diabetics face.hyperglycemia develops gradually,though,and is capable of detection by monitoring blood sugar levels.
conagra owns a plant in fort worth,texas,at which it produces ranch style beans.in january,a temporary staffing agency placed rodriguez at this plant where,until march of that year,he performed heavy manual labor,including unloading delivery trucks and lifting heavy sacks of beans.
based on the quality of rodriguez work,a supervisor recommended to the plant human resources manager,elza zamora,that conagra offer rodriguez a permanent position.in late february,conagra offered rodriguez a job as a production utility employee in the plant production area.the offer was contingent on rodriguez passing a background check,a drug screen,and a physical exam.
the following month,with offer in hand,rodriguez visited occupational health solutions ohs,a private clinic with which conagra had a standing contractual arrangement to perform all of its preemployment physical exams.ohs jerry morris performed rodriguez physical exam.pursuant to the contract,morris was to assess rodriguez medical qualification for the production utility position at conagra.significantly,however,conagra had never provided morris with any data or restrictions applicable to the position,and morris admitted that when he examined rodriguez he knew nothing of rodriguez job offer or the qualifications necessary for the production utility position.
morris performed a urinalysis on rodriguez,which showed an elevated concentration of glucose in his urine.based on rodriguez concentrated level of glucose and the fact that rodriguez could not remember the name of his treating physician or the name of the medication he was taking to control his diabetes,morris concluded that rodriguez diabetes was uncontrolled.on the medical form that morris submitted to conagra,he wrote that rodriguez was n ot medically qualified for the position at the plant because of uncontrolled diabetes.morris also told rodriguez that he did not believe rodriguez was controlling his diabetes.
rodriguez immediately disputed morris assessment,informing him that rodriguez had had a complete physical not even two months ago and his physical was all right and he was taking pills for his diabetes and everything and he never had no trouble.indeed,rodriguez oral medical history and physical exam confirmed that he suffered no physical or mental problems attributable to his diabetes.and,morris testified that he observed no attributable to rodriguez diabetes.
following the exam,rodriguez took his completed medical form to zamora.she thereupon informed rodriguez that he would not be hired because he had failed the physical exam,and morris did not recommend him for employment.
four days after conagra withdrew the job offer,rodriguez filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the texas commission on human rights tchr.after both organizations failed to find a violation of rodriguez rights,the tchr issued him a letter.that was in june of two months later,rodriguez sued conagra in texas state court,alleging that conagra violated the when it refused to hire him because of what it perceived to be uncontrolled diabetes.conagra removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction but the district court remanded it in november of,after concluding that the diversity jurisdiction statute requirement was not satisfied.rodriguez filed an amended original petition in state court,and conagra again removed the suit on diversity grounds,after which the matter proceeded in federal court.
in october,conagra filed a motion for summary judgment,and rodriguez filed for partial summary judgment.in granting conagra motion and dismissing rodriguez claims with prejudice,the district court reasoned that rodriguez failed to present any evidence tending to demonstrate that his employment offer was withdrawn because of the fact that he had diabetes.rather,the overwhelming undisputed evidence is that zamora withdrew the job offer because she believed that rodriguez diabetes was uncontrolled.this,according to the district court,is a distinction with a difference numerous courts have concluded,albeit on differing grounds,that an employer adverse action in response to a plaintiff failure to control an otherwise controllable illness does not give rise to a disability discrimination claim.and,in the district court opinion,diabetes is a generally controllable illness therefore,ruled the court,rodriguez did not have a claim under the tchra rodriguez timely filed a notice of appeal 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review both grants and denials of summary judgment motions de novo i f the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,then summary judgment in favor of that party is appropriate initially,it is the moving party burden to show that there is no genuine issue of material fact if that burden is met,then the nonmoving party must produce evidence or designate specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial.in conducting our analysis,we resolve any doubts and draw any reasonable inferences raised by the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party 
b.the texas commission on human rights act and the americans with disabilities act 
the tchra,like the americans with disabilities act ada prohibits discrimination grounded in an individual disability given the similarity between the ada and the tchra,texas courts look to analogous federal precedent for guidance when interpreting the texas act.as must federal diversity courts when deciding an issue of state law,we will follow the texas courts lead.our analysis today is thus focused on those analogous federal precedents and their interpretation of the federal act banning discrimination in employment on the basis of disability the ada.
the ada makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.the ada defines a qualified individual with a disability as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.the term disability means,with respect to an individual a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.finally,even if an employer discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability,that employer can avoid liability by asserting a legitimate justification for its action,including that the plaintiff,if hired,would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.
taken together,these statutory rules require that a plaintiff situated like rodriguez establish three elements at the time he sought employment he had a disability within the meaning of the ada he was qualified for the position for which he sought employment and he was not hired because of his disability conagra has waived any argument that rodriguez was not qualified for the production utility position and it has expressly declined to employ the direct threat defense to liability.thus,the instant dispute turns entirely on the first and third of the gonzales prongs at the time that conagra withdrew its offer to employ rodriguez,did he have a disability within the meaning of the ada and,if so,did conagra withdraw the job offer because of that disability.
we conclude that the district court erred when it held that conagra did not withdraw rodriguez job offer because of his diabetes.rodriguez has adduced sufficient evidence to establish that he was regarded as substantially impaired in a major life activity by conagra and conagra withdrew its offer to employ him because of his perceived disability.as we explain more fully below,conagra argument that rodriguez failure to control his diabetes obviates the protection of the ada is a red herring.this case is not about failure to control rather,it is a garden variety regarded as disabled case.in such cases,the question of control is never relevant any rule requiring that a plaintiff exercise some level of control over his arguendo that such a rule even relevant and applies only in an actual disability case.at its core,this case is about the emphasis on treating impaired job applicants as individuals.conagra blanket policy of refusing to hire what it characterizes as uncontrolled diabetics violates this fundamental tenet of ada law it embraces what the ada detests reliance on stereotypes and generalizations about an illness when making employment decisions.
conagra regarded rodriguez as disabled within the meaning of the 
background law 
this case falls squarely under the regarded as prong of the ada disjunctive definition of disability.rodriguez theory of recovery is that at the time conagra withdrew his job offer,it regarded him as having a physical impairment that substantially limited him in the major life activity of working,not that he in fact had such an impairment.
under the ada,a plaintiff is regarded as disabled if he 
has an impairment which is not substantially limiting but which the employer perceives as substantially limiting has an impairment which is substantially limiting only because of the attitudes of others towards such an impairment or has no impairment at all but is regarded by the employer as having a substantially limiting impairment 
rodriguez asserts that his case falls within the first of bridges three categories.accordingly,rodriguez had to show that at the time conagra withdrew his job offer his diabetes did not actually substantially limit him in a major life activity,and conagra nonetheless perceived his diabetes to be substantially limiting.as rodriguez grounds his regarded as claim on the major life activity of working he had to demonstrate that conagra believed that he was unable to work in a broad class of jobs.to that end,rodriguez needed to prove that conagra perceived him to be precluded from more than one type of job,a specialized job,or a particular job of choice.rodriguez unmistakably carries this burden.
rodriguez evidence 
i rodriguez proved that his diabetes was not substantially limiting 
rodriguez adduced sufficient evidence to establish that his diabetes did not substantially limit him in a major life activity.for example,rodriguez stated in his affidavit at no time in my life have i experienced any physical or mental problem,other than a temporary illness or injury,that has affected my ability to work.his personal physician,ramon garcia,averred that f or as long as i have been treating rudy rodriguez,dating back to approximately,he has not suffered any complications as a result of his diabetes.as conagra made no attempt to challenge this evidence,we conclude that rodriguez diabetes did not substantially limit him in a major life activity.
the only evidence in the record that could be used to find that rodriguez diabetes was in fact substantially limiting is the hyperbole of morris that outside of a padded room where he could even then fall and break his neck from dizziness or fainting,there is no working environment in which rodriguez would be safe but as we explain below morris did not base his assessment of rodriguez fitness for working on the individualized review of rodriguez that the ada requires an assessment not reached in an individualized manner is not an assessment that we can credit,at least with regards to whether rodriguez is actually substantially limited by his diabetes 
ii rodriguez proved that conagra regarded him as precluded from a wide range of jobs 
to determine whether conagra regarded rodriguez diabetes as a substantially limiting impairment,we focus on the statements of conagra itself,primarily those of its decisionmaker,zamora,and of morris,on whom zamora relied in making her decision first,rodriguez presented conagra response to his interrogatories,in which conagra admitted its position that rodriguez was not qualified for any other position at its plant 
interrogatory was plaintiff qualified for any other positions at conagra foods please include in your answer any positions for which he would have been qualified with a reasonable accommodation on your part.
alone,this statement is sufficient to support a reasonable conclusion that conagra considered rodriguez unable to perform a broad class of jobs when this statement is coupled with the fact that conagra withdrew rodriguez job offer for the express reason that it viewed him as unfit for the production utility is a job that,because it requires only the most basic skills and abilities,virtually any person could follows inescapably that conagra viewed rodriguez as unfit to perform a wide range of jobs.
this same analysis applies to zamora.in her deposition,zamora stated that,based on morris assessment,she viewed rodriguez diabetes as uncontrolled.she confirmed that,in her mind,an uncontrolled diabetic is one who is not taking his medication.this,according to zamora,could lead to dizziness and blacking out,thereby preventing rodriguez from performing the essential duties of his job.like conagra itself,if zamora regarded rodriguez as unable to perform the production utility position because of his diabetes,then there are essentially no manual labor jobs for which she regarded him as being able to perform.
finally,morris testified that the results of rodriguez urinalysis made him unfit to perform any manual labor job.in morris own words,o utside of a padded room where he could even then fall and break his neck from dizziness or fainting,i do know that there would be a safe environment that we could construct.
this summary judgment evidence shows beyond cavil,as a matter of law,that conagra regarded rodriguez diabetes as substantially limiting his ability to engage in the major life activity of working.undeterred,though,conagra continues to disagree.
conagra position 
in response to rodriguez compelling evidence,conagra wields a broad ax in lieu of a scalpel,arguing expansively that the ada protection simply does not extend to rodriguez.its flawed syllogism goes rodriguez has failed to control his diabetes because diabetes is a generally controllable illness conagra regarded rodriguez not as suffering generally from the impairment of diabetes,but rather as suffering from the impairment of the more specific uncontrolled diabetes ergo uncontrolled,as conagra puts it,a plaintiff failure to control his controllable not an impairment that is protected by the ada.this overbroad generalization widely misses the mark.
in firing its broadside argument,conagra cites to no less than seventeen decisions purporting to support its proffered failure to control rule.this extensive citation list,however,suffers from a fatal flaw each decision in the list is completely inapposite to this case.in if we were to assume arguendo that conagra failure to control rule were a valid interpretation of the the rule itself would remain totally inapposite to this case.
fifteen of the seventeen cases to which conagra cites are not regarded as disability cases at all fourteen of them involved an actual and one involved the plaintiff record of an actual disability in other words,the plaintiffs in these cases contended that they suffered or had a record of suffering from an impairment that actually substantially limited their ability to engage in a major life activity.this distinction is important because in an actual disability case there is something for the plaintiff to control,namely the substantially limiting impairment from which the plaintiff claims to suffer.in stark and telling contrast,regarded as disability claims,like rodriguez,are grounded in the foundational distinction that the plaintiff impairment is not substantially limiting.stated differently,in this and all other cases involving only a regarded as disability claim,there is nothing for the plaintiff to control or mitigate.thus,applying the supposed failure to control rule in a regarded as case just makes no sense 
in a world governed by conagra reasoning,an impaired but not substantially limited plaintiff who asserts only a regarded as ada claim could never succeed no one can control a nonlimiting impairment that by definition is merely regarded as substantially limiting.such an imagined condition thus need controlled.an effort like conagra to apply the failure to control rule to a regarded as claim is a logical impossibility that flies in the face of congress and the texas legislature explicit determinations that the ada and the tchra should protect an individual who is not limited by his impairment but who is nonetheless regarded as substantially limited we reject conagra attempt to insert interstitially its failure to control rule into this case.thus,we need not address the substantive question whether the rule itself is a valid interpretation of the,leaving that determination for another day.rodriguez is entitled to summary judgment that conagra regarded him as substantially limited in the major life activity of working by his diabetes.
conagra concedes that it withdrew rodriguez job offer because of his diabetes 
conagra has made resolution of this prong of the analysis easy in its appellate brief,conagra twice concedes albeit coupled with an irrelevant caveat that it withdrew rodriguez job offer because it regarded him as substantially limited by his diabetes in the major life activity of working.in that caveat,conagra continues to contend that the allegedly uncontrolled nature of rodriguez diabetes saves it from liability.at its core,conagra argument is that rodriguez alleged failure to control his diabetes constitutes a legitimate,nondiscriminatory justification à la mcdonnell douglas for its withdrawal of rodriguez job offer.this argument depends for its very viability on conagra underlying assumption that its failure to control rule is both valid and applicable in this regarded as action rodriguez alleged failure to control his diabetes would qualify as a legitimate justification for conagra withdrawal of the job offer only if a failure to control one substantially limiting impairment did in fact obviate the protection of the ada.this contention,however,is yet another red herring as we have already emphasized,this is a regarded as case,so the purported failure to control rule,even if valid,simply does not apply here and thus need not be addressed today.conagra admission that it withdrew rodriguez job offer because of its perception that he suffers from uncontrolled diabetes,is the functional equivalent of an admission that it withdrew the offer because it regarded him as substantially limited by his diabetes.
related to the because of prong of the analysis is the question of discriminatory intent.on this point,conagra argues that neither rodriguez nor we have any reason to believe that it harbors towards diabetics as a class.we agree,especially considering the evidence establishing that conagra employs a number of those whom it characterizes as controlled at its ranch style beans plant.but both that evidence and conagra assertion are beside the point.this case is one of those rare ada cases in which we are presented with direct rather than circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent conagra and zamora have both admitted that rodriguez did not get his job because of his allegedly uncontrolled diabetes.because we are concerned under the ada with animus directed at the disability,and not necessarily with animus directed at the individual,it is of no moment that conagra harbors no towards rodriguez or any other diabetic individuals.its admission is more than enough for us to grant rodriguez partial summary judgment of liability on his disability discrimination claim 
the allegedly uncontrolled state of rodriguez diabetes does not provide a legitimate justification for conagra withdrawal of the job offer 
even if conagra failure to control rule were a valid interpretation of the ada,and even if rodriguez diabetes actually were uncontrolled,for another independent reason conagra assertion of the rule in this case as a justification for withdrawing rodriguez job offer fails mcdonnell douglas requirement of legitimacy.in assessing rodriguez fitness for the production utility position,conagra failed to follow the ada mandate that it measure the impact of rodriguez diabetes on his ability to work in an individualized manner without such an individualized assessment,conagra had no way of knowing whether rodriguez presumed failure to control his diabetes would actually prevent him from performing the requirements of the position.such knowledge,however,is a key component of each of the cases involving an actual or a record of an actual disability that conagra cites in support of its failure to control rule.every one of those courts was presented with particularized evidence of how the impaired employee failure to control his impairment rendered him unable to perform his job adequately here,there was no such particularized evidence,and there could not have been any without the individualized review required by the ada.in fact,all of the particularized evidence available to conagra about rodriguez ability to perform his job established exactly the opposite he received the employment offer precisely because he was already performing up to conagra expectations.without any actual evidence of rodriguez unsuitability for the production utility position,conagra had to rely on precisely the type of stereotypes and generalizations about diabetes and diabetics that the ada abhors such reliance is impermissible it renders conagra purportedly legitimate justification for its withdrawal of rodriguez job offer discriminatory.
a.the requirement of individualized assessment 
in its sutton toyota motor manufacturing and murphy ups,decisions,the supreme court repeatedly emphasized the individualized approach of the ada.the ada is,after all,an law as such,it is meant to to use of grounds in decisionmaking.under this individualized approach,the question whether an applicant is disabled must be answered in a manner.employers can not rely on perceptions of a disability based on myth,fear or stereotype rather,they must evaluate an applicant in her actual state.in other words,an employer must focus on whether the particular applicant before it is actually substantially limited by his impairment and on whether the applicant is actually capable of performing the essential functions of the job at issue this emphatic focus on the individual applicant actual abilities effectuate s one of the primary goals of the ada to prohibit employers from making adverse employment decisions based on stereotypes and generalizations associated with the individual disability rather than on the individual actual characteristics.further,the importance of proceeding in a manner is even more pronounced when an impairment such as diabetes is at issue an individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person.
conagra did not assess the effect of rodriguez diabetes in an individualized manner 
the record in this case unequivocally establishes that conagra did not base its decision to withdraw rodriguez job offer on the kind of individualized and assessment envisioned by the ada.to start with,rodriguez offer was withdrawn on the basis of conagra blanket determination that it would not hire any diabetic who its physicians characterize as uncontrolled,regardless whether the particular diabetic might be able to perform the essential functions of the job at issue.such a policy not only ignores the ada mandate that employers consider an impaired applicant on the basis of his actual abilities,but it also empowers conagra to make an around the ada prohibition of discrimination 
any possible doubt as to whether conagra proceeded in an individualized manner is dispelled by zamora deposition testimony showing that her view of rodriguez diabetes and of diabetes in general was colored by stereotypes and generalizations about the illness at one point,rodriguez counsel asked zamora 
q do you know whether all diabetics take medication 
a i believe they do,yes.
q and do you believe that if someone is diabetic and not taking medication that they have uncontrolled diabetes 
a yes.i understand that to be true.
q so is there a way for a diabetic to control diabetes without medication 
a i would think not.
morris himself,though,flatly answered no when asked in his deposition whether all diabetics need to take medication.according to morris,some diabetics are able to manage their illness through diet and exercise.
this exchange demonstrates that zamora the decisionmaker in this case harbored fundamental employed diabetes.yet despite her misunderstandings,zamora never asked morris what he meant to convey by describing rodriguez diabetes as uncontrolled.rather,zamora relied unscientifically on her personal concepts about the illness gleaned from working with diabetics and from having two diabetic parents.on this flimsy without giving any consideration to the actual,individualized impact of rodriguez diabetes on his concluded that she know s that if a diabetic do es have his medication to control diabetes,it certainly presents a risk factor.when asked what kinds of risks,zamora said,i know that,again,talking to our employees that are diabetic,that if they not taking their medication on time and if they are not eating the proper foods at specific times,it could cause them to become dizzy and possibly blackout.perhaps most telling is this next statement by zamora,as it proves how deeply her misunderstanding of diabetes affects her hiring decisions 
q would you hire a diabetic who does not take medication to work at conagra 
a i would have to say if it uncontrolled,if the diabetes is uncontrolled,i would would not be hired.
to summarize,despite the fact that conagra own doctor stated that a diabetic can control his illness without medication,zamora elected to rely on her own beliefs regarding the general nature of the illness to conclude that any unmedicated diabetic presents too significant a risk to hire.her belief,though,amounts to nothing more than speculation about the danger actually posed by rodriguez.indeed,zamora admitted as much 
q let me put it this way.do you know if someone analyzed,based on rodriguez own physical limitations,whether he was,likely,to cause injury to himself or others 
a i do know.
speculation about the hypothetical risks posed by a diabetic is not a legitimate ground on which to make an employment decision.the sutton court,after all,specifically rejected an approach that would,in many cases,force the decisionmaker to make a disability determination based on general information about how an uncorrected impairment usually affects individuals,rather than on the individual actual condition.that,however,is precisely what happened in this case.zamora decided not to hire rodriguez based on her general beliefs and misconceptions about the risks rodriguez posed as an allegedly uncontrolled diabetic.
finally,conagra can not escape its obligation to evaluate rodriguez actual abilities,notwithstanding his diabetes,by blindly relying on the assessment of morris.morris testified that he had no knowledge of the position for which conagra was considering rodriguez.indeed,he had not even been informed by conagra of any of the essential functions for which rodriguez would be responsible if hired.this,in itself,belies the notion that morris subjected rodriguez to the individualized assessment mandated by the ada.as the first circuit has noted,a medical opinion is often cogent evidence of nondiscriminatory some instances,it may even be enough to justify summary the mere obtaining of such an opinion does not automatically absolve the employer from liability under the ada.the employer has an obligation to ensure that its applicants are treated as individuals t hus,an employer can not slavishly defer to a physician opinion without first pausing to assess the objective reasonableness of the physician conclusions.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court grant of conagra motion for summary judgment and that court denial of rodriguez motion.further,we grant rodriguez motion for partial summary judgment,holding as a matter of law that conagra discriminated against rodriguez under the tchra and we remand this case to the district court for a determination of the quantum of rodriguez damages.

conagra puts forth two additional arguments that,because the failure to control rule is inapplicable to this case,are also easily dismissed.first,conagra argues that the does not protect a plaintiff whose employer mistakenly regards a plaintiff controllable impairment as uncontrolled.second,conagra argues that rodriguez presented no evidence to the district court that his diabetes was in fact under control.obviously,both arguments assume that the failure to control rule applies here.as we have shown,it does not,making both arguments meritless.
indeed,had there been an individualized review of rodriguez abilities,we likely would not even be here today.this is a regarded as case of disability discrimination as such it is premised on conagra mistaken perception of rodriguez as substantially limited by his diabetes.had conagra performed the individualized review the ada requires,it likely would have discovered that rodriguez is not actually substantially limited by his diabetes.
