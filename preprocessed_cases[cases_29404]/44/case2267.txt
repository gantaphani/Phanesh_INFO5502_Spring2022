plaintiff angela montgomery sued defendants wyeth,wyeth pharmaceuticals,a wholly owned subsidiary of wyeth,and ahp subsidiary holding corporation,also a subsidiary of wyeth,after she developed primary pulmonary hypertension pph,a serious,debilitating,and usually fatal disease,from ingesting fenphen,a combination diet drug therapy that included defendant wyeth diet drug,pondimin the district court held that montgomery claim was barred by tennessee statute of repose,which requires that an action be brought within one year after the expiration of the anticipated life of the product.ann.a tsor montgomery appeals.
background 
the fda approved the sale of the pondimin brand of fenfluramine mg tablets as a prescription weight loss medication in.pondimin mg tablets were manufactured in richmond,virginia,and distributed by wyeth to pharmacies and wholesalers in and stock bottles.the expiration date for pondimin mg tablets was three years from the month of manufacture of each lot.the expiration date was printed on a label affixed to each stock bottle.wyeth did not sell pondimin mg tablets directly to consumers.instead the tablets were packaged by third parties.the product was withdrawn from the market in september.
montgomery began taking pondimin in.a tennessee resident,montgomery traveled to the clinic in fort oglethorpe,georgia,to receive treatment and prescriptions of pondimin,which was not available in tennessee at that time.montgomery received her first treatment in january and went to georgia at least eight times during.each time,she was evaluated by a georgia physician.she was prescribed,and purchased,pondimin on seven of those visits.montgomery saw three doctors merton sure,who has since died david hargett,who lost his medical license in january and joyce gray.
pondimin became available in tennessee as of march.wyeth voluntarily withdrew pondimin from the market on september,and did not manufacture,package,or distribute it after that time.montgomery stopped using pondimin in august.
in december,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation established mdl in the eastern district of pennsylvania for consolidated proceedings relating to a wave of litigation involving pondimin,redux,and phentermine.see in re diet drugs,wl,at,pto.on october,the numerous parties to the action reached an understanding of the principal terms of the settlement in a memorandum of understanding mou.id.at.on october,a class action styled brown wyeth was filed on behalf of all users of pondimin and redux,in the eastern district of pennsylvania and became part of mdl,at.montgomery is a member of the brown class.on november,the parties executed a nationwide class action settlement agreement settlement agreement,which included the brown class members.on august,the district court entered pto,which certified the class and approved the settlement agreement.see id.
montgomery was not diagnosed with pph until april.she filed the present action in tennessee state court in october,within six months after being diagnosed.the case was removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee,transferred to the mdl for pretrial proceedings in february,and then remanded to the district court in july.defendants moved for summary judgment,alleging that montgomery claim was barred by the tsor because it had not been brought within one year of the expiration date of the product.the district court reluctantly agreed and granted summary judgment to defendants on march.specifically,the court concluded that the tsor applied to montgomery claim under tennessee rules,the settlement agreement did not preserve her right to sue for pph,tennessee law rather than georgia law applied,and wyeth did not waive its statute of repose defense.see montgomery wyeth,d.the court also denied montgomery rule motion to alter or amend judgment.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.gribcheck runyon,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
choice of law 
montgomery argues that the district court erred in applying tennessee law because the relevant principles dictate that georgia law should govern.as noted,the district court held that the tsor barred montgomery claim.there is a conflict because georgia statute of repose,which limits claims only after ten years,would not bar her claim.see ann.west stating that n o action shall be commenced pursuant to this subsection with respect to an injury after ten years from the date of the first sale for use or consumption of the personal property causing or otherwise bringing about the injury.
because this is a diversity action,the law of the forum state,including the rules,apply.uhl komatsu forklift,cir.tennessee follows the most significant relationship approach of the restatement second of conflict of laws to questions.hataway mckinley.under this approach,the law of the state where the injury occurred will be applied unless some other state has a more significant relationship to the litigation.id.at tennessee adopted this position because generally the law of the state where the injury occurred will have the most significant relationship to the litigation.id.thus,the most significant relationship provides a default rule whereby trial courts can apply the law of the place where the injury occurred when each state has an almost equal relationship to the litigation.id.
contacts to be considered in determining which state has the most significant relationship include the place where the injury occurred,the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,the domicile,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,and the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.id.at quoting.
the district court analyzed these four factors.first,the court noted that the place of injury is not obvious when the injury is a latent disease,like pph,and that there is no tennessee law for determining where a latent injury is suffered.however,the court also noted that there was no indication that montgomery suffered from pph in georgia.the court therefore concluded that because she developed her injury while living in tennessee,her place of injury is tennessee.the court reasoned that this conclusion was consistent with the language of tennessee product liability statute of limitations,which states that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff suffers her injury,not when she purchases the product.see ann.b.second,the district court determined that the conduct causing the injury occurred in georgia because montgomery bought pondimin from a clinic in georgia.the court noted that the drug was prescribed by georgia doctors,and that she signed a consent form with a georgia clinic.furthermore,the georgia doctors allegedly relied on false information from wyeth.third,the district court observed that montgomery lived in tennessee during the relevant periods and that wyeth is incorporated in delaware with its principal place of business in new jersey.lastly,the court determined that the indirect relationship plaintiff and defendant had in georgia weighs in favor of georgia,but is weak.see montgomery wyeth,d.
weighing these factors,the district court concluded that tennessee had the most significant relationship because tennessee was where montgomery consumed the pondimin and suffered her injury.by contrast,the only contact she had with georgia was that she purchased the product from a third party there.see id.at.
on appeal,montgomery claims that all the key events occurred in georgia and that application of the tsor does not promote any interest of the state of tennessee.we agree with the district court that tennessee has the most significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence at issue.although it has not ruled on the issue of latent injury,the tennessee supreme court has commented,in the context of adopting the discovery rule for malpractice actions,that where the injury complained of,and the harmful effect thereof develops gradually over a period of time,the injury is sustained when the harmful effect first manifests itself and becomes physically ascertainable.teeters currey,quoting layton allen,holding that a cause of action for medical malpractice accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the patient discovers or reasonably should have discovered the injury.further,based on the assertions in the complaint and evidence in the record,tennessee has the most significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence because tennessee is where montgomery sustained her injury,tennessee is her place of domicile and residence,tennessee is where she intended to and did use almost all of her pondimin tablets,and tennessee is the state where she was diagnosed and treated for her injury.wyeth also conducted business in tennessee,where pondimin was expected to be used by customers like montgomery,and where it was in fact sold during most of the time montgomery used it trahan squibb sons.applying the lex loci approach,holding that tennessee law rather than north carolina law applied to the plaintiff claim against the defendant manufacturer of des,although the plaintiff mother ingested the drug while pregnant in north carolina,because the plaintiff moved to tennessee,became pregnant,and was diagnosed with an incompetent cervix there.
although montgomery obtained pondimin in georgia,she received pondimin from a third party.she took at most a few tablets there,and she does not claim to have suffered any symptoms in georgia.none of the parties are current or former residents of georgia.montgomery alleges that her prescribing physicians received inadequate warnings from wyeth in georgia.however,there is no support in the record that her prescribing doctors reviewed wyeth inadequate warnings,relied on any other statements made by wyeth,or were uninformed about the risks of pondimin when they prescribed it to montgomery in.thus,montgomery relationship with wyeth is more significant in tennessee,the state where she actually used the manufacturer product and suffered the resulting injury,rather than georgia,the state where she obtained the product through a third party.
montgomery claims that all of the wrongful acts were consummated in georgia because she was not fully informed of the risks at the prescribing clinic.she claims that she relied on her prescribing doctors at the clinic to know the risks of pondimin and she signed a consent form at the clinic stating that such consent was necessary pursuant to georgia law and also that her treating physicians were licensed to practice in georgia.she further claims that wyeth did not adequately inform these doctors about the risks of its drugs.in support,she provides the testimony of leon lane,the medical director of clinic at the time of her treatment.lane testified that its consent form was inadequate because it was based on wyeth labeling,which did not highlight the risks for vhd and pph.she also points out that the physicians desk reference pdr,which was sent to the clinic,mentioned only four reported cases of pulmonary hypertension worldwide associated with pondimin use and no cases of pph,despite the fact that wyeth was aware of more than fifty cases of pph by may.
however,montgomery offers no proof that either shure or hargett reviewed wyeth warnings or any other statements made by wyeth.lane did not provide any evidence about the information shure or hargett had about pondimin,and he did not work at the clinic when hargett first prescribed pondimin to montgomery in june.lane offered no evidence relating to the pondimin labeling in effect when montgomery was prescribed pondimin in.lane testimony about the clinic consent form is irrelevant because it did not contain any statements made by wyeth and he did not draft it.in short,this evidence does not establish that georgia contacts are more significant than tennessee.
our decision in in re bendectin,cir,does not help montgomery.as the district court noted,bendectin applied ohio law under ohio rules because the drug was manufactured in ohio,where the manufacturer also maintained its principal place of business.pondimin was manufactured in virginia,and the wyeth entities maintain their principal places of business in pennsylvania and new jersey.bendectin does not support the proposition that georgia law should apply simply because the product was sold there.
in further support of its conclusion that tennessee law should apply,the district court applied the principles from of the restatement second conflict of laws 
t he principles in the restatement suggest tennessee law should apply.plaintiff argues tennessee has an interest in compensating its resident and georgia has an interest in regulating a product sold in its state.but this argument fails.tennessee interest is not in compensating its resident for harm done to her.such an interest may be a good idea,but that is a decision for the general assembly,not the court.the policy of tennessee as exemplified through its statute of repose is that residents who suffer from diseases with long incubation or latency periods are not entitled to recover for harms done to them.although this statute is designed to limit product liability costs for manufacturers and sellers,it is not inapplicable merely because the product was not purchased in tennessee.pondimin was sold for a short period of time in tennessee,and pph is not the only latent disease for which the legislature decided not to create an exception.to the extent tennessee wants to protect pondimin manufacturers and sellers from product liability costs,the statute advances that goal.and while georgia does have an interest in regulating a product sold there,tennessee has an interest in regulating a product used here it chooses to effect that interest by strictly limiting the time that actions can be brought.
montgomery,d at.the court further noted that,while not dispositive,the parties had already relied exclusively on tennessee law.id.
montgomery claims that the district court failed to consider whether the tsor,as applied to this case,outweighed relevant policies of other states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue.restatement second of conflict of laws b and c.see also restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.c stating that the interest of a state in having its tort rule applied in the determination of a particular issue will depend upon the purpose sought to be achieved by that rule and by the relation of the state to the occurrence and the parties.she also asserts that tennessee has no interest in a claim that is barred by tennessee law.thus,montgomery contends that,as applied to this case,the tsor does not advance tennessee interest in controlling insurance rates.further,she notes that numerous authorities have noted that statutes like the tsor do not actually lower insurance premiums,including this court in kochins,cir acknowledging that the legislative goals of the tsor are not likely to be accomplished by the means selected based on the views of various authorities.
the primary flaw in montgomery argument is that it focuses on the outcome of applying tennessee statute of repose rather than on the significance of tennessee relationship to the parties and the place of injury as required by hataway.tennessee analysis does not turn on whether a plaintiff has a viable claim in one state but not another.see restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.c a rule which exempts the actor from liability for harmful conduct is entitled to the same consideration in the process as a rule which imposes liability see also smith priority,wl,at,holding that mississippi law applied to a mississippi resident claim for retaliatory discharge from his job in mississippi for filing a worker compensation claim even though mississippi did not recognize such a claim and tennessee did cruz ford motor,d,holding that michigan law barring the plaintiff claim for punitive damages applied,even though tennessee would have allowed it.
as the tennessee supreme court has recognized,the tennessee products liability statute of repose was enacted as an important and specific measure to address products liability actions.penley honda motor,see also jones five star eng,the statute in question was enacted after lengthy debates and full consideration by the general assembly.in our opinion it represents a reasonable balancing of the conflicting interests and concerns with which the legislature had to deal.the preamble to tennessee products liability act tpla states 
whereas,the general assembly finds and declares that the number of product liability suits and claims for damages and the amount of judgments,settlements and the expense of defending such suits have increased greatly in recent years,and because of these increases,the cost of product liability insurance was substantially increased.
penley,at quoting preamble.in penley,the tennessee supreme court explained 
as the preamble to the tlpa indicates,the general assembly perceived that uncertainty as to future liability increased the premiums for product liability insurance,which in turn increased the costs of production and ultimately consumer prices.the legislature considered the limitation of future liability to a reasonable and specific period to be one of the most important keys in solving the perceived products liability crisis.
we are not in a position to alter this policy decision of the state legislature.indeed,this court and the tennessee supreme court have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the tsor.see kochins,mathis eli lilly,cir hayes motors,wl,cir unpublished per curiam jones five star eng g,harmon angus jessup,harrison schrader,see also spence miles,aff,cir stutts ford motor.and this court has rejected the criticisms made by montgomery.see kochins,at recognizing that evidence in support of fact that the statute actually reduced the cost of product liability insurance was lacking,but noting a rational basis existed between the tsor and goals expressed in the preamble.montgomery claim that liability is more likely to be determined on a national basis ignores the fact that assessing liability based on the laws of each state would obviously be part of that calculation.in short,as the district court held,tennessee has a strong interest is applying its statute of repose in products liability actions,even when that forecloses a claim by a tennessee plaintiff.
in sum,although georgia has an interest because montgomery was prescribed pondimin there,we agree with the district court conclusion that tennessee has the stronger interest for the purpose of the analysis.lemons cloer,holding that georgia had the more significant relationship to bus accident that occurred in tennessee since all of the children on the bus were georgia residents from a georgia school district,even though tennessee emergency and medical personnel responded to the accident and injured parties were taken to tennessee hospitals.
class action 
montgomery also contends that the district court erred in applying the tsor to dismiss this action.she argues that the tsor was satisfied because she made a claim for injury to person or property as a member of the brown class,which was certified before the tsor would have barred her claim.she further claims that the class included both diagnosed and latent pph claims and claimants,and that the pph claims were fully preserved and remained subject to the retained jurisdiction of the mdl court.finally she notes that she was enjoined from bringing this action until she satisfied the settlement definition of pph and could not have filed this action any earlier.
montgomery was a member of the brown class,which was approved for settlement by the court responsible in mdl.this class was certified to include all persons who ingested pondimin.upon settlement,the mdl court dismissed the class action,so the case is no longer pending.see in re diet drugs,pto,wl,at stating that t he court hereby dismisses,with prejudice the third amended complaint in this action.however,the brown class complaint expressly stated that pph claims were not being asserted.the paragraph that defines the class clearly provides that t he proposed class and subclasses do not include any claims based upon a diagnosis by a qualified physician of primary pulmonary hypertension pph suffered by a diet drug recipient.
the settlement agreement also expressly states that it does not include claims based on pph notwithstanding the foregoing,settled claims do not include claims based on pph.in re diet drugs,pto,wl,at stating that u nder the settlement agreement,claims based on pph,including claims for compensatory,punitive,exemplary or multiple damages based on pph are not settled claims in re diet drugs,mdl,wl,at.april,stating that t he settlement agreement exempts from the definition of settled claims those claims based on pph and allows a class member with this condition to sue wyeth in the tort system.
at the same time,the settlement agreement fully preserves the rights of persons who have or develop pph to sue.see in re diet drugs,pto,wl,at.the settlement agreement defines pph,and limits a plaintiff from suing until she meets that definition.
section of the settlement agreement,and pto,retain the district court continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the action,including defendants and the class members,to administer,supervise,interpret,and enforce the settlement in accordance with its terms and to enter such orders as necessary.see in re diet drugs,pto,wl,at.pto,entered on february,authorizes the district court to enforce pto,including but not limited to injunctive relief against any class member who has asserted a claim based on pph,but whose medical condition does not meet the criteria set out in the settlement agreement.
the settlement agreement bars wyeth from asserting a limitations defense unless and until the condition of the class member meets the definition of pph set forth in the settlement agreement.the settlement agreement expressly provides 
for purposes of any statute of limitations or similar time bar,the ahp released parties shall not assert that a class member actually had pph unless and until the condition of the class member meets the definition of pph set forth in section.
in the event that a class member initiates a claim based on pph,the ahp released parties shall not assert a defense based on splitting of claims,causes of action parties by virtue of the fact that the class member is included in the settlement,but the claim based on pph is not a settled claim.
the first facet of montgomery any claim will suffice to preserve the cause of unpersuasive.in requiring that an action against the manufacturer of a product for injury to person caused by its defective or unreasonably dangerous condition be brought within a certain time,does not suggest that any action against the manufacturer brought within the statute of repose preserves the ability to claim different injuries in the future.see ann.the straightforward reading of requires that an action for the injury for which a plaintiff seeks to recover be brought within the statute of repose.
cronin howe,does not support montgomery argument.in cronin,the plaintiff medical malpractice claim was timely filed and then dismissed without prejudice before it was refiled under the tennessee savings statute,a providing that if an action is filed within the statute of limitations and a judgment of dismissal entered on any ground not concluding the right of action,the action may be refiled within one year of the dismissal.under those circumstances,the tennessee supreme court held that the applicable statute of repose did not bar the plaintiff claim.here,however,montgomery did not file her pph claim within the statute of repose,id.at,and she did not refile her claim following dismissal of the initial action within the period allowed by any savings statute.id.at.in short,montgomery never filed a timely claim for pph and no savings statute is applicable.although her class action claim was based on the use of pondimin,the harm asserted was not pph.she did not file that claim until.
the second facet of montgomery t
