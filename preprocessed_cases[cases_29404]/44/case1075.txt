appellee lincoln griswold purchased a life insurance policy that was later sold to appellant coventry first llc coventry for an allegedly inflated price that included undisclosed kickbacks to the broker.griswold sued,and coventry moved to dismiss the case for lack of standing or,in the alternative,to compel arbitration.the district court denied the motion and coventry appealed.two questions are presented whether we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing and whether the district court erred when it denied a motion to compel arbitration.
this appeal arises from an alleged fraud in connection with a life settlement,which involves the sale of a life insurance policy for more than its value but less than the net death benefit.the purchaser of the policy pays the premiums until the original policy owner death,at which time the purchaser collects the death benefit.
in january,griswold purchased an million life insurance policy.he then established the lincoln griswold irrevocable trust the trust under georgia law for the sole and exclusive purpose of owning the policy and he disclaimed any personal right,title or interest in or power,privilege or incident of ownership in the trust property.he appointed wells fargo bank to serve as trustee.
two weeks after the trust was formed,griswold named griswold as its sole beneficiary according to the terms of the partnership agreement,griswold llp would dissolve once it fulfilled its limited purpose of receiving the proceeds of the life insurance policy.at that point,it would enter into a period,during which the trustee was tasked with liquidating its property,satisfying the claims of its creditors,and distributing any remaining property or the proceeds therefrom to the partners.ja.upon completion of the winding up period,the liquidating trustee would file a cancellation of the election to become a limited liability partnership to terminate the partnership.ja.
in january,the trust appointed mid atlantic financial as its exclusive agent to identify,select and appoint a broker who would help the trust sell griswold life insurance policy.ja.midatlantic selected kevin mcgarrey,who had previously assisted griswold in procuring the policy,to be the settlement broker.in march,mcgarrey reached out to appellant coventry first llc coventry,a insurer and significant player in the life settlement industry,indicating that griswold life insurance policy was for sale and that mid atlantic had authorized him to broker a life settlement for a commission of.in his complaint,griswold alleges that coventry rigged the bidding process by having mcgarrey sign a written producer agreement the secret mcgarrey agreement promising to refrain from seeking any further bids and to report any competing offers and their material terms to coventry.in exchange,coventry allegedly allowed mcgarrey to his commission to the tune of,which was more than what he was entitled to.accordingly,mcgarrey did not put the policy on the competitive market and did not pursue any other potential buyers.
coventry offered million for the griswold policy million for the policy and for mcgarrey commission.coventry and mcgarrey did not disclose the amount of broker compensation to the trust or to griswold on march,the trust sold its policy to coventry without having received a competing offer.the written purchase agreement contained the following arbitration clause 
all disputes and controversies of every kind and nature between the parties arising out of or in connection with this agreement including,but not limited to,its existence,construction,validity,interpretation or meaning,performance,enforcement,operation,breach,continuance,or termination thereof shall be submitted and settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association.
ja.once coventry acquired the life insurance policy,the trust dissolved,having fulfilled its sole purpose.the trustee,wells fargo,then transferred the proceeds of the sale to griswold llp,the sole beneficiary.in december,the partners of griswold llp filed a cancellation of limited liability partnership election in georgia state court pursuant to the llp partnership agreement.
in september,after learning of coventry alleged fraud,griswold sued coventry,coventry group,montgomery capital,coventry financial,and reid buerger,coventry executive vice president,in pennsylvania state court on behalf of himself both in his individual capacity and as the former majority partner of griswold llp and on behalf of a class of persons who had sold their life insurance policies to these defendants.griswold alleged that coventry collusion with mcgarrey to conceal his commission and rig the bidding process constituted common law fraud,fraudulent concealment,conversion,aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duties,unjust enrichment,and also violated state life settlement acts,the sherman act,and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.
because the class action sought over million in damages,coventry removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.in recognition of the fact that griswold had not signed the purchase agreement,coventry filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,or in the alternative,to compel arbitration pursuant to the purchase agreement in response,griswold filed an election to revive and reinstate and otherwise become a limited liability partnership,followed by an amended complaint adding griswold llp as a plaintiff.ja.coventry moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
the district court denied coventry motion to dismiss,finding that because griswold possesses a proprietary interest in the property of griswold llp that was injured,both lincoln griswold and the llp have article iii standing.ja.the district court then denied coventry alternative motion to compel arbitration,holding that the arbitration clause was unenforceable as to plaintiffs who are.id.coventry timely appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to d.we have appellate jurisdiction over the district court denial of defendants motion to compel arbitration pursuant to and the federal arbitration act faa,a b,which provides that a n appeal may be taken from an order denying a petition to compel arbitration.see dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber and resin intermediates,cir.
the parties dispute whether we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court denial of coventry motion to dismiss for lack of standing.coventry argues that we have not only the authority but the obligation to determine whether appellees possess standing because it is a threshold jurisdictional requirement both in the district court and on appeal.coventry br.at citing majestic star casino,llc barden development,cir as a threshold matter of justiciability,we must decide whether the debtors have standing interfaith community org.honeywell int l,cir.see also steel citizens for a better env t,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.internal citation omitted.
though coventry insists that our decision in majestic star should guide our analysis,that case bears little similarity to this appeal.there,the standing issue was raised for the first time on appeal and was inextricably intertwined with the merits of the case.majestic star,at we thus find ourselves in a circumstance where what is ordinarily the preliminary question of standing can not be answered without delving into whether the entity tax status of the debtor subsidiary is property and,if so,whether it belongs to the subsidiary or the corporate parent.thus,we had no choice but to decide the standing question in majestic star.
here,however,we must decide whether we are required to adjudicate the standing issue after it has already been decided by the district court.as we stated in petroleos mexicanos refinacion king a ex tbilisi,cir,t here are countless cases where a district court rejects a defendant challenge to the plaintiff standing in that posture,defendants simply may not seek immediate review in the court of appeals.id.at.in other words,although standing is always a threshold issue,standing to appeal should not be confused with standing to sue.once a district court has determined that a plaintiff has standing to sue,our power to adjudicate that issue on an interlocutory basis is limited.
coventry argues that we can and should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court ruling on the standing question.pendent appellate jurisdiction exists where an appealable issue is so inextricably intertwined with a nonappealable issue that one can not resolve the former without addressing the latter.dupont,at.because we have jurisdiction to review the order of the district court compelling arbitration,coventry argues,we should assert jurisdiction over the order denying coventry motion to dismiss for lack of standing.we disagree.
the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is indisputably narrow and should be used sparingly and only where there is a sufficient overlap in the facts relevant to both the appealable and nonappealable issues to warrant plenary review.id.emphasis in original in re montgomery county,cir pendent appellate jurisdiction over an otherwise unappealable order is available only to the extent necessary to ensure meaningful review of an appealable order.internal quotation marks and citation omitted swint chambers cnty.comm n,warning that loosely allowing pendent appellate jurisdiction would encourage parties to parlay collateral orders into interlocutory appeal tickets.
in dupont,we considered whether we could review the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction an otherwise nonappealable order pendent to our review of a denial of a motion to compel arbitration an appealable order.we held that the jurisdictional question was not sufficiently intertwined with the merits of the appealable order,requiring us to exercise restraint and forego review until the unrelated issue is appealable in its own right.dupont,at citing united states fidelity guaranty braspetro oil serv,cir.
as personal jurisdiction and standing are both threshold jurisdictional questions,our reasoning in dupont applies here.moreover,as coventry has acknowledged,coventry reply br.at,two of our sister courts have declined to extend pendent appellate jurisdiction to adjudicate district court orders on standing.summit medical,pryor,cir finding that the appealable dismissal on eleventh amendment immunity grounds was not inextricably entwined with the nonappealable standing issue triad,robinson,cir to further beat the jurisdictional dead horse,we do not find that the nonappealable collateral standing issue is inextricably entwined with the appealable qualified immunity inquiry nor that there are compelling reasons that would justify invoking our rarely appropriate pendent appellate jurisdiction.internal citation omitted.
like the eleventh circuit in summit medical and the seventh circuit in triad associates,the issues before us now are not sufficiently intertwined to support the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction.regardless of how we adjudicate the standing question,we may still reach the arbitration question.moreover,the factual underpinnings of the issues are distinct the standing issue involves an inquiry into whether griswold llp remains in existence and can bring claims on behalf of the trust as its sole beneficiary.in contrast,the question of arbitrability requires us to decide whether griswold llp,a to the purchase agreement,can be bound to its arbitration clause because it reaped the benefits of the contract.the two considerations are discrete and neither issue determination is dependent upon the other.
in sum,we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court denial of coventry motion to dismiss because it is not inextricably intertwined with the denial of the motion to compel arbitration,nor is its review necessary to adjudicate the arbitrability issue.
we turn next to the district court order denying coventry motion to compel arbitration,which the parties and the court agree is now subject to our review.faa,a b providing that an appeal may be taken from an order denying a petition to compel arbitration.

in this appeal,it is undisputed that the purchase agreement contained a broad arbitration clause requiring the parties to arbitrate any disputes arising out of the contract courts generally apply a presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration clauses.preston ferrer,stating that the faa established a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution dupont,at citing sandvik ab advent int l,cir the faa establishes a strong federal policy in favor of compelling arbitration over litigation.internal quotation marks omitted.coventry argues that because griswold claims touch matters covered by an arbitration clause in a contract those claims must be arbitrated.coventry br.at quoting brayman construction home insurance,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the presumption in favor of arbitration does not extend,however,to to an agreement it applies only when both parties have consented to and are bound by the arbitration clause.see united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation co,a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.bel ray,chemrite pty,cir if a party has not agreed to arbitrate,the courts have no authority to mandate that he do so.still,a may be bound by an arbitration agreement if traditional principles of state law allow a contract to be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract.arthur andersen llp carlisle,see also dupont,at a nonsignatory may be bound to an arbitration agreement if under traditional principles of contract the party is akin to a signatory of the underlying agreement internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
