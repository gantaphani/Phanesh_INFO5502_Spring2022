eric eisenberg eisenberg appeals the district court dismissal of his complaint alleging two claims of negligence against wachovia bank,wachovia.we affirm.
the district court dismissed eisenberg complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we state the relevant facts as alleged by the complaint.see harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir in its review of rule b dismissals,this court must accept as true all of the appellant allegations and must construe factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
eisenberg was the victim of a fraudulent investment scheme perpetrated by douglas walter reid reid.reid falsely represented to eisenberg that he was a senior vice president of bear stearns companies,a large financial securities firm,and convinced eisenberg to make a putative investment.at reid direction,eisenberg transferred via electronic wire to a wachovia branch bank in north carolina for deposit in an account bearing the name douglas walter reid dba bear stearns,for further credit to bear stearns.the electronic transfer was made through the fedwire wire service operated by the federal reserve bank.wachovia accepted the transfer and deposited the funds to the credit of the specified account,which had been opened by and was under the control of reid.reid withdrew almost all of eisenberg funds and converted them to his own use.
wachovia customer agreements do not restrict the name under which a new customer may open a bank account.the wachovia employee who opened reid account did not verify that reid was authorized to operate under the name bear stearns.reid possessed no such authority and was not in any way affiliated with bear stearns.
eisenberg filed a complaint against wachovia in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,see,asserting two claims of negligence.the first claim alleged that wachovia negligently allowed reid to establish and operate a fraudulent bank account and negligently failed to train its employees to detect fraud.the second claim alleged that wachovia was vicariously liable for its employee negligence in allowing reid to open the bank account without proper verification.both claims include the allegation that wachovia breached a duty of care owed to people like eisenberg,who transact with wachovia customers,to detect and prevent the fraudulent use of its bank accounts.
wachovia moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.wachovia argued that both negligence claims are preempted by federal reserve board regulation j regulation j,subpart b.wachovia also argued,in the alternative,that the claims fail as a matter of law because wachovia does not owe eisenberg a duty of care.agreeing that the claims are preempted,the district court granted wachovia motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the court did not address wachovia alternative argument for dismissal based on the absence of a duty of care.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of the complaint and can affirm on any basis fairly supported by the record.korb lehman,cir.we hold that regulation j does not preempt eisenberg negligence claims but the claims still fail because wachovia does not owe eisenberg a duty of care under the facts of this case.
we discussed the preemptive effect of regulation j in donmar enterprises,southern national bank of north carolina,cir.subpart b of regulation j incorporates article of the uniform commercial code to provide rules to govern funds transfers through fedwire.a see id.at a b.the rules adopted from article serve as the exclusive means for determining the rights,duties and liabilities of all parties involved in a fedwire funds transfer.comm.on b,part,subpt,app.a.affected parties include senders,intermediary banks,receiving banks and beneficiaries.id.the federal reserve board intended subpart b to create a uniform and comprehensive national regulation of fedwire transfers.donmar,at.
by its own terms,regulation j supersedes or inconsistent provisions of state law.comm.on,part,subpt.b,app.a.we held in donmar that regulation j preempts any state law cause of action premised on conduct falling within the scope of subpart b,whether the state law conflicts with or is duplicative of subpart at.determining if a state law claim is preempted by regulation j turns on whether the challenged conduct in the state claim would be covered under subpart b as well.
eisenberg negligence claims focus on several aspects of wachovia conduct in establishing reid account and crediting eisenberg funds transfer to that account.one instance of alleged negligence involves wachovia accepting and crediting the wire transfer to reid account when the wire instructions designated bear stearns as the intended recipient.eisenberg addressed the fedwire transfer to wachovia bank,beneficiary account,for further credit to bear stearns.subpart b applies here.when a transfer order identifies the beneficiary by an account number,the receiving bank may rely on the account number in crediting the account even though the transfer order identifies a person different from the holder of the account.see.wachovia properly processed eisenberg funds transfer order under the standards of subpart 
wachovia is not liable under subpart b for the manner in which it received and credited eisenberg fedwire funds transfer.any state law claim that is premised on this same conduct would be either duplicative of or contradictory to regulation j and is thus preempted.eisenberg negligence claims are preempted insofar as they challenge wachovia fedwire transfer processing.
eisenberg contends,however,that his negligence claims primarily challenge not the wire transfer processing but rather wachovia conduct in allowing reid to open and operate the bank account under the name dba bear stearns.the fedwire transfer,according to eisenberg,is only incidental to his negligence claims.eisenberg thus urges that his negligence claims are not preempted by regulation j.we agree.
eisenberg allegations of negligence are not limited to wachovia conduct in processing the fedwire transfer order.eisenberg also alleged that wachovia is negligent by reason of allowing reid to open the dba bear stearns bank account,failing to discover reid improper use of the account and failing to train its employees to recognize and prevent fraud.subpart b has no application to wachovia conduct in these instances.subpart b governs only fedwire funds transfers,defined as the series of transactions,beginning with the originator payment order,made for the purpose of making payment to the beneficiary of the order.comm.to,part,subpt.b,app.b.subpart b does not address the duties,obligations and liabilities applicable to bank functions having nothing to do with a fedwire transfer.
state law claims premised on conduct not covered by subpart b can not create a conflict with or duplicate the rules established in subpart permitting eisenberg claims to go forward would not create an obstacle to the fulfillment of subpart b purpose of establishing a uniform body of federal law to govern fedwire transfers.see fidelity fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d holding state law claim preempted if it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress internal quotations and citation omitted.a finding that wachovia is negligent in opening reid account would not conflict with a finding that,under subpart b of regulation j,wachovia properly credited the fedwire transfer to the account.the two findings would touch on distinct and independent conduct by wachovia.
we hold that eisenberg negligence claims,insofar as they challenge the opening and management of reid account,are not preempted by regulation 
wachovia reasserts on appeal an alternative argument for dismissal,not decided by the district court,that eisenberg fails to allege one essential element in a negligence claim.wachovia contends that it does not owe eisenberg a duty of care and therefore can not be held liable in negligence for eisenberg injury.
under north carolina law,n egligence is the failure to exercise proper care in the performance of a legal duty o
