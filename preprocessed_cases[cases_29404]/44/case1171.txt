opinion of the court 
christian bouriez and montanelle beeher,collectively referred to as bouriez appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of carnegie mellon university cmu with respect to bouriez fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation claims.the issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding that bouriez failed to establish that cmu proximately caused bouriez losses because we conclude that the district court proximate cause analysis was in error,we will vacate the grant of summary judgment to cmu and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we state the facts in the light most favorable to bouriez.carnegie mellon research institute cmri was an unincorporated,organizational unit of defendant cmu.cmri was engaged in scientific research and development for government agencies and industrial entities whom cmri called sponsors.
in july,an entity called governors refining technologies,llc grt and a related entity,governors technologies corporation gtc collectively referred to as governors,agreed to sponsor a catalytic cracking project that cmu had been developing.t he primary goal of this project was to demonstrate an efficient process that uses suitable catalysts in conjunction with microwaves to selectively crack hydrocarbons.joint appendix.the term cracking refers to the breaking down of heavier hydrocarbons into lighter hydrocarbons of a more useful range.id.if successful,microwave heating would have provided a better alternative to traditional heating methods that use large quantities of energy,and would have reduce d the environmental impact of industrial waste.governors agreed to fund cmu development of microwave technology in exchange for the right to license any technology developed.governors had no assets except the rights to the technology.
plaintiff christian bouriez is an investor who resides in london,england.plaintiff montanelle beeher,is an entity incorporated and owned by bouriez.bouriez traveled to pittsburgh to learn about the work being done by cmri under governors sponsorship.governors provided bouriez with a business plan and a project plan written by cmri.bouriez also met with cmri and governors representatives on three occasions in.cmu business plan emphasized its good name and scientific expertise in microwave technology.
in encouraging bouriez to invest in microwave technology,cmu presented him with a document entitled proposal for a project plan for microwave enhanced catalytic processing hereinafter december proposal.cmu gave this same document to governors earlier to obtain governors investment.see.in the december proposal,cmu represented,inter alia,that certain technological improvements have been demonstrated and that cmri reached the proof of concept stage of development for the technology.the december proposal also listed several purported microwave enhancements that cmri had proven.in addition,bouriez indicated during his deposition that alberto guzman,the assistant director of the cmu division undertaking the microwave project,told him that proof of concept had been established.i understood from guzman that this technology was working.i understood that this technology was feasible.i understood that this technology was commercially viable.
furthermore,in a presentation to bouriez in july,cmu indicated that the phase of its research would be completed within six months and that the commercialization phase would begin approximately two years thereafter.in a later presentation,cmu provided financial projections estimating that governors would generate million in profits by the year,based on the state of the research.in a letter,guzman claimed that these projections were good and conservative.
on october,bouriez signed two written agreements the share purchase agreement and the shareholders agreement.pursuant to these agreements,bouriez invested million in governors to fund the work being done by cmri under governors sponsorship.in exchange,bouriez received million shares of governors stock,which he still owns.the price of these shares was based entirely on the potential value of governors contract with cmu and the microwave technology that it was funding.bouriez expert concluded that besides its contract with cmu,governors had no other significant assets or means of achieving profit.moreover,the share purchase agreement explicitly stated that governors had no other assets and that no public market existed for its shares.prior to investing in governors,bouriez did not retain an independent advisor with microwave or petroleum processing expertise to evaluate the microwave technology that cmri claimed to have developed.i relied on what people of cmri told me in making the investment.
in september,bouriez and cmri learned that governors was out of money.cmri and bouriez were also told that two officers of governors had diverted approximately million of the funds invested by bouriez to pay for a debt unrelated to the work being done by cmri.the two officers diverted this money without authorization of governors board of directors.id.it remains unclear,however,whether the diverted money actually included any of bouriez investment because cmu acknowledged that governors had many other investors whose money could have comprised the diversion.we admitted that we were informed of the diversion.we do know that it was bouriez money.all we know is that gtc money was diverted to another company that money that was to go to pay us for the project.
on december,cmri stopped working for governors because it was not paid amounts that governors allegedly owed.cmu directly solicited an additional investment from bouriez,however.bouriez was prepared to make another investment,but this time decided to obtain an independent audit first.contrary to cmu representations,the independent auditor concluded that proof of concept of microwave enhancement effect in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons did not exist in summer.the independent auditor further concluded that the microwave enhancement effect was not proved in and it is not today.id.
bouriez trial expert agreed with these findings in reality all of the information available suggests that cmu was still very much in the ideation stage in late,even after three years of sporadic activity in the area of microwave processing of hydrocarbon streams.the expert also concluded that cmu never subsequently established proof of concept.furthermore,david purta,the lead scientist on the microwave project,admitted during his deposition that cmu had not developed a technology that could achieve the same results as conventional catalytic cracking processes at environments of lower temperatures.
bouriez instituted this action against cmu in december,alleging fraudulent misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.on january,cmu filed an arbitration demand against,inter alia,bouriez and governors.cmu moved the district court to compel bouriez to join that arbitration.the district court granted cmu motion,but this court reversed,holding that because bouriez claims deal with his shareholder agreement,and not the agreement defining the contractual relationship between governors and cmu,bouriez was one step removed from the agreement and,therefore,is not equitably estopped from avoiding the arbitration clause contained in that agreement.bouriez carnegie mellon,cir.
after the parties in this case completed discovery and were awaiting trial,the arbitrator issued an opinion and final award in favor of governors and against cmu,concluding that cmu falsely represented to governors that its microwave technology worked the arbitrator ordered cmu to pay governors in rescissory damages,interest,costs,and fees.cmu declined to appeal the arbitrator decision and satisfied the award.
thereafter,bouriez and cmu filed cross motions for summary judgment.bouriez argued that the arbitrator findings were binding through collateral estoppel and that those findings established each element of his claims.cmu asserted that because it had satisfied the arbitration award to governors,bouriez could not prove any damages caused by cmu alleged misrepresentations.bouriez responded that his claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation were still valid because governors was in the process of dissolving and bouriez argued that he would not get his full million investment back.specifically,bouriez expected to receive only approximately million of the arbitration award upon governors dissolution because approximately million of the arbitration award went towards paying governors legal fees,governors must satisfy legitimate business expenses before dissolution,and bouriez only owns percent of governors stock.bouriez also,however,withdrew his unjust enrichment claim,acknowledging that cmu rescission of all funds it received in connection with the investment in microwave technology terminated this claim.
the district court granted cmu motion and denied bouriez motion,holding that bouriez failed to offer evidence that cmu misrepresentations proximately caused his damages beyond a share of the arbitration award.specifically,the district court held that because bouriez claims are based on those very same misrepresentations,they 
caused the very same damages to both governors and plaintiffs,and those damages,as measured by the arbitrator,are the full amount of monies governors had invested with cmu pursuant to the rescinded agreement,which monies cmu has already paid back in full,with interest.thus cmu has disgorged to governors all monies invested by plaintiffs that were passed through governors to cmu for use on the project.
bouriez carnegie mellon,wl,at,emphasis in original.
the district court rejected bouriez argument that cmu caused some independent injuries or damage to him,or that his damages were somehow distinct from governors damages.see id.the district court concluded that 
plaintiffs may have lost million but not as a result of cmu misrepresentations what was lost as a result of cmu representations was all the monies cmu was ordered to return to governors when its agreement with cmu was rescinded,which included all of plaintiffs investment that was channeled through governors for the project.cmu proximately caused exactly all of the economic loss represented by the monies it returned to governors.
id.emphasis in original.finally,the district court concluded that t o the extent plaintiffs investment in governors is no longer worth million,plaintiffs have not offered any record evidence to show that the entirety of any lost value is attributable to cmu misrepresentations,rather than the million diversion of funds by governors directors and other forces.id.
bouriez now appeals,arguing that the district court incorrectly assumed that the arbitration award represented the full universe of damages caused by cmu misrepresentations.

the central issue in this appeal is whether bouriez has presented evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether cmu proximately caused the loss of his investment in governors.proximate cause is a question of law to be decided by the trial court.holt navarro.the court must ascertain whether a defendant acts or omissions were a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff harm.first zem zem temple.in making this determination,pennsylvania courts apply the factors listed in restatement second of torts

see,brown phila.college of osteopathic,quoting and relying on restatement second of torts.
bouriez argues that the district court misapplied the substantial factor test because it focused on the wrong loss.we agree.referencing a of the restatement,the district court held that the existence of other factors,such as the million diversion of bouriez funds,was clear.it then looked at the shortfall between bouriez investment in governors and the distribution bouriez will receive after governors dissolution.the court held that cmu misrepresentations were not a substantial factor in causing the shortfall,attributing it to the diversion and other factors instead.accordingly,the district court concluded that cmu was entitled to summary judgment because bouriez failed to establish that cmu proximately caused his loss.
in assessing proximate cause,however,the relevant question is not whether cmu misrepresentations were a substantial factor in causing the shortfall,but whether they were a substantial factor in causing bouriez failed investment in governors.this is because the entire million failed investment is the relevant injury for the purpose of analyzing proximate cause in this case.by emphasizing,instead,the difference between bouriez investment in governors and the distribution bouriez will receive after governors dissolution,the district court focused on potential damages in this case,rather than on the injury.only the latter is relevant to the proximate cause inquiry,for although the actions of a third party or other forces can mitigate or even eliminate the ultimate damages award,those forces do not change the fact of the initial injury and the cause of that injury.as discussed bel
