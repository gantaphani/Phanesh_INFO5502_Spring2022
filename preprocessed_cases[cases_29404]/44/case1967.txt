this and bivens fourth amendment related case has its origins in the search of the home of michael and deborah michalik the michaliks.the search was conducted under a warrant issued as part of an investigation into a new orleans drug operation,involving several local,state,and federal officers.the search failed to uncover any evidence of illegal activity,and the michaliks brought suit against those involved in the procurement and execution of the warrant.the michaliks contend that the officers relied on stale information to claim that michalik stashed drugs at their home.
in the over five years since the complaint was filed,the case has provided an web of claims and defendants.at issue in these consolidated appeals is the district court denial of qualified immunity to six on various claims relating to the procurement of the search warrant,the search of the home,the forcible entry of the home.see michalik hermann,wl.
we hold that levis and toye are entitled to qualified immunity for claims based on the procurement of the warrant because neither prepared,presented,nor signed the application for the search warrant.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of qualified immunity as to levis and toye on claims relating to the procurement of the warrant and toye on claims relating to the search of the home.however,we hold that material issues of fact exist as to the conduct of guillot,hermann,clark and jones in the forcible entry of the home.accordingly,we dismiss this interlocutory appeal as to those claims for want of jurisdiction.
in early,officer paul toye toye of the new orleans police department and agent eric levis levis of the federal drug enforcement agency dea began separate investigations of a drug ring in new orleans,louisiana.toye and levis combined their efforts,and the investigation broadened to include police authorities in jefferson,bernard,and tammany parishes.
in august,the new orleans police department requested wiretaps through the louisiana state police.trooper john fitzpatrick fitzpatrick became the case agent for the louisiana state police.the wiretaps were concluded in early november.search warrants were then issued for seventeen houses,and arrest warrants were issued for individuals.fitzpatrick was the sole affiant on the application for search warrant for jean baptiste in chalmette,louisiana,the michaliks home.an arrest warrant was also issued for michalik,gene taglialavore taglialavore.taglialavore had resided at jean baptiste from to,but his permanent address was in nevada at the time the warrant was issued.
the search warrant was executed by eight to ten officers of various jurisdictions on november at approximately only four of the executing officers have been explicitly identified by name kevin guillot guillot of the new orleans police department and mike hermann,harrell clark,and shennandoah jones,all of the bernard parish sheriff department collectively,the bernard defendants.the michaliks were detained for approximately two hours while the house was searched.no drugs or other evidence of illegal activity was found in either the initial search or in a second search conducted with the use of a drug dog.
the michaliks filed their original complaint in november,alleging that their home was searched unlawfully because the officers relied on stale information to determine that taglialavore had stashed drugs at jean baptiste.in their original complaint,they sought damages and other relief based on alleged violations of the constitution and louisiana state law against the federal,state,and local law enforcement officers and their respective agencies and governmental entities,including the united states.
because of the number of parties and claims involved,the procedural posture of this case is exceptionally complicated.we will relate only what is necessary to understand the issues on appeal.
on november,the michaliks filed their first amended and supplemental complaint,adding a claim under the federal tort claims act ftca against the united states,alleging violations of and the united states,along with other named federal defendants,filed a motion to dismiss the michaliks amended complaint.the district court dismissed the claim with prejudice because the michaliks failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing,and more than six months had elapsed from the date on which the plaintiffs actually exhausted their administrative remedies.see a and b.
the michaliks submitted two additional amended complaints,naming federal defendants in their personal capacities and alleging the dual status of levis as a dea agent and member of the bernard parish sheriff department.
we now turn to recount the procedural history of this litigation with respect to each,beginning with levis.levis filed no answer to the michaliks third amended complaint,but instead filed a motion to dismiss,asserting qualified immunity and the judgment bar provision of the ftca.the district court denied levis motion to dismiss and similarly denied levis motion to reconsider.on may,levis filed a motion for summary judgment,again raising qualified immunity and the ftca judgment bar.the district court denied the motion for summary judgment on august.levis now appeals the district court order denying him both dismissal on ftca grounds and qualified immunity on federal law claims relating to the procurement of the warrant.
we next consider toye and guillot of the new orleans police department.on january,the district court granted summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,dismissing all federal claims against all defendants,including toye and guillot.the michaliks filed a federal rule of civil procedure motion,arguing that the court grant of summary judgment was premature in view of ongoing discovery.the district court granted the michaliks motion in part,reinstating federal claims against toye as to the procurement of the search warrant.on may,the new orleans police defendants filed for summary judgment on the remaining claims.in its august order,the district court dismissed all claims against every named new orleans police defendant,except toye and guillot.the district court reinstated the federal claims against guillot,noting that material issues of fact exist as to guillot role in the forcible entry of the michaliks home.the district court also reinstated claims against toye regarding the search and forcible entry of the home,as well as the procurement of the search warrant as noted above.toye and guillot now appeal the district court order.
finally,we turn to the bernard defendants.on december,the bernard defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court granted qualified immunity to the bernard defendants on all federal excessive force claims arising out of the search itself,ordering the federal claims dismissed with prejudice.the district court denied the michaliks motion for reconsideration,specifically holding that the police action during the search was objectively reasonable.on may,the bernard defendants filed a separate motion for summary judgment to dismiss all remaining state law claims.in its august order,the district court granted summary judgment to the bernard defendants for state law claims arising out of the procurement of the warrant,and also held as a matter of law that the officers conduct inside the house was not unreasonable under state tort law principles.the district court,however,denied the motion for summary judgment as to hermann,clark,and jones on the federal and state law claims in conjunction with the forcible entry of the michaliks home.the bernard defendants now appeal.
to sum up,the six appeal the denial of qualified immunity for the following claims federal claims only against levis for procurement of the warrant federal and state claims against toye for procurement of the warrant,search of the home,and forcible entry of the home federal and state claims against guillot for forcible entry of the home federal and state claims against the bernard defendants for forcible entry of the home 
the denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not a final,appealable order over which we have jurisdiction.under the collateral order doctrine,however,a small class of interlocutory orders that conclusively determine,important issues,which are separate from the merits of the action,and which would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,are deemed final for the purposes of appeal.reyes city of richmond,texas,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.a district court denial of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable decision under the collateral order doctrine.mitchell forsyth,d johnson jones,d.we have no jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal,however,when a district court denial of qualified immunity rests on the basis that genuine issues of material fact exist.see reyes,at.
we review a district court denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.see gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.any reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party.gowesky,at citations omitted.
evaluating qualified immunity is a process.first,we determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional or statutory right.see siegert gilley,d.a right is clearly established if its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.wooley city of baton rouge,cir internal citations omitted.if the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established right,the next step for us is to determine whether the official conduct was objectively reasonable under the law at the time of the incident.see sanchez swyden,cir citations omitted.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity.see,bennett city of grand prairie,cir.
we begin by examining the district court denial of qualified immunity to levis and toye for claims related to procurement of the search warrant the district court concluded that neither levis nor toye were subject to franks because the michaliks identified no false statement attributable to levis or toye that appeared anywhere in the warrant application.nevertheless,the district court denied qualified immunity to levis and toye,finding that there were material factual disputes as to whether they were liable under malley briggs,d.the district court concluded that if the officers are ultimately found to have played a significant enough role in procuring the warrant,their conduct may expose them to liability under the principles of malley.wl,at.so,let us examine malley and the district court application of it to this case.
in malley,the officer in charge of the investigation presented criminal complaints to the state judge charging the defendants with felony marijuana possession.the complaints were accompanied by supporting affidavits signed by the officer and by unsigned arrest warrants for the judge signature.at.on the basis of the complaints and affidavits,the judge signed and issued the warrants.id.the defendants were arrested,tried,and acquitted.id.they then brought a claim against the affiant officer,charging that he violated their fourth amendment rights by applying for warrants without a showing of probable cause.id.the officer contended that he was entitled to absolute immunity from suit because the state court judge had approved,executed,and issued the warrants,exonerating the officer from further liability.id.at.the supreme court described the issue thusly the degree of the immunity accorded a defendant police officer in a damages action under when it is alleged that the officer caused the plaintiffs to be unconstitutionally arrested by presenting a judge with a complaint and a supporting affidavit which failed to establish probable cause.id.at.emphasis added.the court concluded that such an officer is not entitled to absolute immunity.the court further held,however,that the officer who applies for a search warrant may be entitled to qualified immunity if his actions are objectionably reasonable.throughout its opinion,the court made clear that the specific and narrow question before it was whether a reasonably officer in petitioner position would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for the warrant.id.at.emphasis added.thus,our reading of the case makes clear to us that malley specifically decided only whether the officer who actually presents or applies for the warrant is liable.
the district court here,however,stated that t he principles enunciated in malley apply not only to those officers who sign and present the warrant to the issuing judge but also to those officers who prepare the warrant application.wl,at.the district court cited bennett city of grand prairie,as support for this understanding of malley.we agree with the district court that bennett seems to move the malley holding a step forward.
in bennett,several officers were engaged in the investigation,preparation,and presentation of the facts that ultimately were presented to the magistrate judge who issued the arrest warrant.at.the detective in charge of the investigation prepared,but did not present,the supporting affidavit.id.under the procedures of that police department,the officer who actually signed and presented the affidavit to the only in a perfunctory role that is,he had no knowledge of the facts,but depended solely upon the supplied affidavit id.the investigators,the detective in charge,and the affiant were sued under for effecting an arrest without probable cause.id.
our opinion in bennett focused primarily on the question of whether probable cause supported the arrest of the two on the nuances of liability under malley.we were concerned largely with the detective who prepared the affidavit,and we addressed in particular the reliability of the facts that he used to make allegations in the affidavit.with respect to the narrow malley issue,we must say that the opinion is not absolutely clear that the detective liability rested explicitly on malley.we did assume,for purposes of assessing the detective fourth amendment liability and his entitlement to qualified immunity,that the facts known to the detective would be insufficient to give him probable cause to arrest the defendant and that the facts in the affidavit that he prepared were insufficient to establish probable cause for the arrests.id.at.in assuming the detective fourth amendment liability as the preparer of the affidavit,we made only a short reference to malley a police officer may be held liable in his individual capacity for filing an application for an arrest warrant without probable cause,the supreme court held in malley briggs.id.at emphasis added.citing malley,we noted that with respect to the detective the question was whether a reasonable officer in the defendant position would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for the warrant.id.without addressing that the detective had not,in fact,applied for the warrant,we went on to find that the detective actions were objectively reasonable and he was entitled to qualified immunity.we will return later to the district court application of malley to deny qualified immunity to levis and toye on the warrant claims.
turning now to the michaliks arguments concerning the warrant claims,they primarily urge that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the denial of qualified immunity here is based on issues of fact relating to levis and toye role in procuring the warrant.johnson,at.reyes,at.this argument,however,assumes that there is no issue of law regarding the applicability of malley and that malley applies to the alleged facts.
in contending that malley establishes liability for officers,the michaliks argue that the supreme court has cautioned aga
