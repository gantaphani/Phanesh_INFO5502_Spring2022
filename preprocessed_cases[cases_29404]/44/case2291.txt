after eight years of failed negotiations and ignored orders,the united states sued george rudy cundiff who goes by rudy and his son,christopher seth cundiff who goes by seth,seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against them for discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without a permit in violation of the clean water act.the district court granted summary judgment for the government,imposed injunctive relief in the form of a restoration plan for the cundiffs wetlands,and imposed a civil penalty of.all but of that penalty was suspended,however,provided that the cundiffs implemented the restoration plan.the district court also dismissed the cundiffs array of statutory,common law,and constitutional counterclaims.while the original appeal in this case was pending,the supreme court issued its splintered ruling in rapanos united states,d,which defined the act jurisdiction over waters of the united states.in light of rapanos,we returned the case to the district court to reconsider whether jurisdiction was proper over the cundiffs wetlands.the district court determined that it was because the cundiffs wetlands were in fact waters of the united states,and the cundiffs appealed.we affirm the district court on all grounds.
defendants rudy and seth cundiff own two adjacent tracts of land in muhlenberg county,kentucky.their properties together sit next to pond and caney creeks,which are tributaries of the green river.the green river,in turn,flows into the ohio river.in,rudy cundiff bought the southern tract,which contains roughly acres of wetlands and an upland area where his house sits.when rudy bought it,portions of the wetlands contained exceptionally acidic orangish to reddish colored water that had drained out of an abandoned coal mine located on a neighbor nearby property.as a result,locals referred to the cundiffs property as a putrid eyesore,and this stagnant,discolored water caused the wetlands to become a festering mosquito the cundiffs knew all this when they bought it shortly after his purchase,cundiff began excavating drainage ditches and clearing trees to make the wetlands suitable for farming.
in october,federal officials from the army corps of engineers and state officials from the kentucky division of water observed ditches,artificially filled wetlands,and mechanically cleared land on the wetlands.the corps suspected possible clean water act violations.rudy had failed to obtain a section permit as required for such dredging and filling activities,and further inspection revealed that cundiff had excavated ditches in the wetlands and placed dredged material into them as filler known as sidecasting.consequently,the corps sent him a letter specifically prohibiting any further activity involving the placement of excavated or fill material into these jurisdictional wetlands without a federal permit.
federal and state officials then began meeting with cundiff in,though they reached no agreement.instead,he insisted on converting the wetlands into farmland and continued to drain and clear the property.the corps referred the matter to the environmental protection agency.over the next several years,cundiff continued his draining and ditch digging activities,simply ignoring whatever government directives came his way.in he planted wheat on the southern tract,and government officials observed downed trees in that area.the epa issued an order of compliance informing him that he had violated the clean water act by depositing fill material into waters of the united states without authorization,and it directed him to immediately cease participating in or causing any additional discharges of pollutants.
in rudy son,seth,purchased a tract of land located north of rudy which contains roughly acres of wetlands.seth leases this property back to rudy for the exact amount of the mortgage payment.rudy quickly began excavating and clearing that property as well,activity of which seth was aware.in october,officials from the epa informed rudy cundiff that he needed a permit for this work too.that,though he knew he needed a permit,he thought the corps would never grant him one so he planned on digging his ditches anyway.he eventually completed a foot ditch through the wetlands that extended all the way to caney creek,and the dredged material was sidecast into the wetlands to dry them out to make them arable.in,kentucky officials told cundiff that he was destroying wetlands without a permit in violation of state law he ignored this too,and the epa issued additional orders of compliance to both rudy and seth cundiff requiring them to cease their excavation activities and to restore the unauthorized ditches by refilling them.the cundiffs responded to these orders as they had to the others.
the united states finally sued both rudy and seth cundiff,alleging that they violated section a of the clean water act for discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without a permit.a.the district court granted the united states motion for summary judgment,thus finding the cundiffs liable,and,after a bench trial,permanently enjoined them from discharging dredged or fill material or any other pollutants into waters of the united states which it concluded that the cundiffs wetlands were and imposed a civil penalty of but suspended of that pending the cundiffs adequate implementation of the restoration plan.the defendants appealed,and while that appeal was pending,the supreme court decided rapanos united states,d,which addressed the scope of the term waters of the united states in the clean water act.the parties jointly moved for a limited remand from this court so the district court could reconsider whether jurisdiction over the wetlands was proper,and this court remanded the case on that question.the district court concluded that the cundiffs wetlands were waters of the united states,and the cundiffs now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in the government favor imposition of a civil penalty and injunctive relief and the dismissal of their counterclaims.

congress enacted the clean water act in to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.section a of the act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person except in compliance with the act.a.d ischarge of any pollutant is broadly defined to mean any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a.in turn,pollutant is defined to include not only traditional contaminants,but also solids such as dredged spoil,rock,sand and cellar dirt.the act defines navigable waters to mean the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.
the act also sets up two permit schemes.section a authorizes the secretary of the army through the united states army corps of engineers,or a state with an approved program,to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.a.section authorizes the environmental protection agency or a state with an approved program to issue a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit for the discharge of pollutants other than dredged or fill material.the corps and the epa share responsibility for implementing and enforcing section.see,b c.
although at one time the term navigable waters included only waters that were navigable in fact,the daniel ball,wall,navigable waters is a defined term in the act that expressly includes all waters of the united states.the supreme court has repeatedly recognized that,with this definition,congress evidently intended to repudiate limits that had been placed on federal regulation by earlier water pollution control statutes and to exercise its powers under the commerce clause to regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed navigable under the classical understanding of that term.united states riverside bayview homes,d.as a result,the corps and epa have put out substantively equivalent regulatory definitions of waters of the united states,compare a,with s,that define it to encompass not only traditional navigable waters of the kind susceptible to use in interstate commerce,but also tributaries of traditional navigable waters and wetlands adjacent to covered waters.see a,a,a.
are the wetlands waters of the united states 
rapanos involved two consolidated cases in which the act had been applied to actual or proposed discharges of pollutants into wetlands adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries of traditional navigable waters.at.although there was no single majority opinion,all the justices agreed that the statutory phrase waters of the united states encompasses some waters not navigable in the traditional sense.see id.at scalia,plurality opinion id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment id.at.stevens,dissenting.the plurality interpreted the act to cover relatively permanent,standing,or continuously flowing bodies of water,at,that are connected to traditional navigable waters,id.at,as well as wetlands with a continuous surface connection to such water bodies.id.at.observing that the act reference to relatively permanent waters d id not necessarily exclude streams,rivers,or lakes that might dry up in extraordinary circumstances,such as drought,or seasonal rivers,which contain continuous flow during some months of the year but no flow during dry months.
justice kennedy,writing only for himself,interpreted the term to cover wetlands that possess a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment quoting solid waste agency united states army corps.of eng,d.he explained 
w etlands possess the requisite nexus,and thus come within the statutory phrase navigable waters,if the wetlands,either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,significantly affect the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as navigable.when,in contrast,wetlands effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial,they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the statutory term navigable waters.
id.at.and justice kennedy,relying on riverside bayview,concluded that the corps assertion of jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to waters may be met by showing adjacency alone.id.on the other hand,where the wetlands are adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries,a bsent more specific regulations,justice kennedy would require the government to establish a significant nexus on a basis.id.he therefore concurred in the judgment vacating the lower court decision and voted to remand the case for more on whether the government could prove the existence of a significant nexus between the wetlands and nearby waters.
the dissenters,with justice stevens writing,would have upheld the determination that the wetlands at issue were waters of the united states as a reasonable agency interpretation of the act under chevron natural resources defense council,d.in the dissenters view,any significant nexus as the act contained be categorically satisfied as to wetlands adjacent to navigable waters or their tributaries.rapanos,at.
parsing any one of rapanos lengthy and technical statutory exegeses is taxing,but the real difficulty comes in determining the three main opinions lower courts should look to for guidance.as the chief justice observed it is unfortunate that no opinion commands a majority of the court on precisely how to read congress limits on the reach of the clean water act.lower courts and regulated entities will now have to feel their way on a basis.id.at.roberts,concurring citing grutter bollinger,d,and marks united states,d.the dissent,for its part,offered its view of what lower courts should do 
in these cases,however,while both the plurality and justice kennedy agree that there must be a remand for further proceedings,their respective opinions define different tests to be applied on remand.given that all four justices who have joined this opinion would uphold the corps jurisdiction in both of these in all other cases in which either the plurality or justice kennedy test is remand each of the judgments should be reinstated if either of those tests is met.
rapanos,at.emphasis added.fortunately,as the following section explains,jurisdiction is proper here under each of the primary rapanos opinions and therefore we do not have to decide here,once and for all,which test controls in all future cases.
in marks united states,the supreme court instructed that w hen a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.at.quoting gregg georgia,d opinion of stewart,powell,and stevens,jj.but all is not always so rosy.the supreme court has marks limitations,stating that it is more easily stated than applied to the various opinions supporting the result,grutter,at,and that i t does not seem useful to pursue the marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courts that have considered it,nichols united states,d quotations omitted.
in its short life,rapanos has indeed satisfied any bafflement requirement.the first court to decide what opinion was controlling decided to ignore all of them and instead opted for earlier circuit precedent which it felt was clearer and more readily applied.united states chevron pipe line,d.the courts of appeals have not fared much better.the ninth circuit has stated that justice kennedy test applies in most instances,northern california river watch city of healdsburg,cir,while the eleventh circuit has held that the act coverage may be established only under his test.united states robison,cir.by contrast,the first and the seventh circuits,though differing somewhat in their analyses,have followed justice stevens advice and held that the act confers jurisdiction whenever either justice kennedy or the plurality test is met.united states johnson,cir united states gerke excavating,cir.this is the approach the district court here followed,largely in reliance on the first circuit thoughtful reasoning.
taken literally,marks instructs lower courts to choose the narrowest concurring opinion and to ignore dissents.marks,at.but what does narrowest mean marks considered an earlier supreme court obscenity decision,a book named john cleland memoirs of a woman of pleasure attorney general of massachusetts,d,where the court split on whether a particular work was protected by the first amendment.in marks,the court determined that the memoirs plurality standard controlled because,while two justices would have held that the first amendment applies equally to all obscene,hardcore,or grated,id.at.douglas,concurring id.at.black,concurring the plurality would have afforded protection only to materials,id.at,and therefore that concurring opinion was doctrinally the narrowest.
the marks rule in fact derived from the court earlier opinion in gregg georgia,d.gregg had interpreted furman georgia,d,in which a majority found that georgia death penalty scheme was unconstitutional.two justices believed that the death penalty was per se unconstitutional,while three others merely stated that it was unconstitutional as then administered in georgia.so the gregg court stated that s ince five justices wrote separately in support of the judgments in furman,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds at.
as these cases contrary to assertions by the cundiffs and their does not imply that the narrowest rapanos opinion is whichever one restricts jurisdiction the most.but it also makes little sense for the narrowest opinion to be the one that restricts jurisdiction the least,as the government amici allege the ability to glean what substantive value judgments are buried within concurring,plurality,and opinions would require something like divination to be performed accurately.instead,narrowest opinion refers to the one which relies on the least doctrinally ground among the justices in the majority it is the concurring opinion that offers the least change to the law.see johnson bd.of regents of the.of,cir johnson,at.in both memoirs and furman the controlling opinion was less doctrinally sweeping.the memoirs controlling opinion did not agree that obscenity laws per se violated the constitution,and the furman controlling opinion did not agree that the death penalty was per se unconstitutional.
yet problems await.for cases like furman and memoirs,marks application is straightforward.but when one opinion supporting the judgment does not fit entirely within a broader circle drawn by the others,marks is problematic.king palmer,en banc.specifically,marks is opinion can be meaningfully regarded as narrower than when one opinion is a logical subset of other,broader opinions.id.at.where no standard put forth in a concurring opinion is a logical subset of another concurring opinion or opinions that,together,would equal five votes,marks breaks down.
enter rapanos.although in most cases in which justice kennedy concludes that there is no federal authority he will command five votes himself plus the four justices in the rapanos plurality,in other cases justice kennedy would vote against federal authority only to be outvoted the four dissenting justices plus the members of the rapanos plurality because there was a slight surface hydrological connection.gerke,at.indeed,there is quite little common ground between justice kennedy and the plurality conceptions of jurisdiction under the act,and both flatly reject the other view.see rapanos,at.scalia,plurality opinion justice kennedy test simply rewrites the statute.id.at.kennedy,concurring t he plurality reads nonexistent requirements into the act.
thus,because rapanos is not easily reconciled with marks,the question becomes what to do.fortunately,we need not reconcile rapanos with marks.here,jurisdiction is proper under both justice kennedy and the plurality tests and thus also the dissent.recently,this court addressed an analogous situation 
because the supreme court divided in missouri seibert,d,there has been some confusion about whether the plurality or concurring opinion controls.most circuits have assumed that justice kennedy concurrence operates as the controlling precedent,though others have raised doubts about whether his concurrence actually represents the narrowest grounds for decision.we do not need to resolve this issue because regardless of the applicable framework lopez statement must be suppressed.
united states,cir citations omitted.as the next section demonstrates,jurisdiction is proper here under both justice kennedy and the plurality tests,so we leave ultimate resolution of the debate to a future case that turns on which test controls 
jurisdiction is proper under both tests 
justice kennedy test.under this test,the clean water act applies to wetlands that possess a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.rapanos,at.this nexus exists if the wetlands,either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,significantly affect the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as navigable.id.at.by contrast,w hen wetlands effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial,they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the statutory terms navigable waters.id.this standard must be met on a basis.id.
the district court found that the cundiffs wetlands have a significant nexus with the green river,via pond and caney creeks,which are tributaries of that river.the court credited the government expert who testified that the wetlands perform significant ecological functions in relation to the green river and the two creeks,including temporary and water storage,filtering of the acid runoff and sediment from the nearby mine,and providing an important habitat for plants and wildlife.and the court found that the cundiffs ditch digging,the mechanical clearing of land,and the dredging of material and using it as undermined the wetlands ability to store water which,in turn,has affected the frequency and extent of flooding,and increased the flood peaks in the green river.thus,it has impact ed navigation,crop production in bottomlands,downstream bank erosion,and sedimentation.united states cundiff,d,quoting report of lyndon lee.the district court further credited another government expert testimony who stated that rudy cundiff ditch digging had created channels so that the acid mine runoff would largely bypass his wetlands and instead flow more directly into pond and caney creek and thus the green river.it found that these channels cause direct and significant impacts to navigation via sediment accumulation in the green river and to aquatic food webs that are not adapted to thrive in acid waters environments.cundiff,d at quoting lee report.the record supports this conclusion and the district court found that the government witnesses were credible,and so we can not say that its conclusion was clearly erroneous 
the cundiffs do not really dispute these findings.instead,they assert that a significant nexus may only be proved by laboratory analysis of soil samples,water samples,or through other tests.though no doubt a district court could find such evidence persuasive,the cundiffs point to expert opinion,no research report or article,and nothing in any of the various rapanos indicate that this is the sole method by which a significant nexus may be proved such that the district court finding was inherently improper.so the district court properly concluded that the government passed justice kennedy test.
the plurality test.under this standard,the government must make two showings to establish jurisdiction first,that the adjacent channel contains a wate r of the united states,a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and second,that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water,making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.rapanos,at.
the first question is whether the adjacent property contains a water of the united states.the district court held that jurisdiction was proper under the plurality standard because the south channel located on the northern tract of the wetlands,and pond and caney creeks were all relatively permanent bodies of water connected to a traditional interstate navigable water,the green river.cundiff,d at.regarding the south channel,the district court found that the water flows through the channel into pond creek for all but a few weeks a year,the two creeks are open waterbodies with significant flowing water,and that both flow into the green river.pond creek itself is navigable in part.so the first prong of the plurality test is met.
the second question is whether the wetlands possess a continuous surface connection with the green river and its tributaries.the cundiffs argue that,because the wetlands are at a different elevation level than the two creeks and it is not readily apparent that water perpetually flows between them,there is no continuous surface connection.the district court,observing that riverside bayview stated that it is often ambiguous where the transition between water and dry land exactly exists,at,disagreed and held that a continuous surface connection existed.specifically,the court observed that the inquiry was whether it was ambiguous where land stopped and water began,because otherwise the plurality recognition of these gradual transitions would be completely eviscerat ed.cundiff,d at.
we agree the cundiffs argument proves too much.although the term continuous surface connection clearly requires surface flow,it does not mean that only perpetually flowing creeks satisfy the plurality test.indeed,the rapanos plurality,in tipping its hat to riverside bayview,fashioned its test to determine when wetlands were waters of the united states,and therefore implicitly recognized that wetlands are neither nor even literally bodies of water.instead,wetlands are merely inundated or saturated soil that can support under normal circumstances a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.b.in other words,the plurality test requires a topical flow of water between a waterway or its tributary with a wetland,and that connection requires some kind of dampness such that polluting a wetland would have a proportionate effect on the traditional waterway.if the cundiffs restrictive version of the plurality test was accurate,then the plurality could have saved itself time and effort by saying that wetlands could never be waters of the united states and overruled riverside bayview holding to the contrary.it did not do that instead,the plurality went through a lengthy analysis and therefore the standard is broader than the cundiffs assert 
further undermining their argument is the fact that the district court took note of the south channel,which provides a largely uninterrupted permanent surface water flow between the wetlands and traditional waterways.the district court also found that the existence of additional and substantial surface connections between the wetlands and permanent water bodies during storm events,bank full periods,ordinary high flows provides additional evidence of a continuous surface connection.cundiff,d at.finally,cundiff personally went a long way towards creating a continuous surface connection when he dug or excavated ditches to enhance the acid mine drainage into the creeks and away from his wetlands in determining whether the act confers jurisdiction,it does not make a difference whether the channel by which water flows from a wetland to a waterway or its tributary was manmade or formed naturally.thus,we affirm the district court determination that the act confers jurisdiction over the cundiffs wetlands because both tests are met 
summary judgment was proper 
to establish liability under the act,the government must prove that a person discharged a pollutant from a point source into waters of the united states without a permit.a,a.the cundiffs do not contend that they are not persons,nor do they contend that no point source was involved,and we have already determined that the wetlands here are waters of the united states.the cundiffs contend that they have not discharged any pollutants and,while they concede that they did not have a permit from the corps,they assert that their activities fell into one of the relevant exemptions though not the recapture provision and thus were not required to have one 
discharge of a pollutant 
the clean water act defines the discharge of a pollutant as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a.pollutant includes not only traditional contaminants like radioactive or chemical waste,but also basic solids like dredged spoil,rock,sand and cellar dirt.latching onto addition,the cundiffs argue that the regulation defining a pollutant to include sidecasting goes beyond the authority the act grants.in other words,they argue that it is unreasonable for the agency to interpret discharge of a pollutant to cover situations not involving the introduction of foreign material into the area.
sidecasting involves the addition of dredged or excavated dirt from a removal site here,the ditches the cundiffs dug,to some disposal site here,the cundiffs own wetlands.sidecasting purpose is to fill wetlands to dry them out.although it is plausible to read addition as covering only completely foreign materials,that reading is foreclosed because pollutant is defined in the act to specifically include dredged spoil the cundiffs would read that term out of the act.further,the act is not concerned with mere material,but instead with the addition of pollutants material can be benign in one spot and seriously disruptive to the surrounding ecological system in another.as the fourth circuit has stated,once you have dug up something,it becomes 
dredged spoil,a statutory pollutant and a type of material that up until then was not present in the wetlands.it is of no consequence that what is now dredged spoil was previously present on the same property in a less threatening form what is important is that once a material was excavated from the wetland,its redeposit in the same wetland added a pollutant where none had been before.
united states deaton deaton i,cir see also avoyelles sportsmen league,marsh,cir.and even if the statute was ambiguous on whether the prohibition on the addition of pollutants included sidecasting,it is nevertheless a reasonable agency interpretation and must be accorded deference.chevron,at.
the cundiffs other argument is that,if the regulations are nevertheless valid,then their dredging,filling,and mechanized landclearing activities nevertheless fall into the exception to the discharge of dredged material for de minimis,incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging operations,codified at d.although this argument was probably waived,see thurman yellow freight,cir,the assertion that the cundiffs merely left some fallback incidental to ditch digging can not be credited they actively filled the wetlands with dredged spoil and covered roughly acres of wetlands next to about feet of ditches.this goes far beyond being de minimis.thus,they discharged a pollutant under the act.
permit requirement 
although the cundiffs do not dispute that they did not have a valid section permit when digging ditches and clearing their wetlands,they nevertheless argue that their activities fell into one of the statutory exemptions,though not into the recapture provision.see f.specifically,the cundiffs argue that their activities fall into either the farming exception,f a,or the drainage ditch maintenance exception,f c.the defendants bear the burden of establishing both that they qualify for one of the exemptions of f and that their actions are not recaptured by f.greenfield mills,macklin,cir.
the farming exception exempts from the permit requirement the discharge of dredged or fill material from normal farming,silviculture,and ranching activities.f a.as the statute and regulations both require,the disputed activities must be part of an established,farming,silviculture,or ranching operation and they cease to be established when the area on which it was conducted has been converted to another use or has lain idle so long that modifications to the hydrological regime are necessary to resume operations.a ii.the cundiffs wetlands fail both requirements before the cundiffs took over and began their landclearing activities,the land had not been used as a farm for many decades prior and no one disputes that no farming could take place on the wetlands without significant entire point of rudy cundiff activities was to significantly alter the wetlands to make them arable.of course,such activities are not universally impermissible,but they do require a permit.thus the farmland exception does not apply.
nor does the drainage ditch maintenance exception apply.section f c exempts the discharge of dredged or fill material for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches,or the maintenance of drainage ditches.note the difference in language between the two clauses while the exemption applies to the maintenance or construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches,it only applies to the maintenance of drainage ditches and not their construction.the regulations make this explicit.a observing exemption for the maintenance but not construction of drainage ditches.the district court found that the cundiffs activities were not limited to merely maintaining existing and functioning ditches,but instead involved both digging brand new ones and excavating ditches that had no function or ability to function as drainage ditches,and neither can be considered mere maintenance.
even if the cundiffs activities fell within either the farming or drainage ditch maintenance exemptions,they woul
