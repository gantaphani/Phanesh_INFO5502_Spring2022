james albright,a former bodyguard and lover of madonna,and his corporate agent,amrak productions,amrak,appeal from the dismissal of their defamation,invasion of privacy,and other state claims stemming from the publication of a book,madonna.in a nutshell,author and publishers allegedly portrayed albright as a homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a homosexual individual with albright name in a book and magazines.the district court dismissed appellants claims,finding that for the photograph to make any kind of statement regarding albright sexuality requires the court to pile inference upon innuendo,innuendo upon stereotype.albright morton,d.the court also applied recent federal and state supreme court decisions on homosexuality to hold that a statement identifying an individual as homosexual is not defamatory per se under massachusetts law.appellants argue otherwise,stating that continued societal and governmental acceptance of various forms of discrimination against homosexuals should lead to a presumption of injury.we affirm the dismissals,albeit on more limited grounds than the district court holding.
background 
amrak employed has been involved in the personal and professional security business for over ten a professional bodyguard.from january to july,albright served as madonna bodyguard,during which time he became romantically involved with the artist and remained so until.
in december,albright entered into a contract with books to sell information about madonna for an upcoming biography.the book,entitled madonna,was written by author andrew morton and published by books in the united kingdom and by martin press in the united states in.chapter of the book details albright relationship with madonna.andrew morton,madonna martin press.
the book also contains pages of photographs,including one in which madonna is accompanied by two men.the man to the left is wearing black pants,a black and white shirt,a black leather jacket,tinted sunglasses,a string necklace,and an earring.the caption states 
madonna attends prince concert with her secret lover and bodyguard jimmy albright left.albright,who bears an uncanny resemblance to carlos león,the father of madonna daughter,enjoyed a stormy relationship with the star.they planned to marry,and had even chosen names for their children.
this photograph allegedly defamed albright because the man pictured was,in fact,josé guitierez,an outspoken homosexual who often dressed as a woman,and engaged in what appellants describe as homosexual,sexually graphic,lewd,lascivious,offensive,and possibly illegal conduct.guitierez was employed as one of madonna dancers.
on november,people magazine,a publication of time,published the same photograph along with the erroneous caption.news of the world,a publication of news group newspapers,published the same on march.
appellants subsequently brought a diversity suit against morton,michael books,michael,martin press,time,and news group newspapers,in the district of massachusetts.specifically,appellants sued for defamation,invasion of privacy,negligence,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,along with violations of state statutory prohibitions on unfair trade practices.laws ch,and ch,and unauthorized commercial use of a name or likeness,id.at ch.
on may,the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss on all counts.first,the court held that no reasonable view of the photograph and text would suggest that albright is homosexual,and thus the publication can not be construed as defamatory.alternatively,the court held that imputing homosexuality can not be considered defamatory per se in massachusetts,particularly given the rationales in the supreme court decision in lawrence texas,d invalidating state statute criminalizing sexual conduct,as well as the supreme judicial court decision in goodridge dep t of pub.health,invalidating limitations to civil marriage for couples under state equal protection principles.given appellants failure to state a defamation claim,the court dismissed the derivative claims of commercial use,false light invasion of privacy,emotional distress,negligence,and unfair trade practices.this appeal follows.
ii.analysis 
defamation 
appellants first argue that they have met the pleading requirements necessary to survive a motion to dismiss a defamation claim.despite our de novo review of the all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the appellant,see barrington cove.rhode island housing and mortg.fin,cir we disagree.
to prevail in a defamation claim,plaintiffs must establish that defendant s w ere at fault for the publication of a false statement regarding the plaintiff,capable of damaging the plaintiff reputation in the community,which either caused economic loss or is actionable without proof of economic loss.white blue cross blue shield of,footnote omitted.a court may dismiss written defamation claims,libel claims,if the communication is incapable of a defamatory meaning.brauer globe newspaper,quoting muchnick post publ g.this threshold question,whether a communication is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning,is a question of law for the court.phelan may stores.
a communication is susceptible to defamatory meaning if it would tend to hold the plaintiff up to scorn,hatred,ridicule or contempt,in the minds of any considerable and respectable segment in the community.id.at quoting stone essex county newspapers.the communication must be interpreted reasonably,leading a reasonable reader to conclude that it conveyed a defamatory meaning.foley lowell sun publ g,internal quotation marks omitted.context matters in assessing such claims the court must examine the statement in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published.the court must consider all the words used,not merely a particular phrase or sentence.id.quoting myers boston magazine.the massachusetts supreme judicial court,for example,has required that allegedly defamatory photographs or headlines be interpreted in light of the entire context of the,the entire text of the survive dismissal.compare mabardi boston,holding that plaintiff stated a claim for defamation where implications from the juxtaposition of plaintiff photo with the article was not discouraged by any clarifying textual reference to the plaintiff,with foley,at affirming dismissal of defamation claim where text of article accompanying the contested headline made clear that plaintiff had been arrested,not convicted,for assault.see generally lambert providence journal,cir reading the challenged articles in their entirety to determine whether they were reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning.
the miscaptioned photograph in the instant case is not reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning.nothing in guitierez appearance,particularly given the accompanying caption stressing albright heterosexuality,madonna secret lover,gives any indication that albright is homosexual.to draw such an inference,the would have to view homosexuals with scorn,hatred,ridicule or contempt,phelan,at follow madonna and her cohort closely enough to recognize guitierez as a gay man,but not closely enough to know guitierez name or what albright looks like.few,if any,readers would fall into this considerable and respectable segment in the community.id.
the context of the text accompanying the photograph further deflates any argument that the photo conveys a defamatory meaning.when we consider all the words used in the accompanying text,foley,at phrases such as albright girlfriend,his hot and heavy affair with madonna,their sexual encounters,and albright fling with a girl at a club we find that no reasonable reader could conclude that albright is homosexual.this conclusion is supported by the caption,which states that albright was madonna secret lover,that they enjoyed a stormy relationship,and that they planned to marry and had even chosen names for their children.similarly,the caption for the people weekly photograph states that albright felt overwhelming love for madonna,with the accompanying article detailing their relationship.
