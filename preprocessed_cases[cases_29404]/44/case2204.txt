background 
bettersworth has an extensive background in the banking industry,which is well documented in the summary judgment record before the court.between and,bettersworth was employed by the first national bank of seguin.in,bettersworth formed southwest commercial capital,swcc,which is described as a venture capital company.in,bettersworth founded first commercial bank of seguin,texas fcb,a federally chartered bank,where he served as chief executive officer and chairman of the board until.in,bettersworth formed southwestern comcorp,incorporated comcorp,a holding company.bettersworth also formed a second small business investment company called southwestern venture capital svc.bettersworth placed swcc and svc under the umbrella of comcorp.bettersworth owned either a participatory interest or a management position or both in these ventures.bettersworth also owned a controlling interest or management position in other related financial institutions.
in,comcorp acquired the republic bank of tecumseh,oklahoma rbt by foreclosure,and bettersworth assumed control of rbt.the bank holding company act bhca,provides that no company may gain control of a bank without prior approval of the board of governors of the federal reserve system.see id.a.the act contains an exception to the requirement for prior board approval when controlling interest in a bank is obtained in the course of collecting upon a previously contracted debt.a.in such a case,the company assuming control of the bank must divest itself of the acquired bank shares within two years.id.that period may be extended one year at a time,but the maximum time period during which a company may hold shares giving it a controlling interest in a bank is five years.id.comcorp foreclosure of a debt owed by one of rbt officers and guaranteed by rbt assets fell within the foreclosure exception to the requirement for prior board approval.moreover,comcorp received an extension,which permitted comcorp to hold rbt for up to five years,or until december,before securing board approval or divesting itself of the rbt assets.
in or,bettersworth resigned from his positions with fcb and rbt.bettersworth also lost control of comcorp.in early,bettersworth and a partner regained controlling interest in comcorp.in october,comcorp filed an application for bank holding company bhc status under the bhca with the federal reserve bank of kansas city the reserve bank.federal reserve banks are authorized to receive and review applications for bhc status.the controlling regulations permit the reserve bank to either approve the application or to refer it to the board.see.thus,the reserve bank has no authority to finally deny an application for bhc status.when considering whether to approve an application for bhc status,the board is authorized to consider inter alia the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company or companies and the banks concerned,id.c,which in turn includes consideration of the competence,experience,and integrity of the officers,directors,and principal shareholders of the company or bank,id.c.
comcorp application for bhc status proposed that comcorp retain percent of rbt.the application disclosed bettersworth prior affiliations with fcb and rbt.accordingly,pamela johnson,the reserve bank official assigned to review the application,began retrieving and reviewing the records maintained by other banking regulatory agencies on those banks.
johnson reviewed occ records relating to the financial condition and management of fcb those records included unfavorable assessments of both the condition of the bank and the bank management,including bettersworth.records from bank examinations conducted shortly after bettersworth left fcb reported that the bank was in bad financial shape and suggested that bettersworth placement of sba loans generated by comcorp or its affiliates contributed to the bank poor financial status.johnson also reviewed the occ supervisory monitoring system sms,a confidential database maintained by the occ and accessible with a password by other banking regulatory agencies.the sms likewise contained an entry blaming bettersworth and another individual for the bank poor condition,and concluding that these individuals should not be approved in an executive capacity at a troubled institution.bettersworth identifies this statement in the occ database as an adverse determination within the meaning of the privacy act,g c.
johnson also reviewed records relating to the financial condition and management of rbt.those records included unfavorable assessments of both the condition of the bank and the bank management,including bettersworth.records from examinations conducted after bettersworth left rbt reported that the bank was in bad financial shape and suggested that bettersworth placement of sba loans generated by comcorp or its affiliates contributed to the bank poor financial status.certain records also suggested that bettersworth and another individual forced rbt into foreclosure so that swcc could obtain the assets of rbt without having to comply with the bhca.
johnson also telephoned occ and fdic examiners familiar with fcb and rbt examinations and discussed these matters with the examiners.johnson also consulted internal reserve bank records.through her investigations,johnson learned that the banks had charged off large loans made to bettersworth or his companies.bettersworth personal guarantee on one such loan had forced his own personal bankruptcy.in sum,johnson investigation generated significant questions concerning,among other things,the rbt foreclosure,bettersworth decision to place a substantial number of sba loans generated by his own companies with banks which he also controlled,and bettersworth failure to honor or default upon certain loans extended to him personally or to his companies by the banks which he managed.johnson eventually authored a memo to reserve bank stephen mcbride,setting out the problems with comcorp bhca application.
on november,reserve bank mcbride issued a letter stating that the reserve bank had completed its review and identified several areas of concern with respect to the application.the areas of concern were stated in some detail and specific questions were posed at the end of the letter,the answers to which could have significantly enhanced the possibility of approval.the letter concluded that,based upon the existing information,the prospects for approval were extremely dim,and that any further application would be considered directly by the board.comcorp did not,however,pursue the application further by providing the specific information requested in an amended application to the board.rather,comcorp abandoned the application and negotiated the sale of rbt,which closed in early.
in,bettersworth decided he wanted to start a new bank in lakeway,texas and began trying to clear his name.after informal efforts failed,bettersworth made privacy act requests in october.bettersworth requested records on himself,stating three variations on his name.the agencies responded that they either did not have records responsive to his request or that the documents they had were not subject to the privacy act.bettersworth subsequently learned that the agencies maintained confidential records relating to bank examinations that sometimes contained comments about bank management.bettersworth made another privacy act request for those records,which was denied because the records were not kept in a system of records tied to his name.there does not appear to be any dispute about the fact that these records were maintained,in accordance with the agencies regulatory purpose,in files on the banks with which bettersworth was affiliated rather than in a file on
