joe pennycuff appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of fentress county board of education and homer lee linder,superintendent of fentress county schools collectively defendants,in this action.because we conclude that the district court correctly determined that pennycuff did not attain tenure as a teacher in the fentress county school system under the provisions of the tennessee teacher tenure law,ann,et,and therefore,that the board did not deny him due process when it terminated his employment without affording him the protections to which a tenured teacher is entitled,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on june,pennycuff was hired by the fentress county board of education board as the principal of clarkrange high school for the school year.pennycuff had previously been a tenured teacher in the oneida school system with nearly twenty years of experience.his first year at the high school was tainted by complaints from parents and students,student walkouts and the presentation to the board of a student petition for pennycuff removal.despite the controversy,the board voted on june,to retain pennycuff as the principal of clarkrange high school for the school year.according to the board minutes,pennycuff status at that time was that of a teacher.
on august,the board held a special meeting at which it adopted the motion of board member freddie stults to transfer pennycuff tenure from the oneida school system to the fentress county school system.this meeting occurred after the board was expanded from five members to ten,pursuant to chapter of the private acts of,and after the election of the new members of the board,but before the terms of the old board had expired.stults had not been reelected,and his motion to transfer pennycuff tenure was his last act as a board member.marjorie wright,then superintendent of schools,neither recommended nor objected to the motion.no prior notice of this meeting appeared in any newspaper published and circulated in fentress county.the agenda for the meeting,prepared by superintendent wright,and distributed to the board members on august,did not include the issue of pennycuff tenure as an item for discussion or vote.neither wright nor any of the board members were aware that pennycuff tenure would be discussed at the meeting.
the new board met on september,and approved the minutes from the august,meeting except for the approval of the motion to transfer pennycuff tenure,which they declared was illegal.the board eventually voted unanimously to request an attorney general opinion regarding the transfer of tenure.although at meetings held on november,and december,the board considered taking action to ratify the actions of august,it has yet to ratify those actions.
in may,the board transferred pennycuff from his position as principal at clarkrange to a teaching position at the fentress county alternative school.pennycuff responded by filing a complaint with the chancery court for fentress county to contest this transfer and demotion.pennycuff also filed a quo warranto action in the chancery court to challenge the constitutionality of the private act that had authorized the election of the board.pennycuff complaint in the first chancery court action asserted,in the third sentence of the fifth paragraph,that o n august,pennycuff acquired tenure as an educator in the fentress county school system.in their amended answer,the defendants stated,t he allegations contained in sentence three paragraph of the complaint are admitted.
pennycuff continued teaching at the fentress county alternative school during the,and school years,and during that time,he was treated as a tenured teacher with respect to renewal or nonrenewal of employment.for example,the board practice was to notify all teachers of their nonrenewal before april of each year,and then to rehire them later in the summer,as needed.under tennessee law,any teachers who are not notified of their nonrenewal by april are automatically rehired for the following school year.ann.pennycuff did not appear on the nonrenewal list for those school years,and he did not appear on the list of teachers who were to be rehired.instead,he was automatically rehired each year in the same fashion as any tenured teacher in the fentress county school system.
on january,the chancery court ruled in the quo warranto action,holding that the private act allowing election of a board was unconstitutional and ordered that the seven board members who had been elected in august be removed from office.two of the ousted members,eddie cook and notie byrd,were appointed to fill the vacant seats,returning the board to five members.the board then sought a second legal opinion regarding pennycuff tenure.the attorney consulted by the board opined that pennycuff did not have tenure,and that it would be defensible to treat him as a teacher and not renew his employment.on march,on the motion of cook and byrd,the board voted to place pennycuff on the teachers list for notification of for the school year.this notice did not include any notice of charges and provided no opportunity for a hearing,both of which are required under ann.and when a tenured teacher is dismissed.
pennycuff filed this and tennessee state law action on june,claiming that his discharge from the fentress county alternative school had violated his constitutional and statutory rights as a tenured teacher,and that his discharge was unlawful because it had been in retaliation for exercising his constitutional right of access to the courts.he filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his claim that his discharge had violated his rights as a tenured teacher.the district court granted this motion,concluding that pennycuff was a tenured teacher at the time the fentress county board of education fired him without cause.the claim of retaliatory discharge proceeded to a bench trial,and the district court determined that the board had retaliated against pennycuff for exercising his right of access to the courts.
the board appealed only the district court decision that pennycuff was tenured in the fentress county school system.on august,this court reversed the district court grant of partial summary judgment to pennycuff on his claim that he was a tenured teacher and the board had failed to comply with due process requirements in terminating his employment.the case was remanded to the district court for reconsideration in light of the intervening case of bowden memphis board of education.on remand,the district court concluded that pennycuff had not attained tenure status under the tennessee teacher tenure law,ann,et.the district court denied pennycuff motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the defendants.
only if pennycuff had attained tenure in the fentress county school system would the board termination of his employment without affording him the protections to which tenure entitled him constitute a denial of due process.the sole issue on this appeal is whether the district court properly concluded that pennycuff did not attain tenure as a teacher in the fentress county school system under the provisions of the tennessee teacher tenure law,ann,et.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,using the same standard under rule c used by the district court.williams mehra,cir en banc.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.entry of summary judgment is appropriate against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
