plaintiff rosalinda baez brought claims against defendants jetblue airways corporation jetblue and its former employee,tiffany malabet malabet,arising out of an encounter at john kennedy airport jfk airport,in which baez was reported by malabet for making an alleged bomb threat and was then arrested by the federal bureau of investigation fbi.baez arrived at the gate after the boarding door was closed her checked luggage was already on board.apparently unhappy about this state of affairs,baez made statements,or raised questions,about the possibility of a bomb in her luggage.malabet,who was working at the gate,acted on this information by reporting it.as law enforcement officers eventually determined after the flight was rerouted and the plane searched,there was no bomb on board.
baez asserted claims under both federal and state law against jetblue and malabet,including at issue on this appeal negligence and defamation claims against jetblue,and claims of false arrest,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and defamation against malabet.the district court dismissed the case on summary judgment on the ground that defendants are immune from liability under the aviation and transportation security act,atsa.the court ruled in the alternative that baez claims lacked merit.
baez appealed,arguing that a jury should decide whether malabet statements relaying what baez had said were materially false and therefore outside the protection of the atsa that the district court erred in concluding malabet statements were materially true and that malabet is not entitled to immunity because she made the report at issue to her jetblue supervisor,rather than to the transportation security administration tsa or other law enforcement officers.
there is no dispute about the salient fact in this case baez made reference to an arguably hypothetical bomb in her luggage,which had made it onto the jetblue plane that she missed.we conclude that no reasonable jury could have found malabet statements relaying that reference to be materially false,and that the report she made,first to her supervisor,and subsequently to law enforcement officials,is covered by the atsa.accordingly,summary judgment in favor of defendants was correct on the ground that defendants are entitled to immunity affirmed.
background 
baez arrived at jfk airport at about in the morning,and checked in at the jetblue counter for her flight to austin.am.compl.she did not,however,appear at her gate until minutes prior to the flight scheduled departure.as baez approached the gate,malabet told her that she had just closed the plane door and that baez would not be permitted to board.id.
baez,upset by this turn of events,asked malabet about her checked luggage.according to baez,malabet informed her that her luggage would remain on the plane and she would be able to retrieve it in austin when she got there on a later flight.id.by baez own account,baez then made cryptic reference to the possibility of a bomb in her luggage is it a security risk to let a bag go on a plane without a passenger,what if there was a bomb in the bag id.baez alleged that malabet responded tsa agents would know if there was a bomb in the bag and baez retorted tsa my ass and walked away.id.
malabet relayed her conversation with baez to her supervisor.according to baez,malabet purposely misrepresented the relevant conversation in making her internal report,and conveyed that baez had stated that she had a bomb in her bag and asked s o are you guys going to turn the plane around cause i need my bag am.compl.baez alleged that malabet falsely attributed to baez the observation that the tsa did not know how to do its job,and would not catch a bomb on board a plane.id.according to malabet,she did not personally regard baez as a security risk,and reported only that baez implied that she had a bomb in her bag by posing the question,what if there was a bomb in my bag.
malabet supervisor advised her that jetblue security personnel would be contacted,as well as the tsa.id.at.an fbi agent interviewed malabet while security officers were locating baez.id.at.
jetblue security personnel located and detained baez.am.compl.baez was then questioned at length by law enforcement agents.the criminal complaint later filed by an fbi agent reported that baez asked malabet,what if i had a bomb in my bag,and that when malabet replied that the tsa would have detected it,baez stated that she did have a bomb in her bag.
as a security measure,jetblue personnel and law enforcement officials decided to reroute the plane carrying baez luggage.id.at.when the plane landed and its passengers were removed,security officers searched all the checked luggage and found no bomb they did find marijuana residue in baez bag.id.
baez was charged with making a false bomb threat.ultimately,the government dropped the bomb threat charge,and baez pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug charges based on the marijuana found in her luggage.baez was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay restitution to jetblue for the cost of rerouting the plane.because she violated the terms of her probation by failing a drug test,and refused to attend a drug treatment program,baez ultimately served a day prison sentence.
baez arrest garnered some media attention.when she lost her job,she suspected this was as a result of the jetblue matter.id.at.baez brought a host of claims against defendants,some of which were previously dismissed.the claims that survived defendants motions to dismiss were for negligent supervision,retention,training,and hiring defamation false arrest and intentional infliction of emotional distress.see baez jetblue airways,d.the district court later granted summary judgment to jetblue and malabet on the ground that the atsa affords them immunity from suit.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate when,having resolved all ambiguities and permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see also doe whelan,cir.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.savino city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.passenger mcdonald,cir.
in enacting the atsa,congress sought to ensure that air carriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide the tsa with the information it needed to respond to potential threats.air.airlines hoeper.accordingly,the statute provides 
any air carrier or employee of an air carrier who makes a voluntary disclosure of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation,relating to air piracy,a threat to aircraft or passenger safety,or terrorism,to any employee or agent of the department of transportation,the department of justice,any federal,state,or local law enforcement officer,or any airport or airline security officer shall not be civilly liable to any person under any law or regulation of the united states,any constitution,law,or regulation of any state or political subdivision of any state,for such disclosure.

the supreme court has held that an air carrier such as jetblue and an airline employee such as malabet are immune from liability for the type of report made here unless the report was materially false.see hoeper.at.in this context,a materially false statement is one that would have a different effect on the mind of the listener from that which the truth would have produced.id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the listener is a reasonable security officer.id.at.specifically,we care whether a falsehood affects the authorities perception of and response to a given threat.id.at.
