gary pelletier brought suit in tort against main street textiles,lp main street tyng textiles,llc charles mcansin associates,lp mcdonna,llc and joan fabrics corporation,seeking to recover for serious injuries sustained while working at a main street site as a rigger.a rigger is one who specializes in the moving of very large and complicated machinery.pelletier was not an employee of main street or any of the defendants.rather,he worked for three d rigging,which had a contract with main street to work on site.a jury returned a verdict for the defendants,and the district court denied pelletier motion for a new trial.
on appeal,pelletier argues that a new trial is warranted because the district court improperly excluded two osha safety standards proffered by pelletier and limited the testimony of one of his experts.finding no abuse of discretion and,in any event,no prejudice to pelletier from these rulings,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in october,main street hired three d rigging to move textile equipment and machinery as part of its relocation out of the old mill,a facility that was more than years old.pelletier,a rigger with twenty years experience,was employed by three d rigging,and he worked on the main street job from october through july.
on july,while working at the old mill,pelletier was seriously injured when the top of a,steel that he was moving with a forklift fell and struck him on the head.the impact caused a fracture dislocation of the spine in pelletier neck,resulting in quadriplegia.
the parties dispute how the accident occurred.pelletier,who was alone at the time,gave the following account.pelletier had secured the to the mast of the forklift using a single strap,and he had tilted the forks of the forklift up slightly for better stability.he planned to move the across an open space,and in doing so,he needed to move the forklift from a portion of the floor covered by a metal plate to an uncovered wooden floor.pelletier said that as the forklift moved off the plate and onto the wood floor,the forklift and began to sway.concerned about the integrity of the uncovered wood floor,pelletier tried to back up to the plated portion of the floor,but when he gave the forklift gas,the tires spun momentarily,then caught,causing the forklift to lurch backwards.this,in turn,caused pelletier to be thrown forwards and to hit the tilt control lever.the lever tilted the forks downwards,causing the base of the to slide forward,until the top of the slipped over the mast of the forklift and struck pelletier on the head.
main street offered a different version of events,tending to show that pelletier had slipped while standing up to tighten the strap around the.
in january,pelletier filed a complaint in the federal district court in massachusetts against main street and related corporate entities under diversity jurisdiction.the complaint alleged that pelletier accident was the result of the defendants negligence and sought compensatory damages 
as later developed at trial,pelletier had two main theories of negligence.first,pelletier alleged that main street had been negligent in maintaining the premises of the old mill.according to pelletier,the deteriorated condition of the wood floor,together with the fact that much,but not all,of the floor had been covered with metal plates,caused the swaying that pelletier had noticed and the need to back up from the wood floor onto the plated portion of the floor.moreover,pelletier alleged that main street failure to clean up oil left on the floor by the textile equipment and to otherwise keep the floors clean caused the forklift to lurch backwards when he tried to back up.
pelletier alternative theory of negligence was that main street exercised sufficient control over the work of pelletier and three d rigging that main street was responsible for ensuring the safety of that work.the three d forklift that pelletier had been using was not equipped with an overhead guard such a guard would have prevented the from hitting him.according to pelletier,main street had a responsibility to ensure that such guards were used,at least where there was sufficient overhead clearance to use a guard,as there was where pelletier was moving the.
main street,for its part,put forward multiple defenses.first,main street argued that the accident could not have happened as pelletier described,and it cast doubt both on whether the forklift could sway and lurch and on whether pelletier could have hit the tilt control lever in the sequence of events he described.moreover,main street alleged that pelletier himself was responsible for the accident because he had failed to secure the to the forklift using a second strap.
as to the premises,main street asserted that pelletier was well aware of any potential hazards,having worked at that site for some time,and that nothing about the condition of the floor made it unreasonably dangerous to work on.main street cast doubt on whether there was any significant amount of oil on the floor and also argued that by the time of the accident,oil was only being spilled as a result of three d activities and it was three d responsibility to clean it up.
finally,main street denied having or exercising any control over three d rigging methods and thus any responsibility for the safety of those methods.as to the issue of overhead guards,main street asserted that it met whatever responsibility it had because it had raised the issue with three d,and that it had no responsibility to act directly to prevent the use of forklifts without guards.in any event,the forklift that pelletier was using had no guard because it was generally being used in an area without sufficient clearance for a guard main street asserted that it had no reason to suspect that pelletier would use that forklift in an area with greater clearance.
on may,the jury returned a verdict for the defendants,finding no negligence.on may,pelletier filed a motion for a new trial,on three grounds.pelletier argued that the district court had erred in excluding two osha regulations,b and,that provided safety standards for construction work in refusing to conduct a voir dire with his safety engineering expert in order to determine the relevance of the proffered osha regulations and in limiting that expert testimony and refusing to allow the expert to testify about industry customs and practices of safety.
on september,the district court denied the motion for a new trial,rejecting all of pelletier claims of error.it found that pelletier had not met his burden to lay an adequate foundation for the admission of the excluded regulations,and had not shown that the regulations were properly applicable to main street or relevant to the issues being tried.further,pelletier had failed to proffer other regulations defining the terms used in the proffered regulations,potentially leading to jury confusion.moreover,the court held it was not required to hear pelletier safety expert on voir dire.
as for the limitation on the safety expert testimony,the court explained that pelletier new trial motion argued that the expert would have testified only as to industry custom and practices in general,but during trial plaintiff counsel proposed that the expert be permitted to testify with respect to which osha regulations were relevant to safety at the old mill.the court stated that it had precluded the expert from providing such testimony because it would have usurped the court function in instructing the jury on the law.the court noted that pelletier had then suggested that his expert be allowed to testify about which industry customs and practices relating to safety had been violated at the old mill.because the expert had never visited the old mill and had apparently based his opinions on deposition testimony and preliminary expert reports about the accident,the court found that his opinion would have been based upon insufficient facts or data and,therefore,was inadmissible pursuant to.finally,the court found that the proposed evidence and testimony were unlikely to have affected the outcome of the trial.
