opinion of the court 
responding to a police dispatch,pennsylvania state trooper jeremy carroll and another trooper proceeded to the home of andrew and karen carman to search for a man who had stolen two loaded handguns and a car with new jersey plates.upon arriving at the carmans residence,the troopers bypassed the front door and went directly to the back of the house and onto a deck adjoining the kitchen.on the deck,a scuffle ensued between carroll and andrew carman.this action arises from carroll warrantless entry onto the carmans property.carroll contends that he did not violate the carmans fourth amendment rights because he entered into their curtilage,the area immediately surrounding their home,while executing a legitimate knock and talk encounter.because carroll proceeded directly through the back of the carmans property and did not begin his visit at the front door,the knock and talk exception to the warrant requirement does not apply.therefore,we reverse the district court denial of the carmans motion for judgment as a matter of law on their unlawful entry claim.we affirm the jury verdict regarding the carmans unlawful seizure claim because there was sufficient support for the jury finding that carroll acted reasonably accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court.
in july,pennsylvania state police troopers jeremy carroll and brian roberts were dispatched to the carmans residence to search for a man named michael zita and a car bearing new jersey license plates.the troopers were told that zita had stolen the car,was armed with two loaded handguns,and might have fled to the carmans residence.neither roberts nor carroll had been to the carmans property before,and neither knew what zita looked like.the troopers did not have a warrant to search the carmans property nor did they have a warrant to arrest zita.
the carmans house sits on a corner lot.the main street runs along the front of the house and a side street runs along the left of the house,as viewed from the front.a clearly marked path leads to the front door.see pl.exs,there is no other marked path to the carmans house.a stone parking area is located on the left side of the house,see pl.ex,and a shed and carport,which the parties refer to as a garage,are located in the carmans backyard.
the carmans also have a back deck that adjoins their kitchen area.see pl.ex.two sets of stairs lead up to the deck,and a sliding glass door by the deck leads to the kitchen.see id.however,the carmans testified that visitors use the front entrance when they come to visit.
when the troopers arrived at the carmans home,andrew and karen carman were sitting in their kitchen with karen carman sister they were the only people present at the home.because there was no parking in front of the carmans house,the troopers drove down the side street,passed numerous cars parked along the side of the carmans house,and parked their cars at the first available spot,at the far rear of the property.app.the troopers then got out of their cars,entered the carmans backyard,and headed toward the garage.carroll purportedly took this route because he saw a light on in the garage and thought someone might be there.he poked his head in the garage and said,pennsylvania state police,but there was nobody in there.app.
carroll thought the sliding door attached to the back deck of the house looked like a customary entryway.app.thus,after searching the garage and finding no one there,he and roberts continued walking through the backyard and proceeded to the back deck.as the troopers stepped onto the deck,andrew carman came out of the house.carman was belligerent and aggressively approached the troopers,asking,who the fuck are you app.given carman behavior,carroll thought the man he was speaking with might be zita.carroll informed him that they were looking for zita and asked carman to identify himself.carman refused to divulge his identity,made a quick turn away from the troopers,and appeared to reach for his waist,bringing his hands outside the troopers view.still unsure of carman identity,carroll feared that carman might be reaching for a weapon.he,therefore,momentarily grabbed carman right arm.upon seeing that carman was unarmed,he let go.carman twisted and fell off the deck.
karen carman subsequently exited her house and came onto the deck with her sister.the two women were screaming when they approached roberts.consequently,roberts ordered them to stand back and drew his taser.karen carman asked the troopers what was going on,and carroll explained that they were looking for zita and asked her if they could search the house for him.she gave her consent and everyone went into the house.
the troopers searched the carmans house and did not find zita.the stolen vehicle was not at the carmans residence,and the carmans were not charged with any crimes.
andrew and karen carman brought this case pursuant to,alleging that carroll violated their fourth amendment rights.in particular,the carmans complaint alleged that carroll warrantless entry into their backyard,garage,back deck,and home constituted an unlawful search and that carroll unreasonably seized andrew carman.before trial,the carmans advised the district court of the supreme court recent decision in florida jardines,d,and asserted that they should be entitled to a directed verdict at trial based on that case.they also submitted a proposed jury instruction regarding the knock and talk exception to the warrant requirement their instruction cited heavily to jardines.
the district court conducted a jury trial.after opening arguments,the carmans moved for a directed verdict,effectively a judgment as a matter of law,on their unlawful entry claim at the close of carroll testimony,the carmans renewed their request for judgment as a matter of law on the unlawful entry claim and also moved for judgment as a matter of law on their unreasonable seizure claim.carroll moved for judgment as a matter of law on the carmans unlawful entry claim on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied all of the motions without explanation.
the district court also rejected the carmans proposed jury instruction regarding the knock and talk exception.over the carmans objections,the district court charged the jury with a different instruction the district court instruction cited language from our decision in estate of smith marasco,cir,but did not cite jardines.
ultimately,the jury returned a verdict finding in carroll favor on both claims.judgment was entered on april.this appeal followed 
on appeal,the carmans argue that the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment as a matter of law on their fourth amendment unlawful entry and unreasonable seizure claims.the carmans also argue that the district court provided an erroneous jury instruction regarding the knock and talk exception to the warrant requirement.
