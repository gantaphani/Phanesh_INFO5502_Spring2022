vincent colianni appeals from the magistrate judge order finding that he violated aba model rule of professional conduct rule by initiating contact with a juror.for the reasons explained below,we hold that the judge abused his discretion in reaching that conclusion and sanctioning colianni for his conduct.we further find that the judge denied colianni due process rights by not following the disciplinary procedures outlined in local rule b of the district court of the virgin islands and by failing to give colianni sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to finding misconduct and imposing sanctions.
factual background and procedural history 
appellant yolanda adams filed suit in the district court of the virgin islands after she suffered a serious brain injury while driving a vehicle manufactured by ford motor company.by consent of the parties,magistrate judge george cannon presided over the trial in the district court.the jury awarded adams million in damages,and determined that she was at fault and that ford was at fault.
vincent colianni,adam counsel of record,called one of the jurors shortly after the trial ended to ask about the jury award of damages and the assignment of fault between the parties.colianni apparently believed that there had been a clerical error on the verdict form.after not being able to reach the jury foreperson,colianni called another juror,alicia barnes.barnes asked colianni whether it was appropriate for her to speak with him,and colianni replied that it was permissible.colianni then explained the law of contributory negligence in the virgin islands,and mistakenly told barnes that the court could apply the negligence standard for contributory fault as opposed to strict liability.after briefly speaking with colianni,barnes told him that she felt uncomfortable discussing the case with him and the call ended.the conversation was very brief,lasting only about one minute.three of colianni colleagues were in his office with him and heard the entire conversation,which colianni had placed on the speakerphone.
shortly after the call ended,barnes contacted magistrate judge cannon and informed him that she felt the call was inappropriate.the judge responded by asking barnes to put her complaint in writing.a few days later,the judge received a letter from barnes in which she related the circumstances of the call and stated that she found colianni conduct reprehensible,and bordering on harassment.app.she also stated that colianni call was the reason many are leery of serving as jurors in our small community.app.
thereafter,magistrate judge cannon contacted counsel for both parties and set the matter for an immediate hearing the next day.at the hearing,the judge began by reading the juror letter and the text of aba model rule into the record.the judge then instructed colianni to recount his version of the telephone call and to explain why he had reached out to the juror.colianni responded that he wished to ask the juror about how his client damages had been calculated.colianni further explained that he had informed the juror that she was under no obligation to speak with him,that it was not until he had already made his inquiries regarding the jury award that the juror expressed her discomfort,and that he had immediately ended the call once the juror said that she was uncomfortable.colianni acknowledged that he had mistakenly given the juror incorrect information about the contributory negligence standard that applied in this case.
both parties submitted memoranda after the hearing.on may,the magistrate judge issued an order in which he found that colianni had engaged in misconduct by his communication with a juror in contravention of american bar association model rule of professional conduct c.app.the court stated that it would not disbar,suspend,or reprimand counsel pursuant to local rule b or initiate disciplinary proceedings pursuant to local rule b.instead,the magistrate judge referred the matter to the virgin islands bar association for a formal investigation and disciplinary proceedings.app.at a subsequent hearing,the judge denied colianni request to seal the order.
thereafter,colianni filed a notice of appeal to this court,but we subsequently issued an opinion reluctantly conclud ing that we lacked jurisdiction to review the magistrate judge order because colianni appeal had been filed prior to the entry of final judgment.app.colianni subsequently filed this timely notice of appeal 
ii.standard of review and jurisdiction 
the decision to impose sanctions is a matter generally entrusted to the discretion of the district court.bowers v.the collegiate athletic,cir.thus,we review a decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion.id.citing newman ghs osteopathic,cir.although this standard of review is deferential,a court abuses its discretion in imposing sanctions when it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.see also cooter gell hartmarx.when the procedure the court uses to impose sanctions raises due process issues of fair notice and the right to be heard,the standard of review is plenary.martin brown,cir.
adams originally filed this suit in the district court of the virgin islands,which had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to because the amount in controversy exceeded and the parties are completely diverse.we therefore have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
iii.discussion 
the government first contends that colianni has no standing to appeal because he did not suffer an imminent injury that can be redressed by a favorable appellate decision.specifically,the government argues that colianni does not have a cognizable injury because the challenged order did not formally sanction or reprimand him.
as in all cases,we must first address the issue of standing because i f plaintiffs do not possess article iii standing,both the district court and this court lack subject matter jurisdiction to address the merits of plaintiff case.aclu nj township of wall,cir citing warth seldin.standing is the irreducible constitutional minimum necessary to make a justiciable case or controversy under article iii,section.lujan defenders of wildlife.a plaintiff interests satisfy article iii when the following three elements are present 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

we have previously highlighted the disagreement among the courts of appeals about whether a court statement in a judicial opinion constitutes a legally sufficient injury to support appellate jurisdiction.see bowers,at internal citations omitted.most courts agree that mere judicial criticism of an attorney conduct is insufficient to constitute a sanction which would support standing.see,united states talao,cir williams united states,f d,cir bolte home ins,cir.on the other hand,courts nearly uniformly have held that an order rising to the level of a public reprimand qualifies as a sufficient sanction.see bank of nova scotia united states,talao,at equating formal finding with public reprimand and sanction williams,at words alone may suffice as sanctions if they are expressly identified as a reprimand.see also.c providing that sanctions may consist of nonmonetary directives.indeed,only the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has held that a public reprimand is not appealable unless it is accompanied by a monetary sanction.clark equip.lift parts mg.col,cir w e have already decided that an attorney may not appeal from an order that finds misconduct but does not result in monetary liability,despite
