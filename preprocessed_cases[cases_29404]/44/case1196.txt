opinion of the court 
gay patterson is a claimant seeking payment under the national class action settlement agreement settlement agreement in this litigation under the settlement agreement,wyeth,formerly american home products corporation,has contributed funds for the payment of claims.ahp settlement trust trust administers and reviews the claims and awards benefits to class members who qualify under the terms of the settlement agreement.
patterson contends she suffers from moderate mitral regurgitation,a medical condition that,if adequately demonstrated,would qualify her for payment.patterson submitted her claim to the trust,supporting it with an attesting physician interpretation of an echocardiogram.the trust referred her claim to an independent auditing cardiologist who concluded that the attesting physician opinion lacked a reasonable medical basis.accordingly,the trust denied patterson claim.
the trust then applied for an order requiring patterson to show cause why the claim should be paid.the district court issued an order to show cause and referred the matter to a special master.after the show cause proceedings,the district court denied recovery finding no reasonable medical basis for patterson claim.we will affirm.
this case is part of a litigation concerning diet drugs previously sold by marketed as pondimin,and dexfenfluramine marketed as redux.in previous decisions,we have provided detailed descriptions of the diet drugs litigation.see,in re briscoe,cir in re diet drugs,cir in re diet drugs,cir in re diet drugs,cir.we limit our discussion here to the facts pertinent to the present appeal.
in november,wyeth and the representatives for plaintiffs entered into the settlement agreement.after conducting fairness proceedings,the district court certified a settlement class and approved the settlement agreement which became final upon exhaustion of all appeals.
the amount of a claimant recovery under the settlement agreement is determined by damage matrices that assess factors such as severity of the medical condition,age of claimant,and length of illness.patterson seeks matrix,level ii compensation in the amount of.in order to recover,a claimant must demonstrate by a reasonable medical basis that she has a qualifying condition.
the only factor in dispute is the severity of patterson medical condition,whether she has mitral regurgitation at a moderate level.the district court has noted the importance of measuring the severity of regurgitation because not all levels of mitral regurgitation are medically significant.pto,d at.mild and trace regurgitation,two lesser grades of valvular regurgitation identified in medical literature,are normal and exist in approximately ninety percent of the population.only when mitral regurgitation reaches the moderate level does it become a serious medical condition.id.the settlement agreement defines moderate mitral regurgitation as regurgitant jet area in any apical view equal to or greater than of the left atrial area but less than.
in order to make a matrix claim under the settlement agreement,the claimant must submit a green form to the trust.the green form requires disclosure of personal and medical information as well as a physician certification,based on a reading of an echocardiogram videotape,of the claimant level of valvular heart disease.the district court has previously stated f or moderate mitral regurgitation to be present,the size of the reverse flowing jet of blood at its most expansive point must encompass between twenty percent and forty percent of the area of the left atrium.pto,d at.
several attorneys,including patterson counsel kip petroff,interpreted the settlement agreement to require a physician report to identify only one frame of an echocardiogram tape showing percent regurgitation.on december,petroff circulated a memorandum describing current developments in the fenphen litigation.the memo articulated this expansive interpretation of the settlement agreement 
it is clear that cardiologists who strictly employed the methodology in the national settlement maximum regurgitant view only are routinely the echos by at least one order of magnitude.that methodology is acceptable in the world of the national settlement,but it is not employed in the real world.we have carefully considered this,and it is absolutely clear that employing the national settlement criteria leads to over estimates of valve regurgitation,especially of the mitral valve.
every client who is graded a moderate mr by national settlement criteria is a mild at best,a severe is a moderate at best.this will lead to numerous mitral valve cases going from to,and that may be one reason to opt such a client back into the national settlement or have a new echo done using standard methodology.
memorandum from kip petroff and robert kisselburgh to all referring attorneys.
in a different but related case,the district court rejected a similar interpretation.see pto,d at holding that o nly after reviewing multiple loops and still frames can a cardiologist reach a medically reasonable assessment as to whether the twenty percent threshold for moderate mitral regurgitation has been achieved.but,because of petroff theory and other dubious practices by other law firms,the trust was inundated with green form claims for matrix benefits in unanticipated volumes under the policies and procedures for audit and disposition of matrix compensation claims,as approved in pto may,the trust could audit up to of matrix claims per quarter,and wyeth could designate up to of claims per quarter,for an audit by the trust.as a result,the trust risked paying out millions of dollars to claimants it believed to be ineligible,but whose claims it could not audit.wyeth asserts that out of the thirty claims submitted by petroff associates and audited under pto,were not failure rate of.according to wyeth,as of march,petroff associates failed audit more than of the time.in order to ameliorate the problem,the district court ordered audits for all matrix compensation claims.see pto,
in july petroff submitted patterson claim to the trust.patterson green form relied on the certification of the attesting physician reed harris,based on a february,echocardiogram,harris concluded that patterson had a moderate mitral regurgitation ratio of and that her left atrium was mildly enlarged.
the trust selected patterson claim for audit.under the audit policies and procedures,patterson had thirty days to submit any additional credible medical information for consideration by the trust and the independent auditing cardiologist.patterson did not supplement her initial submission forms.on december,the auditing cardiologist,keith churchwell,concluded that there was no reasonable medical basis for harris finding of moderate mitral regurgitation because the echocardiogram demonstrated trivial to mild mitral regurgitation.eyeballing the echocardiogram,churchwell determined that the mitral regurgitant jet area was overestimated in comparison to the left atrial size.
on january,the trust informed patterson that her claim had failed audit and attached churchwell findings.patterson chose to dispute the determination and proceed to the show cause proceeding.the district court granted the motion and referred the matter to a special master 
under the audit policies and procedures,f or audits based on the grounds that no reasonable medical basis exists for specific answer s to the audit question s,the claimant shall have the burden of proving that there was a reasonable medical basis to support the material representation s made by the attesting physician in answering the audit question s.audit policies and procedures,pto may.to support the attesting physician harris opinion,patterson submitted the report of cardiologist frank silvestry,silvestry reviewed the february,echocardiogram tape and identified the maximum regurgitant jet emanating from the mitral valve in systole.based upon the maximal jet,drawn at recording time,he concluded that patterson had mitral regurgitation.further,silvestry surmised that churchwell,the auditing cardiologist,may be expressing his qualitative opinion of the degree of mitral regurgitation however,the settlement documents specify a scientific and quantitative degree of mitral regurgitation,a degree which is clearly substantiated by the echocardiogram,and my independent measurements.
the district court concluded patterson has not met her burden in proving that there is a reasonable medical basis for finding that she had moderate mitral regurgitation because she failed to rebut or challenge the conclusion that harris determination was based on improper measurements.in re diet drugs,md,wl,at.the court noted that,notwithstanding silvestry report,patterson had failed to address the improper measurements underlying the finding of harris.id.at.
furthermore,the court rejected patterson suggestion that she could recover matrix benefits by identifying a single maximum regurgitant jet at the required level of mitral regurgitation.patterson has not established that the maximum regurgitant jet offered in support of her claim is representative of her level of mitral regurgitation,therefore,on this basis as well,patterson has failed to establish a reasonable medical basis of her claim.id.at 
patterson contends that the district court erred in several respects when denying her claim.first,patterson contends that,even in a borderline case,measuring a single frame to determine the severity of mitral regurgitation is an acceptable practice under the settlement agreement.second,she asserts that the auditing cardiologist visual assessment of the echocardiogram was insufficient to rebut her attesting physician measurements.according to patterson,the settlement agreement always requires a quantitative measurement of the regurgitant jets.finally,patterson contends that the district court misapplied the reasonable medical basis standard by applying it to silvestry opinion,rather than the attesting physician reed opinion.accordingly,patterson asserts it was improper for the court to deny her claim based on its rejection of silvestry method of evaluating her echocardiogram.we disagree.
patterson contends that the identification,in her case,of a single frame of an echocardiogram constitutes a reasonable medical basis because her doctor reviewed the entire echocardiogram.patterson asserts that in order to find a true maximum jet,a cardiologist must review multiple loops and frames and compare regurgitant jets.wyeth and the trust contend that,even if patterson doctor reviewed the entire echocardiogram,he failed to indicate that the identified maximum jet was representative of her condition and not an isolated and incident.
in determining whether a single frame of an echocardiogram constitutes a reasonable medical basis for finding moderate mitral regurgitation,the parties agree that the district court prior decisions are instructive these decisions indicate that the settlement agreement requires a cardiologist to review the echocardiogram for a regurgitant jet that is representative of the severity of the claimant medical condition.the identification of a single jet without any explanation or indication of its representativeness will not satisfy the claimant burden.
in pto,the district court examined claims determined by the trust to be medically unreasonable because the echocardiograms showed no significant levels of mitral regurgitation.the court noted that f or moderate mitral regurgitation to be present,the size of the reverse flowing jet of blood at its most expansive point must encompass between twenty percent and forty percent of the area of the left atrium,pto,d at,and discussed the settlement agreement protocol for measuring regurgitation.only after reviewing multiple loops and still frames can a cardiologist reach a medically reasonable assessment as to whether the twenty percent threshold for moderate mitral regurgitation has been achieved.id.at the district court held that each of the disputed claims lacked a reasonable medical basis,and in most cases,the measured jet was not a true regurgitant jet but rather a phantom jet or a backflow.id.at.
since pto,the district court has repeatedly criticized the use of a single frame of an echocardiogram as the sole basis for a claim of mitral regurgitation.f or a reasonable medical basis to exist,a claimant must demonstrate that a finding of the requisite level of regurgitation is representative of the level of regurgitation throughout an echocardiogram.in re diet drugs,md,wl,at.may,in re diet drugs,md,wl,at.may.nothing in the settlement agreement suggests that it is permissible for a claimant to rely on isolated instances of what appears to be the requisite level of regurgitation to meet this definition.in re diet drugs,wl,at.even though one of the endnotes in the green form refers to obtaining the regurgitant jet area from a maximum or average of three planes,this does not mean that a claim is compensable based only on the maximum or average regurgitant jet measured.in re diet drugs,wl,at.to conclude otherwise would allow claimants who do not have moderate or greater mitral regurgitation to receive matrix benefits,which would be contrary to the intent of the settlement agreement.id.
to illustrate,the district court has,in disagreement with the auditing cardiologist,awarded matrix compensation when the evidence shows a representative regurgitant jet of sufficient magnitude.in in re diet drugs,wl,the attesting physician found a regurgitation ratio of percent and concluded the claimant suffered from moderate mitral regurgitation.upon review,the auditing cardiologist concluded that the attesting physician opinion lacked a reasonable medical basis.during the show cause proceedings,a technical advisor concluded the echocardiogram demonstrated moderate mitral regurgitation.importantly,the technical advisor found an average of percent mitral regurgitation over four cardiac cycles.id.at.under these circumstances,claimant has met her burden in establishing a reasonable medical basis for her claim.see also in re diet drugs,md,wl,at,holding that claimant demonstrated reasonable medical basis for moderate mitral regurgitation and an abnormal left atrial dimension based on technical advisor opinion,which examined three different views of the heart.
in addition to the district court instructions on what is medically reasonable,the auditing cardiologist training course is instructive the training course states 
importance of viewing multiple heartbeats and frames 
as you are aware from your clinical practice,an echo reader can not focus on a single frame without reference to the overall level of regurgitation as assessed using multiple frames and heartbeats.only after reviewing multiple loops and still frames can a cardiologist reach a medically reasonable assessment as to whether any of the various thresholds established by the settlement for the different severity levels of regurgitation have been achieved,such as the threshold for moderate mitral regurgitation.
the interpreter or auditor thus must properly appreciate the level of regurgitation where a single frame may not appropriately represent the true volume of the regurgitation during systole.
as noted,patterson contends that the settlement agreement allows a cardiologist to measure a single maximum jet.furthermore,patterson asserts that t here is no factual basis for concluding that the maximum regurgitant jet is not representative of the regurgitation throughout the echocardiogram or that silvestry did not review all the loops and frames.patterson br.at.
silvestry report indicated on may,i reviewed and analyzed patterson echocardiographic study and performed my own measurements of the left atrial and regurgitant jet area.i identified the maximum regurgitant jet and measured its area using echoanalysis software.based on this statement,patterson contends that silvestry could not have identified the maximum regurgitant jet without reviewing multiple loops and comparing regurgitant jets.but even if we were to assume that silvestry reviewed multiple loops,the question of representativeness remains.under the settlement agreement,patterson has the burden of proof to demonstrate her entitlement to benefits.a general statement that a
