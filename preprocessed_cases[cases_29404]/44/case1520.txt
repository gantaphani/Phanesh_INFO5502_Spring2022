on december,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia issued an order dismissing appellant richard galustian defamation suit against lawrence peter for forum non conveniens.the district court found that iraq was an available and adequate forum for the suit and was overall more convenient.additionally,the court denied galustian motion to amend his complaint to add further factual allegations against peter and to join colonel jack holly as a.for the reasons stated below,we reverse in part and vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
richard galustian galustian is a citizen of great britain and a resident of the united arab emirates.he is the owner and director of isi international,isi,a commercial security,aviation,and defense consultancy business incorporated under the laws of dubai and the united arab emirates.lawrence peter peter is a citizen of the united states who resides in virginia beach,virginia.he works in baghdad,iraq as the director of the private security company association of iraq pscai,an industry association that keeps member companies apprised of industry developments and sets standards for the private security sector in iraq.
on february,galustian filed a defamation complaint against peter in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.venue and personal jurisdiction were established by peter legal residence in virginia beach.in his complaint,galustian alleged that peter defamed him by sending an email to the members of pscai on february,which attached an arrest warrant for galustian purportedly issued by an iraqi judge.the warrant for galustian arrest showed it was issued by judge muhammad uwaid and listed galustian personal data.however,the space for indicating the type of crime and article of law for which the warrant was issued was left conspicuously blank.peter sent the email to all members of the pscai,attaching the original arabic and english translation of the warrant,and stating please note the attached document received by this office,feb.isi is a member of the pscai.all the best,lawrence.compl.ex.
in his submission to the district court,peter stated that he received the warrant from colonel jack holly holly,then the director of logistics for the army corps of engineers,and that he forwarded it to the members of the pscai because he believed it was significant that an iraqi court was attempting to assert jurisdiction over a private contractor.peter stated he inspected the warrant,and it appeared to be genuine.he submitted to the court that he did not,and does not now,have any reason to believe otherwise.holly stated in his affidavit that he forwarded the warrant to peter because he knew peter worked with a large community of private security companies in iraq,and he believed it could significantly affect their operations.
galustian alleges in his complaint that the warrant was in fact a forgery as background,galustian states that he had made an agreement in the past with a private security company incorporated in canada,skylink arabia skylink,to provide services for them in return for a equity share in their company.skylink failed to deliver the equity interest,and galustian and isi filed suit in a canadian court in november for breach of contract.as a result of his litigation against skylink,galustian claims that skylink caused the false warrant to be issued and to be delivered to peter so that it would be disseminated widely.he further alleges that peter then acted knowingly,recklessly,or negligently in disregard of the fact that the warrant was a forgery when he published it via email to the members of the pscai.as a result,galustian asserts that his reputation for honesty and integrity has been seriously harmed,and he has lost substantial business.he requests in damages.
in response to galustian complaint,peter filed a motion to dismiss the case for forum non conveniens and failure to state a claim under virginia or iraqi law peter attached exhibit a to his motion,an affidavit from george hermes hanna,a member of the iraq bar association who practiced law in iraq until november when he fled to the united states.hanna stated that he is familiar with the current civil code in effect in iraq,and it provides a cause of action for defamation in articles and.peter also attached a copy of coalition provisional authority order number order.order was issued by paul bremer,the head of the coalition provisional authority,during the early days of the occupation of iraq.the order granted immunity from legal process in iraq to certain classes of people the force,foreign liaison missions and their personnel,international consultants,and contractors with respect to acts performed pursuant to their contracts.peter stated,as part of his argument that iraq was an alternative forum,that he was not protected by the immunity provisions of order because he did not contract with the government or military.
galustian did not file a direct response to the motion to dismiss rather he filed a motion to amend his complaint.in his proposed amended complaint,galustian added holly as a,alleging holly conspired with peter and skylink to defame him by causing a false warrant for his arrest to be published.galustian alleged that holly conspired with skylink because holly had obtained a secret equity interest in the company,an assertion holly denied in his affidavit submitted to the court.finally,in his motion to amend,galustian pled that iraq is not an available alternative forum for his suit because both peter and holly are immune from suit under order and galustian himself can no longer be present in iraq because of threats to his life.
the district court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss on may,and issued its decision on june.galustian peter,d.the district judge granted the motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens on the condition that peter waive all immunity under order and affirmatively submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of iraq by waiving any statute of limitations defense he could have otherwise raised.id.at.the court held that dismissal was proper because iraq provides a remedy for defamation and is available for litigation.id.overall,the court found that all factors heavily favor holding the case in iraq.id.at.the district court denied galustian motion to amend,reasoning that because the case was dismissed for forum non conveniens,the motion to amend the complaint was moot.id.at.
after the decision was rendered,galustian filed a motion to amend the court order on the basis that order does not allow for individual waiver,but mandates an express waiver from the sending state.the court agreed with this logic and modified its order to require that peter provide a waiver of immunity from iraqi legal process by the united states on the defendant behalf,in accordance with of order.galustian peter,d.indeed,if peter did not provide the waiver,he has not carried his burden of showing that iraq is an adequate alternative forum.id.at.
in response to the judge requirement,peter submitted a formal request to the state department for a waiver of his order immunity on september.the state department responded on october,declining to prospectively waive peter immunity but stating that,in its opinion,a waiver would not be necessary because,based on the information provided,peter was not entitled to immunity 
the district court dismissed galustian action for forum non conveniens in a final order on december.galustian peter,d.the court found that the best available evidence of whether order applies to peter was the state department letter and its conclusion that he is not immune.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
galustian presents two issues upon appeal whether the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint,and whether the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for forum non conveniens.we reverse the court decision on the first question alone,and remand this matter with guidance to the district court on the forum non conveniens issue.
