in a series of tragic and terrifying attacks on september,terrorists killed thousands in pennsylvania,virginia,and new york,caused extensive damage to the pentagon,and brought about the collapse of the north and south towers of the world trade center wtc.as with other catastrophes,true heros responded,not the least among them the brave firefighters,police,and units of the city of new york.plaintiffs are the personal representatives of firefighters who lost their lives in responding to the wtc following the attacks.plaintiffs complaint focuses on the failure of equipment in the north and south towers that prevented firefighters from receiving evacuation orders before the towers collapse.plaintiffs commenced this action for wrongful death against new york city the city on december,and filed an amended complaint as of right on january,that added motorola,motorola as a defendant.
plaintiffs claim that motorola negligently and intentionally provided the city with communication equipment for firefighters that motorola knew to be ineffective in structures like the towers of the wtc,that motorola made fraudulent material misrepresentations to secure contracts with the city,and that those acts and representations caused decedents deaths plaintiffs also press a series of wrongful death claims against the city based upon its alleged failure to meet duties imposed on the city under new york law to provide adequate and safe equipment finally,in count of the amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that the city and motorola engaged in concerted action in an attempt to deprive firefighters of adequate protection and to engage in fraudulent misrepresentations and deceitful conduct.
shortly after the disaster,congress passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the air stabilization act or the act,stat.the statute limited liability for the air carriers involved in the tragedy to their insurance coverage,see air stabilization act a created the victim compensation fund the fund to provide compensation to victims who were injured in the attacks and to personal representatives of victims killed in the attacks,see id,a,b,c and provided an election of claimants who filed with the fund waived the right to sue for injuries resulting from the attacks except for collateral benefits,see id.c b i.on november,the act was amended by the aviation and transportation security act the aviation security act,stat.significantly,the amendments extended liability limits to aircraft manufacturers,those with a proprietary interest in the wtc,and the city of new york,see id.b,while allowing fund claimants to sue individuals responsible for the attacks notwithstanding the waiver,see id.a.
under the act,the final date by which claimants could submit claims to the fund was december.see air stabilization act a.the special master appointed to oversee the fund,kenneth feinberg,extended the filing date to january,for those claimants who previously submitted incomplete claims.the special master promulgated an application form that notified claimants of the waiver provision and required claimants to sign an acknowledgment of waiver.the acknowledgment of waiver tracked the language of the statutory waiver provision.
a number of september cases were consolidated before judge hellerstein on december,judge hellerstein issued an order addressing when the waiver via assertion of fund claims would become effective.see in re september,mc,wl.judge hellerstein held that submission of fund the waiver on the earlier of when a fund filing is substantially complete as determined by the special master or january.id.at.
a day after filing their amended complaint,plaintiffs moved by order to show cause on january,asking that the court permit them to continue their lawsuit against defendants despite having filed claims with the fund.alternatively,plaintiffs asked the court to stay judge hellerstein earlier required that cases brought by victims with fund awards pending as of january,be to place their case on the suspense docket of the consolidated in re september litigation docket until a general consolidated conference previously set by judge hellerstein for february,took place because of the january deadline for completing previously filed but incomplete fund claims,judge haight held a hearing on the on the motion and issued a ruling from the bench finding that the statute waiver provision barred the suit against the city or motorola the plaintiffs claims against both the city and motorola are subject to the limitation on civil actions provided for in section c b i of the statute.virgilio motorola,d,haight,quoting transcript.
on january,judge haight issued a detailed decision that set forth his reasons for finding that plaintiffs claims were barred as a result of their decision to file with the fund.see id.at.although the court denied the relief requested in the order to show cause on a finding that the waiver provision barred plaintiffs claims,it did not dismiss the amended complaint as defendants had yet to file answers and had little time to oppose the order to show cause other than through argument of counsel before judge haight.because plaintiffs case raised claims similar to those in in re september litigation,judge haight transferred the case to judge hellerstein suspense docket of the consolidated in re september litigation docket.id.at 
on january,the next day,the city moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to.b or for summary judgment on several grounds,including the act waiver provision the expiration of the statute of limitations for wrongful death actions against municipalities and plaintiffs failure to serve timely notices of claim against the city.motorola moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground of waiver.
judge hellerstein dismissed the complaint in an unpublished decision.see virgilio motorola,civ.akh,wl.the district court adopted judge haight decision noting that the waiver provision applies to all of the claims against motorola and the city of new york as plaintiffs have elected their remedy,they have also waived the right to bring a civil action for damages sustained as a result of the aircraft crashes of september.id.at quoting air stabilization act c b i.
plaintiffs appealed,and we now affirm.
discussion 
when confronted with an appeal from the dismissal of a complaint,we review the matter anew,see,conopco,roll int l,cir,and take as true the complaint allegations.a complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim only if there are no legal grounds upon which relief may be granted.see jacobs ramirez,cir.b.the task at hand reduces itself to examining the statute and assessing its impact on this case.
statutory scheme 
the air stabilization act establishes the fund and delegates to the attorney general the authority to appoint a special master to oversee victim compensation.see air stabilization act.as congress noted,one purpose of the fund is to provide compensation to any individual or relatives of a deceased individual who was physically injured or killed as a result of the aircraft crashes of september.id.however,eligibility for fund payment is conditioned upon a waiver by claimants of the right to file any civil action in state or federal court except for civil actions against those responsible for the attack or to recover collateral source obligations.schneider feinberg,cir quoting air stabilization act c b.because the act seeks to provide quick compensation decisions for victims while capping the litigation exposure of defendants,it is quite clear that the act general purpose is to protect the airline industry and other potentially liable entities from financially fatal liabilities while ensuring that those injured or killed in the terrorist attacks receive adequate compensation.canada life assurance converium ruckversicherung deutschland ag,cir citing cong.rec.daily ed,statement of mccain.
sections and b set forth general guidelines and requirements for fund claims and create a federal cause of action for claims relating to.see id,b.section c b i contains the waiver provision central to this case 
b limitation on civil action.
i in the submission of a claim under this title,the claimant waives the right to file a civil action or to be a party to an action in any federal or state court for damages sustained as a result of the aircraft crashes of september.the preceding sentence does not apply to a civil action to recover collateral source obligations,or to a civil action against any person who is a knowing participant in any conspiracy to hijack any aircraft or commit any terrorist act.
as amended by the aviation security act,a.
while section creates a system for determining fund eligibility outside of the litigation context,section funnels all civil litigation for actions resulting from or relating to the aircraft crashes of september,into the southern district of new york by granting that court original and exclusive jurisdiction over such actions,id.b,and provides that the substantive law for decision in any such suit shall be derived from the law of the state in which the crash occurred unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law,id.b.as noted above,section caps the liability of air carriers,aircraft manufacturers,holders of proprietary interests in the wtc,and the city.see id.a,a,a aviation security act b.
statutory waiver provision air stabilization act c b i 
we agree with the district court that under the plain language of the statute,claimants who have filed claims with the fund have waived the right to file a civil action for damages sustained as a result of the aircraft crashes of september,and that the waiver bars claims for damages sustained against defendants.we affirm the district court determination and find plaintiffs claim barred by their election of remedies.
plaintiffs assert that the waiver provision does not apply to claims against the defendants because the correct interpretation of that section bars suits against only the industry.plaintiffs present three arguments to support their contention they assert that the district court misinterpreted congress purpose in enacting the air stabilization act that the waiver provision should be examined in the context of its relationship to the statute and subsequent amendments to the air stabilization act and that the legislative history of the waiver provision supports a narrower interpretation of that provision than that employed by the district court.the city and motorola counter that the plain language unambiguously bars the current suit and that the legislative history of the act further supports their view.
when interpreting a statute,the first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.robinson shell oil,d quoting united states ron pair,d.further,t he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at.citing estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d and mccarthy bronson,d.thus,we begin with the language of the statute itself.
in our view,the waiver provision is unambiguous.the language of the waiver provision clearly states that fund claimants waive their right to bring civil actions resulting from any harm caused by the attacks u pon the submission of a claim,the claimant waives the right to file a civil action in any federal or state court for damages sustained as a result of the aircraft crashes of september.air stabilization act c b i.the waiver provision plainly requires litigants to choose between compensation and civil litigation.if this waiver provision is ambiguous as plaintiffs suggest,few if any statutory provisions could be viewed as clear.
the overall structure of the act highlights two predominate concerns to insulate the airline industry from arising from the sudden and devastating acts of wanton cruelty on and to provide an adequate system of compensation to victims.see canada life assurance,at.the statute balanced the certainty of a recovery against the relinquishment of one right to bring a federal by the injuries arising from the disaster.see schneider,at canada life assurance,at noting fund compensation in exchange for a waiver of their rights to file a civil action b creating a federal cause of action for damages arising out of the hijacking.without the act,victims and their families could seek compensation only through litigation in state or federal courts.the terrorists carried out four separate attacks in three of which involved the damage or destruction of government and office buildings and a concomitant loss of lives within those structures and the areas adjacent to them.thus,the number of plaintiffs,possible defendants,and theories of recovery were as diverse as the confluence of misfortunes that befell each victim.moreover,the litigation scatter pattern presented the possibility of lawsuits in state and federal courts nationwide 
while the potential liability to the air carriers and airplane manufacturers involved was monumental,the prospect for recovery by the victims and their families was not certain.a verdict against the air carriers or other potential defendants,such as the city or motorola,was not guaranteed.in addition,the scope of liability was so substantial that the prospect of bankruptcy court for the air carriers was real.in order to provide the certainty of recovery for victims and their families,congress created the fund,which provides awards without an assessment of fault or responsibility for the loss all the victims or their representatives need establish is presence at the site of a attack and physical injury or death as a result of the attacks.see air stabilization act c.
the act centralizes the victims litigation claims in one federal court while applying the substantive state law of the locus of the injury.it recognizes that the airline industry might not be able to withstand the litigation tidal wave the attacks would create.it also recognizes that such an onslaught would likely leave many victims and their families waiting years,while blame for the attacks and the resulting injuries is parsed out among hundreds of defendants leaving plaintiffs to recover only a small pro rata share of a fair award in bankruptcy court.thus,the statute carries out a careful balancing of a number of important interests.it gives claimants a reasonable choice between an administrative claim or litigation centralized in one court in which the primary defendants would have limits to their exposure.in our view,there is no inconsistency in compensating victims and their families at a price of complete litigation peace.
it is clear to us that plaintiffs claims are within the scope of the waiver provision.here,plaintiffs damages arose as a result of the attacks.plaintiffs assert that the waiver should not reach defendants alleged tortious conduct.in plaintiffs view,defendants acts independently caused plaintiffs injuries.but,in fact,the injuries to plaintiffs and their loved ones resulted from a series of interrelated events that began with the terrorist attack.even assuming independent,successive tortious acts by both the terrorists and defendants,as we must on this motion to dismiss,we are hard pressed to find plaintiffs damages did not least in the terrorist attacks.
indeed,plaintiffs overlook the very language of the statute that defines their eligibility for compensation for the fund.the act provides that anyone,or their relative,who was present at and injured or killed as a result of the aircraft crashes of september,may file a claim with the fund.see air stabilization act c.in our view,plaintiffs can not embrace the statute broad view that many people,in widely differing circumstances,died as a result of the attacks while simultaneously constricting the same language in the waiver to include only the airlines.compare id.c with id.c b i.
plaintiffs also contend that amendments to the air stabilization act reveal the limited scope of the waiver provision.this argument continues to ignore the plai
