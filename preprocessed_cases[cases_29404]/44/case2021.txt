the plaintiffs bring this consolidated interlocutory appeal challenging orders denying their motions for remand to state court after the defendants removed these actions to federal district court.because the relevant mississippi law is,at a minimum,ambiguous,there is arguably a reasonable basis for predicting that the state law might impose liability on the facts involved travis irby,cir.under such circumstances,there is no fraudulent joinder,and removal is inappropriate,because the lack of complete diversity divests the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.we therefore reverse and remand.
the plaintiffs filed their respective suits in mississippi state court alleging that residents of beverly nursing home were injured as a result of the conduct of all the defendants.the named defendants include the corporate owners of the nursing home,beverly,and beverly health and rehabilitation services.these defendants are california corporations with their principal place of business in arkansas and are therefore diverse from the plaintiffs,all of whom are residents and citizens of mississippi.also named as defendants are numerous individual licensees and administrators of the facility,some of whom are diverse from the plaintiffs and others of whom are,also citizens of mississippi.
in each of the suits consolidated for purposes of appeal,defendants removed to federal district court,arguing that the defendants were fraudulently joined,and therefore there is complete diversity.on each of the plaintiffs motions to remand to state court,the district court ruled the defendants were fraudulently joined,denied the motions to remand,and dismissed the claims against the defendants.
the court held that the complaint did not state a viable claim against the defendants under mississippi law,specifically finding that mississippi law does not provide a cause of action for any of the counts alleged against the defendants simple negligence,malice gross negligence,medical malpractice,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty.
the court reasoned that the plaintiffs could not state a claim under state law for simple negligence against the defendants because,u nder mississippi law,an agent of a disclosed principal can incur independent liability when his conduct constitutes gross negligence,malice,or reckless disregard for the rights of another.but,mississippi does not recognize a cause of action against an agent for simple negligence quoting bass cal.life ins,so d,emphasis added by district court.the court further held that the administrator and licensee defendants did not owe plaintiffs a duty under state law,so the claims against those defendants for negligence also fail to state a viable cause of action.the court additionally dismissed the medical malpractice,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty claims.
significantly,as we will explain,the plaintiffs briefs challenge only the ruling with respect to negligence and gross negligence.specifically,the plaintiffs reply brief notes that the remaining claims are not before this court,nor were they discussed in their opening brief.
the district court recognized that n o mississippi case law directly relates to the issues at hand and that the cases leave a great deal to interpretation.the court,therefore,attempted to certify the cases for appeal pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.because of the peculiar language used in the district court orders,however,we requested supplemental briefing on whether the order in one of these consolidated.boddie,was properly certified so as to confer appellate jurisdiction.
plaintiffs have moved this court to take judicial notice of unreported decisions from federal district courts in mississippi and unreported state court judicial decisions and records.that motion was carried with the case.
on the jurisdictional question,there is no discernible difference between the wording of the order purporting to render boddie fit for appeal under either rule b or b and the corresponding orders in the other two cases.nevertheless,even the defendants concede that we have jurisdiction over the other two cases under b,despite the fact that there is no indication that the plaintiffs received the requisite permission from this court as required by the statute.
the relevant order in boddie as well as the orders in the other two cases reads in pertinent part 
plaintiff seeks to certify the findings in the august opinion for interlocutory appeal.plaintiff invokes the provisions of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in the subject case,the court finds that there exists a danger of hardship or injustice through delay which would be alleviated by immediate appeal as such,the court finds that justice will be served by the immediate appeal of this issue 
plaintiff also invokes the provisions of b under b,an issue is appropriate for interlocutory appeal if it present s a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.as analyzed above,the fraudulent joinder of a business manager does present such a question,and interlocutory appeal is appropriate for that issue 
for these final reasons,the court finds that the subject issue should be decided on interlocutory appeal 
brackets in original,citations omitted.
the defendants urge that the order renders neither an appealable final order nor a case certified for interlocutory appeal.they rely on the proposition that an order that dismisses fewer than all defendants is not appealable unless the court makes an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.b.because the order in boddie does not contain this particular phrasing,the defendants conclude rule b can not provide the basis for our jurisdiction.further,defendants contend that the order can not be appealable under b,because this court has not granted leave to take an interlocutory appeal.
plaintiffs,for their part,remind us that our existing jurisprudence explains that a rule b interlocutory appeal is appropriate where the language of the order appealed,independently or read together with other portions of the record,reflects the court unmistakable intent to render the issue appealable under rule b,and nothing else is required to make the order appealable ford elsbury,cir.according to plaintiffs,the order reflects just this sort of unmistakable intent.the defendants completely fail to address the unmistakable intent argument and rely solely on the lack of the phrase no just reason for delay.
to hold that this order is not appropriate for review under rule b because it lacks the talismanic words for which the defendants search would be directly contrary to this circuit precedent.in kelly lee old fashioned hamburgers,cir en banc,we held that a district court may make the requisite express determination without mechanically reciting the words no just reason for delay.
such an unmistakable intent is readily apparent from the face of the district court order.the court found that there exists a danger of hardship or injustice through delay which would be alleviated by immediate appeal as such,the court finds that justice will be served by the immediate appeal of this issue this explanation is a mere paraphrase of the seven words t here is not just reason for delay a paraphrase stating that a delay would yield injustice,and an immediate appeal would serve justice that presents an even stronger justification for appeal than existed in kelly,where the district court did not expressly consider the justice of a delay,but rather impliedly did so by ordering a final judgment pursuant to rule b.
the district court expressed its finding merely using a phraseology different from the seven words of the rule.therefore,we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of all three cases,including boddie,under rule b.
the plaintiffs main contention on appeal is that the district court erred in holding that mississippi law does not recognize a cause of action for negligence or gross negligence against the defendants.from that,plaintiffs reason that removal was improper.
plaintiffs first suggest that the court applied an incorrect standard in considering their motions to remand.such a motion will be denied on grounds of fraudulent joinder only if based on actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts,or inability of the plaintiff to establish a cause of action against the party in state court.travis irby,cir.because neither the parties nor the district court contends there was actual fraud,we look only to the second test.
though our earlier fraudulent joinder cases had been uncertain as to whether a removing defendant must demonstrate an absence of any possibility of recovery in state court,we clarified in travis that the defendant must demonstrate only that there is no reasonable basis for predicting that the plaintiff will recover in state court.id.thus,the travis court noted the similarity of the standard to that used with respect to a federal rule of civil procedure b motion,in that the crucial question is whether the plaintiff has set out a valid claim under applicable state law.id.
critically,all disputed questions of fact and all ambiguities in state law must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff.id.citing great plains trust morgan stanley dean witter,cir.further,the plaintiff may not rely solely on the allegations in his complaint the court may pierce the pleadings and consider summary evidence to determine whether the plaintiff truly has a reasonable possibility of recovery in state court.id.at.
the district court correctly recited this standard from travis.nevertheless,plaintiffs contend that the court improperly expanded its review beyond whether there is a reasonable possibility that a mississippi court might impose liability in making that argument,the plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize the possibility of recovery language while giving only lip service to the reasonable modifier.
to that extent,the district court correctly evaluated the fraudulent joinder claim.although recognizing that mississippi law on the subject is cloudy,the court disregarded the theoretical possibility of recovery and considered whether there was a reasonable possibility under state law.
for example,plaintiffs devote considerable energy to the contention that the very fact that mississippi state courts have entered judgments against administrators and licensees of nursing homes in similar cases is conclusive evidence of the district court error.but,after analyzing the relevant mississippi caselaw,the district court concluded that plaintiffs lacked a reasonable possibility of recovery.this analysis,notwithstanding the fact that we may find it flawed under de novo review,nevertheless reflected the proper approach under applicable precedent.see,id.at.
we review the district court analysis of state law,its determination that the plaintiffs lack a reasonable possibility of recovery de novo.see mckee kansas city,cir.the district court initially concluded,in a cursory analysis,that mississippi state law precludes recovery for simple negligence against an agent of a disclosed principal.for this the court relied solely on bass cal.life ins,so d,holding that a health insurance plan administrator could not be held liable in a bad faith denial of coverage suit based on mere negligent conduct.the bass court noted that such agents owe no duty of good faith or other fiduciary duties to insured parties.id.from this proposition,the district court extrapolated that no negligence claims can be brought successfully against agents of disclosed principals.
this conclusion was likely erroneous,and certainly inaccurate enough to warrant remand under the standard,which resolves all ambiguities in favor of the party seeking remand.as plaintiffs point out,the cases relying on bass are almost all in the context of insurance agents and adjusters.further,there have been several cases in which agents of disclosed principals were in fact held liable for negligence 
the defendants counter that the complaints in the instant cases allege a similar sort of hybrid cause of action,and thus,bass is controlling.nevertheless,defendants point to no additional cases in which the bass limitation has been applied outside the context of denial of claims.consequently,the court incorrectly held that there is no reasonable basis for predicting that a cause of action for simple negligence will lie under the circumstances alleged.
that error,however,is not dispositive.the district court went on to find that the plaintiffs additionally can not state a cause of action for malice or gross negligence the court based its conclusion on the defendants lack of duty to the plaintiffs.these same arguments apply with equal force to claims for simple negligence.thus,if the court was correct in its reason for finding that the plaintiffs can not state a claim for gross negligence,then its erroneous refusal to recognize a simple negligence cause of action would be irrelevant,for that claim would be barred on the other grounds 
in addition to asserting that the defendants were guilty of simple negligence,the complaints allege several breaches of supposed duties under the rubric of inadequate management constituting gross negligence.the district court stated,
the particular issue in this case is whether the duty to adequately manage beverly healthcare was owed by the defendants to plaintiff,or whether the duty was owed to the two corporate defendants that owned beverly healthcare.if the duty was owed to plaintiff,then plaintiff has asserted a viable state law cause of action and the case must be remanded.conversely,if the duty was owed to the corporate defendants,then plaintiff has no valid cause of action against the defendants,requiring dismissal of the defendants and denial of plaintiff motion to remand.
footnote omitted.the court went on to conclude that as a general matter,any duty that the licensees and administrators had to manage the nursing home adequately was owed not to the plaintiffs,but to the business itself.the plaintiffs contend this finding is in error in that both mississippi common law and statutory regulations establish a duty to plaintiffs.
the complaints allege that the administrator and licensee defendants committed gross negligence in that they failed to comply with the regulations promulgated by the mississippi department of health governing nursing homes the district court gave cursory attention to this argument,noting that there was no legislative intent to create a private cause of action.
both sides devote considerable energy to negligence per se and whether these regulations allow recovery under that theory.that debate is beside the point.the district court held that the plaintiffs did not have a reasonable expectation of recovery against the defendants under mississippi law because,inter alia,those defendants did not owe a duty to plaintiffs.negligence per se,on the other hand,is a theory by which statutes are used to establish the appropriate standard of care.in absence of a duty to the plaintiff,the relevant standard of care is moot.as even the plaintiffs note,
the statute provisions are deemed conclusive expressions of the applicable standard of care and reasonable conduct.indeed,the mississippi supreme court has stated that a violation of an internal regulation may serve as evidence of negligence,even if it does not give rise to a private right of action.
quoting moore mem l,so d,other citations omitted.thus,the theory of negligence per se does not speak to the relevant question of whether the defendants owed any duty of care to the plaintiffs.
plaintiffs further argue,citing minimum standards e that the regulations provide an explicit right of action that establishes a duty.indeed,the applicable regulation does appear to grant such a right.unfortunately,it does not appear that any mississippi court has determined whether those particular regulations confer a cause of action.plaintiffs point to several recent unreported federal district court opinions concluding that such a cause of action is afforded on the other hand,defendants counter that in an analogous situation,in moore mem,so d,involving state pharmacy board regulations,the court found no cause of action.but,as noted in hill,slip op.at,moore did not hold that regulations can never establish a legal duty or cause of action,but rather that the particular regulations considered did not do so.
in summary,mississippi caselaw on this point is.the minimum standards may or may not provide a private cause of action that would be applicable here.
defendants further counter by arguing that,even assuming the regulations are meant to grant such a cause of action,such a grant would greatly overstep the department of health legislative grant of authority.the relevant statutory grant authorizes the department to 
adopt,amend,promulgate and enforce such rules,regulations and standards,including classifications,with respect to all institutions for the aged or infirm to be licensed under this chapter as may be designed to further the accomplishment of the purpose of this chapter in promoting adequate care of individuals in those institutions in the interest of public health,safety and welfare.
ann.this statutory grant of authority may be susceptible to interpretation both for and against the ability to grant a private right of action.but,as the plaintiffs correctly note,that is more appropriately an argument for the mississippi courts.
the dearth of applicable caselaw interpreting the minimum standards,coupled with the unreported district court decisions concluding that a cause of action was intended,weighs heavily in plaintiffs favor.as we said above,when considering a fraudulent joinder argument,the court must resolve all ambiguities in state law in favor of remand.thus,defendants are not able to meet their heavy burden of showing that there is no reasonable possibility that plaintiffs can recover in state court 
the district court also concluded that the licensee and administrator defendants did not owe a duty of care to the nursing home residents under mississippi common law,and therefore plaintiffs have no reasonable possibility of recovering under mississippi law.the district court analytically divided the allegations of gross negligence into two relating to either the daily care of plaintiff s or the typical functions of a manager.
with respect to the latter category,the court found that absent extenuating circumstances well beyond those pled in the complaint,the defendants owed to the corporate owners,rather than the residents,the duty to manage the nursing home adequately.although the court purportedly relied on several cases for this proposition,those decisions are not necessarily on point,because they more accurately reflect the law as it relates to allegations of negligence with respect to direct care rather than to inadequate management.the district court points to no cases specifically addressing whether a duty of an agent adequately to manage a facility is owed to the principal,to third parties,or to both.
plaintiffs aver that such duties need not be mutually exclusive.despite the accuracy of this contention,plaintiffs can point to no authority establishing that such duality of allegiances exists with respect to a duty to manage adequately.the defendants,for their part,can do no better.they cite to no case establishing that a duty to manage a facility adequately can not be owed to a third party in addition to the entity itself.although ambiguous questions of law must be resolved in favor of the plaintiffs,they,in the absence of any authority,can not reasonably expect to recover under state law.these allegations alone,therefore,are insufficient to defeat complete diversity.
notwithstanding the absence of authority with respect to the defendants alleged failure adequately to manage the facility,the plaintiffs additionally allege direct participation on behalf of the licensees and administrators in the supposed grossly negligent care of residents.the district court found that the plaintiffs can not adequately show that the defendants were sufficiently directly involved in the care of the plaintiff to saddle independent tort liability on an agent of a disclosed principal.both sides concede that such an agent may be liable under mississippi law where he was directly involved in the commission of a this case,if the defendants were directly involved in resident care.
the issue,therefore,is what constitutes direct.the defendants and the district court apparently equated the term with care.plaintiffs,on the other hand,argue for a more expansive definition.
as we have said,in the context of fraudulent joinder analysis a party may not rely on the allegations in his pleadings on their face,but must show that there is,at minimum,some reasonable dispute of a fact that,if established,would demonstrate a reasonable possibility of recovery.the district court considered affidavits from the defendants claiming that they were not involved in the care of plaintiff s,determined that this evidence was unrebutted,and therefore found that plaintiffs claims must fail.
the defendants echo this argument on appeal,contending that there is no evidence offered that demonstrates care or participation in the medical injuries alleged.plaintiffs claim,however,that liability will lie even in the absence of such evidence,and they contend that their complaints allege sufficiently direct that such participation need not be,as defendants maintain.
defendants point to mozingo correct,cir,for the proposition that to face tort liability,an agent such as the defendants must be the guiding spirit or central figure.defendants further reason that the affidavits of the defendants,which deny any direct participation in the care of the plaintiffs,stand and therefore demonstrate the existence of fraudulent joinder.
in contrast,plaintiffs rely on cases purporting to establish liability for a wider spectrum of acts and omissions.for example,in turner wilson,so d,the court stated that directors,officers,and agents may be liable for torts where they either participated in the act,authorized it or directed it,gave consent to an act,or even acquiesced in a tortious act that they knew of or should have known of in the exercise of reasonable care.
plaintiffs also point to numerous unreported district court decisions in mississippi in which,under very similar circumstances some involving the same defendants as in this case,the courts,in plaintiffs words,rejected the defendants myopic view of direct participation as requiring personal contact quoting hill.in those unreported cases,the district court held that a nursing home administrator,like the defendants,may be held liable for their personal tortious conduct without personal,contact with the plaintiff.see,hill.rather,allegations of failure to perform managerial duties,such as maintaining adequate records and supervising those members of the staff who handled the residents care,were held sufficient to afford a reasonable basis for imposing personal liability under mississippi law.bradley grancare,at.
lastly,plaintiffs rely on rein benchmark constr,wl.june,for the proposition that the question whether these defendants owe a duty to plaintiffs is one of fact.in rein,a nursing home resident sued a pest control company for injuries inflicted by ants.the court found that it was possible that the pest control company was an independent contractor with no independent duty to the plaintiff.nevertheless,it held that the question was one for the trier of fact.id.at.thus,plaintiffs assume that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the defendants in this case owe a duty to them.
on balance,plaintiffs have the better of the least strong enough to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of recovery under mississippi law.plaintiffs can not demonstrate contact by the defendants,but such activity does not seem required to impose personal liability under mississippi law.one may easily be a direct participant in tortious conduct by merely authorizing or negligently failing to remedy misconduct by one subordinates.
it is uncertain,at this stage of the litigation,whether plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations of direct participation to the satisfaction of the trier of fact.nevertheless,it is at least reasonable to expect that a mississippi court might find that the allegations of the defendants misfeasance and nonf
