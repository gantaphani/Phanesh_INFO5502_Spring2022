district courts have authority to enter summary judgment on grounds not raised by the parties.that authority,though,is far from unbridled.here,the district court with the acquiescence of the parties limited pretrial discovery to specific issues.it later entered summary judgment on a completely different issue an issue not briefed and on which discovery had not been allowed.concluding,as we do,that the district court shift in focus exceeded its authority,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we rehearse the facts in the light most amenable to the parties opposing summary judgment here,the plaintiffs.see jones secord,cir,studentcity is a delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in massachusetts.it sells vacation packages to students,including those traveling for spring break or to celebrate graduations.
in the fall of,lisa tam chung and loren daily were seniors in grand prairie,texas.a studentcity representative contacted loren to promote the firm wares and piqued her curiosity about booking a graduation trip.once a critical mass of students had expressed interest about such a trip,the studentcity representative held an informational meeting.the representative assured the assemblage including several parents that studentcity staff attend all events and that participating students would not be permitted to go anywhere unaccompanied.she also distributed promotional materials that stated in pertinent part 
studentcity will provide o n site staff at all scheduled events beginning to end.
studentcity staffs all scheduled events from beginning to end.
studentcity maintains the largest ratio and our staff is there to give you the peace of mind you need.
studentcity staff will be present to assure that everyone is having a great and responsible time.
loren parents met with the studentcity representative and read the written materials.lisa relayed studentcity representations to her parents,who had limited english proficiency.with the blessing of both families,the girls purchased vacation packages for a june trip to canc√∫n,mexico,adding an optional snorkeling excursion.
the snorkeling excursion took place on june,when the participants boarded the ss sea star,a catamaran owned and operated by servicios maritimos y acua del caribe sa de sma.a studentcity staff member transported lisa and loren to the sea star,a vessel approved to carry eighty passengers and three crew members for this kind of outing on the day in question,however,it carried at least studentcity travelers and no fewer than persons in total.no studentcity representative was on board.
the snorkeling trip had a tragic ending the sea star hit a coral reef and began to take on water,yet the crew provided no assistance to the passengers indeed,some crew members deserted ship.acting on their own,lisa and loren donned life preservers and tried to reach safety by grabbing a rope that extended between the sea star and a small private vessel.their efforts failed and they were pulled under the water.loren suffered serious injuries,but survived lisa was pronounced brain dead at a local hospital and died on june.
following an investigation,the harbormaster concluded that the concentration of passengers in the boat caused a considerable imbalance,which most likely led to the sea star collision with the coral reef.similarly,the mexican government attributed the accident to the catamaran imprudent overload and the negligent performance of the captain.
a civil action ensued.although this suit originally had a wider compass,the only claim that is still velivolant is the claim for lisa wrongful death a claim brought by her parents,oahn nguyen chung individually and in her capacity as administratrix of lisa estate and liem chung as to this claim,studentcity moved to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.see fed.civ.b,a.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,but reserved decision on summary judgment.see chung,chung i,wl,at.it reasoned that 
d iscovery has not yet begun in this matter.much of the factual information plaintiffs desire is in defendant control and can be turned over expeditiously.that information may affect the determination of whether defendant voluntarily undertook a duty to ensure the safety of trip participants,and whether defendant knew or should have known about sma dubious prior safety record,if indeed it exists.
after limited discovery a circumstance to which we shortly shall return the district court granted summary judgment in favor of studentcity.with respect to one of the issues to which discovery had been allowed,the court concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the steps studentcity took in selecting its snorkeling excursion vendor were unreasonable under the circumstances.with respect to the other issue,the court concluded that studentcity voluntarily assumed a duty to generally supervise tour participants during all events,including the june,snorkeling excursion.even so,the court ruled that the negligent supervision claim fails on causation because lisa death resulted not from inadequate supervision by studentcity staff,but rather from the boat accident caused by the overloading of the sea star and its negligent operation by sma.this timely appeal followed.

we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo.see gomez stop shop supermkt,cir.in conducting this appraisal,we take all the facts in the light most flattering to the nonmoving party,resolving any evidentiary conflicts in that party favor,and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom to his behoof.id.we will affirm only if the record discloses no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.an issue is genuine if a reasonable factfinder could resolve it in favor of either party.see id.an issue is material if it holds the potential to change the outcome of the suit.see id.
jurisdiction in this case is predicated on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.see a.in a diversity case,state law supplies the substantive rules of decision.see erie tompkins,geshke crocs,cir.the parties agree that,consistent with the provision in the customer agreement,massachusetts law controls here.we have said that a federal court sitting in diversity is free,if it chooses,to forgo independent analysis and accept the parties agreement as to which state law applies.borden paul revere life ins,cir.accordingly,we look to massachusetts law.
under massachusetts law,wrongful death is a species of negligence,see.laws ch,imposing liability for damages against a person who by his negligence causes the death of a person,and as such demands proof of four elements that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care,that the defendant breached this duty,that damage resulted,and that there was a causal relation between the breach of the duty and the damage,jupin kask.
the existence vel non of a duty presents a question of law to be resolved by the judge.cottam cvs pharmacy.massachusetts courts recognize that a duty may be voluntarily assumed and,if it is,must be performed with due care.id.at quoting mullins pine manor.causation,by contrast,generally presents a question of fact within the special province of the jury.jupin,at.it is thus apparent that duty and causation are separate and distinct elements of negligence and actions.
here,the plaintiffs principal argument is that the district court erred in premising its summary judgment decision on the perceived absence of causation an issue that was neither argued by studentcity nor open to discovery.studentcity demurs it asserts that the issue of causation was squarely raised at summary judgment.the record,though,belies this assertion.we start there.
studentcity posits that its motion papers made clear that neither it nor its agents were 
part of the sea star crew,and had no responsibility for boarding passengers,determining where passengers were to be positioned,navigating the vessel,providing safety equipment on the vessel,controlling or limiting the number of passengers,or otherwise instructing the passengers or the studentcity participants on the sea star rules and regulations.
in context,however,it is pellucid that these arguments were advanced not in connection with any issue of causation,but to support studentcity theory.its summary judgment briefing does not in any way,shape,or form link these arguments to causation.instead,the arguments to use studentcity own term related to its responsibility,and responsibility is synonymous with duty.see responsibility,oxford english dictionary ed,defining responsibility as t he state or fact of being in charge of or of having a duty towards a person or thing.
nor is studentcity assertion made more plausible by either of two additional statements in its summary judgment papers.it notes that,in its motion,it alleged that t our operators such as studentcity are simply not liable for the alleged negligence of service suppliers,regardless of the theory advanced.this broad statement is of no help to studentcity,though,because it ignores the district court holding that,in this instance,studentcity voluntarily assumed a duty to supervise.once assumed,that duty had to be performed with due care.see cottam,at.
studentcity also points to a sentence in the memorandum accompanying its summary judgment motion,to the effect that studentcity owed no such duty the breach of which was the proximate cause of lisa tam chung death.this statement plainly went to duty,not causation,as a basis for summary judgment.consequently,we conclude,without serious question,that studentcity never raised causation as a ground for summary judgment.
because causation was not placed in issue,we deem the district court decision to base its ruling on that ground to be a species of sua sponte summary judgment.berkovitz home box office,cir.while a district court may in rare circumstances enter summary judgment on a ground not raised by any party,see fed.civ.f,that power should be exercised sparingly and with great circumspection,stella town of tewksbury,cir.the spontaneous nature of the district court action,though,does not affect our de novo standard of review.berkovitz,at accord john alden,of john alden ins.agency of,cir.
when considering the boundaries of a district court authority to grant summary judgment sua sponte,we have regularly imposed two constraints first,discovery must be sufficiently advanced to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts and second,the targeted party must have been given notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.berkovitz,at accord block island fishing,rogers,cir.wells real estate inv.trust ii,rey,cir.these conditions afford important protections access to discovery ensures that a litigant has an opportunity to learn the relevant facts,and notice that an issue is in play ensures that a litigant has an opportunity to put his best foot forward.both safeguards are applicable where,as here,the district court grants summary judgment on a ground not previously raised.see block island fishing,at.
in applying these tenets,discovery is deemed to be sufficiently advanced once it has proceeded to the point where the parties underst an d the material facts.sanchez triples,cir.quoting penobscot indian nation key bank of,cir.this means,at a minimum,that there must be a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery on a particular issue.here,the plaintiffs were not given the chance to conduct any discovery at all on the causation issue.the district court order reserving decision on the summary judgment motion,fairly read,contemplated discovery on only two factual issues the existence of a duty to supervise that is whether defendant voluntarily undertook a duty to ensure the safety of trip participants and whether studentcity breached its duty to investigate sma that is,whether defendant knew or should have known about sma dubious prior safety record.chung i,wl,at.
subsequent proceedings and communications drove home the circumscribed scope of the permitted discovery.when the parties expressed uncertainty about the reach of the court order,the plaintiffs sought to confirm by an to the court clerk that the fact discovery deadline only relates to the facts related to the summary judgment issue of whether the defendant had a duty to protect the decedent and the deadline does not relate to all fact discovery on all issues in the event the motion for summary judgment is denied.the clerk responded that discovery was so limited and that if the motion is denied,i will set up another hearing for the parties to come in and talk to the judge.studentcity counsel was copied on both parts of this exchange.
studentcity own objections to the plaintiffs discovery requests support our conclusion that discovery was limited and excluded causation.in framing these objections,studentcity insisted that discovery was limited to whether it represented to lisa chung that it would be providing supervision on the snorkeling excursion,the scope of that duty,whether that duty was breached,and whether studentcity negligently selected sma.causation was not mentioned a fact that undercuts studentcity assertion at oral argument in this court that the plaintiffs could have deposed its employees freely to seek information on the cause of lisa death.that assertion is also undercut by the fact that,during discovery,studentcity objected to providing the name and contact information of all employees of studentcity responsible for supervision and student safety on the date of the subject accident.
later,the district court,acting on a motion to compel,issued an order that confirmed the circumscribed nature of the permitted discovery 
in its previous order the court allowed the parties to conduct discovery limited to certain issues raised by defendant motion for summary judgment.they include representations made to the plaintiffs,both,participants and their parents,concerning the safety of participants investigations defendant undertook of the entities engaged for particular activities and of any brokers or agents who assisted the selection of such entities defendant knowledge of the qualifications of the owners and crew of the vessel in issue and any other information that bears on defendant duty,if any,to ensure participants safety and how they performed that duty.
chung,wl,at.the purport of this order was quite clear and if any doubt lingered about the limited scope of the permitted discovery,that doubt was erased when the parties after the discovery period ended filed their supplemental briefing.most telling was studentcity supplemental brief,which declared 
the only issues are whether studentcity negligently selected the sea star and thus could be held liable to the plaintiffs on a negligent selection theory or whether studentcity voluntarily assumed a duty where one would not otherwise exist to ensure lisa chung safety on board the sea star.
the district court summary judgment order overlooks the restricted nature of the parties opportunity to develop the facts.it incorrectly states that d iscovery is now complete.it makes no mention of the limitation theretofore imposed on discovery.the order,which turned on an issue not argued by the parties and as to which no discovery had been allowed,was beyond the district court authority.when a court charts a procedural route,lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it.berkovitz,at.
to compound the error,the plaintiffs had no notice that causation was an issue ripe for decision at this stage of the case.it is common ground that,as a precondition to the entry of summary judgment,the targeted party must be on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.celotex catrett.in this context,adequate notice has two components the summary judgment target is entitled to know both the grounds that the district court will consider and the point at which her obligation to bring forth evidence supporting the elements of her claim accrues.rogan menino,cir.here,the plaintiffs were not seasonably apprised that the court would
