jose alfaro alfaro received emergency medical care at baton rouge general medical center baton rouge general after he was injured in a car accident.this appeal concerns baton rouge general efforts to get paid for the medical care it provided alfaro.the question presented is whether a hospital that is required by law to provide emergency medical care to an uninsured patient,who later becomes eligible for medicaid,may seek to collect payment for the patient medical bills by enforcing a lien against a settlement the patient recovered from a tortfeasor rather than billing medicaid.the district court ruled that baton rouge general could enforce its lien against alfaro tort settlement.alfaro appeals that decision.we affirm.
background 
on july,alfaro was severely burned in an automobile collision in martin parish,louisiana,with an allied van lines,allied truck.following the accident,he was flown by helicopter to baton rouge general for emergency medical treatment.at the time of his admission to the hospital,alfaro was uninsured and ineligible for louisiana medicaid benefits.baton rouge general was required by the emergency medical treatment and active labor act,to treat him.alfaro remained in the hospital from july until october,the cost for two and a half months hospitalization exceeded million.
in august,alfaro and other accident victims filed a federal lawsuit against allied and the truck owner seeking damages for their injuries.baton rouge general obtained a copy of alfaro accident report about a month later.on october,before alfaro was discharged,the hospital filed a statutory privilege,a lien,for recovery of alfaro medical expenses against any settlement or judgment he recovered from allied and its insurers collectively allied.see.ann.et.two months later,allied attorney indicated to baton rouge general his belief that it could recover the full amount of alfaro medical expenses from allied.he confirmed that allied had more than enough insurance coverage to pay the hospital lien.
while alfaro was hospitalized,baton rouge general referred him to a vendor to assist him in seeking supplemental security income ssi benefits from the society security administration.when the hospital learned that he had been approved for ssi benefits,which made him eligible to receive medicaid benefits in louisiana,the hospital informed alfaro attorney that it would not bill medicaid for alfaro medical expenses.nevertheless,out of an abundance of caution,the hospital sought retroactive medicaid approval from the louisiana department of health and hospitals ldhh,the state medicaid agency,for alfaro stay.ldhh approved,but it warned that an approval is not a guarantee of the recipients eligibility and p ayment on a claim will only be made when the claim is billed correctly and all conditions for payment are met.in the end,baton rouge general neither sought from nor was reimbursed by medicaid for alfaro expenses.
baton rouge general chose instead to pursue its statutory lien against alfaro settlement or judgment by intervening in alfaro lawsuit against allied.in january,alfaro,his,and allied finalized a million settlement,with million earmarked for alfaro.the settlement agreement does not allocate funds between past medical expenses and other damages,but it expressly requires alfaro to reserve and hold in trust funds necessary to satisfy all known liens,interventions and other claims until such claims are validly released and the judicial proceedings asserting such claims are dismissed with prejudice.it also requires him to defend,indemnify,and hold allied harmless from any claims asserted by anyone against allied to recover for services rendered or payments made to or on behalf of plaintiffs in accordance with this agreement,alfaro deposited the full amount claimed by baton rouge general in the registry of the district court.
the hospital moved for partial summary judgment to recover the deposited settlement funds.baton rouge general contended that even though alfaro became eligible for medicaid benefits after he was discharged from the hospital it was not required to bill medicaid and indeed was legally compelled to seek payment from any responsible third party before billing medicaid.in a,alfaro countered that once he became eligible for medicaid,the hospital had to bill medicaid.he also argued that enforcement of the hospital lien would constitute recovery not from allied but from alfaro,a result prohibited by state and federal mandates.by consent of the parties,a magistrate judge considered both motions.in a opinion,the judge denied alfaro motion and granted baton rouge general motion,awarding it plus interest.alfaro filed this appeal 
standard of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.chacko sabre,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
discussion 
congress established medicaid in through title xix to the social security act,et,for the purpose of providing federal financial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.harris mcrae,d.under this system of cooperative federalism,if a state agrees to establish a medicaid plan,the federal government agrees to pay a specified percentage of the total amount the state plan spends on medical assistance.id.at.at.the federal medicaid statute defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of covered care and services a.although participation in the medicaid program is entirely voluntary,once a state elects to participate,it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements.see ex rel.dickson hood,cir.despite these requirements,the medicaid statute gives each state flexibility in designing and administering its own medicaid program.of health and hosps.ctr.for medicare and medicaid,cir.
this case concerns federal and state statutes and regulations governing liability and provider reimbursement under medicaid.alfaro contends that,when he became eligible for medicaid,the hospital was no longer permitted to pursue a recovery action against allied,the the state medicaid agency could do so.further,he asserts that,when he became eligible for medicaid,the hospital had no right as a medicaid provider to assert its statutory lien against alfaro share of the settlement.
can baton rouge general seek third party reimbursement 
for purposes of this section,we assume arguendo that when alfaro became eligible for louisiana medicaid,whether or not the hospital availed itself of medicaid coverage,the medicaid regime applied to the hospital reimbursement rights.
we first consider whether a state agency alone can pursue liability claims.congress,in crafting the medicaid legislation,intended that medicaid be a payer of last resort.of health and human servs.ahlborn,d.this means that all other available resources must be used before medicaid pays for the medical care of an individual enrolled in a medicaid program.caremark,goetz,cir.because medicaid is essentially a payer of last resort,federal law requires states to implement third party liability tpl programs which ensure that federal and state funds are not misspent for covered services to eligible medicaid recipients when third parties exist that are legally liable to pay for those services.wesley health care,debuono,cir quoting medicaid programs state plan requirements and other provisions relating to state third party liability programs.
a third party is any individual,entity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a state medicaid plan.the federal medicaid statute requires that each state medicaid agency take measures to find out when third parties,such as private insurers and medicare,are legally obliged to pay for services covered by medicaid.wesley health care,at citing a.each state medicaid plan must include a plan for pursuing claims against such third parties.id.if third party liability is found to exist after the agency has provided medical assistance,the state agency must seek reimbursement for such assistance.id.citing b.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has issued implementing regulations that outline two methods for handling third party liability cost avoidance and pay and chase.when the probable liability of a third party is established at the time a claim is filed,the state medicaid agency must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of liability.b.the state agency must pay the difference if the third party liability does not at least equal the amount the provider is entitled to under medicaid.id.this method of payment is called cost avoiding it entails shifting to the provider the burden of securing payment from third parties.wesley health care,at.
the other method of handling liability is called pay and chase.under this method,the state medicaid agency pays the total amount allowed under the agency payment schedule and then seeks reimbursement from the liable third party.id.quoting medicaid programs state plan requirements and other provisions relating to state third party liability programs.the pay and chase method is used if the probable existence of third party liability can not be established or third party benefits are not available to pay the patient medical expenses at the time a medicaid claim is filed.see c a b.the federal regulations permit,or even require,the state medicaid agency to use the pay and chase method in certain specific circumstances,for example,where labor,delivery,or postpartum care is involved.see b.a state medicaid agency may also use the pay and chase method when it is cost effective to do so and it receives a waiver from cms.see e.
louisiana law complies with these federal mandates.see.ann.in addition,louisiana law requires providers to bill other insurers and third parties that are liable for a patient medical expenses before they bill medicaid.see.ann.requiring medicaid providers to enter into a provider agreement with the state medicaid agency that requires the provider to b ill other insurers and third parties before billing the state medicaid program,if after reasonable inquiry it is known that the medicaid eligible patient is eligible for payment for health care or related services from another insurer or person.
alfaro argues that louisiana requirement conflicts with federal medicaid law concerning liability.he contends that the federal medicaid scheme entrusts the right and duty of recovering funds from third parties to the state medicaid the health care a determination of eligibility.we find this argument unconvincing and,therefore,hold that louisiana law requiring health care providers to bill before billing medicaid does not conflict with federal law.
alfaro first asserts that the responsibility of seeking reimbursement from a liable third party is entrusted to the state medicaid agency,not the health care provider.to support his assertion,he cites the federal medicaid statute mandate that a state medicaid plan require the state medicaid agency to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the plan a a louisiana law complies with this provision.ann.c federal law does not explicitly entrust a state medicaid agency with the sole responsibility of seeking reimbursement from third parties.instead,it requires the agency to a collect information about third party liability so that the agency can pursue a claim against a third party if it needs to do so and b prepare a plan for pursuing such claims.a a i,ii.nothing in the statute prohibits a state from requiring a health care provider to bill a third party before it bills medicaid.
as further support for his argument,alfaro cites the federal medicaid provision stating that if a third party liability for a patient medical expenses is found to exist after a state agency has paid a provider claim,the agency must seek reimbursement for such medical assistance to the extent of such legal liability.a b see also d.critically,the agency responsibility to pursue the third party does not come into effect until after the medicaid agency has paid a provider claim.congress chose not to mandate that a state agency seek reimbursement from a liable third party before it pays a medicaid claim.louisiana,therefore,is entirely free to delegate to a health care provider,rather than the state medicaid agency,the obligation to seek reimbursement from a liable third party before it bills medicaid.
next,alfaro asserts that requires a health care provider to bill a state medicaid agency and submit to whatever reimbursement limit medicaid prescribes as soon as a patient becomes eligible for medicaid.but does not contain such a requirement.it merely describes the procedures that a state medicaid agency must follow if a provider submits a medicaid claim to it for reimbursement and a third party is liable for the patient medical expenses.moreover,this regulation does not prohibit a state from allocating to the provider the burden of collecting payments before it bills medicaid.as mentioned,states that if a provider submits a medicaid claim and the probable liability of a third party is established at the time the claim is filed,the state medicaid agency must,with limited exceptions,reject the claim and require the provider to chase the third party.see b louisiana law is entirely consistent with this regulation it simply authorizes a provider to collect from a earlier in the payment process 
we conclude that even if alfaro is deemed a medicaid patient simply because of his eligibility for coverage,the hospital was within its rights under louisiana and federal law to pursue the tortfeasor before it sought medicaid reimbursement.
could baton rouge general opt out of medicaid in order to pursue recovery from the tortfeasor 
we turn now to the issue of provider reimbursement.alfaro argues that federal and state statutes and regulations limiting the ability of providers to obtain reimbursement for their services under medicaid prohibit baton rouge general from enforcing its hospital lien.
federal law does not require health care providers to participate in a state medicaid program.see a a state medicaid plan must provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain such assistance from any institution,agency,community pharmacy,or person qualified to perform the service or services required who undertakes to provide him such services emphasis added.see barney holzer clinic,cir the extremely detailed federal medicaid statute does not require a particular hospital to participate in the medicaid program.instead,a health care provider voluntarily contracts with a state to provide services to patients in return for reimbursement from the state at specified rates.spectrum health continuing care group bowling,cir.even those health care providers that do choose to serve patients under medicaid need not accept all such patients.barney,at citing a and b barney adds 
because the remuneration provided under medicaid is often significantly less than that provided by private insurers or medicare,health care providers,either in the interest of higher profits or merely to remain solvent,sometimes limit the number of medicaid patients they will accept.so long as these strategies do not otherwise violate the medicaid statute or other federal antidiscrimination laws they are not in themselves prohibited.

what medicaid does not allow is for a provider who accepts medicaid coverage for a patient to recover more than the program reimbursement rates for care.see.moreover,a state plan must provide that in the case of an individual who is entitled to medical assistance under a state plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment,the person furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the individual or any financially responsible relative or representative of that individual payment of an amount for that service if third party liability equals or exceeds the amount medicaid will pay.a c see als
