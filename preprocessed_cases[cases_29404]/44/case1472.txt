albert difederico,a former naval commander,was serving as a civilian contractor for the state department in pakistan when he was killed in a terrorist attack on the marriott islamabad hotel.his widow,mary difederico,and their three sons,brought this wrongful death action and survivorship claim alleging that marriott international marriott was liable for its failure to adequately secure its franchise hotel.the difedericos brought their suit in the forum of marriott principal place of business,the district of maryland.the district court granted marriott motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens,finding that pakistan was an available,adequate,and far more convenient forum to hear the case.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
at on september,a large dump truck containing over pounds of explosives,artillery shells,mortar bombs,and shrapnel tried unsuccessfully to ram through the gate barrier of the marriott islamabad hotel.security personnel approached the truck,apparently mistaken that a traffic accident had occurred.at p,the driver detonated an explosion inside the cab of the vehicle.the explosive device malfunctioned,however,and only initiated a small fire contained in the cab of the truck.the security team did not warn hotel guests of any danger.instead,personnel began searching for a fire extinguisher.at,the explosives in the back of the truck ignited,creating a large blast that engulfed the hotel in fire.the blast and resulting fire killed people including albert difederico and injured at least more.
the difedericos filed suit in june.the wrongful death action in the amended complaint alleged that marriott failed to notify or evacuate guests upon the first explosion failed to have proper measures in place to put out the fire at the security gate failed to adequately train and supervise security employees failed to provide adequate fire safety devices failed to implement additional security measures concomitant with the threat in pakistan and fell below the standard of care in providing for the safety of its hotel guests.the complaint also set forth a survivorship claim and a claim for vicarious liability based on a negligent security theory.
marriott operates and franchises over hotels and resorts in different countries.the marriott islamabad was a franchise hotel owned and operated by hashwani hotels limited hashwani,a public limited company organized under the laws of pakistan.the difedericos chose not to sue hashwani.instead,the difedericos allege that marriott controlled all aspects of security at the hotel.while hashwani contracted with a security company to handle security work,the hotel complied with security standards and protocols set forth by marriott.for instance,in,marriott hired alan orlob to form an international crisis management team that assessed risk and prescribed security measures and procedures for all marriott branded hotels.under orlob direction,marriott instituted a threat level system,installed security equipment,and sent hotel security officers to advanced training programs developed by marriott.orlob explained in an article he authored that marriott comprehensive approach to security is all directed out of marriott corporate security offices.instead of requiring general managers to make risk assessments and implement appropriate countermeasures without support,marriott provides professional analysis and direction.
on september,marriott moved to dismiss based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens.in granting the motion,the district court first found that although the statute of limitations might bar the difedericos claim in pakistan,it posed no bar to dismissal because the difedericos were responsible for a tactical decision not to litigate within the statute of limitations in pakistan.the court then found that pakistan provided an adequate forum for adjudication,relying in large part on an affidavit from marriott expert witness,an experienced pakistani attorney.finally,the court weighed the applicable public and private interest factors,and found almost all factors weighed heavily in favor of dismissal.
the difedericos timely filed an appeal,of which we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court decision to dismiss a case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens for abuse of discretion.piper aircraft reyno,d.a district court forum non conveniens determination may amount to an abuse of discretion if it failed to consider a material factor or clearly erred in evaluating the factors before it,or did not hold the defendants to their burden of persuasion on all elements of the analysis.galustian peter,cir internal quotations omitted.
when considering a motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,a court must determine that the alternative forum is available to the plaintiff,that the alternative forum is adequate,and that the alternative forum is more convenient in light of the public and private interests involved.jiali tang synutra int l,cir.the defendant bears the burden of proving the adequacy,availability and overall convenience of the alternative forum.galustian,at.
the difedericos argue that the district court erred when it decided the pakistani forum was available even though the statute of limitations had run on their claims in pakistan.if the statute of limitations has expired in the alternative forum,the forum is typically not available for purposes of the forum non conveniens inquiry.compania naviera joanna sa koninklijke boskalis westminster nv,cir citing kontoulas robins,cir finding dismissal improper because defendant did not meet its heavy burden of showing for each individual action that no statute of limitations in the alternative forum renders that forum ineligible.
here,pakistan limitation act of prescribes a statute of limitations for all claims by executors,administrators or representatives brought under the fatal accidents act of.the limitation act,act no.ix of.marriott has stated that it will waive all statute of limitations defenses if the case is tried in pakistan.however,the limitation act appears to establish that the statute of limitations is a mandatory,provision that marriott can not waive as an affirmative defense 
in its brief,marriott argues that a reasonable interpretation of the limitation act is that the limitation period does not begin until marriott submits to the jurisdiction of pakistan.however,marriott does not provide any evidence of the viability of this interpretation.while marriott produced an affidavit from an expert on pakistani law to substantiate its argument that the difedericos have access to a remedy in pakistan and that the pakistani courts will enforce a judgment,the expert provided no opinion on the bearing of the pakistani statute of limitations on this case.marriott proffer of a reasonable interpretation of pakistani law does not satisfy its heavy burden of showing that there is no statute of limitations issue that would bar litigation 
while an expired statute of limitations is usually dispositive in a forum non conveniens analysis,we have recognized an exception where it can be shown the plaintiff made a deliberate and tactical decision to run the statute of limitations for the purpose of avoiding dismissal in her preferred forum.compania naviera,at.after acknowledging the difedericos may not be able to pursue their case in pakistan,the district court determined that the difedericos had made a strategic decision to avoid trying the case in pakistan,and concluded that the compania naviera exception clearly applies in this case.difederico marriott int l,cv,at.
courts can not invoke the compania naviera exception without evidence establishing that the plaintiff deliberately maneuvered to avoid trying the case in the alternative forum.compania naviera,at see also veba chemie getafix,cir explaining that dismissal where the statute of limitations has run would be exceedingly harsh and carving out an exception only where the plaintiff has made a deliberate choice to force the case into an inconvenient forum.this conforms with the supreme court foundational explanation of the forum non conveniens doctrine that a plaintiff should not be allowed to vex,harass,or oppress the defendant by inflicting upon him expense or trouble not necessary to his own right to pursue his remedy.gulf oil gilbert.for instance,in compania naviera,counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged candidly to the district court that it had made a reasoned decision to let the statute of limitations run.at.it was this acknowledgement that allowed the district court to conclude,and the fourth circuit to affirm,that the plaintiff had knowingly and purposefully opted to miss the deadline for filing their claims in china.id.at 
unlike in compania naviera,the district court here failed to point to any evidence substantiating its determination that the difedericos made a deliberate and tactical decision to let the statute of limitations run in pakistan to avoid dismissal.the court made only a conclusory statement in its opinion that the fact remains that the plaintiffs decided not to litigate in pakistan because of their assessment they would not benefit in doing so.when the difedericos noted during the hearing that marriott could not waive its statute of limitations defense and that dismissal in a pakistani court would be automatic,the court did not ask a single question,allowing the difedericos to proceed to the next topic.nor did marriott allege that the difedericos had been purposefully dilatory or otherwise respond to the argument on rebuttal.a review of the briefs,the record,and the transcript of the hearing before the district court reveals nothing about the difedericos motives.
we can not credit the district court conclusion on this issue if neither the court nor the record provides support for that conclusion.we hold that the district court abused its discretion in applying the compania naviera exception to this case and that marriott failed to carry its burden of establishing pakistan as an available forum.
before reviewing the district court analysis of the public and private factors relevant to a forum non conveniens analysis,we must establish the appropriate level of deference owing to the difedericos choice of forum.
a defendant seeking dismissal against a plaintiff must make a showing that the relevant public and private interests strongly favor a specific,adequate,and available alternative forum.tang,at emphasis added.but,supreme court precedent commands that a citizen plaintiff choice of forum is entitled to even greater deference when the plaintiff chooses her home forum.piper aircraft,at.a citizen plaintiff choice is presumptively convenient,and should be overridden only when the defendant establish es such oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to plaintiff convenience,which may be shown to be slight or nonexistent.koster american lumbermens mut.cas.as long as there is a real showing of convenience by a plaintiff who has sued in his home forum it will normally outweigh the inconvenience the defendant may have shown.id.
courts considering a motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens against a citizen plaintiff choosing her home forum must apply this increased deference in their analysis.see,duha agrium,cir reversing district court,in part,because court did not apply the deference required for a forum choice made by a plaintiff sme racks,sistemas mecanicos para electronica,cir explaining that the presumption in favor of the plaintiff initial forum choice is at its strongest when the plaintiffs are citizens,residents,or corporations of this country guidi inter continental hotels,cir reversing because the district court did not recognize that the plaintiff is entitled to greater deference when choosing her home forum reid walen hansen,cir citizens should rarely be denied access to courts of the united states.founding church of scientology of washington,verlag,courts should require positive evidence of unusually extreme circumstances,and should be thoroughly convinced that material injustice is manifest before exercising any such discretion to deny a citizen access to the courts of this country.in spite of the overwhelming authority establishing increased deference,the district court here failed to clearly acknowledge the principle,much less analyze the case accordingly.
marriott tries to place the district court analysis in the best possible light,stating that n othing in the district court opinion indicates that it gave less deference to the difedericos choice of forum.but,this can not be our metric of analysis.we must ascertain whether there is affirmative evidence that the district court did in fact consider this heightened standard when it conducted its analysis.see sme racks,at requiring positive evidence of unusually extreme circumstances to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens where a citizen plaintiff has brought suit in her home forum and reversing the district court dismissal because there was no hint from the opinion that this proper presumption was considered.the district court failure to do so here was an abuse of discretion.
having found the difedericos are entitled to heightened deference in their choice of forum,we may now begin our inquiry into the district court balancing of public and private factors while these factors guide the analysis of a motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens,the ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.koster,at.the difedericos argument for convenience and justice begins with avoiding the fear and emotional trauma associated with pursuing their case in pakistan 
in guidi,the second circuit recognized the inconvenience of the emotional burden that plaintiffs would have to shoulder if they were forced to bring their case in egypt where a terrorist attack on a hotel gave rise to the claims.at.the court explained that the widows and victims of a murderous act are strongly adverse to litigating in a country where foreigners have been the target of hostile attacks,and have concerns for their own safety if required to travel there to bring their suit.id.the guidi plaintiffs provided evidence of ongoing terrorist activity in egypt that substantiated their concern.id.
we find guidi analogous to this case and persuasive in its reasoning the difedericos have provided substantial evidence detailing the risks facing americans who travel anywhere in pakistan.for instance,the department of state issued a travel warning on august,explaining that pakistan is unsafe because the presence of,taliban elements,and indigenous militant sectarian groups pose a potential danger to citizens throughout pakistan.the advisory,which references nine separate terrorist attacks on citizens in the country since,states that terrorist groups continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where citizens and westerners are known to congregate or visit,such as shopping areas,hotels,clubs and restaurants,places of worship,schools,or outdoor recreation events.further,the difedericos point to data from the south asia terrorism portal documenting nearly deaths in pakistan between and.
the fear and emotional trauma involved in travel to pakistan for a trial concerning such a politically charged event would give rise to a bevy of logistical concerns and expenses.the difedericos would either have to stay in the hotels,eat in the restaurants,and shop in the stores that the state department identifies as terrorist targets or incur great expense in avoiding them.if the difedericos followed the state department warnings,they would have to steer clear of facilities catering to americans.as such,it would likely be necessary to hire someone to help them access basic amenities and navigate an unfamiliar cultural setting.further,they may need to hire bodyguards for protection.it is indisputable that the difedericos are inconvenienced by these logistical complexities and expenses,let alone the fear and emotional trauma itself.
marriott and the district court attempt to sidestep these concerns by suggesting there would be no need for the difedericos to actually travel to pakistan.difederico,cv,at.there are two problems with this reasoning.first,a civil litigant generally
