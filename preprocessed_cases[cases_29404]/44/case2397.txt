howard kessler and his wife,jacqueline kessler kessler,appeal the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendant,visteon corporation visteon,on their negligence claims.while making a business visit to a visteon plant,kessler was struck by a forklift driven by a visteon employee.he sought damages for injuries sustained in the accident and his wife presented claims for loss of consortium.the district court,applying michigan law,found on summary judgment that visteon did not owe kessler a duty of care because of the open and obvious nature of the hazard.we reverse.the district court erroneously combined and dismissed two distinct allegations of unreasonable risk of harm when it dismissed the danger as open and obvious.we hold that visteon,through its employee,owed kessler a duty of care to operate its machinery in a reasonably safe manner and kessler has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the operation of a forklift in proximity to pedestrians on the loading dock that day is an open and obvious activity that presents special aspects of danger under michigan law.
visteon is in the business of assembling automotive components.until recently,it was part of the ford corporation.on november,kessler was injured when he approached an operating powered material handling vehicle pmhv,commonly known as a or a forklift.the pmhv,moving in reverse,rolled over and broke kessler foot,and its struck him in the leg,knocking him over.kessler was working for dakota freight lines dakota,a company that provides transportation services to and from visteon utica facility,the site of the accident.
kessler was a regular visitor to the utica plant at the time of the accident.he made a dedicated run to the plant,five days a week.on the day of the accident,kessler was delivering a load of dashboards for the ford taurus.he arrived between shifts,at about pm,and spent some time in the plant lounge waiting for assistance.he walked through the facility to find a visteon employee to unload his trailer,which he parked near the fully occupied loading dock.upon entering the loading dock,he saw michael hyde,a visteon employee,using a pmhv to unload another dakota trailer.the trailer in question was not kessler,so,in an attempt to inform hyde that he should be unloading a different trailer,kessler approached,and was struck by the vehicle.
on february,kessler filed his complaint alleging,inter alia,that visteon had been negligent in its ownership and maintenance of the pmhv,that visteon employee had been negligent in the operation of the pmhv,and that these breaches of duty had resulted in severe,permanent,and irreversible injury to kessler.he prayed for compensatory damages.on march,visteon answered the complaint and asserted several affirmative defenses,including comparative negligence,failure to state a claim,and that the danger was open and obvious.
during discovery,the following evidence was produced the utica plant is approximately two million square feet in size.in this large facility,pedestrians share space with pmhvs.in,over twenty significant harmful events occurred involving pmhvs and pedestrians in visteon plants,four resulting in permanent disability.before the accident that is the subject of this case,visteon began a safety campaign to eliminate the dangers posed by men and machine working so closely together.the program included pedestrian safety training,increased pedestrian visibility through reflective vests on employees,and marking aisles for pedestrian and vehicular traffic,creating green and red zones.truck drivers like kessler who visit the plant now watch a pedestrian safety video.the loading dock where kessler was hit is now a pedestrian red zone,a marked area with signs,where pedestrians are not expected to be.visteon training videotapes,and safety standards promulgated by both the michigan occupational safety and health administration and the american society of mechanical engineers,all state that safe operation is the responsibility of a pmhv operator,that pedestrians have the right of way,and that an operator should always look in the direction of travel.the deposition of hyde revealed that he had viewed the videotapes and that none of the visteon pmhvs that he operated sounded an audible warning when moving in reverse.
on december,visteon moved for summary judgment.it argued that no duty was owed to kessler where the danger presented by the operating pmhv was open and obvious.on december,kessler filed a response to the motion,asserting that the open and obvious nature of the danger was irrelevant where visteon operator owed kessler a duty of care to operate and maintain its pmhv in a reasonably safe manner.kessler noted that visteon,in its brief,had failed to cite a single case where the open and obvious exception was applied to the conduct of a defendant and not to a condition on the land.on june,the district court entered summary judgement for visteon on all claims.kessler visteon.june.
on july,kessler moved for reconsideration under rule e.see.e.he also moved to certify the question to the michigan supreme court,arguing that the validity of visteon defense was a question of first impression.see.b allowing federal judges to certify questions to the michigan supreme court.both motions were denied.kessler visteon.july,denying motion to reconsider kessler visteon,denying motion to certify.on august,kessler timely filed his notice of appeal.see fed.
jurisdiction in the district court was proper due to the diversity of the parties and the amount in controversy.see.kessler is a citizen of the state of ohio and visteon is a corporation organized and chartered under the laws of delaware with its principal place of business in michigan.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

in this case,jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship pursuant to a.accordingly,we apply state law as decided by the michigan supreme court.see erie tompkins.state farm fire and cas.mcgowan,cir.if the michigan supreme court has not yet addressed the issue presented,we must predict how it would rule,by looking to all relevant data,including state appellate decisions.kingsley,moll plasticrafters,cir citing bailey v o press,cir see also owens corning union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.i n all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties,the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same,so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation,as it would be if tried in a state court.guaranty trust of york.see also powell jacor comm,cir.
we first examine whether visteon owed kessler a duty of care from its employee conduct and operation of the pmhv in its loading dock.the first element of an action in negligence is duty.see riddle mclouth steel prods,page keeton,et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,ed hereinafter prosser keeton.duty exists because the relationship between the parties gives rise to a legal obligation.bertrand alan ford,see also maiden rozwood.duty is an obligation to conform to a certain standard of conduct,for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.ibid.in michigan,there is generally a duty to exercise reasonable care in how one acts to avoid physical harm to persons and tangible things.michigan civil jurisprudence,negligence emphasis added.
duty may be established specifically by mandate of statute,or it may arise generally by operation of law under application of the basic rule of the common law,which imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care,or to so govern his actions as not to unreasonably endanger the person or property of others.
riddle,at quoting clark dalman,emphasis added.
congruently,the restatement is broad in its initial definition of negligence.it defines negligence as conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm.restatement second of torts emphasis added.of course,that standard is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances.id.at.a negligent act or omission may be one which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another id.at emphasis added.we note these references to conduct and actions because it is clear that actions are a main source of negligent behavior.the michigan courts acknowledge this 
it is well established that those who undertake particular activities or enter into special relationships assume a distinctive duty to procure knowledge and experience regarding that activity,person,or thing.for example,a landlord must inspect a premises to keep it in a reasonably safe condition.physicians must keep reasonably abreast of current advances in their field.manufacturers must diligently inspect their products to discover lurking dangers.lastly,a carrier owes to its passengers the duty of discovering all detectable defects.
schultz consumers power,emphasis added.we think that the michigan supreme court would not hesitate to add that the operators of pmhvs must take reasonable measures to avoid injury to pedestrians.whether visteon employee breached this duty,we think,should be a question for the jury.
in their complaint,the kesslers clearly alleged a breach of this duty.kessler argues that visteon should be held liable vicariously for the negligence of its employee who failed to use due care and caution in the operation and control of the pmhv.compl.at.visteon argues,and the district court agreed,that regardless of the actions of its employee it can not be held liable because the danger was open and obvious.although visteon has a more limited duty to kessler as an owner of the property on which the injury occurred,it has an independent duty to kessler arising vicariously from its employee operation of the pmhv.this latter duty is unaffected by the open and obvious nature of the hazard because it is unrelated to premises liability.
separate and distinct from any duty that flows from conduct,the michigan courts recognize a duty of care that arises solely from the possession of liability.kubczak chem.bank trust,premises liability requires possession and control over the land.in a premises liability claim,liability emanates merely from the defendant duty as an owner,possessor,or occupier of land.laier kitchen.
s ocial policy imposes on possessors of land a legal duty to protect their invitees on the basis of the special relationship that exists between them.the rationale for imposing liability is that the invitor is in a better position to control the safety aspects of his property when his invitees entrust their own protection to him while entering his property.
bertrand alan ford,citation omitted see also riddle mclouth steel prods.invitees are those who enter a premises on the invitation of the owner to conduct some business there.see prosser keeton.typically they are people such as customers and drivers calling for or delivering goods purchased or sold.ibid.in general,a premises possessor owes a duty to an invitee to exercise reasonable care to protect the invitee from an unreasonable risk of harm caused by a dangerous condition on the land.lugo ameritech.but,because possessors of land are not the absolute insurers of the safety of their invitees,bertrand,at,this duty does not generally encompass removal of open and obvious dangers lugo,at.see also prosser keeton.
therefore,it is clear that ordinary negligence and premises liability describe two distinct theories of negligence liability one flows from actions,the other from possession.both place the burden of limiting injuries upon the person most likely to be effective in doing so.
the district court in this case recognized that at least two theories of liability were alleged in kessler complaint.the court identified the duty that the law imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care,kessler visteon,slip op.at.june,hereinafter kessler citing riddle,at,and a duty that a premises owner owes to a visitor on his property.ibid.from that point,however,the district court conflated the two analyses into one and proceeded to discuss duty exclusively in terms of premises liability 
defendant argues it owed no duty to plaintiff because the forklift presented an open and obvious danger and is devoid of special aspects making it unreasonably dangerous.plaintiff seeks to avoid the open and obvious doctrine by insisting this is not a premises liability case,but a case of ordinary negligence,and that the open and obvious doctrine is inapplicable.the court disagrees with plaintiff theory of liability.plaintiff was injured while on defendant premises from an activity on the premises.the various standards of care owed to visitors like plaintiff apply because defendant is the landowner.the open and obvious doctrine applies not only to conditions on the land,but to activities which occur on the land as well.
kessler at footnotes and citations omitted,emphasis added.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on james alberts,pelzner meijer,wl.june,unpublished,per curiam,and the restatement.we shall address each in turn.
in james,the michigan supreme court held that it no longer recognized the volunteer doctrine at.to guide the lower court on remand,the court noted 
the present case is a premises liability action.james claim is that he was injured by a condition of the land.the alleged injury occurred while he and alberts were digging the trench however,james contends that it arose out of a condition of the land,not out of the activity itself.in his complaint,james alleges that alberts breached his duties as a landowner.
at.the district court,in the case at bar,interpreted this language in a footnote and concluded that 
nowhere does the court rule that the analysis is different when a injury occurs from an activity rather than a condition of the land.to the contrary,the michigan supreme court has adopted of the restatement which expressly states that the open and obvious doctrine applies to activities on a landowner land as well as conditions on the land finally,plaintiff pleading of ordinary negligence does not change the result that the incident occurred on defendant property.
kessler at citations omitted.we disagree.
the purpose of the quoted language in james was to guide the lower court analysis towards premises liability where it otherwise might assume that ordinary negligence was implicated.since the injury resulted from an activity of the defendant,the trial court might have simply assumed that a duty of due care was owed and used those principles to settle the dispute.to avoid this conclusion,and to respect the plaintiff position as the master of his complaint,see ernst rising,cir en banc,the michigan supreme court used the conjunction however to introduce the premises liability element and limit the assumption that the theory was ordinary negligence.the court was not instructing that ordinary negligence claims can not proceed when the defendant negligence occurs on his own land.to the contrary,it was merely highlighting the duty that james alleged was breached.further,the michigan supreme court notes that james allegation is that alberts breached his duties as a landowner not as a.
the district court next relies on of the restatement to conclude that the open and obvious doctrine applies not only to conditions on the land,but to activities which occur on the land as well.that section of the restatement states 
a possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them,unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.
the district court erred here by not reading as being in pari materia with the rest of the restatement.when evaluating the scope of,we note that it is located in a chapter entitled liability for condition and use of land and in a entitled special liability of possessors of land to invitees.in contrast,the definition of negligence in resides in a section entitled general principles.in our reading of the restatement,general principles are not modified by special liability,but are supplemented by them.it is this special liability that needs further explanation because there need not be any action by the landowner to incur liability.the district court reading,however,erroneously promotes the special liability of a premises owner to a general principle.
the district court placed its heaviest reliance on pelzner meijer,an unreported,per curiam opinion of the court of appeals,wl.june.in pelzner,the court held that the defendant was not liable for injuries caused when its employee injured a customer while pushing a train of shopping carts because the hazard was open and obvious.id.at.the court held that neither meijer nor their employee owed any duty to the plaintiff.id.at.the court relied on lugo,bertrand,and riddle,supra,for this holding.the pelzner court was in error and was subsequently corrected by the court of appeals in laier kitchen.laier overruled pelzner.see tebo havlik,decision by panel of the court of appeals is controlling statewide until contradicted by another panel or reversed or overruled by the michigan supreme court.see also white ins.of state of,cir applying decision filed after district court judgment to case pending on appeal.
in laier,the court held that the open and obvious danger doctrine is inapplicable to ordinary negligence claim s.laier,at.laier was killed when the bucket of a loading tractor crushed him during an attempted repair conducted on the property of the defendant.id.at.the ensuing wrongful death action alleged defendant negligence.id.at.the trial court granted summary disposition,holding that the landowner had no duty with regard to open and obvious dangerous activity conducted on his land.ibid.the court of appeals reversed,because the trial court and the parties failed to recognize ordinary negligence as a theory of recovery separate from premises liability.id.at hoekstra,concurring.the rule in laier is that when a claim sounds in ordinary negligence the open and obvious danger doctrine is inapplicable to such a claim.ibid.laier has been recognized by both the michigan and federal courts for this proposition.see henderson hammer restoration,wl summers carter,wl walker eagle press equip,wl.
in addition,the district court found that kessler reliance on dooley northwest airlines,wl,was misplaced.although the factual situation in that case was not directly analogous to the one faced in the case at bar,we believe that the law was accurately described when the dooley court declined the defendant invitation to further expand the open and obvious doctrine to encompass ordinary negligence.id.at.in dooley,the plaintiff asserted ordinary negligence claims against northwest after he was hit by a northwest vehicle operating near an airport terminal.id.at.the dooley court held that a defense of open and obvious was inapplicable where the plaintiff was not injured on northwest property,id.at,and was also correct when it noted that michigan law only appears to apply the open and obvious doctrine in the limited areas listed above,premises and products liability and not in ordinary negligence.id.at.
we note,however,that even if laier had not been decided,we would still hold that pelzner is in error for two reasons.first,the great weight of cases demonstrates that the open and obvious exception is to be applied to premises liability theories only and there exists an almost complete lack of cases relying on the theory of the holding in pelzner.second,the michigan supreme court has stated a vision of social policy that is fundamentally at odds with the holding in pelzner.this policy requires that the open and obvious exception be confined to premises and products liability theories.pelzner,and one other case filed subsequently,but before the judgment in kessler,jacob cont l lanes,wl,finding no duty where employee collided with customer,stand alone as authority for the extension of the open and obvious doctrine to claims of ordinary negligence.neither is a published case,so neither has any binding force in michigan courts.see.c unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding.although the doctrine has been extended in a reported case to an injury caused by a loose dog,see klimek drzewiecki,the open and obvious exception has been applied only in premises liability in the vast majority of cases therefore,even in the absence of laier,we would be hesitant to use the open and obvious exception to defeat a claim based upon a theory of ordinary negligence.a possibility for the unraveling of numerous ordinary negligence suits,dooley,the unnatural reading of the restatement,and the lack of any reported cases applying the doctrine in this new fashion all counsel against visteon proposed expansion of the doctrine.
finally,we note that the policy considerations guiding decisions of the michigan supreme court would be effectively undermined by an extension of the open and obvious doctrine into the area of ordinary negligence.illustrative of this concern,a recent unanimous decision of the michigan supreme court held that the duty of a general contractor on a job site under the common work area doctrine is not limited by the open and obvious doctrine.ghaffari turner const.the ghaffari court considered whether the open and obvious exception should apply to injuries received on a construction site.id.at.under michigan law,a construction site is subject to a special rule,the common work area doctrine 
at common law,property owners and general contractors generally could not be held liable for the negligence of independent subcontractors and their employees.however,in funk motors,this court departed from this traditional framework and set forth an exception to the general rule of nonliability in cases involving construction projects 
we regard it to be part of the business of a general contractor to assure that reasonable steps within its supervisory and coordinating authority are taken to guard against readily observable,avoidable dangers in common work areas which create a high degree of risk to a significant number of workmen.
placing ultimate responsibility on the general contractor for job safety in common work areas will,from a practical,economic standpoint,render it more likely that the various subcontractors being supervised by the general contractor will implement or that the general contractor will himself implement the necessary precautions and provide the necessary safety equipment in those areas.
id.at citing funk.the common work area doctrine is reserved only for construction sites because there exist unique and distinct attributes of the construction setting that would make the rules applicable in the typical premises liability setting inappropriate.id.at.the ghaffari court held 
t he two doctrines at issue,common work area and open and obvious are independent of and distinct from one another.the open and obvious doctrine serves as an integral part of the definition of the duty a premises possessor owes invitees,see lugo,while the common work area doctrine is an exception to the general rule of nonliability for the negligent acts of independent subcontractors and their employees,under which an injured employee of an independent subcontractor may sue the general contractor 
w e hold that the open and obvious doctrine has no applicability to a claim under the common work area doctrine,and therefore the trial court erred in granting summary disposition in favor of defendants on the basis that the pipes at issue were an open and obvious hazard.
id.at citing lugo.
in reaching this conclusion the court discussed the policy behind both doctrines.we think that it appropriately encapsulates the problematic extension of the open and obvious doctrine in the case at bar 
the adoption of the open and obvious doctrine in the general contractor setting would tend to thwart the goals of workplace safety advanced by our decisions if we were to adopt the rule set forth below we would effectively return to a contributory negligence regime.in such a case,no matter how negligent the general contractor was in creating or failing to ameliorate the hazard,the employee would be barred from recovery because the hazard was open and obvious.
we recognized that such bars to recovery provide a strong financial incentive to breach the duty to undertake reasonable safety precautions.indeed,such a rule might lead to a paradoxical more egregious,obvious the safety violation,the less incentive the contractor would have to ameliorate the hazard,because of the knowledge that obviousness of the hazard would bar his liability for the resulting injury.
ghaffari,at.an expansion of the open and obvious doctrine into the realm of ordinary negligence undermines the policy goal of placing responsibility for accidents with those who are in the best position to prevent them.
we now examine what duty visteon owed kessler by virtue of owning the utica plant and the nature of the activities conducted the district court properly dismissed kessler premises liability claim by finding that the open and obvious nature of the hazard obviated any duty visteon might have owed,as a property owner,to kessler.to reiterate,visteon duty of care as a possessor of the land is limited.
the largest single area in which the concept of duty has operated as a limitation upon liability has concerned owners and occupiers of land this development has occurred for the obvious reason that the person in possession of property ordinarily is in the best position to discover and control its dangers,and often is responsible for creating them in the first place.
prosser keeton.for purposes of premises liability,michigan courts recognize three categories trespasser,licensee,and invitee.james alberts.a landowner duty to a visitor depends upon that visitor status.stitt holland abundant life fellowship.the parties and the district court in this case agree that kessler should be categorized as an invitee.an invitee is a person who enters upon the land of another upon an invitation which carries with it an implied representation,assurance,or understanding that reasonable care has been used to prepare the premises,and make it safe for the invitee reception.stitt,at citations omitted.where the visitor is an invitee,
t he landowner has a duty of care,not only to warn the invitee of any known dangers,but the additional obligation to also make the premises safe,which requires the landowner to inspect the premises and,depending upon the circumstances,make any necessary repairs or warn of any discovered hazards.thus,an invitee is entitled to the highest level of protection under premises liability law.
ibid.citations omitted.
however,the duty of a landowner to his invitees has clear limits.a landowner does not owe a duty to invitees where the dangers are so obvious and apparent that an invitee may be expected to discover them himself.riddle mclouth steel prods.under such a condition,our negligence analysis is at an there is no duty,then no matter the standard of care,causation or harm,no negligence can lie.the interaction between the open and obvious exception and the duty owed to invitees has been described in this way 
t he no duty to warn of open and obvious danger rule is a defensive doctrine that attacks the duty element that a plaintiff must establish in a prima facie negligence case.a negligence action may only be maintained if a legal duty exists which requires the defendant to conform to a particular standard of conduct in order to protect others against unreasonable risks of harm.if the plaintiff is a business invitee,the premises owner has a duty to exercise due care to protect the invitee from dangerous conditions.however,where the dangers are known to the invitee or are so obvious that the invitee might reasonably be expected to discover them,an invitor owes no duty to protect or warn the invitee unless he should anticipate the harm despite knowledge of it on behalf of the invitee.
id.at citations omitted see also restatement second of torts.but lugo ameritech,cavanagh,concurring believing the majority opinion to be in error and that and prior michigan cases refer not to duty,but to the applicable standard of care.accordingly,the open and obvious doctrine should not be viewed as some type of exception to the duty generally owed invitees,but rather as an integral part of the definition of that duty.lugo,at.if the court finds that,as a matter of law,there is no duty owed,that negligence claim must be dismissed.
the michigan supreme court considered the application of the open and obvious exception in two incidents involving accidents befalling customers on the steps of the businesses they patronized.both actions were combined in one case,bertrand alan ford.in bertrand the court seized upon those dangers that could be considered unreasonable and held that the open and obvious exception should not operate to eliminate a duty in those circumstances 
with the axiom being that the duty is to protect invitees from unreasonable risks of harm,the underlying principle is that even though inviters have a duty to exercise reasonable care in protecting their invitees,they are not absolute insurers of the safety of their invitees.consequently,because the danger of tripping and falling on a step is generally open and obvious,the failure to warn theory can not establish liability.however,there may be special aspects of these particular steps that make the risk of harm unreasonable,and,accordingly,a failure to remedy the dangerous condition may be found to have breached the duty to keep the premises reasonably safe.
ibid.emphasis added.applying this rule,the court found the exception applied to negate any duty where the injured plaintiff tripped on a restroom step because she failed to see it.id.at.because t he plaintiff failed to establish anything unusual about the step the plaintiff has not presented any facts that the step posed an unreasonable risk of harm.ibid.
in the second case,the plaintiff fell while waiting to have her car serviced.to reach the cashier,she needed to navigate a narrow passage between a door and a set of vending machines.while doing this,she fell.id.at.the court held that the premises may be unreasonably dangerous.id.at.when considering the condition of the land,the court found a genuine issue regarding whether the construction of the step,when considered with the placement of the vending machines and the cashier window,along with the hinging of the door,created an unreasonable risk of harm,despite the obviousness or the invitee knowledge of the danger of falling off the step.ibid.
in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,one can reasonably argue that the defendant should have reasonably anticipated a congested pedestrian traffic pattern causing an invitee to fall off the step.
we can not find as a matter of law that the risk of harm was reasonable.because a genuine issue existed regarding whether the defendant breached its duty to protect the plaintiff against an unreasonable risk of harm,in spite of the obviousness or of the plaintiff knowledge of the danger,summary disposition was inappropriate.whether this risk of harm was unreasonable and whether the defendant breached a duty to exercise reasonable care by failing to remedy the danger are issues for the jury to consider.
id.at emphasis in original.under this standard,we must apply the rules of summary judgment to our evaluation of the unreasonableness of the danger presented to decide if it is proper to eliminate the duty of the defendant and deny any recovery to the plaintiff.see howe detroit f
