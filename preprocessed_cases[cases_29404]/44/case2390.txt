lateasha pendergrass,through her guardian udine ellis,brought various state and federal claims against the cleveland municipal school district the school district after she had a physical altercation with janice gibbs,her substitute teacher.pendergrass claims that gibbs slammed her into a chalkboard,threw her on the ground,and choked her.after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district on several of pendergrass claims,the case went to trial on pendergrass claim of failure to train or supervise under.at the close of pendergrass,however,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the school district.pendergrass now appeals,arguing the school district was not entitled to immunity on pendergrass claims because ohio political subdivision tort liability act violates the ohio constitution the district court should have granted her motion to admit reports of abuse by other teachers as a sanction and the school district was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on her claim of failure to train or supervise.we affirm.
gibbs worked as a substitute teacher for the school district between and.gibbs had a substitute license from the ohio department of education,qualifying her to teach grades seven through twelve.although gibbs was given assignments to teach in an elementary school,the school district did not require certification in specific grade levels.a criminal background check demonstrated that gibbs did not have a prior criminal record,and before gibbs had never had a physical altercation with a student.
training and supervision of substitute teachers 
the school district required gibbs,as a applicant,to undergo training before she could be eligible for hiring.all applicants had to attend an orientation for large groups,the orientation lasted half a day otherwise,the orientation was conducted for a shorter duration on an individual basis.during the orientation,the school district informed substitute teachers that its policy prohibited corporal punishment.the school district also instructed the teachers on how to handle student misbehavior and discipline,including altercations between teachers and students,though there is nothing in the record which describes this training.gibbs attended a group orientation before she was hired.
the school district did not require any training beyond the initial orientation for substitute teachers.it did,however,offer voluntary,ongoing professional development training.gibbs attended several of these training sessions,but none of the sessions involved handling altercations with students.
the school district published a substitute teachers manual manual and a substitute teachers handbook.the manual explained that substitute teachers were expected to maintain primary control of the classroom and that,i f a disciplinary situation should occur,the substitute teacher should use professional judgment in seeking the assistance of a principal or assistant principal.regarding corporal punishment,the manual provided in relevant part that 
the district eliminated corporal punishment as a method of resolving discipline problems,effective september.corporal punishment is defined as the act of inflicting or causing to be inflicted bodily pain upon a student as a penalty for the commission or omission of an act.any form of corporal punishment is prohibited.
the manual further stated that a ll substitute teachers are required to study this handbook and be familiar with these policies.although gibbs remembered receiving a packet of information,she does not specifically recall receiving the manual,going over the manual during orientation,or the content of the manual.
once gibbs began teaching at steven howe elementary school,the responsibility for her supervision fell on the principal,angela powers.the school district did not have any particular policy on how the supervision was to be conducted.powers testified that she supervised her substitute teachers by observing them,going to classrooms,and assisting them,if they need to know where different places are in our school.powers did not evaluate the teachers or provide coaching on how to teach or control the class.
b.the altercation 
from may to may,gibbs worked as a substitute at steven howe elementary in pendergrass class.at the time,pendergrass was eight years old.on may,a physical altercation occurred between gibbs and pendergrass.because the circumstances of the altercation are disputed,we provide a summary of both gibbs and pendergrass versions.
gibbs version 
gibbs had been trying to get pendergrass to complete her morning assignment,but pendergrass refused.because it was pendergrass third warning for inappropriate behavior,gibbs told her to write her name on the disruptive student list.instead of writing her name on the list,pendergrass knocked the list off of the table and refused to pick it up.gibbs told pendergrass to leave the classroom and go to the office.pendergrass replied,no,make me.
gibbs walked over,and pendergrass started hitting her.after trying to block pendergrass blows and asking pendergrass to stop,gibbs pushed pendergrass and held her head against the chalkboard.when pendergrass stopped swinging,gibbs let her go.pendergrass again began hitting gibbs.gibbs then tried to grab pendergrass hands,lost her balance,and fell on top of pendergrass.when gibbs regained her balance,she sat on pendergrass,and restrained her by holding her head back from under her chin.although gibbs admits that she physically restrained pendergrass by holding her chin,she denies ever choking pendergrass.
pendergrass version 
pendergrass testimony regarding the altercation significantly differed from that of gibbs 
when i went to class the next day,my substitute told us to take out a pencil and to write in our journal about the weekend or what she had on the black board.and i told her i did have a pencil.so she got up and told me to write my name on the board,and i did,and she got mad at me,and she slammed me up against the wall,and the back of my head hit the board,and she then slung me on the ground and jumped on me and started choking me.
according to pendergrass,gibbs slammed her head against the blackboard hard enough to give her a headache.gibbs then threw her on the ground and choked her for about one minute.
pendergrass injuries 
after pendergrass spoke with school officials and police officers,her grandmother took her to the hospital.a physician concluded that pendergrass had sustained petechia and contusions on her neck.petechia are red marks that result from the application of pressure to a particular area of the skin.police officers took photographs of the marks at the hospital.
pendergrass later suffered from less visible injuries.she began having bad headaches and nightmares about the altercation.she avoided reminders of the altercation,trying not to walk past her old classroom.if she saw a person resembling gibbs,she would become fearful and move away from that person.based upon these symptoms,a therapist diagnosed pendergrass with stress disorder.
pendergrass brought suit against the school district originally in an ohio state court.in her complaint,pendergrass asserted five state and federal claims negligence for failure to properly screen,hire,train,or supervise gibbs under ohio law gross negligence under section b of the ohio revised code failure to screen,train,or supervise under interference with the right of access to redress in state court under and a claim for a declaratory judgment that ohio political subdivision tort liability act liability act,ohio,violates article i,sections and,of the ohio constitution.the school district removed the case to the federal district court below.
the school district filed a motion for summary judgment.in august,the district court granted the motion as to the claims,the claim of interference with the right of access to state courts,and the claim for declaratory judgment,but the court denied the motion as to the claim of failure to train or supervise in particular,the district court first ruled that pendergrass had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish her claims of negligent and grossly negligent screening,hiring,or supervision.pendergrass had raised a material issue of fact regarding her claim of negligent training,but the court ruled that the liability act immunized the school district from liability.the district court then ruled that pendergrass was not entitled to a declaratory judgment that the liability act was unconstitutional because,despite the dicta of a plurality of the supreme court of ohio in butler jordan,ohio,ohio,ohio intermediate courts had unanimously found the act constitutional.regarding the claims,the district court ruled that pendergrass had raised a material issue of fact as to her claim of failure to train or supervise,but failed as to her claim of access to state courts.
both pendergrass and the school district filed motions in limine to exclude certain evidence before trial.the school district requested,among other things,that the district court exclude collateral incident reports detailing other students allegations of assault by substitute teachers,because such reports were inadmissible as subsequent remedial measures.the district court denied the school district motion.pendergrass requested,among other things,that the court admit the collateral incident reports as a sanction for the school district alleged failure to provide a knowledgeable representative for deposition pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court ruled that,because it had denied the school district motion to exclude the statements,pendergrass motion to admit the statements was moot.
the case went to trial in january on pendergrass claim of failure to train or supervise.despite its earlier ruling that pendergrass motion to admit the collateral incident reports was moot,the district court excluded approximately half of the reports.reports relating to incidents that occurred after the altercation between gibbs and pendergrass were excluded because they were irrelevant to the issue of whether the school district had been deliberately indifferent to abuse.the district court did not exclude the ten incident reports relating to alleged abuse by teachers prior to the altercation,although the reports were never admitted into evidence.instead the record reflects that,following a hearsay challenge,at,the court,pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,informed the jury only of the existence and dates of the reports,at.
at the close of pendergrass,the school district moved under federal rule of civil procedure a for judgment as a matter of law.the district court ruled that pendergrass had failed to demonstrate an underlying constitutional injury because,even under pendergrass version of the altercation,no reasonable person could conclude that gibbs demonstrated brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.in addition,the district court ruled that pendergrass had not demonstrated that the school district had a policy or custom of inaction towards abuse by substitute teachers.according to the court,the ten reports of alleged prior assaults by teachers in a period were wholly insufficient to establish a clear and persistent pattern of abuse by substitute teachers.because there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that the school district had a policy or custom of failing to train or supervise substitute teachers properly,the district court granted the school district motion for judgment as a matter of law.
pendergrass now appeals,arguing that the liability act violates the ohio constitution,thus making the district court grant of summary judgment as to her state claim erroneous the district court erred by not admitting the incident reports if for no other reason,as a sanction for the school district conduct and a reasonable jury could have found the school district liable under for failure to train or supervise.
constitutionality of ohio political subdivision tort liability act 
the district court properly held that the liability act,ohio,does not violate article i,sections and,of the ohio constitution because the supreme court of ohio has never held the statute unconstitutional and because ohio intermediate courts are unanimous in upholding the statute.when deciding an issue of state law,we apply the law of the state highest court.see erie tompkins.where a state highest court has spoken to an issue,we are bound by that decision unless we are convinced that the high court would overrule it if confronted with facts similar to those before us.kirk hanes of,cir.
no majority decision of the supreme court of ohio has ever held the liability act unconstitutional.on the contrary,the law of the supreme court remains that the statute is constitutional.in fabrey mcdonald village police department,the supreme court held that the liability act does not violate the equal protection due process or article i,section,right to remedy provisions of the ohio constitution ohio,ohio.
the supreme court dicta in butler jordan,ohio,ohio,did not work a change because it was pronounced by a plurality of the court.in butler,the supreme court held that an ohio statute did not expressly impose liability for negligence or recklessness in the inspection and certification of certain facilities,and the defendant was therefore immune under the liability act.id.at.nevertheless,a plurality of three of the seven justices went on to question the constitutionality of the liability act.id.at.in the plurality opinion,there was a serious question whether the liability act violated the right to trial by jury guaranteed by article i,section,of the ohio constitution because citizens of ohio had the right to demand a jury trial in negligence actions at the time the ohio constitution was adopted.id.at.the plurality also appeared to suggest that the act violated the right to remedy under section.see id.at.the plurality nonetheless voted to apply the law whose constitutionality it questioned.see id.at chapter remains the law and must be interpreted and applied as written.
the plurality dicta does not represent the view of the majority of the supreme court of ohio and was not even applied by the plurality in that case,and thus it can not be said that it represents ohio law.see franklin county convention facilities auth.am.premier underwriters,cir.because the state highest court has not decided the applicable law,then this court must ascertain the state law from all relevant data,including the state intermediate court decisions.garden city osteopathic hosp.hbe,cir quoting bailey o press,cir.
every decision of the court of appeals of ohio that has entertained challenges to the liability act has found the statute constitutional.see,nagel horner,ohio app d,ohio thompson bagley,wl,at ohio,bundy five rivers metroparks,ohio app d,ohio.if the only precedent is from the state intermediate appellate courts,the intermediate court decision should be followed absent a strong showing that the state supreme court would act in a different manner.derungs stores,cir.because a majority of the supreme court has never held that the liability act is unconstitutional,there has been no showing that the supreme court would act differently from the courts of appeals.therefore,we read ohio law in its current state to provide that the liability act is constitutional 
exclusion of the collateral incident reports 
although the district court erred when it denied as moot pendergrass motion to sanction the school district by admitting all of the collateral incident reports,the error was harmless because the reports that the district court ultimately excluded were irrelevant and thus inadmissible under federal rules of evidence and.pendergrass limits her sanction argument to the district court refusal to impose the particular sanction of admitting all of the incident reports.both parties argue that this court should review the district court decision not to admit the reports as a sanction under an abuse of discretion standard.the district court,however,never reached the issue whether sanctions were necessary instead,the district court ruled that pendergrass motion was moot because the court had de
