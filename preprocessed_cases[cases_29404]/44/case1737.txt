in,alfred longhi,longhi,a former employee of lithium power technologies,lithium power,filed a qui tam suit under the false claims act fca,against lithium power and its president,mohammed zafar munshi jointly,the defendants.in,the united states of america intervened in the suit.longhi and the united states of america jointly,the government alleged that the defendants engaged in an elaborate pattern of false statements to secure research grants from the federal government.ultimately,the district court granted the government motions for summary judgment on liability and damages.the court awarded nearly million in damages and penalties,and the parties voluntarily dismissed the remaining claims in the lawsuit.the defendants moved for reconsideration,and the district court denied that motion and entered a final judgment.longhi then filed a motion for statutory attorneys fees,which the district court granted in full.the defendants now appeal the district court finding of liability,award of damages,and award of attorneys fees to longhi.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in,congress established the small business innovation research sbir program.the goal of the sbir program is to provide research assistance to small businesses in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.see a.congress directed each federal agency with a research and development budget exceeding million to establish a sbir program and to provide some fraction of its budget to small businesses.f.each federal agency with a sbir program was charged with selecting awardees for its sbir funding.g.
the department of defense dod administers a sbir program in which twelve military components participate.the dod identifies specific research projects that it is interested in funding and allows small businesses to seek sbir grants for these projects.dod program solicitations explicitly state that knowingly and willfully making any false,fictitious,or fraudulent statements or representations may be a felony under the federal criminal false statements act.after receiving proposals,the dod selects those that they perceive offer the best value to the government and nation.the merits of a sbir proposal are in part measured by an examination of the applicant qualifications.the dod specifically considers the key personnel available to perform the research,facilities and equipment available to the applicant,and scope of any previously funded work performed by the applicant that may be similar to that proposed.when the dod selects a proposal for funding,the agency enters into a contract with the recipient that governs the terms under which the funds are disbursed.the dod generally does not verify all of the information submitted in a proposal,and it depends heavily on the integrity of sbir applicants.
under the dod sbir program,there are two types of sbir grants.a phase i research grant is intended for the recipient to determine the scientific,technical,and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the sbir program.these grants typically range from to and cover at most a period.if the dod determines that the phase i grant recipient demonstrates that future research may potentially yield a product or process of continuing importance to the dod and the private sector,it can award a phase ii grant.phase ii grants are only available to applicants who previously received a phase i award and are aimed at research or a research and development effort.a phase ii grant is expected to produce a,deliverable prototype and typically ranges from to over a period.during phase iii of a research and development project,the applicant is expected to obtain funding from the private sector or government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product.
in,munshi founded a small business,lithium power.lithium power designs and manufactures specialized batteries for commercial and government applications.munshi is lithium power majority shareholder,president,chief executive officer,and chairman of the board.
the defendants submitted four to the ballistic missile defense office bmdo and two to the air receive phase i and ii sbir grants for research that could lead to the development of very thin rechargeable batteries.in connection with the four sbir grants,the defendants submitted more than fifty invoices to the bmdo and the air force for payment and received more than million.
lithium power four sbir proposals contained the false claims at issue in this case.in,the in this action,longhi,joined lithium power as vice president for sales and marketing.during and,longhi began to suspect that the defendants were defrauding the federal government.he began documenting what he believed was the defendants pattern of fraudulent conduct and investigating a means to stop the fraud.in august,longhi began working with counsel to prepare his fca case,and he met with the government on september.one month later,munshi told longhi that due to tough economic times longhi would be placed on a work week beginning november,and receive a percent decrease in compensation.longhi informed munshi that he could not afford the extreme decrease in pay and needed to sell his lithium power stock to raise capital.on november,munshi told longhi that he would be laid off within two weeks and offered to buy longhi stock for between and.on november,munshi explained that the stock sale would be the subject of a more detailed agreement.
on november,longhi filed a qui tam action against the defendants to recover statutory damages and civil penalties under the fca.on november,munshi provided longhi with a copy of the stock sale agreement.on november,munshi laid off longhi.the agreement for the sale of stock contained a provision stating that longhi personally agreed to release the defendants from pending claims or lawsuits and agreed not to sue the defendants for the loss of longhi job.the original covenant also disallowed longhi to sue for any other reason,but longhi objected to this language and it was changed to for any other matter prior to execution of the agreement to sell the stock.the agreement was executed by the parties on november,eleven days after longhi filed suit against the defendants.munshi wife paid longhi for the stock.
longhi qui tam action accused lithium power of double billing and of billing for work that was never completed in connection with different contracts.the united states investigated and intervened in in connection with longhi allegations pertaining to fraudulent billing on the four sbir grant proposals.the defendants denied longhi allegations,and the government failed to uncover evidence that supported longhi allegations.
on november,the government filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to liability and argued that the undisputed record evidence demonstrated that the defendants had,at a minimum,shown a reckless disregard for the truth regarding many of the representations in their four sbir grant proposals.on december,the defendants filed a for partial summary judgment.the district court granted the government motion for partial summary judgment on march.the district court stated that fraudulently inducing the government to provide funding for a project could give rise to fca liability,even if the statements on particular invoices submitted in connection with the project were true.the district court explained that the government needed only to demonstrate that the defendants either were willfully blind to the falsity of the statements or acted with an extreme form of negligence in making those statements.
in determining the merits,the district court examined five separate categories of statements in the defendants sbir proposals.first,the district court explained that the defendants bmdo phase ii proposal falsely stated that lithium power was incorporated in.second,the district court concluded that the defendants misrepresented the key personnel who would be conducting the research work in three of the four proposals.the district court noted,however,that the misrepresentations as to key personnel resulted from mere negligence,and the court discounted this evidence.third,the district court determined that lithium power knowingly falsified statements regarding its facilities and equipment.fourth,the district court concluded that the defendants acted with reckless disregard to the falsity of statements by representing that lithium power had cooperative arrangements with the university of houston and polyhedron laboratories.fifth,the district court noted that the defendants failed to disclose in its air force sbir grant proposals that lithium power had previously undertaken related work in connection with a bmdo sbir grant.
the district court then assessed whether these false statements,omissions,and misrepresentations were material.the district court explained that under the fca materiality requires that the false statement in question have a natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing a decisionmaker.the district court concluded that the government offered ample summary judgment evidence that the misrepresentations were actually material.
the government then moved for summary judgment on damages.the district court held that the government suffered damages in the amount of the grants it paid out to the defendants in connection with their deceptive proposals.the court tripled that amount,as required by the fca,and awarded in damages.the district court rejected the defendants contention that the damages should be reduced to reflect the benefit the united states received from the battery research that lithium power performed.
the parties stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of the government remaining claims and the defendants counterclaims without prejudice.longhi claims regarding the other seventeen contracts,that the government did not intervene in,were among those dismissed.the district court entered final judgment for the government based on that stipulation.the defendants appeal the district court finding of liability and damages award 
on february,longhi filed a motion for statutory attorneys fees and final judgment.on february,the defendants objected to longhi motion on a variety of grounds.specifically,the defendants stated that longhi motion for attorneys fees failed to segregate the hours worked by his attorney on contracts and claims for which longhi was not the prevailing party,the seventeen claims that were dismissed.the district court did not require longhi to segregate the time his attorneys worked,and awarded longhi the full amount of fees and costs that he requested.the defendants now also appeal the district court award of attorneys fees 
ii.liability damages award 
in appealing the district court judgment finding the defendants liable and awarding damages to the government,the defendants make four arguments.first,they allege that the district court erred in granting the government motion for partial summary judgment on the merits and finding that the defendants violated the fca.second,the defendants argue that the district court erred in granting the government motion for summary judgment with respect to damages and finding that the united states was entitled to recover the full amount of the grant awards paid out to the defendants and to receive treble damages.third,the defendants allege that the district court erred in determining that their claims for release and indemnification from longhi were against public policy and the text of the fca.finally,the defendants contend that the district court erred by denying their summary judgment motions with respect to liability,damages,and the enforceability of the release and indemnification agreement.we discuss each of the defendants arguments in turn.

violation of the false claims act 
the district court granted the government motion for partial summary judgment on the merits and found that the defendants violated the fca.the defendants argue that the district court erred because with regards to the bmdo phase i grant,the misstatement of lithium power date of incorporation does not give rise to liability under the fca because it was an error that resulted from inadvertence or mere negligence and was not material with regards to the bmdo phase i grant,statements regarding lithium power facilities did not give rise to liability under the fca,because the facilities were under construction when the defendants made the statements and were completed by the time the government funded the proposal with regards to all four grant applications,the defendants statements concerning cooperative arrangements,as opposed to cooperative research arrangements,with the university of houston and with polyhedron were true and did not give rise to liability under the fca,because they had a cooperative arrangement to use laboratories and scientific equipment,different than a cooperative research agreement to conduct certain research for a defined time period,and the statement was not material with regards to the bmdo phase i and ii grants and the air force phase ii grant,that statements regarding specific personnel indicated an expectation and wish to hire those individuals,but did not put forth that the individuals would necessarily accept an offer of employment and with regards to the air force phase i and ii grants,the defendants assert that they properly disclosed the bmdo contracts to the air force when submitting their proposals,because they informed individual air force personnel of the bmdo sbir grants.thus,the defendants request that we reverse and remand the district court grant of the government motion for summary judgment.
the government contends that the district court properly granted summary judgment in its favor after correctly concluding that the defendants false statements affected the sbir grant selection process.the government argues that the defendants violated the fca by submitting four sbir proposals replete with false statements that gave the dod the mistaken impression that lithium power was far more qualified than it actually was to engage in the proposed research.the government argues that taken individually,any one of the falsehoods would suffice to demonstrate a violation of the fca.at a minimum,the government argues that the defendants acted with a reckless disregard for the truth and presented false claims to the dod,allowing lithium power to secure more than million in research grants.the government notes that the defendants maintain that several of its misrepresentations were made inadvertently.in response,the government argues that while subjective inadvertence is relevant to whether the defendants had actual knowledge of the falsity of their statements,it is not relevant to the objective inquiry into whether the defendants acted with reckless disregard of a statement truth or falsity.the government also argues that the defendants repeated false statements were material to the selection process.the government explains that because an applicant qualifications are a critical feature of the sbir evaluation process,the defendants falsehoods had a natural tendency to influence and were capable of influencing the extremely competitive process for selecting small businesses to receive sbir grants.the government maintains that each false statement contributed to the impression that lithium power was better suited to carry out the proposed research than it actually was.
legal standard for finding a violation of the false claims act 
an individual violates the fca when he 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government or 
conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.
a.we note that while the underlying fraud that invokes the fca differs under a,the statute attaches liability,not to the underlying fraudulent activity or to the government wrongful payment,but to the claim for payment.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir quoting united states rivera,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the fca defines the terms knowing and knowingly,which mean 
that a person,with respect to information 
has actual knowledge of the information 
acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or 
acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.
b.in addition to the requirements found in the text,our jurisprudence holds that a false or fraudulent claim or statement violates the fca only if it is material.see united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir stating that the fca interdicts material misrepresentations made to qualify for government privileges or services citation and quotation marks omitted see also allison engine,united states ex rel.sanders,d explaining that a plaintiff asserting a a claim must prove that the defendant intended that the false record or statement be material to the government decision to pay or approve the false claim.
we have consistently recognized the requirements discussed above,but we have not yet delineated a succinct test recognizing each element.the fourth circuit has concisely stated these various requirements in one test,which we adopt today whether there was a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct made or carried out with the requisite scienter that was material and that caused the government to pay out money or to forfeit moneys due,that involved a claim.united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir quoting harrison,at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states ex rel.hendow of phoenix,cir united states ex.rel.mikes straus,cir utilizing a test where a violation of the fca is shown when an individual makes a claim,to the united states government,that is false or fraudulent,knowing its falsity,and seeking payment from the federal treasury.
false or fraudulent statement 
in the instant appeal,the government alleges that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct by submitting false statements in the sbir grant proposals.the government does not allege that the defendants submitted false claims for payment for each sbir grant proposal.in certain cases,fca liability may be imposed when the contract under which payment is made was procured by fraud.united states ex rel.willard humana health plan of texas,cir citing harrison,at.this type of fca claim is characterized as fraudulent inducement.under a fraudulent inducement theory,although the defendants subsequent claims for payment made under the contract were not literally false,because they derived from the original fraudulent misrepresentation,they,too,became actionable false claims.united states ex rel.laird lockheed martin eng g science servs,cir citing united states ex rel.marcus hess.
requisite scienter 
the government contends that the defendants fraudulent conduct was made or carried out with the requisite scienter.the scienter requirement comes from b definition of the terms knowing and knowingly.we have explained that t hough the fca is plain that proof of specific intent to defraud is not necessary,the mens rea requirement is not met by mere negligence or even gross negligence.united states ex rel.farmer city of houston,cir internal citation omitted.thus,the government must demonstrate the defendants had actual knowledge of falsity,acted with deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information provided,or acted with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information provided when the defendants fraudulently induced the bmdo and air force to award them the sbir grants.see id.at.
materiality 
the government next argues that the false statements in the sbir grant proposals were material.no majority decision of this circuit has addressed the proper standard for assessing the materiality of a false statement under the fca provisions.laird,at.the parties and this court all recognize that a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.neder united states,d quotation omitted insertion in original see also united states southland mgmt.southland ii,cir en banc jones,concurring united states southland mgmt.southland i,cir,vacated by grant of reh g en banc,cir quoting united states wells,d.
in southland i,however,we noted two different interpretations of the natural tendency to influence or capable of influencing standard.southland i,at.some courts have defined the standard to require outcome materiality a falsehood or misrepresentations must affect the government ultimate decision whether to remit funds to the claimant in order to be material.id.citing united states ex rel.berge bd.of trs.of the of,cir united states intervest,d.in contrast,another court required what is termed claim materiality a falsehood or misrepresentation must be material to the defendant claim of right in order to be considered material for the purposes of the fca.id.citing united states ex rel.wilkins am.constr,d.in southland ii,five judges of this court suggested that outcome materiality is the correct standard,explaining that a statement is material only if it actually affects the government decision to pay.see laird,at citing southland ii,at 
the government,however,contends that these definitions are incorrect.it argues that the fca requires proof only that the defendant false statements could have influenced the government payment decision or had the potential to influence the government decision,not that the false statements actually did so.we agree.the outcome and claim materiality definitions unnecessarily narrow the natural tendency to influence or capable of influencing test,which is unambiguous and easily applied 
the lack of ambiguity in this test is clear when we examine the common meaning of the words used.the oxford english dictionary oed defines tendency as a constant disposition to move or act in some direction or toward some point,end,or purpose leaning,inclination,bias,or bent toward some object,effect,or result.oxford english dictionary online,www.oed.com last visited june,defining tendency.the dictionary defines tendency as a proneness to a particular kind of thought or action.dictionary online,www.merriam webster.com last visited june,defining tendency.the oed has two definitions of capable that apply in this context able or fit to receive and be affected by open to,susceptible and able to be affected by of a nature,or in a condition,to allow or admit of admitting susceptible.oxford english dictionary online,www.oed.com last visited june,defining capable.defines capable as susceptible.dictionary online,www.merriam webster.com last visited june,defining capable.finally,oed defines influence as ascendancy,sway,control,or authority,not formally or overtly expressed and as a thing or person that exercises action or power of a or unexpressed kind.oxford english dictionary online,www.oed.com last visited june,defining influence.defines influence as the act or power of producing an effect without apparent exertion of force or direct exercise of command,corrupt interference with authority for personal gain,and the power or capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways.dictionary online,www.merriam webster.com last visited june,defining influence.
thus,the natural tendency to influence or capable of influencing test requires only that the false or fraudulent statements either make the government prone to a particular impression,thereby producing some sort of effect,or have the ability to effect the government actions,even if this is a result of indirect or intangible actions on the part of the defendants.all that is required under the test for materiality,therefore,is that the false or fraudulent statements have the potential to influence the government decisions.
our conclusion is buttressed by cases from our sister circuits.the ninth circuit recently recognized a circuit split to measure materiality under the fca.united states bourseau,cir.the court noted that the fourth and sixth circuits have adopted a natural tendency test for materiality,which focuses on the potential effect of the false statement when it is made rather than on the false statement actual effect after it is discovered.id.quoting united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir see also united states ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.the court then explained that the eighth circuit has adopted the more restrictive outcome materiality test.bourseau,at citing costner urs consultants,cir.the ninth circuit adopted the fourth and sixth circuits natural tendency test for materiality because it is more consistent with the plain meaning of the fca.id.citation omitted.
moreover,congress recently codified the definition of materiality when it enacted the fraud enforcement and recovery act of fera,stat.to be codified at.congress enacted of fera to clarify the fca and to reflect the original intent of the law.id.congress enactment will add the following language to b the term material means having a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the payment or receipt of money or property.if congress intended materiality to be defined under the more narrow outcome materiality standard,it had ample opportunity to adopt the outcome materiality standard in fera.instead,congress embraced the test as stated by the supreme court and several courts of appeals.while we decline to rule on whether this statute applies retroactively or prospectively,we find this enactment to be relevant as to congress intent when it enacted the fca.see ncnb texas bank cowden,cir a legislative body may amend statutory language to make what was intended all along even more unmistakably clear.quoting united states montgomery county,cir.
payment of money 
finally,the government argues that the defendants knowing,material,false statements caused the government to pay out money.neither party disputes that the government awarded approximately million to lithium power as a result of the four sbir grant proposals.thus,we are left with determining whether the government has successfully demonstrated factors one,two,and three of the above test.
the government has met its burden with regards to factors one and defendants knowingly provided false or fraudulent statements in the sbir grant proposals.most egregiously,the defendants lied in all four sbir grant proposals regarding a cooperative arrangement with the university of houston and polyhedron laboratories.the defendants argued below that because members of the public could use labs at the university of houston and polyhedron laboratories for a fee,lithium power,as a member of the public,had an arrangement with both institutions.this argument is patently absurd.the defendants either purposefully,or with reckless disregard to the truth or the falsity of their statements,misled the bmdo and the air force into believing that lithium power had a formal partnership with these two organizations.the ability of any member of the public to essentially rent the facility is not synonymous with a cooperative arrangement of the type the defendants hoped the government would infer by their statements.these misrepresentations alone would be sufficient to establish that the defendants had no intention to perform according to the terms of the sbir,but these are not the only false statements contained in the sbir grant proposals.
the defendants bmdo phase i grant contained an incorrect incorporation date for lithium power.this was not a mere typographical error,as lithium power was not incorporated until five months after it submitted its phase i grant proposal to bmdo.in addition,the defendants lied about the existence of lithium power facilities,which were under construction at the time the sbir phase i grant proposal was submitted.these false statements,especially when considered in conjunction with the misrepresentation regarding a cooperative arrangement with the university of houston and polyhedron laboratories,left the bmdo with the impression that lithium power was a much more established and experienced company than it actually was.thus,the defendants had no intention to perform according to the terms as outlined in the bmdo sbir grant proposals,because they did not portray lithium power accurately in the proposals.because the receipt of a phase ii grant was predicated on the phase i grant,any false or fraudulent statements made in the bmdo phase i grant equally taints the bmdo phase ii grant.
we also find troubling lithium power failure to disclose receipt of the bmdo grants when applying for an additional sbir grant from the air force.the sbir application required applicants to describe significant activities directly related to the proposed effort and previous work not directly related to the proposed effort but similar.lithium power states that it told individual members of the air force that it also received the bmdo grants,but that does not negate the fact that it failed to account for the bmdo grants in its sbir grant proposals to the air force.this omission,again when coupled with the misrepresentations regarding lithium power cooperative agreements,establish that the defendants had no intention to perform according to the terms of the sbir.
the government has also successfully demonstrated factor power false statements were material.as we explained above,the test for determining whether a false statement is material is whether it has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the government.we are convinced that lithium power false statements had the potential to influence the bmdo and air force decisions to award lithium power the sbir grants.lithium power painted a picture of an established company,that was so in the community that it had developed a strong relationship with two notable research organizations.in reality,lithium power was a company that was in its preliminary stages of development that had yet to demonstrate any proven success.
moreover,in the instant case we also have evidence that the false statements actually influenced the decision to award the defendants the sbir grants one of the bmdo phase i evaluators recommended approving the proposal because lithium power had adequate facilities to conduct the actuality lithium power had no such facilities.in addition,another bmdo phase i evaluator stated that his recommendation to fund lithium power proposal was greatly influenced by the false statements.finally,the evaluator who approved the air force proposals stated that he would not have approved funding the air force proposals if the defendants had included information regarding the bmdo sbir grants in lithium power air force sbir grant proposal.
based on the foregoing analysis,we conclude that the defendants violated the fca.the irony of this situation is not lost on the court.lithium power blatantly deceived the bmdo and the air force and received funds that it was not entitled to.but it appears that the company then went on to successfully design and manufacture batteries that the bmdo and the air force found to be satisfactory.the defendants ability to deliver on the hoped for ends,however,does not justify the means it employed to receive the sbir grants.we affirm the judgment of liability.
the district court held that the government suffered damages in the amount of the grants it paid out to the defendants in connection with their deceptive proposals awarded treble damages in the amount of.the defendants argue that the government is not entitled to damages because it did not suffer an injury.the defendants argue that the district court erred in granting the damages award and state that no court has ever applied a fraudulent theory in the absence of some tangible injury to the gove
