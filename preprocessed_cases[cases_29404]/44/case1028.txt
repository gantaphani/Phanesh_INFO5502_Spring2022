george lombard and his corporation,lomar,collectively lombard or he appeal from judge jones grant of summary judgment dismissing claims for the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and for negligence.
briefly stated,lombard is a former senior executive of lockheed aeronautical systems company lockheed,who hoped to build and operate an aerostructures manufacturing plant in puerto rico.the venture was to be titled newco,and lomar was to serve as the corporate owner.lombard sought assistance from several puerto rican officials,including the administrator of the economic development administration of puerto rico eda and the president of the puerto rico industrial development company pridco.these officials appear to have expressed interest in the project and recommended that lombard approach the government development bank of puerto rico gdb to obtain debt financing.however,gdb was skeptical and retained a consulting firm,hamilton,bah,to do a feasibility study of the proposed loan.concluding that the newco project was risky,bah proposed various changes in the financial structure of the venture that lombard was either unwilling or unable to make.gdb thereafter turned down lombard loan application.lombard was unable to obtain financing elsewhere,and the newco venture never got off the ground.
lombard then brought the present action,seeking over million in damages.the issues on this appeal involve claims against bah and its employee frank jones for intentionally interfering with lombard business relationship with eda,pridco,and gdb,and,alternatively,for negligently preparing the feasibility study.we hold that lombard did not meet his burden of proffering evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on his intentional interference claim.we also hold that,under new york law,a loan applicant may not recover for negligence by a consulting firm retained by a potential lender to review the merits of a loan application.we therefore affirm.
background 
we of course view the record in the light most favorable to lombard,who is appealing from an adverse grant of summary judgment.see delaware hudson ry.consol.rail,cir we assess the record in the light most favorable to the and we draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.
in,lombard,then a vice president of lockheed,conducted a feasibility study regarding the establishment of a lockheed aerostructures manufacturing plant at a facility in puerto rico.the study recommended such a venture,but lockheed decided not to proceed,apparently for reasons unrelated to profitability.however,authorities at eda were hoping to attract such a business to puerto rico and entered into discussions with lombard regarding his undertaking the project.to that end,lombard quit his job at lockheed after obtaining the rights to the lockheed feasibility study.lombard appears to have expected to secure a contract with eda,but eda refused to offer more than transitional funds and a consulting contract,which a disappointed lombard accepted.pridco also may have agreed to lease an available facility should newco get under way.
needless to say,the management and financial plan for newco had to be altered once lockheed declined to participate.absent lockheed management,lombard would serve as the venture founder and chief executive,although his years of aircraft manufacturing experience did not include the running of a company.also,financing would not be provided by lockheed.lombard financing plan,which is at the heart of the present dispute,required million in capital.of that total,million was to be raised through an unsecured,fully bank loan.the remaining million was to be raised through sales of common shares to a number of outside investors,but only after the million loan had been secured the outside investors would hold of the shares.a controlling bloc of of the common shares would be held by lombard and other senior executives of the newco project,who would make no financial investment of their own.lombard business plan anticipated five years of operation,after which the venture would be sold at a price of to return to the to lombard conservative estimate.
the plan appears not to have attracted private lenders with regard to the million loan,and the venture supporters at eda and pridco suggested that lombard take it to gdb,an agency of the puerto rican government that provides loans to projects helpful to the commonwealth economic development.gdb initial reaction was negative.it had previously made loans to other aerospace manufacturers to use the same pridco facility proposed for newco,but they had defaulted,causing gdb to lose million.furthermore,gdb did not share lombard optimism about the general state of the pertinent market or newco ability to capture a large percentage of that market.finally,gdb president noted that the proposed financing structure,with little equity or collateral,ensured that gdb would bear most of the downside risk without any of the potential upside benefits.
nevertheless,gdb did not reject the loan application outright but suggested that a acceptable to the gdb evaluate the proposal,the cost of the study to be paid by lombard.when lombard declined to fund such a study,gdb retained bah,with which the puerto rican government had dealt in the past.gdb paid half the costs of the study another half was paid by eda from the incentives fund set up for the venture.lombard does not argue that bah has breached a contractual duty owed to him.instead,as detailed infra,he argues that he has a relationship with bah,permitting him to sue bah for negligence.
lombard claims that gdb retaining of bah was a collusive arrangement,designed solely to echo gdb existing skepticism towards the loan application.lombard does not claim that gdb had any legal obligation to make the requested loan or even to provide a reason to decline to do so.however,he insists that a pretext was necessary for puerto rican political reasons.he has not,however,produced any evidence to support this allegation,apart from his own speculation,and there is no evidence that the relationship between gdb and bah was anything but.lombard also claims that a prior but favorable feasibility study was surreptitiously concealed or destroyed by high officials at gdb.again,apart from his speculation,there is no evidence of any such study,and a senior executive of gdb testified that no such study ever existed.even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to lombard,therefore,we can not credit his claims of a collusive arrangement between gdb and bah or of the existence of a prior favorable study.
the bah report was supervised by appellee jones.it depicted newco as a risky project but did not recommend an outright rejection of the newco loan.rather,it recommended modifications of newco financial plan including i spreading the loan,and risk,among a syndication of lenders and ii requiring a substantial equity investment by management,or,absent such a management investment,staging gdb loan as series of smaller loans,thereby allowing the lender s to monitor newco progress and to cut losses if progress did not in fact occur.lombard was either unwilling or unable to accept these modifications.
again,but for lombard speculation,there is no evidence that bah deliberately falsified any parts of its report or that it acted in an illegal or fraudulent manner.however,lombard claims that the preparation of the report was flawed because bah did not contact executives at the mcdonnell douglas corporation and the boeing company,whose names were provided by lombard,concerning newco likelihood of getting outsourcing contracts.he also faults the content of the report principally i for failing to mention a tour of a northrop facility by bah staff during which northrop executives allegedly made statements favorable to the newco project ii for criticizing lombard estimates of puerto rican labor costs and iii for declining generally to adopt lombard highly optimistic view of newco prospects.he is also critical of jones ability to make such a study.
the gdb board unanimously rejected lombard loan application.in doing so,it considered various factors other than the report.nevertheless,we believe that,on the present record,a trier could find that the report was a substantial factor motivating gdb decision.bah was commissioned for the very purpose of affording guidance to the gdb board the board decision was consistent with bah recommendations and even the eda administrator,an early newco cheerleader,voted against the loan in his capacity as a member of the gdb board after the bah report was received.
after gdb rejected lombard application,one of eda executives sent bah report to the only other potentially interested lender,general electric corporation,which did not extend a loan.the record does not amplify the role that the bah report may have played in whatever consideration,if any,general electric gave to the newco venture.
unable to raise financing,lombard then proceeded to bring the present action.lombard complaint sought damages on a variety of claims against most of the significant dramatis personae described above.it alleged claims against i eda and pridco for breach of contract,quantum meruit,and promissory estoppel ii eda administrator,who was a member of gdb board,for breach of implied warranty iii gdb its president for fraud and misrepresentation,tortious interference with contract,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and iv bah jones for breach of contract,quantum meruit,breach of beneficiary contract,fraud and misrepresentation,tortious interference with contract,intentional interference with contract,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and negligence.the complaint sought damages in excess of million.
all claims against all parties have been dismissed or settled.lombard has appealed solely from the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing his claims against bah and jones for tortious interference with prospective business relations and for garden variety negligence.appellant opening brief at.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see ogden travelers indem,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c see also anderson liberty lobby,d montana first fed.sav.loan,cir.
a the intentional interference claim 
under new york law recovery of damages for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage must be based on a factual showing that i the plaintiff had business relations with a third party ii the defendants interfered with those business relations iii the defendants acted for a wrongful purpose or used dishonest,unfair,or improper means and iv the defendants acts injured the relationship.see burba rochester gas and,see also nadel toys novelties,cir purgess sharrock,cir.although lombard case is thin with regard to the substantiality of his business relations with eda,pridco,and encouragement but little else from eda and pridco,outright skepticism from record is simply bereft of any evidence that bah either acted solely to injure lombard or used improper means to do so.
the evidence of a wrongful purpose offered by lombard consists largely of bah failure to i follow up on some sources of information allegedly favorable to the newco project ii draw allegedly correct inferences from a tour of a northrop plant and conversations that occurred during it and iii reach a conclusion that the project was not a risky investment.this showing at best demonstrates that bah gave a hard look at newco based perhaps on a slightly less than thorough investigation.it is,however,far short of the requisite showing of a wrongful purpose.
with regard to whether bah resorted to methods sufficiently wrongful to be deemed tortious under new york law,a similar conclusion is required.wrongful means include physical violence,fraud,misrepresentation,civil suits,criminal prosecutions and some degree of economic pressure.more than simple persuasion is required.see nbt bancorp fin.group.more than simple persuasion was not shown here.
b the garden variety negligence claim 
under new york law,the elements of a negligence claim are i a duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant ii breach of that duty and iii injury substantially caused by that breach.see merino new york city transit,see also nathan drage,first concord,misc d.lombard argues that bah owed him a duty to exercise reasonable care in preparing its report for gdb,did not exercise that level of care,and caused gdb to reject lombard loan application,leaving newco stillborn.
lombard theory faces serious difficulties with regard both to a lack of reasonable care and causation.even if bah had a duty to exercise such care toward we conclude infra that it did a very broad concept of reasonable care could be found to have been breached by a consultant cautionary advice regarding the loan as actually proposed by lombard.to be sure,lombard view of the newco project prospects was very conservative estimate of a to return on the equity investment within five years.that view of newco prospects is reflected in the very gravamen of his negligence claim,namely that it was unreasonable for bah to conclude that newco was in any way risky.however,a potential lender would likely have,as gdb did from the start,a more cautious view.
lombard reliance on gdb itself indicates that private lenders did not share lombard rosy view.gdb presumably does not exist to compete with private lenders who deem a particular project to be.rather,it exists to provide capital for projects that do not attract sufficient private capital.even if bah failed to get information from persons identified by lombard as sharing his optimism and otherwise failed to conduct an entirely thorough investigation,there is little in this record to show that a more thorough investigation would have altered the ultimate recommendations of the bah report.lombard plan called for a fully and unsecured loan that would amount to as much as of the capital raised.the lender would thus bear most of the risk but not share in the foreseen bonanza of profits.in this light,bah suggestion that the loan be spread among several lenders seems prudent rather than unreasonable,particularly given gdb past experience with similar ventures.moreover,the apparent impossibility of spreading the risk with other lenders rather undermines lombard position that it was unreasonable to view newco as entailing a substantial risk of default.
similarly,a fully lender might reasonably be concerned about a plan that entrusted control of the venture to a management that would draw salaries from the capital provided but had zero investment of personal wealth.even if early signs of failure were apparent,the lender would have no power to prevent the loss of its entire loan or to change management,which would have an incentive to entire capital.such a lender would therefore want either a substantial financial investment by management or a staging of the loans.
under new york law,however,decisions as to a lack of reasonable care and its nexus to a plaintiff injury are quintessential jury questions,largely as a result of developments in the personal injury area.thus,foreseeability and causation are issues generally and more suitably entrusted to fact finder adjudication,while the definition of the existence and scope of an alleged tortfeasor duty is usually a legal,declaration reserved for judges.palka servicemaster mgmt.servs.we therefore forgo the option of holding that the bah report was either not prepared negligently or would have remained essentially unchanged even if more thoroughly researched.instead,we turn to whether bah owed lombard a duty of care in preparing that report.nevertheless,the discussion above of the risks to a lender in lombard plan is relevant to that question.
the liability to third parties for a defendant negligent performance of a contract with a second party is a much litigated question in new york courts.however,decisions of the new york court of appeals clearly reject the position taken by appellant.we begin with a discussion of why the cases relied upon by lombard yield a principle contrary to that which he argues.we then turn to new york decisions that d
