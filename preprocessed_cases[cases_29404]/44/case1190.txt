opinion of the court 
for over years,the insurance commissioner for the state of vermont the commissioner has served as receiver of ambassador insurance company ambassador or the company and sought to recover damages for claims paid on insurance policies following the company downward spiral and ultimate collapse in,the commissioner brought a professional malpractice claim against coopers lybrand coopers,on behalf of the company,alleging that coopers failed to disclose the insolvency of ambassador following their and audit and negligently issued unqualified and favorable audit opinions with knowledge that the financial statements were untrue and materially understated the company loss reserves.at trial in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,the commissioner presented a traditional malpractice claim and proved to the jury that but for coopers negligence,ambassador would not have continued to write insurance policies,which resulted in its ultimate failure.at the close of a trial,the jury awarded the state of vermont million in damages.the judgment reached million after the district court added prejudgment interest.pricewaterhousecoopers pwc,the successor in interest to coopers,appeals the jury verdict.we will affirm the jury verdict in its entirety.
factual background 
ambassador was an insurance company incorporated in vermont,with its principal place of business in north bergen,new jersey.arnold chait chait founded ambassador in and served as the company president and chief executive officer.ambassador was a surplus lines insurance company,which insured businesses and individuals who were unable to get insurance from other companies at standard rates.in,chait formed a holding company to raise capital for ambassador named ambassador group.chait and his wife,doris chait,owned approximately of the ambassador group stock the remainder was publicly held.
by virtue of its vermont domicile,ambassador was regulated by the vermont department of banking and insurance the insurance department.according to vermont statute,ambassador was required to file an annual financial statement with the insurance department annual vermont statement each year by march.the applicable statute required the annual vermont statement to be verified by oath of two of its executive officers,but did not require that the statement be audited.see.stat.ann.tit.the statute also authorized periodic examinations by the insurance department examiners.id.
ambassador was also required to file an annual financial statement with the securities and exchange commission annual sec statement.unlike the annual vermont statement,the annual sec statement had to be audited.to audit the ambassador group annual sec statements that were filed between and,ambassador retained coopers.coopers did not audit the annual vermont statements that ambassador filed with the insurance department however these statements incorporated coopers loss reserves calculations from the audited annual sec statements.
from january to may,two vermont state examiners conducted an examination of ambassador annual vermont statements for the period ending december,and detected no significant problems.in particular,the vermont state examiners concluded that ambassador loss reserves reported in were adequate.the first downturn in ambassador financial strength was reflected in its annual sec statement,which showed an underwriting loss.thereafter,in february,ambassador group stock price dropped by almost half.ambassador group annual sec statement recorded an overall loss and showed a drop in its surplus.in april,ambassador also failed seven of the national association of insurance commissioners early warning tests that the insurance department used to monitor insurers financial condition.
following this downturn,in march,the insurance department retained kramer capital consultants kramer,an independent financial consulting firm for insurance companies and regulators,to conduct a special examination of ambassador,including its loss reserves.kramer,relying on coopers audited annual sec statements,concluded that there were no material deficiencies in ambassador reported loss reserves and that it was solvent.nonetheless,it reported that ambassador financial condition has materially deteriorated,and the c ompany may be deemed to be operating in a hazardous financial condition.app.in light of this report,the insurance department presented chait with a plan requiring ambassador to halt its growth by reducing premium volumes by.chait accepted the plan but he failed to abide by it and continued to increase ambassador premium volumes.in september,the insurance department ordered ambassador to cease payment of dividends and ordered kramer to resume its examination.
within two months,kramer issued a report concluding that ambassador was million insolvent immediately,the insurance department filed a complaint against ambassador in vermont state court,seeking to enjoin ambassador from conducting further business and to have the commissioner appointed as receiver.based on its conclusion that it is unsafe and inexpedient for ambassador to continue business,the state court appointed the commissioner as ambassador receiver.app.in,the commissioner concluded that ambassador could not be successfully rehabilitated and,accordingly,obtained an order of liquidation.
in may,the commissioner filed this action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the complaint alleged,among other things,negligent mismanagement and misfeasance,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and negligent misrepresentation against arnold and doris chait and richard tafro,ambassador former vice president of finance.relevant here,the complaint also asserted a cause of action for negligent auditing practices against coopers.
in his claim against coopers,the commissioner alleged that coopers was negligent in its audit of ambassador and financial statements specifically,the commissioner claimed that as a result of its audit of ambassador group and its subsidiaries,coopers either knew or should have known in early that ambassador was only marginally solvent and should not have continued writing new insurance policies.he further alleged that if coopers had issued the adverse audit opinion that it should have the regulators could have acted to protect ambassador and its policyholders,claimants and creditors.
in november,following chait death,the estate of arnold chait the estate was substituted as a defendant in the commissioner action.coopers,a national accounting firm,subsequently merged with pricewaterhouse to form pricewaterhousecoopers pwc in in the years that followed,pwc filed numerous motions,seeking,among other things,summary judgment and separate trials for the commissioner claims against pwc and the estate.all the motions were denied.approximately six weeks before trial,the district court,sua sponte,entered default against chait estate,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,for failure to comply with a court order to seek replacement counsel or notify the court of its intentions with regard to the litigation.the case against the estate and pwc then proceeded to trial 
at the close of the evidence,the district court sua sponte entered a default judgment against the estate,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,removing the estate liability as an issue for the jury,requiring the jury to only consider chait percentage of fault,and instructed the jury accordingly.after deliberating for less than two days,the jury reached a verdict against pwc and the estate and awarded total damages of million to the commissioner.the jury apportioned of the fault to chait and the remaining to pwc.following the jury verdict,the district court added million in prejudgment interest to the jury damages award,raising the total liability to million.because pwc was deemed jointly and severally liable under new jersey law,pwc was liable for the entire million judgment.pwc now appeals the district court final judgment 
on appeal,pwc argues that the district court erred in not entering judgment for pwc as a matter of law for lack of compensable injury to ambassador on the basis that deepening insolvency can not be used as a measure of damages for a negligence claim in not granting judgment to pwc as a matter of law for lack of proximate causation in not entering judgment as a matter of law on pwc in pari delicto defense in denying pwc motion for a separate trial because the estate was in default and no jury issues remained as to chait liability by entering an excessive damages award in awarding million in prejudgment interest and in applying new jersey law on joint and severable liability rather than vermont law.we address each in turn.
ii.deepening insolvency and damages to ambassador 
on appeal,pwc contends that the commissioner case was based on a theory of damages for deepening insolvency and that such a theory can not be used as a measure of damages for an independent cause of action such as malpractice.pwc also maintains that it was error for the district court not to enter summary judgment in favor of pwc because the commissioner failed to prove that pwc alleged negligence resulted in any cognizable harm to ambassador.according to pwc,only ambassador policyholders and creditors suffered harm,not the company.
while we do not ignore the undisputed fact that there was reference made throughout this case to deepening insolvency as a measure of damages for pwc negligence,we conclude that the damages presented to the jury were based on traditional new jersey tort damages under new jersey law,the measure of damages for a negligence action are the damages proximately caused by defendant conduct.see schroeder perkel,gleitman cosgrove.as to damages,the district court instructed the jury at the close of trial that 
the vermont commissioner seeks damages for the net loss ambassador incurred from its continued operation after march.the vermont commissioner contends that pwc is liable for such damages because ambassador would have been prevented from writing new business if pwc had conducted an audit of ambassador financial statements in a manner.accordingly,the commissioner theory of damages is that,because of pwc alleged negligent audit,ambassador was permitted to continue to write new business until november.during that time,the commissioner contends that the insurance that ambassador wrote produced claims that cost the company more than the premiums,plus interest and other investment income on those premiums,it collected for that insurance.the commissioner claims that this amount equals million and that this constitutes the company damages your job as jurors will be to consider the evidence that the commissioner has presented relating to ambassador insolvency and its consequences.
the question of whether pwc caused ambassador deepening insolvency was never put before the jury.rather,on the question of damages,the verdict sheet asked the jurors has the commissioner proven by a preponderance of the evidence that pwc breach was a proximate cause of any damages that the ambassador may have incurred app.emphasis added.the jury responded yes.id.the jury was then asked to determine the total damages incurred by ambassador that the commissioner proved by a preponderance of the evidence.
despite pwc contention,the jury was not simply presented with a comparison of ambassador balance sheets at the point of wrongdoing and at the point of insolvency to show the harm done to the corporation and to measure the damages.instead,the commissioner proved actual damages itemized,specific,and avoidable losses that ambassador incurred by continuing its operations beyond the date of pwc negligent audits.the damages that were presented to the jury were ambassador million net loss from continuing operations after march,the date that pwc completed its audit of ambassador.the damages were comprised of million in total costs incurred from continuing operations past march,less million in net premiums earned on the insurance policies that ambassador wrote after this date,plus million for the net interest expense app.the total cost incurred from continuing operations,million,included the net cost of claims incurred,operating and receivership expenses,and dividends paid to the parent company.app.the net cost of claims incurred included future unpaid claims.
undoubtedly,these losses,which arose from the continued writing of insurance policies,had an impact on ambassador solvency and increased ambassador liabilities.this increase in ambassador liabilities was caused by pwc negligence and thus was properly considered as damages proximately caused by pwc negligence.
relying on in re citx citx,pwc asks us to hold that whenever a plaintiff makes reference to deepening insolvency or an injury to the debtor corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of its corporate life,as part of its explanation of damages in a negligence action,recovery is not permissible.appellant br.at citing,cir.however,citx does not support this proposition.when a plaintiff brings an action for professional negligence and proves that the defendant negligent conduct was the proximate cause of a corporation increased liabilities,decreased fair market value,or lost profits,the plaintiff may recover damages in accordance with state law.
in official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,lafferty,we held that the pennsylvania supreme court would recognize deepening insolvency as an independent cause of action where it causes damage to corporate property,cir.we defined deepening insolvency as an injury to the debtors corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of corporate life.id.at.we further explained that prolonging an insolvent corporation life through bad debt may simply cause the dissipation of corporate assets and that such harm can be averted,and the value within an insolvent corporation salvaged,if the corporation is dissolved in a timely manner,rather than kept afloat with spurious debt.id.at.lafferty was decided under pennsylvania law,unlike the instant case which is controlled by new jersey law.
subsequently in citx,the trustee of a bankrupt internet company,citx corporation,citx,sued the company accounting firm for malpractice and deepening insolvency.at.the accounting firm compiled citx financial statements from july through december.using these financial statements at shareholder meetings,citx raised over in equity,allowing it to continue its operations and accrue millions of dollars in debt.id.at.the trustee alleged that the accounting firm had dramatically deepened the insolvency of citx,and wrongfully expanded the debt of citx and waste of its illegally raised capital,by permitting citx to incur additional debt by virtue of the compilation statements prepared and relied upon by third parties.id.at internal quotations omitted.
we determined that there was no harm to the plaintiff corporation because the immediate result of the defendant audit was to increase citx capital and reduce its debt through an extra in investments.id.to the extent that the extra capital,which decreased citx insolvency,extended the corporation life and allowed management to incur more debt,the ultimate harm was caused by mismanagement,not the auditor.id.at.in this case,on the other hand,the jury found that the negligent audit proximately caused an increase in liabilities through the writing of more insurance policies.the audit in the present case had an immediate negative consequence,as contrasted with the immediate positive consequence following the audit in citx.in other words,the damages here are losses incurred on insurance policies that would not have been written but for coopers negligence.
in affirming the district court grant of summary judgment on behalf of the accounting firm in citx,we stated that lafferty had never held that deepening insolvency was a valid theory of damages for an independent cause of action.id.at emphasis in original.we explained that the statements in lafferty were in the context of a cause of action,and held that t hey should not be interpreted to create a novel theory of damages for an independent cause of action like malpractice.id.the citx court also stated that t he deepening of a firm insolvency is not an independent form of corporate damage.id.at citation omitted.however,we further explained that 
where an independent cause of action gives a firm a remedy for the increase in its liabilities,the decrease in fair asset value,or its lost profits,then the firm may recover,without reference to the incidental impact upon the solvency calculation.
at quoting sabin willett,the shallows of deepening insolvency,bus.law.
what is important to note at this juncture is that whether deepening insolvency constitutes a valid theory of damages for a harm is a matter that is uniquely subject to state law principles.it is well settled jurisprudence that as a federal court sitting in diversity we are required to apply the law of the state.erie tompkins.see also commonwealth of pennsylvania brown,cir stating that in diversity cases,where the applicable rule of decision is the state law,it is the duty of the federal court to ascertain and apply that law,even though it has not been expounded by the highest court of the state.as in lafferty,citx examined deepening insolvency as a theory of damages under pennsylvania law,which is not binding in this case.
in this case,we are persuaded by new jersey law that the commissioner tort damages theory was appropriate for pwc negligent conduct.pwc asserts that there is no reason to believe that new jersey would authorize deepening insolvency damages beyond what is authorized by lafferty and citx.appellant br.although neither the new jersey legislature nor the new jersey supreme court has authorized a deepening insolvency cause of action,contrary to pwc assertion,there has been a trend among the state courts toward recognizing deepening insolvency damages.in ncp litig.trust kpmg,llp,ncp i,the new jersey supreme court addressed the question of damages resulting from the inflation of a company revenues and continuation beyond insolvency.in ncp i,kpmg was retained as the accountant for the physician computer network,inc pcn.id.at.in the two officers of pcn conducted fraudulent transactions to artificially inflate pcn revenues.id.at.the auditors failed to detect the misrepresentations initially.id.after kpmg uncovered the misrepresentations years later,the company was forced to acknowledge previously unreported losses of tens of millions of dollars.the disclosures resulted in a cash flow deficit and pcn defaulting on its bank debt.in,pcn filed for bankruptcy.id.at.under the bankruptcy plan,pcn assigned all its potential causes of action to the ncp litigation trust the trust.id.in,the trust initiated suit against kpmg alleging causes of action for i negligence ii negligent misrepresentation,iii breach of contract,and iv breach of fiduciary duty.the trial court granted kpmg motion to dismiss the complaint.it reasoned that because the wrongdoing of pcn corporate officers had to be imputed to the company and because under in pari delicto,the trust stood in the shoes of the company,pcn,pcn and the trust unclean hands barred the action id.at.the appellate division affirmed the dismissal of the trust breach of fiduciary duty claims and reversed on all the remaining causes of action,concluding that the in pari delicto defense is not available to one who contributes to the misconduct sought to be imputed.id.at.
on appeal,the new jersey supreme court affirmed the appellate division,holding that because kpmg alleged negligence contributed to the misconduct of officers at pcn,kpmg was barred from raising the in pari delicto defense.id.at.in doing so,the supreme court explained that inflating a corporation revenues and enabling a corporation to continue in business past the point of insolvency can not be considered a benefit to the corporation.id.at.the new jersey supreme court remanded the case for discovery,noting that the only issue before it was the applicability of the imputation doctrine.id.at.
on remand,the trial court addressed the question of whether new jersey jurisprudence recognized deepening insolvency as a theory of harm to the corporation and held that it was a legally cognizable harm.ncp litigation trust kpmg,ncp ii.in ncp ii,the court rejected our language in citx and embraced the theory that corporate damage could be found in the form of increased liabilities,decrease in fair asset value and lost profits,noting that such damage encompasses the same concept as deepening insolvency.id.at.relying on the supreme court statement in ncp ii,the trial court held that 
whether courts term it deepening insolvency or describe in detail the gamut of destruction that the term is meant to embrace,the bottom line is the same.harm is harm.where there is a harm,the law provides a remedy the artificial prolongation of an insolvent corporation life can harm a corporation.where there is a harm,the law provides a remedy.
in light of ncp i and ncp ii,we are not as resolute that new jersey law would not recognize deepening insolvency as a cause of action or as a theory of damages.in the end,we are satisfied that new jersey law provides for a remedy for traditional tort damages that flow from wrongful conduct that results in increased liabilities,decrease in fair asset value and lost profits of a corporation.
pwc also asserts that the commissioner failed to establish an injury to ambassador separate from an injury to its creditors and thus recovery is barred by citx.pwc argues that million of the commissioner million damages calculation consists of net liabilities from insurance policies that ambassador wrote between april,and november,excess of the claims paid out over the premiums received and the investment income on those premiums.according to pwc,this amount represents an increase in the liabilities of the estate and a loss to ambassador policyholders,not a distinct injury to ambassador.further,the unpaid portion on these claims is an increase in the liabilities of ambassador and a loss to policyholders.today we hold that an increase in liabilities is a harm to the company and the law provides a remedy when a plaintiff proves a negligence cause of action.
under the facts of this case,we are satisfied that a jury could properly hold pwc liable for damages under traditional negligence and malpractice principles.accepting pwc invitation to prevent a plaintiff from recovering damages in a negligence action where there has been reference to deepening insolvency,would require us to ignore new jersey tort law doctrine,which we are not inclined to do.we hold that traditional damages,stemming from actual harm of a defendant negligence,do not become invalid merely because they have the effect of increasing a corporation insolvency.
iii.proximate cause 
pwc argues that its audits of ambassador were not a substantial factor in the insurance department failure to intervene earlier and that ambassador damages resulted from several other causes.pwc contends that the district court should not have charged the jury on the substantial factor test and instead should have entered judgment in favor of pwc because its negligence was sufficiently remote or insignificant.finally,pwc asserts that it is entitled to a new trial because the district court refused to instruct the jury on superseding causes,a distinct causation test requiring a separate instruction.for the reasons stated,we reject these contentions.
substantial factor test 
under new jersey law,when multiple factors contribut e to the cause of the accident,a defendant in a negligence action is not liable if his conduct was too remotely or insignificantly related to the injury.brown stove.to incur liability,the defendant negligence must be a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries.id.quotations omitted.pwc argues that the district court should have entered summary judgment in favor of pwc as a matter of law because pwc negligence was remote and insignificant.pwc asserts that its audits of ambassador were not a substantial factor in the commissioner failure to intervene earlier because the commissioner did not rely on pwc audit opinions but,rather,relied on numerous third parties,including its own examiners,who did not undercover ambassador insolvency.
the district court determined that the questions of proximate and intervening causes were to be left to the jury for its factual determination.in denying pwc motion for summary judgment,the district court properly recognized that the issue of proximate cause could be addressed as a matter of law only where the outcome is clear or when highly extraordinary events or conduct takes place.app.the district court found that pwc failed to provide evidence that intervening events were sufficiently extraordinary or so clearly unrelated to the antecedent negligence that imposition of liability would be unreasonable.app.citation omitted.the district court also found that pwc disputed the facts regarding proximate cause,and thus,summary judgment was inappropriate.
pwc relies on fdic ernst young,cir,in which the federal deposit insurance company fdic,as receiver for the failed western savings association western,filed negligence and breach of contract claims against western auditors,ernst young.in the district court the fdic argued that if the audits had been accurate,government regulators would have prevented further losses.id.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the auditors observing that the fdic,as assignee,stood in the shoes of western and because western already had knowledge of its precarious financial condition neither it nor the fdic could have relied on the allegedly negligent audits.the fifth circuit affirmed,noting that i f nobody relied on the audit,then the audit could not have been a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.id.at quotation omitted.the fifth circuit found that the sole owner of western,jarrett woods,did not rely on the audits because it was his risky lending practices that created western precarious financial condition.the court held that woods fraudulent activities were on behalf of western and thus his knowledge and conduct was imputable to western.the fifth circuit concluded that the fdic could not maintain a suit for a negligently performed audit upon which neither the owner nor the corporation relied.id.at.
we believe fdic to be inapposite.the fifth circuit,found that the fdic had not relied on the audits on the basis that the sole owner knowledge and fraudulent conduct were imputable to western.unlike in fdic,we will not impute chait conduct or knowledge to ambassador,as discussed later.see infra part.thus,ambassador did not have knowledge of chait negligent conduct nor of chait breach of fiduciary duty as the ceo,and did not know that pwc negligently audited it.furthermore,the record in the instant case establishes that ambassador relied on pwc financial statements.ambassador incorporated pwc loss reserves calculations from the audited annual sec statements into the annual vermont statements ambassador filed with the insurance department.the commissioner independent examiners relied on these same loss reserve calculations.finally,ambassador relied on the pwc loss reserves calculations from the audited annual sec statements to continue writing insurance policies.
pwc also relies on muhl ambassador group,aff mem.sub.nom.muhl coopers lybrand,a case that involves ambassador subsidiary,horizon.in muhl,the new york superintendent of insurance brought an action on behalf of horizon insurance company against pwc,alleging negligence based on the same audits as the ones at issue in the instant case.the new york superintendent,similar to the commissioner,alleged that he would have intervened earlier had he known horizon true financial condition.the new york supreme court granted summary judgment to pwc on the basis that the new york insurance regulator did not rely pwc audit of ambassador.the court also emphasized that the new york insurance regulators usually relied on their own independent examinations.id.at.in contrast here,the annual vermont statements that ambassador filed with the insurance department incorporated pwc loss reserves calculations from the audited annual sec statements.thus the commissioner did rely on those loss reserve calculations,unlike the new york superintendent,who disregarded the reports of outside auditors.
accordingly,we believe that the district court correctly concluded that the record contained factual disputes as to proximate cause and whether any intervening events cut off pwc liability.these questions were properly submitted for the jury determination.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the commissioner,the court did not err in denying pwc motions for judgment as a matter of law.
jury instruction on superseding cause 
having determined that the district court properly submitted the issue of proximate cause to the jury,we turn to pwc contention that it is entitled to a new trial because the district court refused to instruct the jury on superseding causes,a distinct causation test under new jersey law requiring a separate instruction.a superseding cause is an event or conduct sufficiently unrelated to or unanticipated by a defendant that warrants termination of liability,irrespective of whether the defendant negligence was or was not a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.pwc asserts that a jury could have found that chait independent and intentional misconduct,as well as failures by third parties such as the commissioner independent examiners,were superseding causes of ambassador injury.the commissioner responds that pwc failed to request a proper instruction of superseding cause before the district court,and thus failed to preserve the issue for appeal.
we first address the commissioner assertion that pwc has waived this argument.under federal rule of civil procedure c,a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.we believe this issue was not waived.
as shown in the record,pwc requested the following instruction if you find that plaintiff damages were the result of an intervening cause for which pwc is not responsible,then you would find that the conduct of pwc was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff damages.app.the district court denied this request and adopted new jersey model civil charge entitled proximate cause,which provides that where there is a claim of an intervening or superseding cause,civil charge should also be charged nevertheless,the district court did not issue civil charge furthermore,the record reflects that pwc preserved this issue for appeal by objecting to the absence of an instruction on multiple causes and intervening cause.app.because civil charge is very similar to pwc requested instruction and pwc objected to the absence of such an instruction,we conclude that pwc claim based on the absence of a superseding cause instruction was not waived.thus,we turn to the merits of the district court decision not to instruct the jury on superseding causes.
the district court ruling not to instruct on superseding causes 
under new jersey law,the doctrine of superseding cause focuses on whether events or conduct that intervene subsequent to the defendant negligence are sufficiently unrelated to or unanticipated by that negligence to warrant termination of the defendant responsibility.lynch scheininger,see also restatement second of torts comment b a superseding cause relieves the actor from liability,irrespective of whether his antecedent negligence was or was not a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.therefore,if in looking back from the harm and tracing the sequence of events by which it was produced,it is found that a superseding cause has operated,there is no need of determining whether the actor antecedent conduct was or was not a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.an intervening cause which is foreseeable or a normal incident of the risk created by a tortfeasor action does not relieve the tortfeasor of liability.see lynch,at quoting rappaport nichols.ordinarily,the question of whether an intervening event supersedes a defendant liability is left to the jury for its factual determination.id.however,where the evidence does not suggest any superseding or intervening cause,it is improper for the trial court to instruct the jury and permit the jury to speculate that one existed.see bethlehem steel.
as noted above,the district court found that pwc failed to provide evidence that intervening events were sufficiently extraordinary or so clearly unrelated to the antecedent negligence that imposition of liability would be unreasonable.app.quotation omitted.we agree.however egregious chait conduct may have been,we can not conclude on the record before us that the evidence presented at trial indicates that his conduct was so unrelated to pwc negligent conduct that it would have extinguished pwc liability.in our review of the record,we are satisfied that the district court properly omitted such an instruction.
iv.in pari delicto 
next we turn to pwc argument that chait improper conduct should have been imputed to ambassador,triggering the in pari delicto doctrine and relieving pwc of liability.the doctrine of in pari delicto provides that a plaintiff may not assert a claim against a defendant if the plaintiff bears fault for the claim.lafferty,at.pwc argues that under this doctrine a corporate officer misconduct is imputed to the corporation and a plaintiff suing on behalf of the corporation is barred from filing a third party claim in which the plaintiff is at fault.pwc argues that because the district court found that chait committed gross negligence and breached his fiduciary duty,and because that conduct should be imputed to ambassador,the commissioner suing on behalf of ambassador,should be barred from suing pwc for wrongful conduct for which ambassador bears fault.see lafferty,at.
the commissioner first argues that pwc waived its right to complain about the lack of a jury instruction on the in pari delicto defense by not proposing an appropriate charge.the record demonstrates that pwc did propose a charge,which the district court refused to give,which included the following language in general,any agents or employees of an organization may bind the organization by their acts and declarations made while acting within the scope of their authority delegated to them by the organization or within the scope of their duties as agents or employees of the organization.app.pwc also requested a question on the verdict sheet to determine if officers were acting for their own benefit,which the district court also rejected.finally,pwc objected to the absence of an instruction on attribution of acts of agents or employees of an organization to the organization.app.based on the record,it is clear that pwc preserved this issue for appeal.
district court ruling not to instruct on in pari delicto 
pwc contends that if chait conduct is imputed to ambassador,the commissioner,as ambassador receiver,can not recover from pwc.pwc asserts that chait conduct should be imputed to ambassador and the in pari delicto defense should govern because chait was found liable for of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.pwc also argues that under the sole actor doctrine,which provides that acts of a controlling shareholder or dominating officer are automatically imputed,chait misconduct should have been imputed to ambassador.see lafferty,at under the law of imputation,courts impute the fraud of an officer to a corporation when the officer commits the fraud in the course of his employment,and for the benefit of the corporation.citations omitted 
we analyze the second requirement of the imputation the officer fraud is committed for the benefit of the the adverse interest exception.id.at.under the adverse interest exception,fraudulent conduct will not be imputed if the officer interests were adverse to the corporation and not for the benefit of the corporation.id.this exception is subject to the sole actor doctrine which provides that if an agent is the sole representative of a principal,then that agent fraudulent conduct will be imputed to the principal regardless of whether the agent conduct was adverse to the principal interests.id.
new jersey courts have also held that one who contributed to the misconduct can not invoke imputation.ncp litig.trust,at.in ncp,a litigation trust acting as a bankrupt corporation successor in interest and shareholders representative brought an action against kpmg to recover for negligent failure to uncover fraud by corporate officers.id.at.kmpg sought to invoke the in pari delicto doctrine.the new jersey supreme court held that the in pari delicto doctrine does not bar corporate shareholders from recovering in suit against the auditor.id.at.the court recognized an auditor negligence exception,explaining that a claim for negligence may be brought on behalf of a corporation against the corporation allegedly negligent auditors for damages proximately caused by that negligence.id.the court explained that the imputation defense is properly applied in situations where a principal agent defrauded a third party who the principal subsequently seeks to sue.id.the ncp court distinguished its facts by explaining that the bankrupt corporation officers did not directly defraud an innocent third defrauded the corporation and its creditors.id.thus,kmpg was not a victim of the fraud and allowing it to avoid liability would not serve the purpose of the imputation protect the innocent.id.
pwc asserts that the commissioner,as ambassador receiver,stands in ambassador shoes and thus is barred from bringing claims against pwc because chait acts as ambassador president are imputed to ambassador.to support this proposition,pwc points to the district court finding that chait was guilty of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.pwc asserts that the adverse interest exception does not apply because chait was not stealing from the company moreover should it apply,chait conduct would still be imputable under the sole actor doctrine.pwc argues that the auditor exception recognized in ncp does not alter its position that chait misconduct is imputed to ambassador as a matter of law because it does not bar imputation of conduct by a controlling shareholder.
first,we agree with the parties that under the first prong of the imputation test,chait conduct was committed in the course of his employment with ambassador.turning to the second requirement of the test,for the benefit of the corporation,we look at the adverse interest exception.as stated above,under the adverse interest exception,chait fraudulent conduct will not be imputed to ambassador if his interests were adverse to the corporation and not for the benefit of the corporation.pwc asserts in its opening brief that the adverse interest exception does not apply because chait was not stealing from the company.appellant br.at.in the alternate,pwc argues that chait actions should be imputed to ambassador under the sole actor doctrine.we do not agree with either assertion and decline to impute chait actions.
in schacht brown,the seventh circuit addressed the issue of who can bring claims of negligence against auditors.cir,cert.denied.in schacht,the officers and directors of an insurance corporation allegedly arranged a fraudulent scheme to issue extraordinarily insurance policies without retaining sufficient funds to cover possible claims.id.at.when the corporation became insolvent,a liquidator was appointed to manage its affairs and to initiate any actions belonging to the bankruptcy estate.id.at.the liquidator eventually sued the auditor for negligently failing to discover the fraud.id.the auditor argued that the liquidator,as the corporation,stand s in the shoes of the corporation and only can advance those claims that the corporation could advance directly.id.therefore,the corporate agents fraud was imputable to the liquidator in the same way that it was imputable to the corporation.id.the court held that the corporation officer conduct was not a benefit to the corporation,and therefore the adverse interest exception to imputation applied.id.at.relying on schacht,the new jersey supreme court has also held,in ncp,that inflating a corporation revenues and enabling a corporation to exist beyond insolvency could not be considered a benefit to the corporation.at.
given that chait conduct allowed ambassador to continue past the point of insolvency,his actions can not be deemed to have benefitted the corporation.as in schacht and ncp,chait fraudulent conduct can not be imputed to ambassador under the adverse interest exception.pwc attempts to distinguish ncp on the basis that chait,unlike the defendants in ncp,was a controlling shareholder and the ncp court could not implicate the sole actor doctrine.however,we are unpersuaded.the ncp court did not reveal how much stock the wrongdoers owned and the court did not rely on their status as controlling shareholders.furthermore,the sole actor exception is applied to cases in which the agent who committed the fraud was the sole shareholder of the corporation or dominated the corporation.here,chait and his wife,collectively,owned of group stock.thus,pwc argument must fail.
we also deem applicable the auditor negligence exception recognized by the new jersey supreme court in ncp,which explained that a claim for negligence may be brought on behalf of a corporation against the corporation allegedly negligent auditors for damages proximately caused by that negligence.similar to the fact pattern in ncp,pwc was not a victim of chait fraud and allowing it to avoid liability by invoking the in pari delicto doctrine would not serve the purpose of the protect the innocent.
pwc further argues that the district court erred in denying its motions for summary judgment because the facts material to imputation were not in dispute and if there were any disputed facts,the district court erred in refusing to submit the in pari delicto defense.the district court did not provide any reasoning or analysis on the issue of the in pari delicto defense,but merely rejected pwc argument by stating that pwc instruction was not necessary.app.it is clear from witness testimony that there were disputed facts as to chait misconduct.based on our reading of schacht and ncp,which control,and for the reasons stated above,we conclude that pwc was barred from raising the imputation defense against ambassador because of its negligence and contribution to chait misconduct.thus,we will affirm the district court denial of pwc motions for summary judgment based on the in pari delicto doctrine and refusal to charge the jury on imputation.
motion to bifurcate the trial 
pwc challenges the district court denial of its motion to bifurcate the trial and to try the commissioner claims against pwc and chait separately.federal rule of civil procedure rule b governs a request by a party to bifurcate a trial and provides f or convenience,to avoid prejudice,or to expedite and economize,the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues or claims.b.we review the denial of a motion to bifurcate a trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for abuse of discretion.barr laboratories,abbott laboratories,cir see also idzojtic pennsylvania,cir the district court is given broad discretion in reaching its decision whether to separate the issues of liability and damages.
pwc argues that because the district court entered a default against chait estate six weeks before trial for failure to respond to a court order,it was improper that he remained a defendant at the trial on pwc liability.according to pwc,the district court failure try the claims against the commissioner separately resulted in an unfair trial,forcing pwc to defend chait because of the doctrine of joint and several liability pwc contends that its liability,as the defendant,should have been determined in a separate trial.pwc also asserts that the district court charge regarding the default judgment against chait estate made it impossible for the jury to find pwc not liable.
in denying pwc motions for separate trials the district court ruled that the entry of a default rather than a default judgment,which the court did not enter until the close of evidence,left certain issues to the jury for a final judgment the proper apportionment of fault against all parties was an appropriate consideration for the jury and evidence relating to the audit environment and chait conduct was relevant and properly before the jury.in denying pwc motion for a new trial based,in part,on the denial of its bifurcation request,the district court found that m uch of the evidence regarding chait culpability was admissible to establish the particulars of pwc alleged negligence.
pwc arguments that it was prejudiced by chait presence at the trial and was forced to defend his actions are unpersuasive.eliminating chait as a defendant would have eliminated little of the evidence presented at trial.as pwc counsel conceded at oral argument,the jury would have heard evidence of chait wrongdoing even in a bifurcated trial.pwc chose to defend chait not only because of joint and several liability,but also to defend pwc conclusion that at the time of the audit ambassador was properly managed.moreover,pwc sought to reverse course and distance itself from chiat only after the district court found him liable.
further,contrary to pwc argument that the liability of chait,a defaulted defendant,was given to the jury to determine,the district court issued a limiting instruction,informing the jury that chait estate was liable to the commissioner as a matter of law and guilty of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.the district court emphasized the jury sole responsibility with respect to chait was to assess his proportionate fault.specifically,the district court instructed the jury that 
although chait estate is a defendant in this case,i have entered a default judgment against the estate.default judgment is a technical term that simply means that i have determined that chait estate is liable to the vermont commissioner on the claims made against chait in this case.therefore,you are to accept for purposes of your deliberations that chait is guilty of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in his role as director and officer of ambassador.your responsibility as triers of fact will be to assess damages against chait estate in accordance with the evidence you have heard and,as i will instruct later,to apportion fault as between chait and others for what happened to ambassador.
i must stress,i can not stress this you are not to assume the liability of pwc.i repeat that simply because i have found chait to be liable to the vermont commissioner does not automatically mean that pwc is similarly liable.your job as jurors will be to determine whether you believe,on the basis of the evidence you have heard,that pwc was negligent in auditing the financial statements of ambassador group,and whether their negligence was a proximate cause of any damages which may have been incurred by ambassador.
given the explicit jury charge,pwc argument that it was prejudiced by the district court entry of default judgment against chait estate at the close of evidence is unpersuasive.considering this portion of the district court charge,we believe it was possible for the jury to have determined that pwc had no liability and was not negligent in auditing the financials even in light of the court default judgment against the estate.furthermore,the jury verdict sheet questions were directed solely to pwc conduct and only made reference to chait in the context of determining his percentage of fault,if any.
pwc reliance on in re uranium antitrust litigation,cir is unavailing.although the seventh circuit held that a damages hearing should not be held until the liability of each defendant had been resolved,it reasoned that holding one damages hearing for a defaulting defendant prior to the resolution of the liability of joint and severally liable defendants could result in inconsistency and possibly two distinct damages awards on a single claim.id.at.the court found this to be a concern of possible inconsistency and judicial economy,rather than actual prejudice.id.here,there was no attempt by the district court to inquire into or have chait damages determined before pwc liability was determined.furthermore,the district court in the instant case noted its strong desire to try all of the commissioner claims together for judicial economy.app.
similarly unavailing is pwc reliance on fehlhaber indian trails,cir,which only held that it was within the discretionary authority of the court to hold a rule b hearing to determine the amount defendant was entitled to by reason of the third party defendants default.there was no issue of joint and several liability in fehlhaber nor did the court hold that such a hearing was required when there was a defaulting defendant.
based on the record before us and the district court multiple rulings on pwc motions for separate trials,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motions for separate trials.
vi.damages 
pwc argues that the million damages award is excessive because it exceeds ambassador total insolvency and contradicts the commissioner theory that ambassador was already insolvent at the end of.
we first address the commissioner argument that pwc waived its argument about damages by failing to argue this point before the district court.in pwc motion for a new trial,pwc asserted that a new trial was required because the damages were excessive and irreconcilable with the jury findings.pwc also contended that the damages award exceeded ambassador actual insolvency in its post trial motion for summary judgment.as pwc asserts,the commissioner responded to these arguments before the district court and the district court acknowledged pwc argument that the damages awarded were unreasonably excessive.thus,based on the record created before the district court,pwc did not waive its argument that the damages award was excessive,and the issue is properly before us.
damages calculation 
pwc argues that the damages award is excessive because it exceeds ambassador total insolvency.it further maintains that the award of million contradicts the commissioner theory that ambassador was already insolvent at the end of and that such inconsistency entitles pwc to a new trial on liability and damages.in other words,pwc contends that the unpaid liabilities allegedly caused by pwc negligent audit can not possibly exceed ambassador total unpaid liabilities.thus,pwc argues that as the commissioner expert calculated the net loss from continuing operations after march,to be million,based on ambassador total insolvency as of december,the latest calculation before trial of million less million in litigation expenses,the million in damages awarded by the jury is logically too high.finally,pwc argues that any amount above million,including interest,will go to the estate,because it would exceed what ambassador owes its creditors in liquidation,creating a windfall recovery to the estate.
in response,the commissioner explains that million was calculated as an alternative theory of damages,which pwc attacked at trial.the million was based on the amount of current assets that ambassador owed to creditors as of that point in time that it could not pay with available assets.at trial,the commissioner ultimately opted not to offer that calculation and instead submitted the million net loss from continuing operations after march,measure of damages.the commissioner also responds that there will be no windfall to the estate given that damages were calculated as of december.
we review district court ruling on a new trial motion for only abuse of discretion.honeywell,am.standards testing bureau,cir.a jury damages award will not be upset so long as there exists sufficient evidence on the record,which if accepted by the jury,would sustain the award.see national controls semiconductor.cir.in denying pwc motion for summary judgment,the district court noted that pwc went to lengths to discredit the commissioner expert damages calculations of million actual insolvency and perhaps for this reason the jury declined to accept this calculation.the district court found that the commissioner had presented sufficient evidence in support of its damages theory to permit the jury finding.reviewing the testimony of the commissioner damages expert,it is clear that if the jury accepted his calculation there was sufficient evidence to sustain an award of million as detailed by his testimony.moreover,as the district court noted,the jury specifically requested the breakdown of the commissioner calculation of damages and l ittle more than an hour after receiving this information,the jury returned a verdict for the full amount of damages.app.furthermore,having decided that chait conduct is not imputed to ambassador,pwc reliance on ncp,is unpersuasive as to the issue of determining damages and concerns that the estate may reap a windfall.thus,we agree with the district court that the jury accepted the commissioner damages calculations and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying pwc motion for new trial.
vii.prejudgment interest 
we now turn to the district court calculation of prejudgment interest.we review a district court determination to require the payment of prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion.ambromovage united mine workers of america,cir.the district court may exercise this discretion upon considerations of fairness and prejudgment interest may be denied when its exaction would be inequitable.id.quoting bd.of comm rs of jackson county united states.under new jersey state law,the purpose of prejudgment interest is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of income that would have been earned on the judgment had it been paid earlier.ruff weintraub.
pwc contends that the million prejudgment interest award by the district court was punitive rather than merely compensatory and violates new jersey prohibitions against the recovery of prejudgment interest on future economic losses and awarding compound interest.pwc maintains that the bulk of damages accrued after the commissioner brought this action in,yet the district court award calculates prejudgment interest as if each loss existed on the day the case was filed.accordingly,pwc argues that the commissioner is only entitled to prejudgment interest on past loss measured from the specific date each of ambassador liabilities became payable.
in calculating the amount of prejudgment interest,the district court accepted the commissioner proposal to strike million from the verdict to remove all future economic losses,easily resolving pwc first argument that the award was punitive and violated new jersey prohibitions against the recovery of prejudgment interest on future economic losses.the commissioner arrived at the number of the amount to strike from the verdict,million,by adding million for net unpaid claims and million for assumed claims payable to horizon,both of which represent future economic losses,and reducing it to the present value.after reducing the verdict of million by million,the amount of future economic losses,the district court used a base verdict of million to calculate prejudgment interest.
the district court found that while all the claims had not been filed when this action commenced,the losses were nevertheless actuarial and anticipated at the time the complaint was filed.the district court calculated prejudgment interest on the full amount of damages from to the date of its judgment,september.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
new jersey rules governing civil practice states that 
except where provided by statute with respect to a public entity or employee,and except as otherwise provided by law,the court shall,in tort actions,including products liability actions,include in the judgment simple interest,calculated as hereafter provided,from the date of the institution of the action or from a date months after the date the cause of action arises,whichever is later,provided that in exceptional cases the court may suspend the running of such prejudgment interest.prejudgment interest shall not,however,be allowed on any recovery for future economic losses.
court b.the claims incurred by the company after the filing of the action were not future losses,defined under new jersey law as those that accrue after judgment,but rather damages that became actualized after the filing of the complaint.see mckeand gerhard.pwc does not contest that the claims were actuarial and anticipated at the time the action was filed.
the language of the rule provides that interest should be calculated from the date of the institution of the action without reference to when during the litigation a particular claim was actualized.it is well settled that the purposes for awarding prejudgment interest in tort actions are not only to compensate plaintiffs for not having use of judgment money while their actions are pending and to require defendants to give up benefits of their use of money during that time,but also to encourage defendants to settle cases.see ruff weintraub.based on these considerations,we find that the district court appropriately calculated prejudgment interest on the damages for the entire period since the filing of the action.
we also conclude that the district court did not violate the prohibition against compound interest.at issue is a million hypothetical borrowing cost embedded in the damages set forth by the commissioner.of this million,million is hypothetical interest earned on the premiums for policies after march.the difference between these amounts is a million net interest expense.pwc argues that the entire million hypothetical borrowing cost should be deducted from the verdict prior to calculating the prejudgment interest.
the district court deducted the million net interest expense from the base verdict of million,noting that it was the only part of the million item that appeared in the verdict.the district court then calculated the prejudgment interest as million and deducted an additional million,arriving at the prejudgment award of million.the district court deducted the second million because otherwise it would have resulted in an award of prejudgment interest higher than the commissioner sought.the court recognized that this second deduction,would treat the million item as having never been found by the jury but nonetheless deducted it so as to not let the commissioner recover twice.app.
the commissioner view is that pwc is complaining of a ruling in its favor.the question before us is whether the court abused its discretion in netting the two interest figures contained in the avoidable loss damage calculation.while the million item represents a hypothetical borrowing cost,the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that ambassador would have earned million in interest on the premiums and this required an offsetting of the hypothetical interest expense.
viii.joint and several liability 
finally,we turn to pwc argument that the district court should have applied vermont law on joint and several liability,under which pwc can not be liable for more than its proportionate share of the judgment,because ambassador was domiciled in vermont.the district court interpretation and application of new jersey choice of law rules is a purely legal matter and therefore subject to plenary review by this court.simon united states,cir.
it is well established that in a diversity action,a district court must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state to determine what law will govern each of the issues of a case.klaxon stentor.new jersey has accepted the governmental interest choice of law test.warriner stanton,cir citing veazey doremus.under this inquiry we must determine the state with the greatest interest in governing the particular issue and apply the laws of that state.id.at quotations omitted.the governmental interest analysis is each case presents its own unique combination of parties residence,the place and type of occurrence and the specific set of governmental influence the resolution of the issue presented.id.quoting erny estate of merola.furthermore,the new jersey supreme court has held that determinations are made on an basis,with each issue receiving separate analysis.see erny,at citing gantes kason.
the first prong of the governmental interest test requires us to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the states involved.erny,at.unquestionably,an actual conflict exists between the respective joint and several liability laws of new jersey and vermont.at the time of pwc negligence and in,when the commissioner filed his action,new jersey law provided for joint and several liability for all joint tortfeasors.stat.ann.supp.the new jersey statute has since been amended twice,in and in,to limit the applicability of joint and several liability.the current statute,as amended in,only permits joint and several liability to defendants or more at fault.stat.ann.a west.meanwhile,vermont established a system of comparative negligence and abolished joint and several liability among joint tortfeasors in.stat,tit.

in its opinion entering judgment,the district court held that pwc and chait estate were joint tortfeasors and were both jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the million jury verdict.the district court did not undertake a separate choice of law analysis to determine whether new jersey or vermont law should apply to the issue of whether pwc is jointly and severally liable with chait estate for the full amount of damages at the time it entered judgment.instead,the district court applied new jersey law on joint and several liability solely based on its earlier opinion denying pwc motion for summary judgment that new jersey state law would govern the substantive issues in this case 
after entering judgment,and in response to pwc motion to amend the judgment pursuant to rule e,the district court corrected its error of applying new jersey law on joint and several liability simply because it applied that state law to the substantive issues,and addressed the choice of law issue as it pertained to the question of joint and several liability.to determine vermont interest in having its comparative negligence statute applied,the district court examined the policy underlying the vermont statute and analyzed vermont contacts with pwc conduct and the commissioner litigation.the district court then analyzed new jersey interest by looking to the policy underlying the statute that was in place in,the year that the commissioner filed this action.the district court held that new jersey had the superior interest in having its law determine the allocation of damages because its policy favoring full compensation of tort victims would be frustrated by application of vermont comparative negligence statute,whose policy favored the equitable allocation of damages among vermont tortfeasors.the court also concluded that vermont had no interest in ensuring that pwc and the estate pay only their pro rata share of damages.
pwc contends that the district court erred by looking at the policy underlying new jersey joint and several liability statute in effect in rather than the statute currently in effect.it argues that because new jersey current statute would only hold pwc liable for its proportionate share of damages,new jersey would have no interest in applying its superseded joint and several liability statute.in addition,pwc argues that vermont has a greater interest in this case because of its stated position that it is a dom
