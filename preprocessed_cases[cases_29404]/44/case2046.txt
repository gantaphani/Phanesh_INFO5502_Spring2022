defendants deputy secretary paul fontenot,sergeant john watson,officer linda clark,officer shirley armstrong,and trooper jeffrey watts appeal a jury verdict reached in favor of plaintiff gregory johnson.the jury found that the defendants fired johnson in violation of and the first amendment right to free speech.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of judgment in favor of all five defendants.
johnson was employed by the louisiana department of public service and corrections as a motor vehicle inspector in the harvey office.johnson supervisor was watson,the district supervisor.fontenot was the deputy secretary of the entire department.clark and armstrong also worked in the harvey office.watts worked in internal affairs.
on july,johnson and three of his coworkers delivered a complaint to the internal affairs division of the state police concerning watson and paul speer,the acting district supervisor.johnson had been the acting district supervisor until june,when watson demoted him and replaced him with speer.before his demotion,johnson had supervised the other three employees who signed the complaint.the complaint accused watson of payroll fraud,intimidation,favoritism,disrespect,racial and sexual discrimination,abusiveness towards subordinate officers,unfairness,and sexual harassment the sexual harassment allegation was that watson had attempted to put his hand on the breast of a female officer while massaging her shoulders and that he had made comments about the size of the officer breasts.
because the officers submitted the complaint to internal affairs instead of to watson supervisor,watts investigated them for violating the chain of command.he also investigated their allegation of bribery against speer.although he did not officially investigate watson,watts asked all the officers who signed the complaint to provide any evidence they had to support their allegations.
johnson identified clark as the victim of watson sexual harassment.he said that he personally had observed the massaging incident and that watson had bragged later that he had almost had his hand on clark breast.another officer corroborated that he had seen watson massaging clark shoulders,but he had not been in a position to see if watson attempted to touch her breast.the other complaining officers had no information regarding that incident.watts also took statements from watson and speer,who both denied the allegations clark submitted a written statement denying the allegation 
watts eventually concluded that all four employees violated the chain of command.johnson was reprimanded,but the other three officers were not.
according to johnson,in august armstrong told him and another officer that watson had again attempted to touch clark breast and that armstrong had reported the incident to her supervisor,theresa gendusa.in response to armstrong information,johnson submitted a request to fontenot that he an investigation into watson behavior.
watts then investigated whether johnson had made false allegations of sexual harassment against watson watts supervisor told watts that he believed the sexual harassment allegations to be false.
for the second investigation,watts interviewed johnson,clark,armstrong,and gendusa.watts did not interview the other officer who,according to johnson,heard what armstrong said in august.clark again denied that she had ever been sexually harassed by watson.she also complained that johnson went by her desk every day for two weeks asking her to submit a written statement that watson had harassed her.she said that johnson told her that he and the other officers who signed the initial complaint could lose their jobs if she did not support their allegations.clark stated that she had become physically ill from the stress of johnson repeated requests.armstrong told watts that watson had not harassed clark and that johnson had been pressuring her to state otherwise.she admitted that she told johnson that watson had said that clark would not allow him to touch her breasts,but she said that everyone understood it was a joke.she also stated that johnson had been pressuring her to make a statement that clark had complained to her of sexual harassment.she,too,claimed the stress of johnson requests was making her ill.gendusa said no one had reported any sexual harassment to her.
watts submitted his investigative report to fontenot on september.in it,he reported the denials of sexual harassment by all three women and the complaints about johnson behavior.he suggested that johnson might have a vendetta against watson for demoting him from the acting district supervisor position.clark told watts that she believed this to be the case,and johnson admitted he was unhappy about the demotion and felt that watson decision was based on racial bias and friendship.watts concluded 
based on the testimony and written statements provided by linda clark,shirley armstrong,and theresa gendusa,it is quite obvious that the allegation of sexual harassment is false.officer johnson was well aware of this during the interview however,he continued to accuse sergeant watson of sexually harassing linda clark without any proof.
on november,fontenot sent johnson a notice of intended dismissal because of johnson persistent untrue allegations of sexual harassment.in the notice,fontenot discussed johnson repeated attempts to get clark and armstrong to submit statements supporting his claims.fontenot invited johnson to submit evidence in support of his allegations to avoid dismissal.in response,johnson requested further investigation and indicated his willingness to elicit information from clark while wearing a wire.he did not,however,submit any further evidence.fontenot fired johnson on december.
johnson sued the state of louisiana and the defendants in their individual and official capacities in the district court.the district court dismissed the claims against the state of louisiana and against the defendants in their official capacity.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,and the defendants appealed.we dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because we found the district court determination depended on questions of fact.johnson louisiana,cir unpublished table decision.
the parties then tried the case to a jury.at trial,johnson highlighted inconsistencies between clark and armstrong compared to each other and as compared to their own earlier well as facts that belied some of their statements for example,armstrong complained of being so ill from the stress that she needed to see a doctor,but at trial she admitted she had not gone to see a doctor.he presented no evidence that either watts or fontenot were aware of these inconsistencies at the time of johnson termination.in special interrogatories,the jury found that the defendants had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that johnson accusations were made in bad faith and that all of the defendants acting individually collectively intentionally retaliated against johnson for his accusations of sexual harassment.the district court entered a judgment in johnson favor against all five defendants in the amount of.it later awarded him attorney fees and costs pursuant to.
we will overturn a jury verdict only if we conclude that,after viewing the trial record in the light most favorable to the verdict,there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for the prevailing party.mato baldauf,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.we find that johnson failed to do so.
to prove a first amendment retaliation claim under,a plaintiff must show that he suffered an adverse employment action,his speech involved a matter of public concern,his interest in commenting on matters of public concern outweighed the government employer interest in promoting efficiency,and his speech motivated the adverse employment action.harris victoria.sch,cir.the last element is one of causation if the who imposed the adverse employment action was not motivated by the speech,then the
