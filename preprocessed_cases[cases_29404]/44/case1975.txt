plaintiff bradley guile guile appeals the district court dismissal of his claims against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca and the court granting of defendant cristina cruz motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding liability for the death of guile wife.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
guile wife,emiko guile,was admitted on may,to an inpatient psychiatric ward for military dependents and retirees at william beaumont army medical center beaumont in el paso,texas.beginning in,guile had been seeing military doctors,including neurologists,psychiatrists,and psychologists,at various places that guile was stationed because of problems including depression,anxiety,and an involuntary head movement.when she was admitted to beaumont in may,guile had been found unconscious at home by her daughter and her husband after overdosing on her antidepressant medication.this was guile second inpatient admission at beaumont she had been admitted in february for a few days,apparently for severe anxiety and because she had expressed concerns that she would overdose on her medications 
the united states army had contracted with php healthcare corporation php to provide psychiatric services for dependents and retirees at beaumont.the inpatient ward serving guile was therefore operated by php within the army beaumont facility.guile psychiatrist while she was admitted to the inpatient ward was cristina cruz,a independent contractor with php.cruz treated guile from may until tuesday,june,when she left for a few days vacation.from june through friday,june,cecilia devargas,another php contractor psychiatrist,covered for cruz in treating guile.beginning on the evening of june,milton anderson,an active duty army officer and psychiatrist,was the physician covering the inpatient ward for the weekend 
on the morning of sunday,june emiko guile was found dead in her room.she had hung herself from a door hinge of an armoire in the room,using the belt from her bathrobe.guile was in a room with a roommate,and two large armoires were positioned between the two beds in the room.the armoires blocked the view from the room doorway of most of guile bed.although guile likely died soon after midnight,her body was not discovered until about the next morning.the nurse on duty during the night,adree rojas,had spent much of her shift asleep in a break room,without checking on guile.the mental health technician,mario padilla,charged with checking on guile every thirty minutes also did not do so,although he marked her chart to indicate that he had.padilla also heard a banging noise from the direction of guile room soon after midnight,but did not investigate.
on behalf of himself,his daughter,and his wife estate,guile sued the united states,cruz and devargas,php,and some of php nurses and technicians in the district court below.the claims against the united states included claims based on premises liability and negligent contractor supervision and a claim based on negligence of anderson.at the close of evidence,the court granted a motion to dismiss the claims referred to as the premises liability claims.the court then instructed the jury that the united states could not be liable if the jury found that there was no relationship between anderson and guile,and the jury did in fact find that there was no such relationship.
with regard to the plaintiffs,the court instructed the jury that php,adree rojas,mario padilla,and guile herself were each negligent and a proximate cause of emiko guile death as a matter of law.php had entered bankruptcy proceedings by this time,and its insurance company was in receivership.the plaintiff had dismissed its claims against the other php nurses and technicians at the close of evidence.the jury found that devargas was not liable for guile death,but that cruz and bradley guile were liable.the jury awarded total damages of about million,and attributed the liability to php,to cruz,to mario padilla,to adree rojas,to emiko guile,and to bradley guile.
cruz renewed with the district court the motion for judgment as a matter of law that she had made unsuccessfully at the close of the plaintiff evidence and at the close of all evidence.the court agreed that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant cruz allegedly negligent acts or omissions were the proximate cause of emiko guile death,and granted cruz motion for judgment as a matter of law.cruz motions for a new trial and for remittitur were denied as moot.guile appeals the grant of cruz motion for judgment as a matter of law and the dismissal of the claims against the government.

ii.liability of cruz 
it has long been the law in texas that a plaintiff in a medical negligence case must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the allegedly negligent act or omission was a proximate cause of the harm alleged.see,archer warren,park place hosp.estate of milo,kramer lewisville mem l,bowles bourdon.for the alleged negligence to be a proximate cause of the harm,the harm must have been a foreseeable result of the negligence,and the negligence must have been a substantial factor in bringing about the harm,and without which the harm would not have occurred.archer,at park place,at kramer,at.because medical treatment is beyond the reach of a layperson knowledge and experience,expert evidence is required to show both a breach of a standard of care and that the breach was a proximate cause of the harm suffered.see chambers conaway,bowles,at.in granting cruz motion,the district court concluded that guile expert had not established that any negligence on the part of cruz was a proximate cause of emiko guile suicide.
breach of the standard of care 
guile argues that the testimony of his expert,george meyer,did establish breaches of the relevant standard of care.the breaches that guile contends were established are improper drug dosing,lack of necessary suicide precautions,improper handling of test results,failure to the treatment plan,failure to transfer guile to another hospital,improper discussion of discharge with guile,improper sending of guile out on a pass,and failure to have the armoires removed from guile room 
in the case of some of these alleged breaches,there is no evidence that cruz committed the alleged act or omission,whether or not such act or omission would constitute a breach of the standard of care.for example,the expert reference to discussion of discharge with guile involved acts of devargas,not cruz.all evidence showed that cruz continually and adjusted the treatment plan,including seeking of second opinions.cruz did read the results of the testing she ordered,and discussed the results with the testing psychologist.there was no evidence that cruz had anything to do with any subsequent unavailability of the test results.guile charts showed that cruz did increase the dosages of medication over time,as meyer testified was necessary to meet the standard of care.
furthermore,there was no evidence that cruz knew about the armoires in guile room.cruz testified that she had not been in guile room and did not know about the furniture,and there was no evidence that she had been in the room.guile argues that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to infer that cruz had seen the armoires or should have seen them inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence must be reasonable inferences,however,cir brock merrell dow,cir.an inference that cruz should have noticed the furniture in guile room because it may have been possible to see the furniture from the nurse station is not a reasonable inference in view of evidence that her practice was to see patients in her office,and the arrangement of patient rooms was not her responsibility so that there would be no reason for her to be looking at the patient rooms while at the nurse station.such an inference would be mere speculation and conjecture,which is not sufficient to support a jury verdict.anthony chevron usa,cir concluding that testimony showing ways in which it was possible that an oil drilling operation contaminated an aquifer was not sufficient to allow an inference that the operation actually did so.cruz can of course not be held liable for these acts or omissions that she was not shown to have committed.
for most of the remaining alleged breaches,there was not substantial evidence that these were actually breaches of the relevant standard of care,where the standard of care is that of a psychiatrist exercising ordinary care.although meyer testified that he would have used higher dosages on guile medications,he agreed that cruz adjustment of the medications met the standard of care.with regard to transferring guile to another hospital,meyer at one point said that transfer to a facility having electroconvulsive therapy ect capability would be appropriate,but he later conceded that ect was not required to meet the standard of care and might be inappropriate in some cases.meyer statement that guile should have been transferred to a safer facility was a reference to the lassitude of rojas and padilla,which was not foreseeable to cruz.in the case of suicide precautions,meyer at one point asserts that cruz did not properly maintain suicide precautions,and at another point allows that the ongoing suicide assessments of guile met the standard of care.
guile argues that the district court was incorrect in concluding that meyer had retracted his statements asserting that cruz breached the standard of care.he argues that meyer instead created contradictions the resolution of which is the province of the jury.we must remember,however,that evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict must be substantial evidence.anthony,at.an expert opinion must be supported to provide substantial evidence we look to the basis of the expert opinion,and not the bare opinion alone.archer,at.a claim can not stand or fall on the mere ipse dixit of a credentialed witness.id.footnote omitted.many of the alleged breaches described above come from statements of meyer that are unsupported by any data such as studies evaluating treatment techniques,in addition to being later contradicted by him,or to be nothing but his incorrect factual assumptions based on examination of incomplete records.the contradictions coupled with the lack of support for the statements take them out of the realm of substantive evidence.in the context of admissibility of expert testimony,this court has noted that i f an opinion is fundamentally unsupported,then it offers no expert assistance to the jury.viterbo dow chem,cir.
proximate cause 
even to the extent guile could establish any breaches of the standard of care,there can be no liability unless such breaches are shown to be a proximate cause of guile death.for example,meyer did testify to a belief that cruz breached the standard of care when she allowed guile to go on a pass with her family on may.this was arguably contradicted by his later testimony acknowledging that guile passes appeared to make her feel better,but even if we assume that the pass was a breach of the standard of care,there can be no liability from this breach because meyer testified that the pass was not a cause of guile death.
similarly,there is no expert evidence establishing that any of the alleged breaches by cruz were a proximate cause of guile suicide.evidence of proximate cause must show that in the absence of the alleged breach the harm would not have occurred,and must state,describe or explain the connection between the breach and the harm in sufficient detail to support the expert assertion of proximate cause.see,bottoms smith,holding that fact issue existed as to proximate cause when expert opined that polyp would more likely than not have been diagnosed if omitted test had been done,that polyp diagnosed at that time would more likely than not have been at cancer stage having an or better survival rate,and that delay in diagnosis resulted in a cancer stage having a survival rate.
meyer statements regarding the causes of emiko guile suicide do not provide a sufficient connection between any alleged breaches of cruz and guile death.there was no expert testimony that any one or more alleged breaches of care by cruz caused emiko guile death.as noted in guile brief,meyer stated generally that in totality all breaches by all the multiple actors involved combined to cause guile suicide these unexplained,conclusory statements do not establish proximate cause for any particular breach or combination of particular breaches by cruz,because they do not describe or state how any particular asserted breach or breaches by cruz related to the suicide and do not state that without cruz alleged breach or breaches the suicide would not have occurred.this is especially so in that several asserted deficiencies which meyer assumed were attributable to cruz were shown by uncontradicted evidence either not to have occurred at all or not to have been attributable to cruz and the others were essentially withdrawn by meyer the same is true for meyer generalized statements that guile illness was treatable or that her suicide was preventable.meyer further testified that he could not guarantee within a reasonable degree of medical probability that guile would not have committed suicide on june,even if she had received the care that he testified was appropriate.
because guile did not establish by expert testimony any negligence on the part of cruz that was a proximate cause of emiko guile suicide,the district court was correct in granting cruz motion for judgment as a matter of law.
iii.dismissal of claims against united states 
guile argues that the district court erred in applying the discretionary function exception to the ftca to dismiss his claims against the united states.the united states has sovereign immunity from suit except as it waives this immunity by consent.united states sherwood.one example of such a waiver is the ftca,which provides that the united states may be sued for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b 
there are multiple exceptions to liability of the united states under the ftca,however,one of which is known as the discretionary function exception.liability under the ftca does not apply to claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a the supreme court has described the purpose of the discretionary function exception as being to protect legislative and administrative decisions from judicial.united states varig airlines,d united states gaubert,d.
guile argues that the united states failed to properly supervise php,failed to provide safe premises,failed to protect the safety of hospital patients,and failed to ensure that php had the malpractice insurance required by its contract with the army guile reasons for arguing that the discretionary function exception does not apply to these claims appear to be that when the government retains safety oversight authority over a contractor,enforcement of safety obligations is not a discretionary function that medical judgments are not covered by the discretionary functions exception and that the government negligence in this case was too egregious to be rooted in the policy considerations that the discretionary function exception is intended to protect.
