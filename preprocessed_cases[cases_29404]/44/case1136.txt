opinion of the court 
the committee of unsecured creditors the committee on behalf of the estate of the lemington home for the aged the home appeals the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants,the officers and directors of the home,on the committee breach of fiduciary duty and deepening insolvency claims.the district court found that summary judgment was appropriate because the business judgment rule and the doctrine of in pari delicto barred recovery on the breach of fiduciary duty claims,and because the committee was unable to demonstrate a material issue of fact concerning whether the defendants committed the fraud necessary to support a claim of deepening insolvency.because our independent review of the record discloses genuine disputes of material facts on all claims,we will vacate and remand for trial.
the home,a nonprofit corporation,has a storied place in history.as the city of pittsburgh grew in influence as an industrial and manufacturing center in the century,its diverse population swelled.by,the city had a population of,a increase in just ten years.among this population were about african americans,mostly free blacks who had been born in the north,a few war migrants from the south,as well as some runaway slaves and their descendants.many of these people did not share in the industrial prosperity enveloping the city,struggling both to make ends meet and to secure the civil rights guaranteed to them by the constitution.
in,mary peck bond,a daughter of pittsburgh african american abolitionist and minister john peck,is said to have discovered that her friend,former slave and thencentenarian aunt peggy,was living alone in squalor in a damp basement.together with friends,bond worked to raise funds to provide a place of refuge for elderly members of the african american community.this effort first incarnation,the home for the aged and infirm colored women,was incorporated and dedicated on july.eventually,this facility would become known as the lemington home for the aged,also known as lemington center.the home was affiliated with lemington elder care services,with which it had an interlocking board of directors.in,the home was relocated to a facility on lincoln avenue in pittsburgh,and expanded to about beds.
almost immediately from the time of its relocation in,the home was beset with financial troubles.in its first year at the new facility,the home operated at a loss of.although an initial projection had indicated that the home would profit,this was based on the center being aggressively marketed to produce a more even mix of medicare,medicaid,and private pay patients.id.at.instead,of the home patients receiv ed medicaid,medicare and private payors.id.
this stagnation continued through the and into the.because the home financial condition was rapidly deteriorating,the city of pittsburgh,allegheny county,and several private foundations periodically assisted to keep the home in operation.by late,the home was again maintaining its own operations,but had million in deferred mortgage debt.
unfortunately,the home financial condition again deteriorated.the department of health and human services implemented a ban on new admissions in september.a comprehensive plan formulated at the home direction by hershberg salter associates in found that the home had image problems within the community,and recommended,among other things,that it should hire an administrator,a quality human resources staff,and outside specialists.id.at.
defendant melody causey was hired as the home administrator in september.by,the home was insolvent.going concern accompanied audits for fiscal years and as of june,the home total liabilities exceeded total assets by,and total liabilities exceeded total assets by at the end of the fiscal year.in,a study funded by the pittsburgh foundation recommended that the board replace causey with a qualified,seasoned nursing home administrator,and review,revamp and each department.the foundation provided a grant of more than to hire a new administrator.causey,however,decided to use the grant for other purposes.
in december of,defendant james shealey became the home chief financial officer.shealey failed to maintain a general ledger,and the home financial and billing records were in deplorable condition.in march of,the board was informed that employee insurance premiums were not paid even though payroll deductions had been made for that purpose.
beginning in,the home was cited for numerous deficiencies primarily as a result of staff failing to document services rendered.id.at.causey commented that we continue to employ staff that should no longer be employed by our organization and in the last eighteen months,the nursing department alone caused the facility to receive nursing care deficiencies.id.at.according to causey,in april or may,she informed the board of directors that,due to health problems,she had been placed on work status by her physicians.according to her administrative assistant,she was absent from the home for periods of up to six or eight weeks at a time.she was not replaced,although state law required the home to employ a,licensed administrator.
from november of to january of,the board position of treasurer was vacant.the treasurer was to chair the board finance committee.there is evidence that there was no meaningful oversight of the home financial operations during this period.
in may of,causey recommended that the home file for bankruptcy.the board opted to pursue other options at that time.one of the options was obtaining a loan from the lemington home fund,which was administered by the pittsburgh foundation.approval of the loan was conditioned upon the board having a viability study conducted.the board declined to pursue such a study.
the home problems came to a head on july,when resident terry norwood,who suffered from advanced diabetes,was found unresponsive without a pulse.although he had an advanced directive which specified that,if he ceased to breathe,he should be resuscitated,no such action was taken.instead,a nurse left a message on a physician pager.because of this death,the pennsylvania department of health cited the home for neglect,placed the home license on provisional status,and provided a day window for the home to correct its deficiencies.
the home accounting firm declined to continue to work for the home in the fall of due to of its bills.a medical records and billing consultant terminated her services in august of due to.
another resident,elaine carrington,died at the home on december,under circumstances suggesting neglect.because of this death,the pennsylvania department of health conducted another investigation.among other things,the department noted that a n administrator,or a designee,is not present on the premises on a hr.basis.in the administrator frequent absence,staff are confused as to whom is to be in charge of the pc unit.id.at.the department further noted that t he administrator failed to report the unusual death of resident ec on id.at and it determined that the administrator,mel causey,lack ed the qualifications,the knowledge of the pc regulations and the ability to direct staff to perform personal care services as required id.at.
at the time of these incidents,records indicate that the board itself was in disarray.minutes of board meetings were incomplete or.administrator causey noted in a deposition that minutes were never kept of executive sessions,at which compensation,among other issues,was discussed.attendance at board meetings was often below.although the board required a finance committee with the board treasurer as chairperson,the position of treasurer remained unfilled.instead,the board relied on the advice of chief financial officer shealey,although,as board chair arthur baldwin noted in his deposition,the board was aware as early as december that shealey was not maintaining financial records.
at its meeting on january,the board considered options in case a proposed merger with the university of pittsburgh medical center did not occur.the board considered two options bankruptcy and restructuring.at this meeting,the board voted to close the nursing home and assisted living entities,to retain eva mitchell,community services sic and,if possible,lemington residential corporation,and to continue pursuing upmc for a possible of lemington.id.at.
the board did not approve the filing of a bankruptcy petition for another three months.instead,at its january meeting,the board agreed to stop admissions to the nursing home and assisted living facility immediately.id.at.at this meeting,the board further noted that it was informed that mel causey ha d been working from home on a basis for several months and,as such,was not in control of the activities that were taking place at the facilities.id.the board voted to terminate causey.in march,the board hired elizabeth garrett as an administrator.the board informed garrett that,because it had decided to declare bankruptcy,the facility would not be receiving new patients.
handwritten notes from a board meeting held on march,indicate discussion of plans to transfer the home principal charitable asset,the lemington home fund,held by the pittsburgh foundation,to lemington elder care,an affiliated entity.the members of the home board were also directors of lemington elder care.by march,the pennsylvania department of health determined that the home deficiencies had been corrected.on march,a document called the lemington elder care transition action plan was created,which,among other things,provided for the lemington elder services restructuring process,to close lemington nursing home and assisted living facilities,obtain funding to assist with the transition and restructuring of lemington elder care,enlist all possible selling options of the lemington nursing home and assisted living facility,conduct bankruptcy filing of lemington nursing home assisted living entities,and restructure lemington elder care to include community services,eva mitchell and hud project.id.at.consistent with the plan to shift the home principal charitable asset to lemington elder care,on may,chairperson baldwin drafted a letter to be signed by the pennsylvania secretary of aging,requesting that the pittsburgh foundation provide 
financial assistance to be used by lemington center for legal counsel,communications support,insurance and the services of a turnaround expert in order to orchestrate a caring,orderly and safe transition for its nursing home and assisted living residents as lemington center discontinues nursing home and assisted living services and works through bankruptcy reorganization.
on april,the home filed a voluntary chapter petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania.the committee of unsecured creditors was appointed two weeks later.in early may,terrence brown was hired by one of lemington creditors to investigate the company financial situation.according to brown report,shealey admitted that the general ledger and accounting system had not been maintained for some time because of lack of staff and trained staff.id.at.furthermore,brown reported that he was unable to obtain records of any checks written,deposits made,bank statements or bank statement reconciliations for any month of the current fiscal year i do know that accounting records problems go back to at least november and i do not know if the accounting system itself was maintained after november.id.at.importantly,brown also related that t he billing clerk also admitted and shealey confirmed that no medicare billings had been submitted to medicare since at least august i estimate that during this period there were approximately unbilled medicare patient days.id.
on june,the bankruptcy court directed the debtor in possession to obtain a viability study from primuscare,a company previously hired by the debtor.in its report dated june,primuscare first noted that t he facility can not operate in its current condition and without an influx of anticipated medicare recovery funds would be insolvent by the beginning of august claim recovery efforts are currently underway.id.at.among other things,primuscare further opined that 
t he overall knowledge of the department heads appears to be limited.many have been placed into positions without solid training on the main functions of their duties.basic internal controls are missing in many key areas including census tracking,accounts receivable,accounts payable,payroll,and resident trust accounts without these key internal controls in place the facility is unable to monitor and track financial performance.
primuscare also highlighted a number of positive factors for the home,including a high local population of senior citizens,support from local government officials and families,and local hospital interest in referring patients to the home.consequently,primuscare concluded,if the home improved its image,recruited and developed qualified staff,and secured approximately million in working capital needed to make necessary reforms,it could achieve the occupancy rate necessary to continue operations.primuscare suggested that some of the necessary funding could be obtained by,among other things,collecting approximately in unpaid medicare reimbursements,appealing to government sources for rate relief,and the home debt structure and the collective bargaining agreement.notably,primuscare recommended that board members with,long term care management experience should be added,that e ngaging a seasoned,long term care management company with local and diverse management experience is essential,and that r ecruitment of key personnel with tremendous experience is vital.
the home delayed filing its monthly operating reports for may and june until september.if they had been filed,they would have shown that the home received nearly million in nursing home assessment tax payments.
at a bankruptcy status conference held on june,no one expressed any interest in funding or acquiring the home.consequently,the bankruptcy court approved closure of the home and the transfer of its residents to other facilities.
on november,the bankruptcy judge granted the committee motion to commence an adversary proceeding against the home directors and officers.on august,the official committee of unsecured creditors filed its second amended complaint on behalf of the debtor,asserting causes of action against the directors and officers for breach of the fiduciary duties of care and loyalty and for deepening insolvency.on september,the directors and officers filed a joint motion for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted the motion,finding that the business judgment rule and the doctrine of in pari delicto applied to preclude the committee breach of fiduciary duty claims.the district court also found that,even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the committee,the committee would be unable to show that there was fraud necessary to support a claim of deepening insolvency.this appeal followed 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.official committee of unsecured creditors of allegheny health,educ.and research found.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp,cir.summary judgment is governed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides that t he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.a material fact is a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby.for an issue to be genuine,all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties differing versions of the truth at trial.id.at quoting first national bank of arizona cities serv,internal quotation marks omitted.
because appellants have brought claims for breach of fiduciary duty as well as for deepening insolvency,we will examine whether summary judgment is appropriate for each of these in turn.
pennsylvania law,which codifies the fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers of a corporation,provides as follows for directors 
a director of a nonprofit corporation shall stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation and shall perform his duties as a director in good faith,in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.in performing his duties,a director shall be entitled to rely in good faith on information,opinions,reports or statements,including financial statements and other financial data,in each case prepared or presented by any of the following one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.counsel,public accountants or other persons as to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert competence of such person b effect of actual knowledge.a director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause his reliance to be unwarranted.
ann.a b.the standard of care for officers is set forth as follows 
a n officer shall perform his duties as an officer in good faith,in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.
id.c.these fiduciary duties are owed not only to the corporation and its shareholders,but also to the creditors of an insolvent entity.see citicorp venture capital,comm.of creditors holding unsecured claims.cir.certainly,then,it is material whether the directors reliance upon the information provided by one or more officers or employees was in good faith,and whether there was a reasonable basis for relying upon officers and employees of the corporation.it is likewise material whether the officers have exercised reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence in performing their duties.
in support of its claim of a breach of the duty of due care,the committee contends that the board relied on administrator causey judgment,notwithstanding that it was aware that she was working in violation of requirements,and had a string of deficiencies on her watch.furthermore,the committee asserts that the board failed to follow its established governance structure in not appointing a treasurer and a finance committee.it thus did not discover shealey complete failure to maintain financial and billing records and his failure to bill medicare for over in payables during one year.the committee likewise argues that,by eschewing their responsibilities,causey and shealey breached their duty of due care.as to the duty of loyalty,the committee contends that the board and its officers breached their duty in that the board consciously chose to close the home so that the lemington home fund,a charitable lending source could be diverted to elder care another organization which had an interlocking board of directors with the lemington home,appellant br.at,and that the officers were dually employed by both the home and elder care,with cfo shealey allegedly commingling funds of the entities.
the evidence produced by the committee is such that a could conclude that the home directors did not have a reasonable basis to believe that causey and shealey were reliable and competent.in this regard,the evidence of the numerous deficiencies,the death of a resident in the summer of that resulted in the placement of the home license on probationary status,the staff and operational deficiencies noted in the primuscare report,the fact that members of the board knew that causey was not working full time,and shealey failure to maintain even rudimentary but essential accounting records would enable a to conclude that the directors had breached their fiduciary duty of care.this same evidence would support an inference that causey and shealey did not exercise such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.finally,the evidence presented by the committee pertaining to plans to divert the lemington home fund to lemington elder care suffices to create a triable issue on the duty of loyalty claim.
the district court,however,found that the business judgment rule as well as the doctrine of in pari delicto applied to shield the directors and officers from liability.we disagree,and will discuss each of these doctrines to illustrate why they are inapplicable here.
business judgment rule 
pennsylvania law provides that a bsent breach of fiduciary duty,lack of good faith or,any act as the board of directors,a committee of the board or an individual director shall be presumed to be in the best interests of the corporation.ann.d emphasis added.as explained in cuker mikalauskas,
the business judgment rule should insulate officers and directors from judicial intervention in the absence of fraud or,if challenged decisions were within the scope of the directors authority,if they exercised reasonable diligence,and if they honestly and rationally believed their decisions were in the best interests of the company.it is obvious that a court must examine the circumstances surrounding the decisions in order to determine if the conditions warrant application of the business judgment rule.
id.at.as we have observed,underlying the business judgment rule is the assumption that reasonable diligence has been used in reaching the decision which the rule is invoked to justify.miller american,cir.factors bearing on the board decision include whether the board was disinterested,whether it was assisted by counsel,whether it prepared a written report,whether it was independent,whether it conducted an adequate investigation,and whether it rationally believed its decision was in the best interests of the corporation.cuker,at.whether the duty of care has been met is a question of fact to be determined by an examination of all the circumstances in the case.wolf fried.
the district court relied upon the fact that the board was assisted by counsel,conducted several meetings,and pursued various options before approving the bankruptcy filing.to be sure,this is the type of evidence that could support application of the business judgment rule as a matter of law.but it is countered by evidence that the board received numerous red flags as to the competence and diligence of causey and shealey.the fact that the board eschewed a viability study also calls into question the adequacy of a investigation.and finally,there is the evidence that the directors favored lemington elder care over the home.where,as here,there is evidence to support a rational conclusion that the directors did not exercise reasonable diligence,application of the business judgment rule can not be decided on a summary judgment motion see keyser commonwealth fin.
in pari delicto 
in pari delicto,expressed in its most basic form,prohibits courts from lend ing their good offices to mediating disputes among wrongdoers.bateman eichler,hill richards,berner.for the doctrine of in pari delicto to apply in pennsylvania,the plaintiff must be an active,voluntary participant in the wrongful conduct or transaction s for which it seeks redress,and bear substantially equal or greater responsibility for the underlying illegality as compared to the defendant.official comm.of unsecured creditors of allegheny health educ.research found.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp,quoting bateman eichler,at.
with respect to in pari delicto in a bankruptcy context,the trustee stands in the shoes of the debtor and can only assert those causes of action possessed by the debtor.conversely,t he trustee is,of course,subject to the same defenses as could have been asserted by the defendant had the action been instituted by the debtor.official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir quoting hays merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
as the district court noted,however,there is an exception to the applicability of in pari delicto,when the action did not actually benefit the corporation.thus,although principals generally are responsible for the acts of age
