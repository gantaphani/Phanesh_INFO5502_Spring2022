harris filed the present lawsuit in saginaw county,michigan,circuit court,asserting claims for breach of trust,breach of duty,embezzlement,larceny,conversion,damage to personal property,and civil theft.defendant robinson removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan based upon diversity of citizenship and an amount in controversy in excess of.
on may,robinson moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the original diamond was returned.in support of its motion,robinson relied in substantial part upon the expert opinion of martin fuller,a certified gem appraiser.based upon his examination of the ring,fuller opined that the colorless,carat diamond currently mounted in harris ring is likely the original.
in opposing summary judgment,harris submitted her deposition testimony regarding the alleged color and size of her original center diamond.in addition,harris submitted affidavits of three witnesses essie washington,willie washington,and ann marie lewis easley.each of these witnesses swore,based upon personal knowledge,that harris original center diamond was pink in color.

all of harris claims rest upon the allegation that robinson replaced her large,pink diamond with a smaller,colorless diamond.harris contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the admissible record evidence establishes a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether plaintiff original diamond was replaced.upon review,we agree.
in opposing summary judgment,harris submitted her deposition testimony.when asked how she was able to discern that her center diamond had been replaced,she stated it was not the same color.it was not the same size.it was nothing like the one i took into the store that i had for years.this testimony alone is sufficient to create a jury question regarding the alleged replacement.see churchwell bluegrass marine,cir plaintiff testimony creates sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material facts.see also head glacier nw,cir a plaintiff testimony may suffice to establish a genuine issue of material fact.britton great lakes fleet,cir plaintiff testimony alone created a genuine issue of material fact.robinson also contends that harris testimony is,and therefore should not be considered by the court.we do not agree.a court may not disregard evidence merely because it serves the interests of the party introducing it.see niemi nhk spring,cir plaintiff affidavit,albeit arguably,is not no evidence.rushing.city ry,cir reversed on other grounds m erely claiming that the evidence is does not mean we can not consider it or that it is insufficient.
moreover,harris testimony was bolstered by the sworn affidavits of three witnesses.each of these witnesses contend,based upon personal observation,that harris original center diamond was pink in color.there is no dispute that the diamond presently mounted in harris ring is colorless.accordingly,this testimony,which must be viewed in the light most favorable to harris,supports the allegation that harris diamond was replaced robinson contends that the district court erred in considering the affidavit of ann marie lewis easley because harris failed to identify her as an individual with knowledge during discovery.however,as the magistrate noted,easley was named on harris witness list.because robinson was made aware of easley prior to summary judgment,the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to exclude her testimony.see tisdale fed.express,cir noting that an appellate court reviews a district court decision regarding discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion,considering in part prejudice suffered as a result of alleged discovery violation.

here,the testimony offered by harris regarding the perceived color of her original center diamond is not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge.rather,this testimony is based upon a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life,the observation and recognition of color.
in holding harris proffered witness testimony to be improper lay opinion,the district court noted that an opinion regarding the color of the diamond necessitates a conclusion that the ring contained a pink diamond,which evaluates the quality of the gem.however,the testimony submitted by harris was not offered to prove damages or the quality of her original diamond,nor to prove that the stone was truly pink,as the term is used in the diamond industry.instead,the evidence was submitted in support of plaintiff allegation that the diamond she left with robinson was not returned.
the recognition of color is well within the realm of ordinary experience to which a lay witness may testify indeed

i respectfully dissent.in matsushita electric industries zenith radio,the supreme court stated that on appellate review a summary judgment should be upheld w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.this is the quintessential example of such a case.
although in my view plaintiff pro se claims are nothing short of preposterous,that is not the test.a judge must ask himself not whether he thinks the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented.anderson liberty lobby.it is the application of this standard that informs my dissent.
according to plaintiff,in,her husband,in her presence,purchased for a gold wedding ring which she now alleges contained a carat pink diamond.the original sales slip for this purchase is part of the record.there is no indication on the sales slip as to size or color of the diamond nor did the salesmen make any representations about the diamond 
on august,some years later,plaintiff took the ring to a robinson jewelers for sizing.when she returned on august,to pick up the ring,plaintiff complained that the ring did not contain its original diamond claiming that the diamond now in the ring was too small and that it sparkled,splattered,and glittered too much.nothing was said about the original diamond being pink.plaintiff refused to take the ring home,but returned on august.on this date plaintiff now complained that the diamond had been switched again and was not the same diamond that was in the ring on august.on both occasions plaintiff was informed that all rings brought in for work are cleaned by machine which restores their original sparkle.this time,plaintiff left with the ring,again not making any reference to a pink diamond.
later in,the plaintiff contacted the attorney general office,the local police,and an attorney,none of whom pursued this matter.in the initial report to the police,plaintiff mentioned nothing about a pink diamond,but years later,in,she submitted an update to the police,and for the first time mentioned the diamond was pink.two months later she filed this pro se complaint in a michigan state court alleging that a carat,pink diamond had been taken from her ring and replaced with a smaller white stone.defendant removed the case to a federal court,where after referral to a magistrate judge,summary judgment was granted to defendant and this pro se appeal followed.
although i disagree with the majority analysis of the evidentiary issues,even if plaintiff evidence is deemed admissible she still can not prevail.by focusing only on the evidentiary rulings,the court misses the overarching principle of what is necessary for a plaintiff to defeat a motion for summary judgment.in the district court the defendant motion for summary judgment framed the issue as whether taking the record as a whole,any rational trier of fact could find for plaintiff an examination of the record taken as a whole demonstrates that no rational juror could make such a finding.
the first document in the record is plaintiff complaint.although some leeway is given to pro se pleadings,the rambling lengthy narrative filed by plaintiff is long on emotion but short on plausibility.the allegation that a large national jeweler would have sold her a rare,pink carat diamon
