while attending a cleveland indians baseball game,jeffrey swiecicki,along with several of his friends,loudly cheered for some players and heckled others.officer jose delgado,an police officer for the city of cleveland,was in full uniform and working for the ballpark as a security guard.he allegedly heard swiecicki using profane language.delgado asked swiecicki to halt his behavior or leave the stadium.when swiecicki did not respond,delgado placed swiecicki in the escort position and began leading him out of the bleachers.in the course of leaving the stadium,delgado arrested swiecicki and wrestled him to the ground.swiecicki was later charged with and convicted of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,but his convictions were overturned on appeal.see city of cleveland swiecicki,ohio app d,ohio.
he subsequently filed an action in federal district court pursuant to,alleging that delgado had violated his constitutional rights by arresting him based on the content of his speech,had effectuated the arrest without probable cause,and had used excessive force during the arrest.swiecicki also raised various claims.the district court granted summary judgment to delgado,holding that the statute of limitations had run on swiecicki claim,that delgado was entitled to qualified immunity on the remaining federal claims,that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim of malicious prosecution,and that swiecicki other claims should be dismissed without prejudice.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on september,swiecicki and several of his friends attended a cleveland indians baseball game at jacobs field.during the game,swiecicki heckled members of both teams,particularly those playing the left field position,and consumed two beers.
at all relevant times,delgado,a city of cleveland police officer,was working as a security guard and was stationed at a tunnel near the bleachers where swiecicki and his friends were seated.delgado was officially,but he was wearing his police uniform with his badge and was carrying the weapons issued by the police department.wilfred labrie,a host greeter for jacobs field,was assigned to a section near delgado.both of these men were hired to provide assistance and to monitor the fans behavior.
in conjunction with gateway economic development corporation gateway,the owner of jacobs field,the indians promulgated various rules and regulations to govern fan behavior.the rule relevant to the present case provides as follows 
fan behavior persons using obscene or abusive language,or engaging in any other antisocial conduct offensive to those around them,will be asked by cleveland indians personnel to cease this conduct.if the offensive conduct persists,those involved will be subject to ejection from the ballpark.
although the rule prohibits offensive or abusive language,no similar rule prohibits loud yelling,heckling,or booing.swiecicki admits that he led a group of fans in various heckles and cheers.he also contends that almost the entire bleachers were yelling.
around the seventh inning,both delgado and labrie allegedly heard loud,profane language coming from the bleachers.delgado claims that he heard swiecicki yell branyon,you suck and branyon,you have a fat ass.swiecicki admits to loud heckling,but denies that he used profane language.although swiecicki also denies that he was intoxicated,delgado contends that he saw swiecicki with a beer in his hand at the time of the offensive comments.labrie,however,testified that neither the bleachers nor swiecicki were directly visible from where labrie and delgado were stationed.
based upon delgado perception of swiecicki comments and realizing that swiecicki might be intoxicated,delgado approached swiecicki and told him to cut it out.swiecicki did not respond.although no fan specifically requested that delgado take action to stop swiecicki behavior,delgado alleges that a man with a young daughter later thanked delgado for asking swiecicki to lower his voice.after again motioning to swiecicki to halt his behavior with no success,delgado told swiecicki we can either do this the easy way or the hard way.swiecicki then approached delgado.delgado moved toward swiecicki,grabbed his arm and shirt to place him into the escort position,and led him towards the tunnel to exit the stadium.
while delgado was escorting swiecicki through the tunnel,swiecicki asked delgado on more than occasions what he had done to prompt delgado actions.delgado provided no response.swiecicki brother scott,along with three other men,began to follow delgado,also asking delgado what swiecicki had done wrong.at this point,delgado alleges that swiecicki jerked his arm away to break from delgado grasp.swiecicki denies any physical resistance.delgado then used an arm bar and wrestled swiecicki to the ground,with swiecicki hitting his head on a door before falling to his knees.on the ground,delgado pushed swiecicki face into the concrete and continued to apply pressure to his right arm despite swiecicki pained expression.delgado then told swiecicki that he was under arrest.
swiecicki was later charged with aggravated disorderly conduct pursuant to cleveland codified ordinance and with resisting arrest pursuant to cleveland codified ordinance.he was found guilty by the cleveland municipal court of the offense of disorderly conduct and of resisting arrest.the ohio court of appeals,however,reversed his convictions based on insufficiency of the evidence.see swiecicki,ohio app d at.
swiecicki then filed the present suit in federal district court pursuant to,alleging that delgado had violated his constitutional rights by arresting him based on the content of his speech in violation of the first amendment,without probable cause in violation of the fourth amendment,and through the use of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.swiecicki also accused delgado of assault,battery,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution,all in violation of ohio law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of delgado,holding that qualified immunity acts as a complete bar to all of swiecicki federal claims.it also granted summary judgment to delgado on the claim and dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the statute of limitations as applied to swiecicki fourth amendment claim 
swiecicki first argues that the district court erred in holding that his fourth amendment claim was barred by the statute of limitations.the district court determination is a question of law that we review de novo.wolfe perry,cir reversing a district court determination that the complaint was filed after the statute of limitations had run.because congress did not specify a statute of limitations for claims made pursuant to,we must borrow the statute of limitations governing personal injury claims in ohio.banks city of whitehall,cir holding that federal courts must borrow the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state in which the section action was brought.the appropriate statute of limitations in this case is two years.see id.when the statute of limitations begins to run depends on the nature of the claim under.heck humphrey,d holding that a claim for malicious prosecution does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff favor.
typically,the statute of limitations for filing an action based on excessive force begins to run at the time the injury is discovered,which in most cases is at the time of the arrest.if,however,a cause of action under would necessarily imply the invalidity of the plaintiff underlying criminal conviction,the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the underlying conviction is reversed or expunged.shamaeizadeh cunigan,cir holding that the statute of limitations for a criminal defendant claim did not begin to run until the underlying criminal proceedings had concluded in his favor.swiecicki filed his complaint on december,more than two years after his arrest but just over one year after his underlying convictions were reversed.the key inquiry,then,is whether swiecicki claim pursuant to would have implied the invalidity of his criminal convictions.
this court has previously held,in an unpublished decision,that a claim of excessive force does not necessarily relate to the validity of the underlying conviction and therefore may be immediately cognizable.hodge city of elyria,cir holding that the statute of limitations began to run at the time of arrest because hodge conviction related to drug possession and tampering with evidence was wholly unrelated to excessive force.the district court below seized on this holding and,with no further analysis,declared that swiecicki claim was barred by the statute of limitations.what the district court failed to recognize,however,is that in order to determine whether the claim would imply the invalidity of the offense,the court must look both to the claims raised under and to the specific offenses for which the claimant was convicted.hughes lott,cir emphasis added interpreting heck,at.see also heck.suggesting that the statute of limitations for a claim based on an unreasonable seizure would not begin to run until the plaintiff underlying conviction for resisting arrest had been overturned because,in order to prevail on his claim,the plaintiff would have to negate an element of the particular offense for which he was convicted.hodge is therefore not dispositive both because it is unpublished and because the underlying offenses in hodge were unrelated to the claim of excessive force.
cleveland ordinance provides that n o person,recklessly or by force,shall resist or interfere with a lawful arrest of himself or another.cleveland cod.ord.a conviction for resisting arrest thus requires that the underlying arrest be lawful.this court has held in an unpublished opinion that such a conviction necessarily includes a finding that the police officer did not use excessive force.see white ebie,wl,at cir analyzing the relationship between a conviction for resisting arrest pursuant to the applicable ohio statute and a claim of excessive force pursuant to.the white court relied on ohio law,which provides that an arrest is not lawful if the arresting officer uses excessive force.see also city of columbus fraley,ohio,ohio i n the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer,a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows,or has good reason to believe,is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties emphasis added.we agree with white analysis.
white and the ohio rule of law on which it relies,then,suggest that swiecicki claim under would have necessarily implied the invalidity of his conviction for resisting indicating that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until swiecicki convictions were overturned.in city of cleveland murad,ohio app d,ohio,however,the eighth district of the ohio court of appeals,which includes cleveland,limited the rule announced in fraley to cases in which the excessive force by the arresting officer occurred prior to the suspect resistance.because the suspect in murad admitted that he resisted arrest so forcefully that it took three officers and a civilian to subdue him,the court concluded that the suspect himself was the cause of the force used in his arrest.id.
the murad court thus upheld the suspect conviction for resisting arrest,rejecting the argument that his resistance preceding the force used to arrest him was justifiable.see also city of columbus purdie,wl,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,unpublished upholding a defendant conviction for resisting arrest where the use of force by police was in response to the conduct of defendant emphasis added.in other words,murad implies that in some cases a conviction may stand even if excessive force was used after the suspect resistance.
a synthesis of these cases indicates that we must consider the nature and extent,if any,of swiecicki resistance,paying particular attention to whether swiecicki alleged resistance occurred prior to the alleged use of excessive force by delgado.if,as swiecicki claims,delgado use of force was essentially unprovoked,the rule from white,wl,at,provides that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until swiecicki convictions were overturned by the ohio court of appeals.ohio law,as interpreted by white,explicitly provides that a lawful arrest is a necessary element of a conviction for resisting arrest.id.on that basis,swiecicki claim pursuant to would have necessarily implied the invalidity of his conviction for resisting arrest because if the amount of force used was unlawful,an essential element of the underlying offense for resisting arrest would have been negated.see heck,at.explaining that a plaintiff can not bring a claim if he would have to negate an element of the underlying offense for which he has been convicted.the statute of limitations,under swiecicki version of the facts,therefore did not begin to run until the ohio court of appeals invalidated his convictions.
on the other hand,if swiecicki did in fact jerk his arm away from delgado grasp,the analysis from murad suggests that the statute of limitations for swiecicki claim began to run at the time of his arrest.the key question is one of timing.if swiecicki resisted,jerked his arm away,and if the resistance occurred before the use of force by delgado,his conviction for resisting arrest would not be called into question even if he later recovered on a claim.under these circumstances,the statute of limitations would have began to run at the moment of swiecicki arrest.see shamaeizadeh,at.
our evaluation of the issue,however,requires us to consider the facts as swiecicki has alleged them.see,at noting that the seventh,eighth,and eleventh circuits have created a general exception to the heck doctrine for fourth amendment claims brought against state officials pursuant to,but that the sixth circuit employs a approach.in order for swiecicki to prevail on his claim as he has alleged it,he must prove that delgado employed excessive force without provocation.success on his claim prior to the invalidation of his conviction by the ohio court of appeals,therefore,would have necessarily implied the invalidity of his conviction for resisting arrest.see white,wl,at fraley,at.if swiecicki had brought his claim before such reversal,the district court would have had to dismiss it as.see heck,at.in order to prevail in this action,he would have had to negate an element of the offense of which he has been convicted t he action will not lie.we therefore hold that the statute of limitations for swiecicki claim did not begin to run until the ohio court of appeals overturned his conviction.
we recognize,as judge sutton points out in his concurrence on this issue,that some claims would not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction for resisting arrest.on these particular facts,however,that is not the case.the specific language of the cleveland ordinance requiring that the arrest be lawful in order to convict in combination with the applicable ohio caselaw where a finding of excessive force invalidates the lawfulness of an arrest dictates the result here.swiecicki success on his claim would therefore necessarily imply the invalidity of his ohio conviction for resisting arrest.thus,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until swiecicki conviction was overturned.
delgado status as a state actor 
the district court also held that delgado was not acting under color of state law until he actually placed swiecicki under arrest.swiecicki,on the other hand,argues that delgado was acting under color of state law during the entire incident,and that the district court erroneously relied on disputed material facts in making its decision.
to state a claim under,the plaintiff must show that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.redding eward,cir.delgado,to be liable under,must have exercised power made possible only because he was clothed with the authority of state law.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.
whether a police officer like delgado was acting under the color of state law poses a difficult question that depends on the nature of the act performed,not the clothing of the actor or even the status of being on duty id.citation and quotation marks omitted.relevant considerations include whether the officer flashed a badge,identified himself as an officer,or arrested or threatened to arrest someone.parks city of columbus,cir holding that an police officer acted under color of state law when he threatened a citizen with arrest at a local festival.
the parties agree that delgado was at the time of the incident,even though he was wearing his police uniform and carrying his official weapons.as indicated by redding,however,the nature of the act,rather than delgado clothing,informs the analysis.redding,at.we must therefore consider delgado behavior during the course of the incident,making sure to view the facts in the light most favorable to swiecicki at this stage of the case.see matsushita,at.
swiecicki alleges that delgado used police procedures and was therefore a state actor during the entire incident.according to swiecicki and several witnesses,delgado grabbed swiecicki by the shirt and arm to escort him,and delgado himself admits that he put swiecicki in the escort position before forcibly removing him from the bleachers.the district court failed to acknowledge swiecicki version of the facts,holding that a lthough officer delgado may have been acting as a private actor when he began escorting jeffrey swiecicki out of the stadium pursuant to the rules and regulations of jacobs field,he asserted his official state power when he placed jeffrey swiecicki under arrest.despite this broad pronouncement,the district court never articulated why it concluded that delgado was not a state actor when he first escorted swiecicki out of the stands.
here,we believe the record establishes that delgado was a state actor from the beginning of the incident in question because he presented himself as a police officer.parks,at.our conclusion is based not only on delgado attire,badge,and weapons,but also on the fact that delgado told swiecicki that w e can either do this the easy way or the hard way.we recognize that these words,standing alone,would not necessarily rise to the level of a threatened arrest.after all,if a private citizen like labrie,or a fellow indians fan,had warned swiecicki in a similar manner,no threat of arrest would have been present.and if delgado had simply asked swiecicki to calm down or risk being ejected from the game,we would be unable to conclude that delgado acted under color of state law.see watkins oaklawn jockey club,cir holding that an deputy sheriff who worked as a security guard at a race track was not acting under color of state law when he ejected a patron because the deputy sheriff acted in the same manner that a civilian employee of the track would have acted.
but we are required to consider all of the relevant circumstances.see parks,at a ll of these factors combined create the presumption of state action.rather than calmly asking swiecicki to leave the stadium,delgado,while wearing his uniform and carrying his official weapons,threatened swiecicki and forcibly removed him from the bleachers.this evidence,combined with the fact that delgado was hired by jacobs field to intervene in cases requiring police action suggests that his warning to swiecicki amounted to a threat of arrest.delgado apparently believed,moreover,that the incident was one requiring police action because he approached swiecicki before labrie had a chance to further investigate.in sum,this was more than a case in which a civilian employed by the indians peaceably ejected an unruly fan from a baseball procedure clearly contemplated by the rules and regulations of jacobs field.delgado,in full police uniform,forcibly removed swiecicki in the escort position.
all of this evidence,when considered together,indicates that delgado was acting under color of state law at the time he removed swiecicki from the bleachers.see id.at holding that the police officer was a state actor because he was in uniform,identified himself as an officer,and threatened arrest see also villegas city of gilroy,d,holding that an police officer who ejected citizens from a festival held at a public park acted under color of state law because her presence was intended to give some air of authority as a police officer and because she had an active hand assisting in enforcing the dress code policy by intimidating plaintiffs into leaving the festival.quotation marks omitted.but see herrera chisox,c,wl,at,unpublished holding that deputy sheriffs did not act under color of state law when they allegedly arrested herrera at a chicago whitesox game because the deputy sheriffs were not wearing their uniforms,did not carry official weapons,filed a whitesox incident report rather than an arrest report,and did not accompany officers of the chicago police department who took herrera to the police station.
delgado status as a state actor continued as he escorted swiecicki through the tunnel.after removing swiecicki from the bleachers,delgado formally placed swiecicki under arrest,wrestled him to the ground using the technique,and attempted to handcuff him.such actions were clearly carried out with the authority of state law.redding,at.we therefore hold that delgado was a state actor for the duration of the incident.see layne sampley,cir holding that the question of whether someone acted under the color of state law may be determined as a matter of law unless there remain unanswered questions of fact for the jury to decide.
d.the law of qualified immunity 
we will review the denial of summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity de novo because application of this doctrine is a question of law.mccloud testa,cir.but to the extent that there is disagreement about the facts,we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,taking all inferences in his favor.champion outlook nashville,cir.
in determining whether a law enforcement officer is shielded from civil liability due to qualified immunity,this court typically employs a analysis whether,considering the allegations in a light most favorable to the party injured,a constitutional right has been violated,and whether that right was clearly established.estate of carter city of detroit,cir citing saucier katz,d.in addition to the two steps listed above,this court occasionally performs a third step in the qualified immunity analysis.see estate of carter,at panels of this court occasionally employ a qualified immunity analysis,as opposed to the analysis set forth here b oth the approach and the approach can be said to capture the holding of saucier.citations omitted.when utilized,this third step requires inquiry into whether the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.champion,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court since saucier has continued to use the approach to qualified immunity,but this court has noted that the approach may in some cases increase the clarity of the proper analysis.see estate of carter,at.if,on the other hand,the case at issue is one of the many cases where,if the right is clearly established,the conduct at issue would also be objectively unreasonable,then this court has collapse d the second and third prongs in an effort to avoid duplicative analysis.caudill hollan,cir.
throughout the analysis,the burden is on swiecicki to show that delgado is not entitled to qualified immunity.see silberstein city of dayton,cir once the qualified immunity defense is raised,the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.the district court in the present case utilized the typical analysis and assumed that swiecicki constitutional rights were violated,but concluded that delgado was nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity.on appeal,swiecicki claims that delgado did not have probable cause to make the arrest,and violated his clearly established first amendment rights by arresting swiecicki based on the content of his speech.
swiecicki claim 
in order for the arrest to survive constitutional scrutiny,delgado must have had probable cause to believe that swiecicki committed the offenses charged.see hunter bryant,d holding that the defendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to make the arrest.in determining whether delgado had probable cause to arrest swiecicki for disorderly conduct,we must decide whether,at that moment of the arrest,the facts and circumstances within his knowledge and of which he had reasonably trusty information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.beck ohio,d.
probable cause is an issue of fact for the jury to resolve if there are any genuine issues of material fact that are relevant to the inquiry.see john hickey,cir holding that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.an officer may not base his determination on speech protected by the first amendment.see sandul larion,cir.but to the extent that probable cause existed for either of swiecicki charges disorderly conduct or resisting arrest,the arrest was lawful with respect to the requirement.see lyons city of xenia,cir granting qualified immunity to the defendant officers on the plaintiff claim.
the offense of disorderly conduct is defined in the city of cleveland code,with the relevant portions set forth below 
disorderly conduct intoxication 
b no person,while voluntarily intoxicated shall do either of the following 
in a public place or in the presence of two or more persons,engage in conduct likely to be offensive or to cause inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm to persons of ordinary sensibilities,which conduct the offender,if he were not intoxicated,should know is likely to have such effect on others 
cleveland cod.ord.section therefore requires that delgado not only had probable cause to believe that swiecicki was engaging in offensive or alarming behavior,but also that he was intoxicated.see id.
as discussed above,the first step in the qualified immunity analysis is to determine whether swiecicki has sufficiently alleged a constitutional violation.in determining whether delgado had probable cause to arrest swiecicki,we must focus only on those facts within delgado knowledge at the moment swiecicki was arrested.see hunter,at.holding that the inquiry focuses on facts within the arresting officer knowledge at the time of the arrest.we are still required,however,to consider the facts in the light most favorable to swiecicki.see champion,at.
swiecicki argues that his heckling was not so offensive as to give delgado probable cause to believe that swiecicki was violating the disorderly conduct ordinance.he denies that he used profane language,and he further argues that the content,the underlying message of his speech would have been protected by the first amendment even if profane.see chaplinsky new hampshire.holding that the only type of language denied first amendment protection is fighting words see also city of paul,d clarifying chaplinsky and holding that even though a particular mode of speech such as fighting words may not be protected by the first amendment,the underlying message still receives first amendment protection.delgado therefore lacked probable cause to arrest swiecicki if delgado based his decision on protected speech.see sandul,at holding that an officer could not rely solely on protected speech to establish probable cause.the record suggests such a motivation because delgado himself indicated that he responded to swiecicki foul language.
even though delgado did not have probable cause to arrest swiecicki based on the content of his speech,we next consider whether the manner of swiecicki speech was sufficient to lead delgado to believe that probable cause existed.the district court held that a reasonable police officer could have believed that there was probable cause based on jeffrey swiecicki loud and rowdy manner to support an arrest for aggravated disorderly conduct.because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to swiecicki manner of speech,this legal conclusion by the district court is not supported by the record.swiecicki denies that his behavior was inappropriately loud or offensive,and the parties agree that no one actually complained about his behavior.although swiecicki admits that he was leading the crowd of hecklers,the record establishes that the fans were really excited at that particular game and that almost everyone in the stands was shouting.jacobs field,moreover,encourages fans to cheer and make noise,meaning that loud or even rowdy behavior was commonplace at games.see swiecicki,ohio app d at.
taking the facts and circumstances in the light most favorable to swiecicki,delgado did not have probable cause to believe that the manner of swiecicki speech rose to a level prohibited by the disorderly conduct ordinance.see spokane mcdonough,interpreting a similar statute and holding that conduct that is offensive to a person of ordinary sensibilities in one setting might be perfectly acceptable in other settings.we therefore have no need to consider whether delgado had probable cause to believe that swiecicki was intoxicated.
turning to swiecicki other offense,cleveland ordinance provides no person,recklessly or by force,shall resist or interfere with a lawful arrest of himself or another.cleveland cod.ord.a.delgado alleges that swiecicki jerked his arm away while delgado was escorting him out of the stadium,but swiecicki claims that his protests were verbal only.rather than taking the facts in the light most favorable to swiecicki,the district court held that swiecicki arm movement could have been interpreted by a reasonable officer as an attempt to resist arrest.the district court thus improperly concluded that delgado was entitled to qualified immunity.
cleveland ordinance requires a lawful arrest on the underlying charge in order to sustain a conviction for resisting arrest.cleveland cod.ord.the above analysis indicates that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether delgado had probable cause to arrest swiecicki for the underlying offense of disorderly conduct.swiecicki fourth amendment right to be free from an arrest without probable cause was clearly established at the time of his arrest in.we therefore reverse the district court grant of qualified immunity to delgado on this fourth amendment claim.
swiecicki first amendment claim 
swiecicki also alleges that delgado impermissibly arrested him for saying branyon,you suck and branyon,you have a fat ass,and for verbally protesting his arrest.the district court acknowledged that i f officer delgado arrested jeffrey swiecicki even partially because of the content of his speech,then officer delgado would have violated jeffrey swiecicki constitutional right to freedom of speech.after assuming without discussion that swiecicki had alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate a constitutional violation,the court went on to hold that the right was not clearly established.
in so doing,the district court failed in its duty to resolve the preliminary issue of the constitutional violation before proceeding to the second step of the qualified immunity analysis.see saucier,at.i f a constitutional violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.emphasis added.although we could remand the case in order for the district court to properly determine this issue,we instead will make the determination ourselves in light of the completeness of the record and in the interests of judicial economy.see beaty united states,cir opting to resolve an issue not decided below because the record is complete,and it would be a waste of everyone time to remand to the district court what can be decided now as a matter of law.
delgado first argues that swiecicki first amendment protections did not apply in jacobs field,which he alleges is a private park.in support of this proposition,delgado contends that the game ticket was a license that jacobs field could revoke at will,and that a private entity acting on its own can not deprive a citizen of first amendment rights.we are not persuaded.swiecicki does not challenge either the rule or the authority of jacobs field officials to eject him from the game.instead,he challenges delgado decision as a state actor to threaten and later actually arrest him for an alleged violation of city ordinances.we therefore hold that swiecicki first amendment protections apply.
swiecicki heckling 
the supreme court in chaplinsky held that fighting words receive very limited first amendment protection because they are of such slight social value as a step to the truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.at.fighting words were defined in chaplinsky as those by which their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.id.in,the supreme court clarified the scope of first amendment protection afforded fighting words when it held that because the underlying message expressed by the fighting words is protected by the first amendment even though the nonspeech element is not,any government regulation must be.at.with regard to government regulation,this court has previously held that unless the speech in question constitutes fighting words,it can not serve as the basis for a violation of municipal ordinances.see sandul,at.the first amendment therefore provides expansive protection of swiecicki speech unless he uttered fighting words.
contrary to the law of this circuit,the district court improperly considered the facts in the light most favorable to delgado rather than to swiecicki in determining that delgado was entitled to qualified immunity.see champion,at.the district court,for example,relied on delgado testimony that there was a man with a young girl who appeared to be disturbed by swiecicki comments,and that the man thanked the officer for requesting that swiecicki stop heckling the players.based on this testimony,the district court held that delgado actions were reasonable given the loudness and disruptiveness of swiecicki heckling and the apparent discomfort of other patrons.
swiecicki contends,however,that he was heckling in a manner similar to other fans at the game,and he maintains that he did not use profane language.delgado interaction with the man and his young daughter is similarly disputed,with swiecicki claiming that there were no children seated near him in the bleachers.the district court clearly erred in basing its holding on facts disputed by swiecicki.
if,as swiecicki alleges,delgado arrested him based on the content of his heckling,then the arrest constituted a violation of swiecicki first amendment rights.see sandul,at.there is also no evidence in the record that swiecicki heckling rose to the level of fighting words.branyon,the player who was the subject of swiecicki comments,apparently did not hear swiecicki jeers.nor is there any evidence that other fans,even if they were offended by the jeers,were incited to become violent.see chaplinsky,at.because his heckling did not provoke the type of lawless action referred to in chaplinsky,the first amendment provided protection for swiecicki words.
based on our conclusion that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether delgado committed a constitutional violation in arresting swiecicki,we now consider whether swiecicki first amendment protection was clearly established at the time of the arrest.chaplinsky,at,plainly held that speech does not lose its first amendment protection unless it constitutes fighting words.this court decision in sandul,at,similarly makes clear that the content of swiecicki speech could not serve as the basis for a violation of cleveland disorderly conduct ordinance.swiecicki first amendment right to free speech was thus clearly established at the time of delgado actions in question.we therefore reverse the grant of qualified immunity awarded to delgado on this issue.
swiecicki verbal protests 
with regard to swiecicki verbal protests during his forcible removal from the game and subsequent arrest,this court held in mccurdy montgomery county,cir,that t here can be no doubt that the freedom to express disagreement with state action,without fear of reprisal based on the expression,is unequivocally among the protections provided by the first amendment.the freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.city of houston hill,d.
on the basis of mccurdy,hill,and the discussion above regarding chaplinsky,swiecicki verbal protests during his arrest are protected by the first amendment unless they rose to the level of fighting words.see also barnes wright,cir holding that in order to state a successful first amendment retaliation claim under,the plaintiff must prove a lack of probable cause for his arrest.police officers like delgado,moreover,are expected to exercise greater restraint in their response than the average citizen.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.delgado does not challenge these general tenets.instead,he claims that his decision to arrest swiecicki was not based on swiecicki verbal protests.
in holding that there were grounds for the resisting arrest charge that involved physical action and had nothing to do with the content of jeffrey swiecicki speech,the district court took as true delgado testimony that swiecicki physically jerked his arm away from delgado.the district court in doing so failed to consider swiecicki contention that he did not pull his arm away during the arrest and that delgado instead acted in response to swiecicki verbal protests.if based on swiecicki version of the facts,in which no physical resistance occurred,the arrest could only have been the result of swiecicki constituting a constitutional violation.see mccurdy,at,holding that an officer violated the plaintiff first amendment rights where the arrest was based on the plaintiff verbal challenge of what the f k do you want see also greene barber,cir holding that the first amendment prohibited a police officer from retaliating against a plaintiff who called him an a hole.
given the relatively tame nature of swiecicki verbal protests in comparison to those in mccurdy and greene,one might reasonably question whether delgado decision to arrest swiecicki was based on swiecicki protests alone.we are nevertheless required to accept swiecicki version of the facts at the summary judgment stage of this case,which leaves his verbal protests as the only basis for delgado actions.because delgado would have lacked probable cause to arrest swiecicki under these circumstances,and because swiecicki right to verbally protest his arrest was clearly established at the time of the arrest in question,we reverse the district court grant of qualified immunity regarding swiecicki first amendment claim.
e.the dismissal of swiecicki claims
