at issue in this appeal is the scope of north carolina general statutes section,which at the relevant time provided 
unless otherwise provided by statute,for personal injury or physical damage to claimant property,the cause of action,except in causes of actions referred to in c,shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his property becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,whichever event first occurs.provided that no cause of action shall accrue more than years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action.
the supreme court of north carolina has explained that this statute establishes what is commonly referred to as the discovery rule,which tolls the running of the statute of limitations for torts resulting in certain latent injuries,although such actions remain subject to the year statute of repose provision.misenheimer burris.
appellant kent stahle was diagnosed with leukemia.he subsequently brought a complaint against appellee cts corporation cts.stahle alleges that cts was responsible for dumping toxic solvents from an manufacturing plant into a local stream,and that childhood exposure to the contaminated stream water many years ago caused his leukemia.the district court dismissed stahle complaint,holding that the statute of repose in section barred his action.
we disagree.the supreme court of north carolina has not yet directly resolved whether section applies to disease claims.as a federal court sitting in diversity faced with an unresolved question of state law,we must predict how the question would be decided by that state highest court.because we understand that under north carolina law a disease is not a latent injury,we conclude that the supreme court of north carolina would not find section applicable to stahle claim.accordingly,we reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
cts is a delaware corporation that was licensed to do business in north carolina.cts purportedly owned cts of asheville,cts of asheville,a north carolina corporation.from to,cts of asheville operated a manufacturing facility in buncombe county,north carolina.as part of its manufacturing operations,cts of asheville used various toxic solvents,including trichloroethylene.cts of asheville allegedly dumped large quantities of these toxic contaminants onto its property and into a stream known as dingle creek.
from until,stahle lived with his family on a property on dingle creek,downstream of cts of asheville manufacturing plant.during this period,stahle was exposed to the contaminated water of dingle creek.many years later,stahle was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia.
on february,stahle filed a complaint against cts in the western district of north carolina.stahle alleges that cts of asheville negligence in dumping toxic chemicals into dingle creek caused his leukemia.cts moved to dismiss stahle complaint,principally on the basis that it was under north carolina general statutes section,the second sentence of which provides that no cause of action shall accrue more than years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action.cts argued that the last possible relevant act or omission of the defendant occurred in when stahle moved away from dingle creek as such,the statute applied to bar any action by stahle not brought by.stahle responded that precedent of the supreme court of north carolina and decisions of this circuit established that statutes such as section do not apply to claims arising from disease.
the magistrate judge recommended that cts motion to dismiss be granted.the magistrate judge found that the statutory text of section was unambiguous and did not contain an exception for diseases.the district court agreed with the recommendation and dismissed stahle action with prejudice.stahle timely appealed.

because federal jurisdiction in this matter rests in diversity our role is to apply the governing state law.see bp prods,stanley,cir.it is axiomatic that in determining state law a federal court must look first and foremost to the law of the state highest court,giving appropriate effect to all its implications.assicurazioni generali,neil,cir.if,as here,the state highest court has not directly addressed the issue,a federal court must anticipate how it would rule.liberty,citizens ins.of,cir in other words,our task here is to anticipate whether the supreme court of north carolina would rule that north carolina general statutes section bars stahle action.
this is not the first time we have anticipated north carolina law on the subject of disease claims and personal injury statutes of repose.in hyer pittsburgh corning we articulated our understanding that the north carolina supreme court does not consider disease to be included within a statute of repose directed at personal injury claims unless the legislature expressly expands the language to include it,cir quotation omitted.hyer is still the law in this circuit,and we are bound to follow it here,demetres,cir united states collins,cir a decision of a panel of this court becomes the law of the circuit and is binding on other panels unless it is overruled by a subsequent en banc opinion of this court or a superseding contrary decision of the supreme court.quoting etheridge norfolk ry,cir.
section functions as a statute of repose directed at certain personal injury claims.the north carolina general assembly has not expressly expanded the language to include disease.therefore,under our understanding of north carolina law as articulated in hyer,we conclude that the supreme court of north carolina would not consider section applicable to claims arising out of disease.
cts argues that hyer is distinguishable because it analyzed a different statute of repose.as stated above,the conclusion announced in hyer is broad enough to encompass the statute at issue here.however,even assuming our articulation of north carolina law in hyer was broader than necessary to resolve that case such that it should be considered dicta we nevertheless conclude that applying the underlying reasoning in hyer leads to the same result here.
in hyer,we considered the scope of the statute of repose in north carolina general statutes section.section was enacted in as part of an act relating to civil actions for damages for personal injury,death or damage to property resulting from the use of products.see sess.laws products liability act.at that time,section provided 
no action for the recovery of damages for personal injury,death or damage to property based upon or arising out of any alleged defect or any failure in relation to a product shall be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.
hyer,at.the plaintiff in hyer was diagnosed with a disease,asbestosis,in,and alleged in an action brought the same year that his disease had been caused by products manufactured by the defendant.id.at.in response,the defendant presented evidence that it had sold its last product containing asbestos in,meaning that nine years had passed before the action was brought.id.at.the district court ruled that the action was by the limit in section.
we reversed,principally relying on the supreme court of north carolina intervening decision in wilder amatex.hyer,at.as we explained in hyer,wilder also involved a disease claim,and the wilder court faced the question of whether yet another statute of repose,the north carolina general statutes section b,applie d to claims arising out of disease.at quoting wilder,at.that statute provided 
except where otherwise provided by statute,a cause of action,other than one for wrongful death or one for malpractice arising out of the performance or failure to perform professional services,having as an essential element bodily injury to the person or a defect or damage not readily apparent to the claimant at the time of its origin,is deemed to have accrued at the time the injury was discovered by the claimant,or ought reasonably to have been discovered by him,whichever event first occurs provided that in such cases the period shall not exceed ten years from the last act of the defendant giving rise to the claim for relief.
hyer,at.after reviewing the supreme court of north carolina analysis of section b,we noted its conclusion that the legislature intended section b to have no application to claims arising from disease.hyer,at quoting wilder,at.we highlighted the supreme court finding that the statute primary purpose was to change the accrual date from which the period of limitations begins to run on latent injury claims and to add a statute of repose to latent injury claims.hyer,at quoting wilder,at.we quoted wilder statement that unlike latent injury claims,disease presents an intrinsically different kind of claim and noted our understanding that north carolina has always recognized the distinction.hyer,at quoting wilder,at 
with this understanding of wilder,we returned to our analysis of the statute of repose in section.we noted our cognizance that wilder concerned b while we construe but found that the implications of wilder with respect to the construction to be placed on were plain.hyer,at.we concluded that wilder makes it plain that the north carolina supreme court does not consider disease to be included within a statute of repose directed at personal injury claims unless the legislature expressly expands the language to include it.id.at quotation omitted.we predicted that the supreme court of north carolina would conclude that section did not bar disease claims.id.
we have repeatedly affirmed our understanding of north carolina law as articulated in hyer.for example,in bullard dalkon shield claimants trust,we held that the principles stated in wilder were not limited only to occupational diseases,cir see also id.at citing cases applying hyer.we noted that we understood the supreme court of north carolina decision in wilder to be based not on the specific characteristics of a particular disease,but on characteristics of disease as a general phenomenon.see id.at.we further noted in bullard that t he wilder court recognized that b oth the north carolina supreme court and the north carolina legislature have long been cognizant of the difference between diseases on the one hand and other kinds of injury on the other from the standpoint of identifying legally relevant time periods.at second alteration in original quoting wilder,at.
returning to the case at bar,we are cognizant that hyer and bullard concerned section while we now construe section.however,we see no meaningful distinction between section and section such that the principles in wilder would extend to the former but not to the latter.cts suggests that section contains ambiguity not present in section,and that only such ambiguity made application of wilder appropriate in hyer.but cts does not identify the pertinent ambiguity in section,or what about section eliminates ambiguity.the operative language in each provision is quite similar emphasis added 
section no action for the recovery of damages for personal injury based upon or arising out of any alleged defect or any failure in relation to a product shall be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.
section f or personal injury the cause of action shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent p rovided that no cause of action shall accrue more than years from the last act or omission of the defendant 
indeed,to the extent the bare language of each provision differs,we think section admits of at least as much ambiguity,if not more.
additionally,the common ancestry of these statutes of repose reinforces the applicability of hyer here.both section and section were enacted in the products liability act.see sess.laws.this same act also repealed the predecessor statute of repose at issue in wilder,section b.id.
cts argues that the language of the parent statute in wilder was sufficiently different such that wilder should not extend to the daughter statute at issue here,section.we concluded in hyer,however,that wilder extended to the other daughter statute,section.the linguistic differences cts points to here between parent and daughter were also present in hyer,and we do not see a meaningful difference between the two daughter statutes that would undermine a straightforward application of hyer.in fact,of the two sister statutes,section is more closely linked to the parent statute the heir apparent perhaps,pembee cape fear const,describing the similar provision and effect of section b and section.if the wilder rule extends to section,as we concluded it did in hyer,we conclude it also extends to section.
finally,we take a small measure of comfort in the fact that although hyer and bullard have been on the books and applied for several decades,neither the north carolina general assembly nor the north carolina courts have taken exception to our expressed understanding of north carolina law or the implications of the wilder decision.the supreme court of north carolina has recognized that the legislature decision not to amend a statute that has been interpreted by a court is some evidence that the legislature approves of that interpretation.see,state ellison,citing cases.the supreme court of north carolina also always presume s that the legislature acted with full knowledge of prior and existing law.dickson rucho,quotation omitted.amicus north carolina advocates for justice informs us that the general assembly has acted at least eight times since wilder to amend various statutes of repose and limitations without undoing any judicial application of the law relating to claims arising from disease.see br.amicus curiae north carolina advocates for justice.
of particular note,in the general assembly specifically repealed section,the statute of repose interpreted in hyer and bullard,and enacted section in its place.see sess.laws.however,the only textual change to the new product liability action statute was to replace six years with years.id.moreover,the enacting law further provided that n othing in this act is intended to change existing law relating to product liability actions based upon disease.id.though certainly not dispositive,we think the general assembly consideration and reenactment of the language of section in section,with specific reference to existing law and presumed knowledge of judicial interpretations of the statute,is at least some evidence of approval of the wilder line of cases.
in short,we our understanding that the north carolina supreme court does not consider disease to be included within a statute of repose directed at personal injury claims unless the legislature expressly expands the language to include it.hyer,at quotation omitted.we also our understanding that the supreme court of north carolina has recognized that the north carolina legislature ha s long been cognizant of the difference between diseases on the one hand and other kinds of injury on the other from the standpoint of identifying legally relevant time periods.bullard,at quoting wilder,at.thus,looking to the law of north carolina highest court and giving appropriate effect to all its implications,assicurazioni generali,at,consistent with our precedents we anticipate that the supreme court of north carolina would rule that section is not applicable to stahle claim arising from disease.
the district court did not discuss the applicability of hyer or bullard in reaching its decision.instead,leaning heavily on a decision of the eleventh circuit,bryant united states,cir,the district court concluded that the statutory text of section was facially unambiguous and applied to stahle disease claim.although the eleventh circuit of course was not bound by our prior decisions in hyer or bullard,the district court was,and,as discussed earlier,erred in not applying our precedent.
however,even if hyer and its progeny were not the law of this circuit,and we were faced with determining the scope of section without those precedents,we would still reverse.as discussed below,north carolina courts are guided by the principle of plain meaning when construing statutes.while the district court correctly adduced that principle,it did not carry it into practice as enunciated and applied by the state highest court.volvo trademark holding aktiebolaget clark mach,cir.the district court focused narrowly on the isolated text of subsection to determine its plain meaning.however,the supreme court of north carolina does not read segments of a statute in isolation.rhyne k mart.
read in the context of north carolina statutory limitations and repose scheme,section appears plainly to apply to not injury claims.specifically,it appears to apply to that set of personal injuries for which bodily harm to the claimant becomes apparent at some point in time after the injury.that is,it applies to latent injuries.
this conclusion is further supported by north carolina caselaw.although the supreme court of north carolina has not construed section specifically in a disease case,it has construed the statute in other contexts and also opined on its general operation in dicta.weighing these cases,we conclude that the supreme court of north carolina considers section applicable only to latent injuries.because north carolina law clearly establishes that a disease is not a latent injury,wilder,at,we anticipate that the supreme court of north carolina would not consider section applicable to stahle disease claim.
as the supreme court of north carolina has explained,w hen the language of a statute is clear and without ambiguity,it is the duty of a court to give effect to the plain meaning of the statute.diaz div.of soc.importantly,however,the supreme court of north carolina does not read segments of a statute in isolation.rhyne,at.instead,in determining the plain meaning of the words chosen by the legislature,the supreme court of north carolina reads those words within the context of the statute.brown flowe,accord,dickson,at watson indus.shaw,few words are so plain that the context or the occasion is without capacity to enlarge or narrow their extension.quotation omitted 
cts urges us,in essence,to eschew a contextual reading of section and find that subsection by itself is clear and unambiguous and applies to stahle claim.notwithstanding that this approach is inconsistent with the principles of north carolina statutory construction just articulated,we think the argument fails on its own terms.
first,in misenheimer,the supreme court of north carolina stated we find to be ambiguous on its face.at.the misenheimer court was not considering the clarity of section with respect to a disease claim,and a statute may be facially ambiguous as to only some applications while having discrete unambiguous application elsewhere.however,misenheimer significantly undermines cts argument that the statute is unambiguous even in isolation,and our analysis of subsection certainly is informed by the supreme court of north carolina determination that the statute is ambiguous on its face.
second,cts principal argument that subsection has unambiguous application to disease claims is that the text does not explicitly exclude disease claims.true enough.however,the text does not explicitly include disease claims either.absent explicit textual inclusion of disease,cts argument turns on disease being unambiguously included within the set of personal injuries to which subsection is addressed.we are skeptical,not least because the supreme court of north carolina in misenheimer specifically found that section is ambiguous as to what is intended by the use of the words personal injury.at.
regardless,cts argument is based on reading subsection in isolation.as noted above,this is not the approach to statutory construction articulated by the supreme court of north carolina.to determine whether there is a clear and unambiguous plain meaning of the words in section,we must read those words in their statutory context 
chapter of the north carolina general statutes covers civil procedure,within which subchapter ii covers limitations and provides both general limitations on civil actions as well as limitations applicable to numerous specific types of civil actions.the first general provision,section,states that c ivil actions can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this chapter,after the cause of action has accrued,except where in special cases a different limitation is prescribed by statute.a.the periods prescribed are provided in a host of subsequent sections.the periods prescribed for the commencement of actions,other than for the recovery of real property are set forth in article.id.
article is divided into ten different sections,each of which enumerates the various types of actions that must be commenced within a certain period of time,ranging from years,id,to two months,id.the sixth of these sections,section,enumerates types of actions that must be commenced w ithin three years.id.section in turn is broken into twenty different subsections.
most of these twenty subsections are similar in form,describing different types of civil actions they comprise a list,enumerating those actions that are timely if brought w ithin three years.id.grammatically,most of these subsections are incomplete.they are sentence fragments enumerating different categories of civil actions,and must be read in conjunction with the section introductory text to pull in the three years language and even then do not become grammatically complete sentences.
for example,the text of the second subsection reads only upon the official bond of a public officer.id.read with the introductory phrase at the beginning of section,the combined text becomes within three years an action u pon the official bond of a public officer.this combined fragment,incorporated into the overarching general limitation provision of section leads to a complete statutory command civil actions upon the official bond of a public officer can only be commenced within three years,after the cause of action has accrued,except where in special cases a different limitation is prescribed by statute.id.a.
relevant here,subsection of section specifically limits actions f or criminal conversation,or for any other injury to the person or rights of another,not arising on contract and not hereafter enumerated.id.the language any other injury to the person or rights of another is extremely broad,and appears to establish a three year statute of limitations for any action arising from an injury to the person,unless the action is thereafter specifically enumerated.
reading down the subsections of section,we come at last to subsection as it read at the relevant time 
unless otherwise provided by statute,for personal injury or physical damage to claimant property,the cause of action,except in causes of actions referred to in c,shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his property becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,whichever event first occurs.provided that no cause of action shall accrue more than years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action.
id.this subsection is structured differently than most of the others in section.it reads as grammatically complete sentences without recourse to section introductory text in fact becoming ungrammatical when read with the three years introductory text.nor can it easily be incorporated into the general limitation command of section.
cts argues that it is undisputed that the first sentence of subsection sets forth a statute of limitations for all causes of action covered by the provision,and that the second sentence sets forth a repose period cts further argues that subsection by its express terms applies to all causes of action for personal injury.thus,the second sentence of subsection establishes a repose period for all causes of action for personal injury.we disagree 
the first sentence of subsection does not say,expressly or otherwise,that all causes of action for personal injury must be commenced within three years it says unless otherwise provided by statute,for personal injury the cause of action shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant becomes apparent.id.the operative verb is accrue,suggesting in the first instance that subsection is an accrual provision.further,the first sentence only has meaningful effect for those personal injuries for which the harm is not immediately apparent that is,latent injuries.for personal injuries where the harm is immediately apparent,this provision would serve no meaningful purpose.
but most importantly,reading subsection as encompassing all personal injury actions would render the personal injury language in the preceding subsection meaningless.subsection establishes a statute of limitation expressly for actions for any other injury to the person.see,misenheimer,at personal injuries are covered in section.reading subsection as cts proposes would read the language of subsection out of north carolina statutory scheme,a result strongly disfavored by north carolina.the supreme court of north carolina considers it a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that courts should evaluate a statute as a whole and not construe an individual section in a manner that renders another provision of the same statute meaningless.lunsford mills,quotation omitted.we decline to construe subsection in such a manner.
reading north carolina statute as a whole,and heeding the supreme court of north carolina guidance that we should not construe one statutory provision so as to render another meaningless,we conclude that subsection is the pertinent statute of limitation for civil actions for an injury to the person.we conclude that subsection in turn is an accrual provision that applies to a subset of those actions,namely those in which the harm is not immediately apparent,but rather becomes apparent at some later point in time.in other words,section applies to certain latent injuries.we think these conclusions are plain from the text of the north carolina statute,and as further explained below,comport with north carolina caselaw.
while the supreme court of north carolina has not directly addressed the applicability of section to disease claims,it has had occasion to opine generally on the operation of the statute.cts argues that the supreme court of north carolina has all but held subsection applicable to disease claims,citing to language in two cases,wilder and dunn pacific employers insurance.while the language in wilder and dunn was dicta,dicta of a state highest court is relevant to a federal court sitting in diversity.see,private mortg.inv,hotel club,cir.
at issue in wilder was a legacy statute of repose,section b.although section was not at issue,the wilder court did reference the statute in discussing the purpose of section b.the supreme court of north carolina noted that the primary purpose of section b was to change the accrual date from which the period of limitations begins to run on latent injury claims,and that section b was not intended to be a statute of limitations governing all negligence claims,such as the statute of limitations contained in the first clause of section.at.from this,cts argues that the supreme court of north carolina considers section to govern all negligence claims.
cts also points us to dunn,where the issue was the timeliness of a wrongful death action.the decedent had been diagnosed with liver cancer in august and died a little less than two years later.at.the wrongful death action was brought by his widow just less than two years after the decedent death or nearly four years after the diagnosis.id.the operative statute,section,provided a limit on bringing wrongful death actions,but further barred an action where the decedent would have been barred,had he lived,from bringing an action for bodily harm because of the provisions of section c or section.id.quoting.the defendant in dunn argued that section would have barred an action by the decedent,had he lived,three years after his diagnosis since almost four years had passed,the suit should be barred.id.at.
the supreme court of north carolina rejected this argument,holding that the wrongful death statute proviso only barred actions that were barred by the listed statutes within the decedent lifetime.id.at.because the decedent died within three years of his diagnosis,his claim was not in life,and his widow had two years from his death to bring the wrongful death action.id.cts here argues that implicit in dunn was a finding by the supreme court of north carolina that section normally applied to claims arising from disease.
if the language in wilder and dunn constituted the supreme court of north carolina only extant pronouncements on section,cts argument would have considerably more force.however,picking out just wilder and dunn from the caselaw is akin to looking over a crowd and picking out your friends.yellow freight,reich,cir quotation omitted.other supreme court of north carolina cases,including more recent cases with fuller analysis of section,seriously undermine cts position.
for example,three years after wilder,the supreme court of north carolina decided boudreau baughman.the plaintiff in boudreau seriously injured himself using a chair manufactured by the defendant.the defendant asserted that the action was barred by several north carolina statutes of repose,which the court ultimately rejected as it found the dispute was governed by florida law.at.however,in discussing the potential applicability of north carolina law,the supreme court stated 
defendants also contend that the action would be by we need not consider the effect of the period prescribed by section.this section replaced legacy section b and its primary purpose appears to have been the adoption of the discovery rule.that is,it was intended to apply to plaintiffs with latent injuries.it is undisputed that plaintiff was aware of his injury as soon as it occurred.thus the statute is inapplicable on the facts of this case.
at internal citations omitted.boudreau indicates that the supreme court of north carolina considers section inapplicable to plaintiffs who are aware of their injury as soon as it occur s.in other words,section was intended to apply to plaintiffs with latent injuries.id.
in,the supreme court of north carolina decided misenheimer.misenheimer dealt directly with the interaction of sections and,though in an action for criminal conversation rather than disease the court explained that section was t he pertinent statute of limitations while section establishes what is commonly referred to as the discovery rule,which tolls the running of the statute of limitations for torts resulting in certain latent injuries,though such actions remain subject to the statute of repose provision in section.at.like boudreau,misenheimer suggests to us that the supreme court of north carolina considers section applicable only in such actions,that is,torts resulting in certain latent injuries.
importantly,the misenheimer court further explained that the express reference to criminal conversation in section did not bar application of section in certain cases.at.the misenheimer defendant had noted that section stated that it applied u nless otherwise provided by statute,and argued that section specific reference to criminal conversation meant that such actions were otherwise provided by statute and thus section could not apply.id.the supreme court rejected this argument,specifically noting the effect such a reading would have on actions for personal injuries.the court noted that,in addition to criminal conversation,p ersonal injuries are covered in section and defendant argument,if accepted,would bar application of section even though that section also specifically applies to personal injury.id.at.to harmonize the two provisions,the court found that section reference to criminal conversation does not bar the application of section when the injury is latent.id.at.
following the reasoning in misenheimer,we anticipate that the supreme court of north carolina would find that section applies to personal injury actions,but that section reference to personal injury does not bar the application of section to personal injury actions when the injury is latent.we understand that north carolina law is settled that disease is not a latent injury instead,the legal injury and awareness of that injury occur simultaneously at diagnosis.wilder,at.as such,section would not apply to a disease claim.accord boudreau,at p laintiff was aware of his injury as soon as it occurred.thus section is inapplicable.
while there is perhaps some tension among the dicta in the cases discussed above,it is improbable that any court dicta over the course of four decades would be perfectly harmonized for all future applications.we suspect our own caselaw admits of some inconsistencies over that span.however,looking to the dicta in these cases as a whole,and giving appropriate effect to all its implications,assicurazioni generali,at,we conclude that the supreme court of north carolina considers section only applicable to certain latent injuries,and because disease is not a latent injury,would not find section applicable to stahle claim.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
reversed and remanded 
i concur in the majority outcome,but i write separately for three reasons.first,i would not rely so heavily on our decision in hyer pittsburgh corning,cir,which construed a north carolina statute significantly different than the one at bar,and which has never been cited in a reported north carolina decision.second,i address appellee unfounded argument that there is no meaningful difference between the claims in cts waldburger,d,and the claim in this case.finally,i note that a north carolina certified question mechanism would have provided us with a beneficial tool in deconstructing this novel and unsettled state law issue,which four circuits have now addressed with varying results.
this case boils down to the meaning of the phrase personal injury in.if the north carolina supreme court would read this phrase to encompass disease claims,appellant claim is barred.if not,the claim proceeds.
in determining whether disease claims fall within the meaning of personal injury,the majority turns first to this court decision in hyer pittsburgh corning,which states,the north carolina supreme court does not consider disease to be included within a statute of repose directed at personal injury claims unless the legislature expressly expands the language to include it,cir emphasis supplied internal quotation marks omitted.because hyer construed a different statute,relied on a north carolina decision characterizing quite broadly,and has not been cited by a reported north carolina decision,i would consider the passage above dicta.see ante at.
hyer construed a north carolina statute of repose,which provided a bar to recovery for damages for personal injury based on a product failure or defect,if the claim was brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.in concluding that statute of repose did not apply to claims based on disease,hyer relied heavily on the north carolina supreme court decision in wilder amatex,which held that the statute of repose in the repealed.b did not apply to disease claims.see hyer,at stating that in wilder,the north carolina supreme court conclu ded that the legislature intended b to have no application to claims arising from disease quoting wilder,at.
but in,when hyer stated the rule upon which the majority relies,had been on the books over six years,and even though it,too,contained a statute of repose ostensibly directed to personal injur ies,hyer failed to mention.moreover,wilder specifically contrasted with b,stating,we note,importantly,that b is not intended to be a statute of limitations governing all negligence claims,such as the statute of limitations contained in the first clause of.wilder,at emphasis supplied.thus,an equally permissible reading of hyer against the legal landscape at the time is that was not included in the umbrella of statutes of repose directed at personal injury claims because it applied generally to all negligence claims.
in addition,the language of b differed significantly from the language of.by its terms,b applied to cause s of action having as an essential element bodily injury to the person not readily apparent to the claimant at the time of its origin,and stated that in such cases,cases involving a latent bodily harm,a year statute of repose applies.b repealed.section,which replaced b,contains broader language,applying to personal injury cause s of action,and stating without qualification that no cause of action shall accrue more than years after the defendant last act or omission.as explained by the majority,we now have more guidance from north carolina state courts as to the breadth of.but at the time of the hyer decision,wilder was the only north carolina decision comparing language to that of b,and it suggested that is much broader than its predecessor statute.therefore,hyer reading of construed a statute specifically encompassing claims involving bodily injuries not apparent to the claimant when they not dictate the same result for stare decisis purposes regarding a statute generally referencing personal injur ies.
finally,although certainly not dispositive,in predicting what the north carolina supreme court would do in this situation,i am reluctant to afford substantial weight to a decision that has never been cited in a reported north carolina state court decision.indeed,hyer has only been cited by this court in four decisions in years,and even then,only in the context of.see bullard dalkon shield trust,cir guy dupont de nemours,cir silver johns manville,cir burnette nicolet,cir.
however,even without the binding authority of hyer,i agree with the majority that the north carolina supreme court would likely treat the case at hand as falling outside the scope of the statute of repose in.
post hyer,the north carolina supreme court made clear that the phrase personal injury as used in has a wide range of meanings is ambiguous and placed in the proper context,must be a latent injury,an injury not reasonably apparent to the claimant at the time it occurs.misenheimer burris,quoting.
at first blush,one would think a disease is or at least breeds a latent injury.but that is not the way north carolina sees it.north carolina has recognized that diseases can be the result not of a single incident but rather of prolonged exposure to hazardous conditions of a agent.booker duke med.thus,the legal injury and awareness of that injury occur simultaneously at diagnosis.ante at,citing wilder,at.
for these reasons and those more cogently set forth in section iv of the majority opinion i agree that the north carolina supreme court would not view appellant disease claim as a personal injury under.
second,like the majority,i too reject appellee argument that the supreme court decision in cts waldburger,d,dictates our outcome.see ante at.appellee submits there is no meaningful difference between the waldburger claims and appellant claim,and appellant action was properly dismissed for the same reasons as in waldburger.appellee br.it is true that in both cases,the last alleged act or omission of cts occurred decades before suit was filed.id.at.and it is also true that the statute of repose provision in applies to claims based on physical damage to one property one of the bases for waldburger nuisance claim and personal injury.
however,in waldburger,the supreme court did not address whether the plaintiffs claims may be subject to the statute of repose in,as written.rather,the issue in waldburger was whether the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla preempted that statute of repose.after the supreme court waldburger decision,leaving the statute of repose intact,this case takes the next step of asking whether appellant disease claim falls within its parameters.in making this argument,cts basically ignores the crux of this appeal.therefore,waldburger is inapplicable here.
finally,i write to express my view that a north carolina certification procedure would have provided this panel wi
