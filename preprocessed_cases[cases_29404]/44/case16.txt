respondent carol sachs,a california resident,purchased a eurail pass over the internet from a travel agent.while using that pass to board a train in austria operated by petitioner obb personenverkehr ag obb,the austrian railway,sachs fell to the tracks and suffered traumatic personal injuries.she sued obb in federal district court.obb moved to dismiss,claiming that her suit was barred by the foreign sovereign immunities act,which shields foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities from suit in united states courts,unless a specified exception applies.sachs countered that her suit fell within the act commercial activity exception,which abrogates sovereign immunity for suits based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by a foreign state,a,reasoning that her suit was based upon the travel agent sale of the eurail pass in the united states,and that the travel agent sale of that pass could be attributed to obb through common law principles of agency.the district court held that sachs suit did not fall within a and dismissed the suit,but the en banc ninth circuit reversed.the court first concluded that the eurail pass sale by the travel agent could be attributed to obb through common law principles of agency,and then determined that sachs suit was based upon that eurail pass sale because the sale established a single element necessary to recover under each cause of action brought by sachs.
held sachs suit falls outside the commercial activity exception and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity.
a sachs suit is not based upon the sale of the eurail pass for purposes of a.therefore,the court has no need to address whether the act allows the travel agent sale of the eurail pass to be attributed to obb through common law principles of agency.
although the act does not elaborate on the phrase based upon,saudi arabia nelson,provides sufficient guidance to resolve this case.there,the court held that the based upon inquiry requires a court to determine the particular conduct on which the action is based,at,and identified that conduct by looking to the gravamen of the complaint,at.
the ninth circuit used a flawed approach when it found that the based upon inquiry would be satisfied if the sale of the eurail pass provided an element of each of sachs claims.this court approach in nelson is flatly incompatible with such a approach,which necessarily requires a court to identify all the elements of each claim before finding that the claim falls outside a.the nelson court did not undertake such an exhaustive,analysis or engage in the analysis necessary to such an undertaking.see,at.
as opposed to adopting a test,the nelson court zeroed in on the core of the plaintiffs suit the conduct that actually injured the plaintiffs to identify the conduct that the suit was based upon.see,at.all of sachs claims turn on the same tragic episode in austria,allegedly caused by wrongful conduct and dangerous conditions in austria,which led to injuries suffered in austria.however sachs frames her suit,the incident in innsbruck,austria,remains at its foundation.any other approach would allow plaintiffs to evade the act restrictions through artful pleading.see,at.
b sachs now contends that her claims are based upon obb entire railway enterprise.because that argument was never presented to any lower court,it is forfeited.see taylor freeland kronz.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the foreign sovereign immunities act shields foreign states and their agencies from suit in united states courts unless the suit falls within one of the act specifically enumerated exceptions.this case concerns the scope of the commercial activity exception,which withdraws sovereign immunity in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by a foreign state.a.
respondent carol sachs is a resident of california who purchased in the united states a eurail pass for rail travel in europe.she suffered traumatic personal when she fell onto the tracks at the innsbruck,austria,train station while attempting to board a train operated by the austrian railway.she sued the railway in federal district court,arguing that her suit was not barred by sovereign immunity because it is based upon the railway sale of the pass to her in the united states.we disagree and conclude that her action is instead based upon the railway conduct in innsbruck.we therefore hold that her suit falls outside the commercial activity exception and is barred by sovereign immunity.

carol sachs is a resident of berkeley,california.in march,she purchased a eurail pass over the internet from the rail pass experts,a travel agent.the following month,sachs arrived at the innsbruck train station,planning to use her eurail pass to ride an obb train to prague.as she attempted to board the train,sachs fell from the platform onto the tracks.obb moving train crushed her legs,both of which had to be amputated above the knee,at.
sachs sued obb in the united states district court for the northern district of california,asserting five causes of action negligence strict liability for design defects in the train and platform strict liability for failure to warn of those design defects breach of an implied warranty of merchantability for providing a train and platform unsafe for their intended uses and breach of an implied warranty of fitness for providing a train and platform unfit for their intended uses.app.obb claimed sovereign immunity and moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,at.
the foreign sovereign immunities act provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.argentine republic amerada hess shipping.the act defines foreign state to include a state agency or instrumentality,a,and both parties agree that obb qualifies as a foreign state for purposes of the act.obb is therefore presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of united states courts unless one of the act express exceptions to sovereign immunity applies.saudi arabia nelson.sachs argues that her suit falls within the act commercial activity exception,which provides in part that a foreign state does not enjoy immunity when the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state.a 
the district court concluded that sachs suit did not fall within a and therefore granted obb motion to dismiss.wl,nd.a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.the full court ordered rehearing en banc and,with three judg
