factual and procedural background 
as a regional sales manager for stryker medical division for the southwest sales region,coffel managed territory managers throughout his sales region.regional managers received a flat salary and,if specific sales goals were met,bonuses.in january,coffel received and signed a compensation package to govern the year,which included sales quotas to be achieved by his region january plan.at that time,stryker medical division had two sales groups,one selling hospital beds and the other selling stretchers.coffel and his territory managers were in the stretcher group.
due to the medical division economic losses in the first six months of,stryker hired both a new president for the division,brian hutchison hutchison,and a new vice president of sales,david johnston johnston.under new management,a major reorganization of the division resulted in a reduction in stryker sales force and the merger of the medical division bed and stretcher groups.as a result,coffel received an additional product.
as part of the restructuring,the company presented a new bonus plan to coffel and the other regional managers for august through december the time period from the merger to the end of the calendar year.the new bonus plan consisted of four parts the annual percent to quota bonus the overall sales of a region compared to the quota set by management for that region,the quarterly balance sell bonus for selling across the various product lines,the quarterly discount bonus for limiting the amount of discounts given on sales,and the annual expense control bonus for reducing incidental expenses.
in august,there were a series of meetings at stryker regarding the setting of the quotas necessary to determine the compensation for the regional managers august meetings after the initial merger,johnston met with his new group of regional managers,including coffel,to discuss possibilities for a new compensation plan to replace the january plan.johnston used an overhead screen and handouts to identify designated target categories and discuss bonus targets for regional managers.coffel contends that johnston told the regional managers guys,this is a rich client.you could make a lot of money you could make per category.at the conclusion of the meeting,stryker claims that johnston collected all copies of the draft plan and informed the regional managers that it was not complete but rather was a work in progress.
coffel attended a subsequent meeting in august with johnston and the other regional managers.at this meeting,the regional managers were informed that a new compensation plan would replace the january plan august plan and they discussed how quotas should be allocated to each of the regions.stryker claims that during this meeting,david damm damm,the medical division director of marketing,ran figures and statistics through a computer database and arrived at a preliminary quota of million for coffel region.
according to stryker,johnston subsequently set coffel quota at million.however,coffel claims that subsequent to his acceptance of,performance under,and reliance upon stryker representations regarding the new contract,the company repudiated the plan by increasing his quota from million to million.in late august,damm sent a memorandum to coffel detailing the quotas for the august to december time period damm memo.coffel claims that the million quota figure was attached to the memo,while stryker contends that the previously discussed million quota that johnston set was attached to it.in early october,coffel received his compensation plan in final written form in a memorandum from johnston dated september,johnston plan.
coffel continued working as a regional sales manager through the end of,and on january,he began working as a regional project manager for stryker.soon thereafter,he resigned.in a february letter to stryker,he alleged that stryker had discriminated against him.
coffel sued stryker,claiming age discrimination under the age discrimination in employment act,disability discrimination under the americans with disabilities act,and workers compensation discrimination under texas law.ann.vernon.additionally,he claimed breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation related to bonuses to which he claimed entitlement.
the case was tried before a jury from february,to february.the jury rejected coffel three discrimination claims,as well as the negligent misrepresentation claim.it returned a verdict for coffel on the fraud and breach of contract claims,awarding coffel in actual damages on the contract claim,in actual damages on the fraud claim,and in exemplary damages.
on february,stryker filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b.based on the partially favorable verdict,on march,coffel filed a motion seeking an attorney fee award of for fees incurred at the trial level,plus an additional for fees,and for services in the event of appeal.in an order dated june,magistrate judge albright granted stryker rule b motion on the fraud and associated damages findings,but denied the motion with respect to the contract claim.thus,coffel recovery was limited to for breach of contract damages.the magistrate judge entered final judgment on july,however,he subsequently noted the pendency of coffel motion for attorneys fees and rescinded the judgment to address that issue.before ruling on that motion,magistrate judge albright left the federal bench to return to private practice,and the attorneys fees motion was brought before magistrate judge austin.magistrate judge austin awarded coffel attorneys fees under texas law,but reduced his requested amount from to for fees incurred at trial on the breach of contract claim,plus in the event of a successful appeal.this appeal followed.

coffel suggests that although the district court set forth the appropriate rule b standard,it failed to review the record as a whole and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor as the nonmovant.after reviewing magistrate judge albright order,we conclude that he reviewed all of the evidence in the record,not limiting his b review to the evidence specifically identified by coffel as supporting the verdict on fraud we address in our de novo review of the sufficiency of the evidence of fraud and damages coffel contention that the district court failed to indulge all reasonable inferences in his favor.
sufficiency of the evidence of fraud and damages 
coffel argues that the district court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law on the fraud claim and finding insufficient evidence to support fraud damages and punitive damages.we agree.
fraud claim 
under texas law,the elements of a fraud cause of action are a material representation was made it was false when made the speaker either knew it was false,or made it without knowledge of its truth the speaker made it with the intent that it should be acted upon the party acted in reliance and the party was injured as a result,formosa plastics.usa presidio eng rs contractors.in the case of a promise of future performance,the plaintiff also has to prove that the promise was made with no intention of performing at the time it was made.id.at.at issue is whether coffel established,as part of his prima facie case,that stryker committed fraud when it changed its salary and bonus framework.specifically,we decide whether there was legally sufficient evidence of the following points to support the jury verdict and survive judgment as a matter of law a promise or representation,fraudulent intent,and coffel reliance.
coffel alleges that stryker made three representations that it never intended to keep in order to induce coffel to continue employment after the merger under the new bonus compensation plan,and that coffel relied on these representations in accepting the new plan in august.first,the august plan and damm memo represented that coffel would have a million quota for august through december.second,the august plan and the johnston plan represented that coffel could potentially earn a discount bonus.third,the august plan and the johnston plan represented that coffel could potentially earn an expense control bonus.
regarding a promise of future performance,the district court order stated the court finds that there is no evidence that the defendant made a promise to do an act in the future.coffel argues that this finding of no promise is in because stryker must have made some representations of future acts,as evidenced by the jury verdict on breach of contract and its survival of the motion for judgment as a matter of law.stryker contends that the magistrate judge conclusion that there was no promise of a million sales quota was not in error,and that coffel argument begs the question stryker presents a simple argument because the essence of coffel fraud claim is that he was fraudulently induced to remain in the employ of stryker based on an alleged promise that stryker would use a million quota,as opposed to stryker actual use of a million quota,coffel unequivocal admission on that from the outset of the new bonus compensation plan,he knew that the higher million quota applied,defeats his claim of fraud.to support its argument that coffel knew that he had a million quota from the inception of the new plan,stryker relies on the following portion of coffel 
q up until recent times you have understood all along that your quota was million is that right 
a yes,i have a million quota.
q your quota was million from day one,was it 
a under duress,yes,sir.
tr.vol,at.stryker claims that coffel admission that he knew of his million quota all along came after he clarified that he knew of his million quota at the second august meeting,and was forced to admit that he distributed million worth of quota to his own sales people on labor day weekend at the end of august.coffel responds that there was no such admission and that the testimony was not inconsistent.
after reviewing the entire record,and drawing all reasonable inferences in coffel favor,we determine that stryker admission argument fails.first,coffel did not admit that he understood from the plan inception that his quota was million.although reading the above testimony out of context could lead one to that conclusion,after reading the testimony in context,its meaning is more ambiguous.coffel testified,i have a million quota,and acknowledged that the million quota governed the new plan covering august to december of.this does not necessarily mean that he knew that his quota was million when he began working under this new plan in august and at the august meetings.although johnston told coffel in the second august meeting that his quota was not high enough,coffel consistently testified that he received a memo dated august,from damm with a million quota.tr.vol,at vol,at.by the end of august,coffel knew that the million quota was coming,and thus,prepared the quota for his staff on labor day weekend based on that number,as per johnston request.tr.vol,at.the first time he received the million quota in writing,however,was the memo from johnston dated september.tr.vol,at.considering the evidence,a reasonable jury could have determined that coffel testimony was consistent with his previous and subsequent testimony.it could then have concluded that although coffel eventually knew that the million figure would govern the new compensation plan,he originally believed that his quota was million and did not learn that the quota was going to change until he began working under the new plan.second,by limiting the question of a promise of future performance to the million quota,stryker overlooks allegations that stryker new compensation plan included representations to coffel of various bonus components that were never paid,only one of which included the million quota.
we conclude that coffel presented legally sufficient evidence that stryker made promises of future performance.coffel and other regional managers testified that they accepted a new compensation package in late july or early august of and that this package included a million quota for coffel and his southwest region.while stryker flatly denies that the million figure discussed in the august meetings was a promise,and damm testified that the million was merely a preliminary quota,evidence was produced at trial that the million quota was confirmed in the damm memo on august.johnston even acknowledged that,prior to september,the quota established for coffel appears to be million.accordingly,there is sufficient evidence that the million quota representation was in fact made by stryker.further,the august plan,as well as the johnston plan,included representations that the new compensation plan contained discount bonus and expense control bonus components.viewing all reasonable inferences in coffel favor,the jury could have reasonably concluded that these three representations were promises of future performance.
the district court also ruled that,even assuming a representation or promise was made,coffel did not introduce any evidence,direct or circumstantial,of stryker intent not to perform a promise to do an act in the future is actionable fraud if representations are made with the intent to deceive and with no intention of performing as represented.formosa,at.moreover,the evidence presented must be relevant to the defendant intent at the time the representation was made.id.intent is a fact question uniquely within the realm of the trier of fact because it so depends upon the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.spoljaric percival tours.since intent to defraud is generally not susceptible to direct proof,it usually must be proven by circumstantial evidence.id.
while a party intent is determined at the time the party made the representation,it may be inferred from the party subsequent acts after the representation is made.spoljaric,at.a denial that a promise was made and a failure to perform are factors showing no intent to perform when the promise was made however,standing alone,these do not suffice.ensley cody,cir citing stanley boot bank of el paso,spoljaric,at.there must be some additional slight circumstantial evidence of fraud to support a finding of fraudulent intent.id.citing spoljaric,at hoechst celanese arthur.no pretense of performance by the defendant has also been held to be a factor showing lack of intent.spoljaric,at citing chicago,ry.titterington.
coffel asserts that the record contains both direct and additional circumstantial evidence sufficient to survive judgment as a matter of law.coffel points to a report prepared by hutchinson prior to the august meetings and argues that the report recommendations were inconsistent with the august plan and therefore the report constituted direct evidence of stryker present intent not to perform under formosa we agree.in the august meetings,johnston,hutchinson direct subordinate and vice president of the medical division,made representations to the regional managers,including a million quota for coffel and the discount and expense control bonuses,and stated that the new plan was a chance to make some big money.coffel and the other regional sales managers viewed this plan as an opportunity for a substantial increase in their compensation.in contravention of these representations,hutchinson had already prepared a report,in june,advising stryker ceo john brown that,among other problems which needed correction,stryker selling costs were very high,the commission program for the sales staff was very rich,and that t his area had lots of savings opportunity.hutchinson report also recommended combining the medical division bed and stretcher groups into one sales group.brown testified that he agreed that there should be a change in management and,in fact,hired hutchinson as president of stryker medical division to lead the reorganization and implement the recommendations contained in his report.one of the first steps taken by hutchinson was to merge the bed and stretcher groups.in august of,a new compensation plan was developed for the medical division regional managers.johnston testified that the new plan was designed to give the sales managers incentive and motivate them to work on the merger and help with training,because the merger would have failed without the efforts of stryker sales managers.stryker human resources director,at the time of the merger,testified that the compensation plan was designed to encourage the managers to sell across the merged product lines.we conclude that a jury could have found that coffel presented legally sufficient evidence that stryker discussed quotas and bonuses in the august meetings with intent to deceive and no intention of performing as represented in order to induce coffel to enter into a new compensation plan and assist with the merger.
in addition to this direct evidence,coffel also points to the subsequent acts of stryker as evidence of its lack of intent to perform under the discussed quota and bonuses in the august meetings at the time these representations were made.stryker adamantly denies that it ever made any promise to coffel based upon a million quota,and instead set coffel quota at million.coffel relies on the additional evidence that stryker immediately repudiated the million quota,delayed in distributing the final written compensation plan until october,changed other terms of the compensation plan between august and the october johnston plan,took credits against coffel quota,and failed to pay any of the regional managers the full bonus under the august plan.johnston immediate repudiation of the million quota,saying coffel quota was high enough and that the southwest was a senior veteran region and could handle more,is consistent with stryker lack of intent to keep its promises under the august compensation plan.beijing metals minerals am.bus,cir concluding that under texas law,immediate repudiation of a promise was a factor precluding summary judgment on plaintiff fraud claim.coffel agreed to a new plan in august that was to cover his compensation through december,but no formal written plan was distributed for almost two months.the jury could have inferred that this delay was evidence of fraudulent intent.spoljaric,at holding that the jury finding of fraudulent intent was supported by evidence of an eight month delay in producing a previously agreed upon bonus plan.further,various terms of the new plan changed between august and the johnston plan specifically,requirements for making the balance sell bonus increased,the total compensation possible under the bonus plan was lowered,and a disclaimer was added that stryker had sole discretion regarding changes to the plan.stryker also took credits for sales occurring prior to august against coffel quota in december,after representing in august that no such credits would be taken.lastly,coffel claims that the highest bonus stryker paid to a regional manager was,despite representations that there was a potential of earning considering all of the circumstantial evidence of stryker lack of intent in conjunction with stryker denial of the million quota and failure to keep its promise,we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding of fraudulent intent.
further,coffel argues that stryker failure to distribute or maintain information necessary for the computation of two of the four categories of the august and johnston plans shows a lack of pretense of performance,from which fraudulent intent can be inferred.regarding the expense control bonus,for keeping expenses under budget,stryker failed to distribute expense budgets to its regional managers,and thus,they were unable to compare their expenses to their budgets in order to qualify and there was no data available for coffel to calculate whether he met this component of the plan.further,evidence at trial indicated that stryker consistently denied that it maintained the information necessary to compute the discount bonus element of both compensation plans at the time the bonuses were to be paid.at trial,however,a stryker employee,bill kleczynski kleczynski testified that this data was maintained,that the bonus was calculated,and that coffel did not qualify for a discount bonus.we hold that,considering the above evidence,a jury could have reasonably concluded that stryker never intended to implement the discount and expense control components of its bonus plan.
after concluding that the trial court erred in finding no evidence that stryker never intended to perform,we must determine whether the record provides legally sufficient evidence of coffel reliance upon any of stryker representations.in order to prove reliance,the party claiming fraud must show actual and justifiable reliance on the defendant representations.haralson hutton group,cir morgan amarillo bank.thus,fraud does not exist unless the defendant representations induced the plaintiff to take a particular course of action.johnson johnson,sanchez,morgan,at.it is not necessary that the representations were the sole inducement,but the representations relied upon must have been a material factor in inducing the plaintiff action.first state bank olde colony house.
coffel argues that the district court erred in finding that he failed to put forth any evidence of reliance,contending that he relied on stryker representations by remaining in stryker employ,foregoing compensation to which he was due under the prior january compensation plan,delaying consideration of other job opportunities,and accepting more duties.the district court stated that t he only possible conduct that plaintiff could have made in reliance on any statement made at the august meeting is that he gave up the bonus plan that he had begun the year with in exchange for the new bonus plan.the court then rejected this as credible evidence of reliance because there is no evidence of any alternative that the plaintiff considered to staying in the employ of striker.we disagree with the district court and conclude that coffel decision to forego pursuing compensation earned under the january compensation plan and continue employment with stryker under the new compensation plan based upon the representations made to him in august constituted actual and justifiable reliance 
under the january contract,some bonus components were computed and paid quarterly,while other components were computed annually.under this plan,coffel met his quota and received his bonus for the first and second quarters,and he was ahead of pace to meet his quota for the third quarter at the end of july.further,by the end of the second quarter,coffel testified that he was very close to meeting the overall quota for his region and that he believed he would have made his bonus.stryker told its regional managers in august,half way through the third quarter,that the new compensation plan would cover from august through december.stryker also told coffel that he would not be paid under the january contract for july b ecause the numbers were so badly confused it would be almost impossible to extract your numbers.coffel testified at trial that based upon his experience in previous years,he gave up something of value from his january contract in accepting the new compensation plan.a jury could have reasonably concluded that coffel relied upon stryker representations in august,including the million quota figure and the discount and expense control bonus components,in concluding that the new plan would adequately compensate him for july and his expected bonuses under the january plan and in giving up that plan in exchange for what stryker represented as the new bonus plan.further,coffel presented evidence that this reliance was justified because stryker past practice was that quotas never changed after performance had begun and the president of stryker medical division testified that it was fair for the regional managers to rely upon representations in connection with the bonus plan.thus,we find that the district court failed to draw all reasonable inferences in coffel favor and conclude that the record presents legally sufficient evidence to support the jury fraud finding.
fraud damages 
to recover for fraud,the plaintiff must plead and prove that a pecuniary loss was suffered as a result of reliance upon a false representation.digrazia atlantic mut.ins.the measure of damages is the actual amount of the plaintiff loss resulting directly and proximately from fraud.id.texas law recognizes the and the measures of direct damages for common law fraud.formosa,at.the measure computes the difference between the value paid and the value received.id.the measure compensates for the actual injury sustained,measured by the difference between the value of that which he has parted with,and the value of that which has been received.id.citations and internal quotations omitted.t he measure computes the difference between the value as represented and the value received.id.the method can include lost profits on the bargain if such damages are proved with reasonable certainty,but this measure only compensates for the profits that the plaintiff would have made if the bargain had been performed as promised.id.citing restatement second of torts.
the district court concluded that there was no legally sufficient evidence supporting an award of damages for fraud.the court reasoned,and stryker argues on appeal,that coffel loss of either salary or bonuses was not reasonably certain because the testimony was mere speculation thus,there was not legally sufficient evidence of damages to support the jury award of in concluding that coffel losses were not reasonably certain,the district court cited texas case law denying recovery of lost profit damages where they were not proved with reasonable certainty thus,the court concluded that,as with lost profits,coffel must prove his lost bonuses to the same degree of reasonable certainty.
although recovery for lost profits does not require that the loss be susceptible of exact calculation,the plaintiff must do more than demonstrate that some lost profits were suffered.holt atherton,heine.w hether lost profits have been proved with reasonable certainty is a determination dependent upon the circumstances of a particular case.formosa,at.as a minimum,opinions or estimates of lost profits must be based on objective facts,figures,or data from which the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.heine,at.when a review of the surrounding circumstances establishes that the profits are not reasonably certain,there is no evidence to support the lost profits award.formosa,at.
coffel contends that the trial court erred in finding that the evidence was insufficient to support any award of fraud damages,without evaluating any of the evidence related to damages.coffel also argues that he has established damages under the measure because he proved his lost bonuses to a reasonable certainty.we agree coffel was required to prove his lost bonuses to a reasonable certainty under the measure.see restatement second of torts t he recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation in a business transaction is also entitled to recover additional damages sufficient to give him the benefit of his contract with the maker,if these damages are proved with reasonable certainty.although the district court properly recognized that reasonable certainty was the proof requirement,the court improperly equated coffel lost bonuses with lost profits,which are speculative by their very nature 
we conclude that coffel lost bonuses were not too speculative.instead,coffel provided evidence of what stryker fraudulent representations were,what coffel actual performance was during the last five months of,and what coffel bonus payment was for that period.the total potential bonus under the august plan was and coffel received a total of.although coffel did not keep his own performance numbers because he did not expect stryker to commit fraud and stryker documents include inconsistent data of coffel performance,coffel presented at least the minimum objective evidence to establish lost bonuses with reasonable certainty the jury could have considered the objective data of coffel performance and reasonably determined that coffel was entitled to for lost bonuses under the fraudulent august representations.we find legally sufficient evidence to support the award of fraud damages.
punitive damages 
the district court held that coffel was not entitled to the award of in punitive damages because coffel failed to prove fraud and,alternatively,because there was insufficient evidence of malice or intent to harm.because we found that judgment as a matter of law as to fraud was inappropriate,we address the district court latter reasoning.the district court based its conclusion on its review of employment cases from alabama,idaho,ohio,and new jersey suggesting that punitive damages are typically limited to cases where there is evidence of malice or its equivalent.while the district court recognized that spoljaric held that conscious indifference supports a punitive damages award,at,the court concluded that the facts of this case were not identical to the texas supreme court decision in spoljaric.we disagree and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the jury award of punitive damages.
a finding of intent to harm or conscious indifference to the rights of others will support an award of exemplary damages.sp
