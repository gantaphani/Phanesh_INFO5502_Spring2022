after suzanne sloane discovered that a thief had stolen her identity and ruined her credit,she notified the police and sought to have equifax information services,llc,a credit reporting service,correct the resulting errors in her credit report.the police promptly arrested and jailed the thief.but months later,equifax still had not corrected the errors in suzanne credit report.accordingly,suzanne brought this action against equifax for violations of the fair credit reporting act fcra,et.west supp.a jury found that equifax had violated the act in numerous respects and awarded suzanne in actual damages for economic losses and for mental anguish,humiliation,and emotional distress.the district court entered judgment in the amount of.in addition,without permitting equifax to file a written opposition,the court also awarded suzanne attorney fees in the amount of.on appeal,equifax challenges the award of damages and attorney fees.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
on june,suzanne sloane entered prince william hospital to deliver a baby.she left the hospital not only a new mother,but also the victim of identity theft.a recently hired hospital employee named shovana sloan noticed similarity in the women names and birth dates and,in november and december,began using suzanne social security number to obtain credit cards,loans,cash advances,and other goods and services totaling more than.at the end of january,suzanne discovered these fraudulent transactions when citibank notified her that it had cancelled her credit card and told her to contact equifax if she had any concerns.
unable to reach equifax by telephone on a friday evening,suzanne went instead to the equifax website,where she was able to access her credit report and discovered shovana sloan name and evidence of the financial crimes shovana had committed.suzanne promptly notified the police and contacted equifax,which assertedly placed a fraud alert on her credit file.equifax told suzanne to roll up her sleeves and start calling all of her creditors to notify them of the identity theft.suzanne took the next two days off from work to contact each of her creditors,and,at their direction,she submitted numerous notarized forms to correct her credit history.
suzanne,however,continued to experience problems with equifax.on march,almost two months after reporting the identity theft to equifax and despite her efforts to work with individual creditors as equifax had advised,suzanne and her husband,tracey,tried to secure a letter to buy a vacation home,but were turned down.the loan officer told them that suzanne credit score was terrible in fact,the worst the loan officer had ever that no loan would be possible until the numerous problems in suzanne equifax credit report had been corrected.the loan officer also told suzanne not to apply for additional credit in the meantime,because each credit inquiry would appear on her credit report and further lower her score.
chagrined that equifax had not yet corrected these errors in her credit report,suzanne refrained from applying for any type of consumer credit for seven months.but,in october,after the repeated breakdown of their family car,suzanne and tracey attempted to rely on suzanne credit to purchase a used car at a local dealership.following a credit check,the car salesman pulled tracey aside and informed him that it would be impossible to approve the financing so long as suzanne name appeared on the loan.similarly,when the sloanes returned to the mortgage company to obtain a home loan in january,eight months after their initial visit,they were offered only an adjustable rate loan instead of a less expensive fixed rate loan in part because of equifax still inaccurate credit report.
in frustration,on march,more than thirteen months after first reporting the identity theft to equifax,suzanne sent a formal letter to the credit reporting agency,disputing specific items in her credit report and requesting their deletion.equifax agreed to delete the majority of these items,but after assertedly verifying two accounts with citifinancial,equifax notified suzanne that it would not remove these two items.at trial,equifax admitted that under its verified victim policy,it should have automatically removed these citifinancial items at suzanne request,but it failed to do so in violation of its own written procedures.
two months later,on may,suzanne again wrote to equifax,still disputing the two citifinancial accounts,and now also contesting two washington mutual accounts that equifax had previously deleted but had mistakenly restored to suzanne report.when equifax attempted to correct these mistakes,it exacerbated matters further by generating a second credit file bearing shovana sloan name but containing suzanne social security number.compounding this mistake,on may,equifax sent a letter to suzanne house addressed to shovana sloan,warning shovana that she was possibly the victim of identity theft and offering to sell her a service to monitor her credit file.then,on june,equifax sent copies of both credit reports to suzanne notably,both credit reports still contained the disputed citifinancial accounts.
the stress of these problems weighed on suzanne and significantly contributed to the deterioration of her marriage to tracey.as a result of the constant denials of credit,she refused to seek routine credit from local stores,which,in turn,sparked angry recriminations from tracey.in may,the credit situation forced tracey,a high school teacher,to abandon his plans to take a sabbatical during which he had hoped to develop land for modular homes with his father.the sloanes frequently fought during the day and slept in separate rooms at night.in desperation,suzanne sought the name of a marriage counselor,but her husband refused to go.for his part,tracey researched how the couple could secure a divorce and left the information for suzanne to find when she arrived at home from work one day.also,during this period,suzanne was frequently unable to sleep at night,and as her insomnia worsened,she found herself nodding off while driving home from work in the evening.even after the couple took a vacation to reconcile in august,when they returned home,they were greeted with the denial of a line of credit from wachovia bank.two months later,in november,suzanne again applied to wachovia for a line of credit,and again the bank turned her down.
on november,months of struggle to correct her credit filed this action against equifax,trans union,llc,experian information solutions,and citifinancial,alleging violations of the fcra.after settling a separate suit against prince william hospital and the personnel company that placed shovana sloan in the hospital accounting department,suzanne settled her claims in this action against experian,trans union,and citifinancial.equifax,however,refused to settle.thus,the case proceeded to trial with equifax the sole remaining defendant.the jury returned a verdict against equifax,awarding suzanne for economic loss and for mental anguish,humiliation,and emotional distress.
equifax moved for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial or remittitur on the jury award of damages for emotional distress.the district court denied equifax motions and then,without permitting equifax to submit an opposition to suzanne request for attorney fees,ordered equifax to pay in attorney fees.this appeal followed.
congress enacted the fcra to require that consumer credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit,personnel,insurance,and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information.b.
in this case,the jury specifically found,via a special verdict,that suzanne proved by a preponderance of the evidence that equifax violated the fcra by negligently failing to follow reasonable procedures designed to assure maximum accuracy on her consumer credit report failing to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether disputed information in her credit report was inaccurate failing to delete information from the report that it found after reinvestigation to be inaccurate,incomplete,or unverified and reinserting information into her credit file that it had previously deleted.on appeal,equifax does not challenge the jury findings that suzanne proved that it violated the fcra in all of these respects.
the fcra provides a private cause of action for those damaged by violations of the statute.see.a successful plaintiff can recover both actual and punitive damages for willful violations of the fcra,id.a,and actual damages for negligent violations,id.a.actual damages may include not only economic damages,but also damages for humiliation and mental distress.see,guimond trans union credit info,cir johnson dep t of treasury,irs,cir millstone reports,cir,aff g.the statute also provides that a successful plaintiff suing under the fcra may recover reasonable attorney fees.a,a.
equifax does not challenge the constitutionality or applicability of any of these statutory provisions.rather,the company simply insists that,despite its numerous statutory violations,the jury erred in awarding suzanne damages and the court erred in awarding attorney fees.we consider each of equifax contentions in turn.
equifax initially contends that the district court erred in refusing to nullify the jury verdict and grant it judgment as a matter of law.a court may award judgment as a matter of law only if it determines that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party.a.thus,when a jury has returned its verdict,a court may grant judgment as a matter of law only if,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party and drawing every legitimate inference in that party favor,the court determines that the only conclusion a reasonable jury could have reached is one in favor of the moving party.figg schroeder,cir.the district court concluded that it could not so hold in this case and therefore denied equifax motion.we review de novo the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.anderson russell,cir.
equifax first argues that because suzanne assertedly suffered a single,indivisible injury,she should not recover any damages from equifax or,alternatively,her recovery should be reduced to take account of her prior settlements with other defendants.according to equifax,the prior settlements have fully,or almost fully,compensated suzanne for all of her injuries.
equifax relies on the one satisfaction rule to support its argument.see chisholm uhp projects,cir t his equitable doctrine operates to reduce a plaintiff recovery from the nonsettling defendant to prevent the plaintiff from recovering twice from the same assessment of liability.but,in the case at hand,we can not find,as a matter of law,that suzanne has suffered from a single,indivisible harm that has already been redressed by other parties.see id.the essential requirement for the one satisfaction rule is that the amounts recovered by settlement and the judgment must represent common damages arising from a single,indivisible harm.
to the contrary,suzanne provided credible evidence that her emotional and economic damages resulted from separate acts by separate parties.she did not attempt to hold any of the credit reporting agencies responsible for damages arising from either the identity theft itself or the initial inaccuracies that the theft generated in her credit reports.moreover,although some of suzanne interactions with equifax overlapped with exchanges with other credit reporting agencies,her encounters with equifax both predate and postdate these other exchanges.for example,suzanne initially contacted equifax on february,more than a year before she contacted experian and trans union,and equifax reporting errors persisted long after trans union and experian had rectified the errors in their reports.
further,during the period when suzanne attempted to correct the mistakes made by all three agencies,each agency produced reports with different inaccuracies,and each agency either corrected or exacerbated these mistakes independently of the others.thus,even during this period,the inaccuracies in equifax credit reports caused suzanne discrete injuries independent of those caused by the other credit reporting agencies.
for all of these reasons,we reject equifax argument that suzanne has suffered from a single,indivisible injury or has been doubly compensated as a consequence of her prior settlements 
equifax next argues that the evidence does not support any award for economic losses.equifax claims that only speculation and conjecture support such an award,and so the district court erred in denying equifax motion for judgment as to this award.
we disagree.the evidence at trial in this case clearly demonstrates that on numerous occasions suzanne attempted to secure lines of credit from a variety of financial institutions,only to be either denied outright or offered credit on less advantageous terms that she might have received absent equifax improper conduct.at times,these financial institutions consulted credit reports from other agencies,but at other times these institutions relied exclusively on the erroneous credit information provided by equifax.based on these incidents,we find that there is a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found that equifax conduct resulted in economic losses for suzanne.therefore,the district court did not err in denying equifax motion regarding this award.
additionally,equifax asserts that the district court erred in refusing to order remittitur of the mental anguish,humiliation,and emotional distress damages award to no more than.see.a see also cline stores,cir.equifax contends that the jury award of is inconsistent with awards in similar cases and is disproportionate to any actual injury proved at trial.suzanne,by contrast,contends that the evidence provides more than adequate support for the jury award.to resolve this question,we set forth the relevant governing principles,apply these principles to the evidence before the jury,and compare the evidence and emotional distress award in suzanne case with the evidence and award in all assertedly relevant cases.our analysis leads us to the conclusion that both equifax and suzanne positions must be rejected.for reasons that we explain below,we find that the jury emotional distress award was in fact excessive,but not to the extent that equifax maintains.
we begin with federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides that if a court concludes that a jury award of compensatory damages is excessive,it may order a new trial nisi remittitur.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.we have long recognized that the decision as to whether to grant a new trial on such grounds is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court and such determinations will be reversed on appeal only upon a showing of abuse of discretion giv ing the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge.cline,at internal quotation marks omitted.a district court abuses its discretion only by upholding an award of damages when the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence or based on evidence which is false.id.quoting atlas food,crane vendors,cir.
in this case,the district court found that the jury emotional distress award was not an unreasonable conclusion from this evidence.the court noted that the jury could base its award on equifax specific actions,as distinct from those of the other credit reporting agencies,and that equifax actions directly led to the mounting frustration and distress that suzanne felt for almost two years.as one example of equifax specific actions,the court recalled the letter that equifax sent to suzanne,many months after she had notified equifax of the identity theft,bearing the name of the identity thief and warning the thief,not suzanne,that the thief personal information was in peril.furthermore,the district court underscored the deference accorded jury verdicts,noting that,in the present case,a jury of ordinary people from the community,after having listen e
