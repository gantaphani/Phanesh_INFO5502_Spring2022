defendants daniel lubelan and jerry ellsworth appeal the denial of their motion for summary judgment brought pursuant to fed.civ.c.defendants argue that the district court mistakenly concluded that genuine issues of material fact precluded the entry of summary judgment and that it failed to consider whether defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff geraldine livermore fourth amendment claims.defendants argue further that livermore state law claims of gross negligence fail as a matter of michigan law.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court denial of defendants motion for summary judgment.
thomas crosslin and decedent roland rohm operated the rainbow farms campground rainbow farms in cass county,michigan.crosslin and rohm advocated the legalization of marijuana and often sponsored concerts and on rainbow farms to espouse their views.after receiving complaints about illegal drug use occurring on rainbow farms,the cass county sheriff department initiated an undercover investigation of crosslin and rohm.crosslin,as owner of rainbow farms,was subsequently charged with violating public health laws and forfeiture proceedings against crosslin and his property were initiated.
after a search warrant was issued,investigators discovered a marijuana grow operation in the basement of crosslin and rohm residence on rainbow farms.consequently,more criminal charges were filed and a family independence agency investigation began,resulting in the removal of rohm young son,robert,from crosslin and rohm residence on rainbow farms.in august,crosslin and rohm violated an injunction prohibiting them from sponsoring any more events on the farm and were subsequently held in contempt by the cass county circuit court.
on august,after failing to appear at a scheduled show cause hearing in connection with their contempt order,crosslin and rohm set fire to the outbuildings on rainbow farms and barricaded themselves in their residence.the cass county sheriff department set up observation points around rainbow farms,closed off the perimeter,and requested assistance from the michigan state police emergency services team emergency services to resolve the standoff at rainbow farms and to arrest crosslin and rohm.crosslin confronted the arriving police officials armed with a gun and refused them permission to enter his property.
that evening,crosslin shot at and struck a news helicopter as it flew over his property,taking aerial footage of the fires.emergency services,commanded by defendant lieutenant jerry ellsworth,and fbi personnel responded to cass county request for assistance and began arriving on the morning of september.on september,crosslin and an identified as bradon their residence and walked through the woods to a neighboring home,where they broke in and stole supplies.on their return,crosslin was shot and killed by an fbi agent in.peoples was arrested.
during the early morning hours of september,emergency services began negotiating with rohm by phone.rohm indicated that he would come out of the house and surrender at if he were allowed to speak with his son.the negotiator agreed,and rohm was instructed to come out to the street unarmed with his hands up.the rainbow farms residence began burning at that morning,apparently set on fire by rohm.at approximately,rohm exited the house armed with a rifle and hid between two trees in the backyard,near the northwest corner of the house.what happened next is the subject of dispute between the parties.
after rohm fled his residence and hid between the trees,emergency services members sergeant steven homrich,sergeant david bower,and ellsworth approached rohm in a light armored vehicle lav because of the lav armor plating,emergency services radios did not work inside the vehicle.to allow radio communication,sgts.homrich and bower were placed in open hatches in the roof of the lav,exposed from their to the tops of their heads.the lav approached rohm residence as ellsworth identified himself via a loudspeaker and directed rohm to surrender,but sgts.homrich and bower were unable to see him due to the lack of daylight and the smoke emitting from the house.
emergency services snipers on an observation point approximately yards northwest of the house,however,were able to see rohm.defendant daniel lubelan,a michigan state police trooper,observed rohm in a crouched or kneeling position,holding his rifle at waist level and turning his torso back and forth as if looking for someone.according to lubelan,rohm identified the lav and aimed his gun in its direction,tracking the lav as it moved.lubelan believed that rohm was pointing his gun toward an exposed officer in the lav and fired two shots at rohm,killing him 
on august,plaintiff geraldine livermore,rohm mother and personal representative,filed a complaint in the eastern district of michigan.livermore alleged that lubelan used excessive force in shooting rohm,and that ellsworth acted negligently in creating the circumstances that led to rohm death.on november,defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that lubelan use of force was reasonable,that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,and that livermore gross negligence claims failed as a matter of michigan law on the facts of this case.the district court denied defendants motion on february,finding that genuine issues of material fact existed 
defendants filed this interlocutory appeal on march.
we first consider whether we have jurisdiction to address defendants interlocutory appeal.title limits this court jurisdiction to final decisions of the district courts of the united states a district court denial of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision pursuant to,but only to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.estate of carter city of detroit,cir quoting mitchell forsyth,d.a defendant raising a qualified immunity defense may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.johnson jones,d see also berryman rieger,cir a defendant who is denied qualified immunity may file an interlocutory appeal with this court only if that appeal involves the abstract or pure legal issue of whether the facts alleged by the plaintiff constitute a violation of clearly established law.nevertheless,that the district court here denied defendants motion for summary judgment on the grounds that genuine issues of material fact exist does not necessarily preclude this court jurisdiction over defendants appeal.rather,as this court has recognized,regardless of the district court reasons for denying qualified immunity,this court may exercise jurisdiction over the defendants appeal to the extent it raises questions of law.williams mehra,cir en banc see also turner scott,cir.
language in our earlier decisions interpreting johnson suggests that where,as here,the appellant fails to concede the facts as alleged by the appellee,this court is completely deprived of jurisdiction over the appellant interlocutory appeal.see berryman,at if the defendant disputes the plaintiff version of the story,the defendant must nonetheless be willing to concede the most favorable view of the facts to the plaintiff for purposes of the appeal.subsequent cases,however,have rejected that approach and clarified that we may consider a pure question of law,despite the defendants failure to concede the plaintiff version of the facts for purposes of the interlocutory appeal if aside from the impermissible arguments regarding disputes of fact,the defendant also raises the purely legal question of whether the facts alleged support a claim of violation of clearly established law,then there is an issue over which this court has jurisdiction.estate of carter,at internal quotations and citation omitted see also smith cupp,cir but see mckenna city of royal oak,et,cir holding this court lacks jurisdiction to consider interlocutory appeal where appellant relies solely on disputed facts.we therefore conclude that this court has jurisdiction over defendants interlocutory appeal to consider whether,accepting the facts as alleged by livermore,defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from livermore claim of excessive force.see mehra,at instructing that court has jurisdiction to consider whether facts,as alleged by plaintiff,entitle defendant to summary judgment berryman,at same.
through the use of qualified immunity,the law shields governmental officials performing discretionary functions from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.solomon auburn hills police dep t,cir quoting anderson creighton,d.the supreme court instructs lower courts to perform a inquiry to determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.saucier katz,d.courts should first determine whether the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.if the plaintiff establishes that a constitutional violation occurred,a court must next consider whether the right was clearly established.id.when a defendant raises a defense of qualified immunity,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.silberstein city of dayton,cir.
the court has emphasized that the qualified immunity analysis must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.saucier,at.thus,in the excessive force context,it is not enough that a plaintiff establishes that the defendant use of force was excessive under the fourth amendment.to defeat qualified immunity,the plaintiff must show that the defendant had notice that the manner in which the force was used had been previously proscribed 
t here is no doubt that precedent clearly establishes the general proposition that use of force is contrary to the fourth amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness.yet that is not enough.rather,we emphasized in anderson creighton,that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right,d.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.
brosseau haugen,d quoting saucier,at.
sergeant lubelan 
as saucier and brosseau instruct,we must first determine whether lubelan violated rohm constitutional rights by shooting him.it is that individuals have a constitutional right to be free from excessive force during an arrest.see,graham connor,d solomon,at.a ll claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive or the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure of a free citizen should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard graham,at.t he fourth amendment prohibits a police officer use of deadly force to seize an unarmed,suspect.sample bailey,cir citing tennessee garner,d.rather,the use of deadly force is only constitutionally permissible if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others garner,at.see also sample,at noting that only in rare instances may an officer seize a suspect by use of deadly force.the court has identified three factors that lower courts should consider in determining the reasonableness of force used the severity of the crime at issue whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the police officers or others and whether the suspect actively resisted arrest or attempted to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.smoak hall,cir.these factors are not an exhaustive list,as the ultimate inquiry is whether the totality of the circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure.john hickey,cir quoting graham,at.
considering the totality of the facts and circumstances as alleged by livermore,we hold that lubelan acted reasonably in firing at rohm.several factors compel a finding that rohm posed a serious threat rohm helped cause the standoff that led to crosslin death by along with crosslin setting fire to the buildings on rainbow farms,he was present when crosslin fired shots at a news helicopter,than surrender as agreed exited his burning residence armed with a rifle.in addition,michigan state police officers were told that rohm and crosslin had wired their residence with explosives.furthermore,although livermore contends that rohm was not aiming a gun at the lav when he was shot,the ultimately fired by lubelan hit the rifle stock of rohm gun before entering rohm chest.thus,plaintiff own expert,thornton,concedes that rohm was holding his rifle when he was shot 
despite these factors,livermore argues that lubelan acted unreasonably in firing at rohm.livermore relies on thornton affidavit to argue that rohm was not pointing his rifle at the lav when he was shot,and on statements made by sgts.homrich and bower that they were inside the lav at the time of the shooting.thus,livermore argues,rohm did not pose an immediate threat when he was fired upon.we disagree.
first,we note our disagreement with the district court that sgts.homrich and bower statements create a genuine issue of material fact concerning their whereabouts at the time rohm was shot.in the statements at from a michigan state police incident report filed immediately after the shooting at rainbow bower and homrich state that after they left their hatches and went down into the lav,they were informed by the perimeter personnel that the suspect had been shot.these statements,however,only suggest that sgts.homrich and bower were inside the lav when they learned that rohm had been shot they are silent as to whether the officers had been exposed at the time lubelan fired at rohm.in our view,these statements do not contradict homrich deposition testimony that he was exposed at the time rohm was shot.
moreover,in determining whether rohm posed a threat of serious harm at the time he was shot,we must focus on lubelan perspective 
the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.
smith freland,cir quoting graham,at.lubelan testified that he saw an officer exposed through the hatch of the lav before he fired at rohm,and that he fired at rohm in order to prevent rohm from firing at the lav.even assuming that rohm was not aiming his rifle at the lav when he was shot,we nonetheless conclude that lubelan had probable cause to believe that rohm posed a serious threat to the officers in the to his proximity to the lav while armed with a rifle,his prior violent behavior,and his continued refusal to surrender and face arrest.garner,at.holding the use of deadly force is constitutionally permissible only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others.
because livermore has not shown that lubelan used excessive force in shooting at rohm,we need not address whether rohm had a clearly established right to be free from being fired upon.saucier,at.lubelan request for qualified immunity should have been granted,and the district court denial of defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to livermore claim of excessive force against lubelan is reversed.
lieutenant ellsworth 
livermore also asserts that ellsworth,who commanded the emergency services team and attempted to confront rohm in the lav,intentionally or recklessly created the circumstances leading to rohm death.with respect to this claim,the district court stated that 
plaintiff law enforcement practices expert,van blaricom,has also provided reliable opinion evidence that the police practices used and ordered by jerry ellswor
