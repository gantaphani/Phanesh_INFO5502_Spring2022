in this consolidated limitation action,claimants,hurricane katrina flood victims,filed claims against the limitation petitioners,private companies that operated dredging vessels along the mississippi river gulf outlet pursuant to contracts with the united states army corps of engineers.claimants suffered damages from the flooding of orleans and bernard parishes when several levee systems failed as a result of the erosion of protective wetlands allegedly caused by the limitation petitioners negligent maintenance dredging operations.the limitation petitioners moved to dismiss the claims under federal rules of civil procedure b and c.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,finding that the limitation petitioners owed no duty to the claimants because the devastation caused by hurricane katrina was not a foreseeable result of the allegedly negligent conduct of any limitation petitioner.claimants timely appealed.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo is a navigational channel that connects the gulf of mexico with the industrial canal in new orleans,bisecting the marshy wetlands of bernard parish and chandeleur sound.it was built between and by the united states army corps of engineers corps of engineers pursuant to congressional authorization.from to,the corps of engineers performed maintenance dredging to maintain the navigability of the mrgo.beginning in,the corps of engineers contracted with numerous private dredging companies,including the limitation petitioners,to assist the corps of engineers in maintenance dredging along the mrgo.from to,the corps of engineers awarded contracts to private dredging companies,many to the limitation petitioners,to dredge the length of the mrgo channel.
claimants in the present action,who number in the tens of thousands,are individuals,businesses,and other entities who own property that was damaged due to flooding after hurricane katrina made landfall on august.they contend that the limitation petitioners maintenance dredging operations caused severe damage to the louisiana wetlands,which provide a natural barrier against tidal surge from storms and hurricanes.this damage to the wetlands caused an amplification of the storm surge in the new orleans region during hurricane katrina,which increased the pressure on the levees and flood walls along the mrgo,leading to levee breaches and the subsequent flooding of bernard parish and orleans parish.
prior to the instant action,two separate class action suits reed and ackerson were filed in the district court for the eastern district of louisiana by plaintiffs seeking damages from the united states and from private companies that performed maintenance dredging in the mrgo pursuant to government contracts.after consolidation of the reed and ackersonsuits,the government and the defendant dredgers moved to dismiss.
before the district court ruled on the defendants motions,several of the dredgers filed petitions in the eastern district of louisiana under the limitation of liability act,seeking exoneration from limitation of liability for all claims for any damages arising out of hurricane katrina as a result of their maintenance dredging activities for the corps of engineers the limitation actions were consolidated into the present case the limitation action and transferred to the judge presiding over the reed and ackerson suits.
the district court subsequently granted the motions to dismiss the claims against the government and the defendant dredgers in the reed and ackerson suits see in re katrina canal breaches consol,wl.the district court dismissed the claims against the government for lack of subject matter jurisdiction id.at.the district court dismissed the claims against the dredging companies under the government contractor immunity doctrines articulated in yearsley ross constr.and boyle united techs.the district court found that,because the dredging companies were alleged to have performed their contracts in conformity with the corps of engineers specifications,and were not alleged to have performed negligently or absent due care,the dredgers,as government contractors,were immune from liability for any damages caused by their dredging operations for the corps of engineers.in re katrina,wl,at.we affirmed on appeal,finding that the pleadings attack congress policy of creating and maintaining the mrgo,not any separate act of negligence by the contractor defendants,and therefore the district court did not err in dismissing the action on the basis that yearsley immunity applied.see ackerson,at.
following dismissal of the class action suits,claimants filed claims against the dredgers in the limitation action.many of the claims asserted in the limitation action were substantially similar to those brought against the dredgers in the reed and ackerson suits.but the claimants also added new allegations of negligence to defeat the dredgers government contractor immunity defenses,as well as the dredgers entitlement to exoneration from or limitation of liability under the limitation of liability act.specifically,they alleged that the limitation petitioners failed to perform their dredging work with due care and that they performed their dredging work in the mrgo negligently.claimants also alleged that the limitation petitioners violated requirements imposed by their contracts with the corps of engineers and by various federal and state statutes and regulations 
limitation petitioners and the vessels failed to follow requirements of cfr parts,particularly cfr c and cfr b and executive order made applicable thereby.
limitation petitioners and the vessels deviated from failed to execute their dredging activities in the manner required by the corps of engineers,or by reasonably precise specifications issued by the corps of engineers if they were issued by nationwide permits,specific permits,or general authorizations for dredging issued by or obtained by the corps of engineers pursuant to cfr and,and all other regulations that limitation petitioners and the vessels were required to follow.
limitation petitioners and the vessels failed to follow louisiana state dredging requirements made applicable by cfr,including those contained in chapter,sections and of the louisiana administrative code related to dredging activities 
limitation petitioners and the vessels have performed advance maintenance and dredging of the mrgo,going beyond its authorized project depth.limitation petitioners and the vessels have also performed dredging,also for advance maintenance purposes.limitation petitioners and the vessels also overcut the slope of the channel,based on the potential for undisturbed material to slough downward to the channel,and for other reasons,changing the designed slope of the channel banks,thereby enlarging the design width of the channel,causing wetlands along the banks of the channel to erode,and causing the width of the channel to increase.these activities were conducted without authorization,approval or control of the corps of engineers,and were outside of any reasonably detailed specifications provided by the corps of engineers for the work.these activities by limitation petitioners and the vessels constitute negligence and violate regulations enacted to control dredging activities.
thus,in contrast to the reed and ackerson cases,the claimants alleged that their injuries resulted from the erosion to the wetlands caused by the limitation petitioners negligent dredging,performed in breach of the standards set out in their corps of engineers contracts and various rules and regulations alleged to apply to their operations,rather than from the very existence of the mrgo or by any dredging performed by the corps of engineers or the limitation petitioners in conformity with their government contracts.
the limitation petitioners moved to dismiss under rule b and rule c.the district court granted the motion,holding as a matter of law that the limitation petitioners did not owe a duty to the claimants,and were therefore not liable,because the claimants hurricane damages were not the legally foreseeable consequence of the limitation petitioners allegedly negligent dredging activities.relying on a standard that we articulated in consolidated aluminum bean,cir,the district court held that the harm was too attenuated from the alleged cause to be legally foreseeable,noting 
i t is simply inconceivable to this court why discrete acts of dredging after by the myriad dredgers would be sufficient for the specific dredger to foresee the absolutely devastating and cataclysmic damages that occurred to bernard and orleans parishes.simply put,the limitation dredgers could not have anticipated that its alleged negligent dredging would be a cause thereof.
furthermore,the district court held that the pleadings failed sufficiently to allege a causal connection between any of the limitation petitioners alleged negligent acts and any of the claimants damages.i t seems inexorable that in order to find liability,there would have to be some group liability finding in reference to causation.claimants have cited no case in the maritime law context where a group liability theory has been recognized or applied.the district court concluded,t o recover on this theory would obviate proof of individual causation and the theory is therefore fatally flawed.claimants timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
the claimants argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing their claims pursuant to rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that the district court had jurisdiction over their claims under alternatively,they argue that,had the district court lacked jurisdiction,it erred in reaching the merits of their claims and dismissing them with prejudice under rule c for failure to state a claim.
the claimants are correct that when,as here,a rule b motion is filed in conjunction with other rule motions,the court should consider the rule b jurisdictional attack before addressing any attack on the merits to prevent a court without jurisdiction from prematurely dismissing a case with prejudice.ramming united states,cir.furthermore,they correctly note that if the district court had held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction,it should have entered dismissal without prejudice to allow the claimants to retry their claims in a court with jurisdiction to hear them.see id.the court dismissal of a plaintiff case because the plaintiff lacks subject matter jurisdiction is not a determination of the merits and does not prevent the plaintiff from pursuing a claim in a court that does have proper jurisdiction.
however,it is clear from the substance of the district court opinion that the district court did not dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.although the district court referenced both rules b and c when granting the motion to dismiss,the entirety of the district court analysis addressed the merits of the claimants pleadings.the district court stated no basis for dismissal under rule b,and we agree with the claimants that none exists.accordingly,because the district court did not hold that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction,and as there is no basis for such a holding,the district court did not err in entering dismissal with prejudice on the merits under rule c.we therefore conclude that the district court reference to rule b does not provide a basis for reversal

duty and foreseeability 
the district court held that the limitation petitioners owed no duty to the claimants,and therefore were not liable,because the individual dredgers could not have foreseen that discrete acts of negligent dredging could have resulted in the absolutely devastating and cataclysmic damages that occurred to bernard and orleans parishes.
on appeal,claimants contend that their damages were foreseeable because it is well known,as a matter of general knowledge,that the wetlands provide storm surge mitigation that the levees protecting cities and towns in the coastal areas were designed with the assumption that the buffering action provided by the wetlands would remain intact and that dredging activities cause damage to the wetlands.accordingly,they contend,the district court erred in holding that the limitation petitioners did not and could not have foreseen that flooding could result from the damage to the wetlands caused by their maintenance dredging operations.
additionally,the claimants contend that the district court erroneously disregarded the securities and exchange commission sec filings of great lakes dredge dock great lakes,one of the limitation petitioners,that the claimants submitted to the district court in briefing.the claimants argue that in portions of these filings,great lakes acknowledges that its operations carry environmental risks,including flooding that its operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations related to the prevention of environmental damage,including damage to the wetlands and that erosion to louisiana wetlands has increased the region exposure to hurricanes.the claimants contend that these statements contradict the limitation petitioners assertion that the flooding that caused the claimants injuries was not foreseeable.the district court concluded that these documents were rather standard sec filings,and that great lakes acknowledgment that its operating risks include flooding does not indicate that great lakes could foresee the catastrophic damages alleged here under the test set forth in consolidated aluminum.
the parties agree that maritime law governs the claimants claims,which relate to the limitation petitioners conduct of operations on a navigable waterway.see creppel shell oil,cir torts occurring in navigable waters are governed by maritime law.n egligence is an actionable wrong under general maritime law,and the elements of that tort are essentially the same as negligence under the common law.withhart otto candies,cir.to state a claim for relief under maritime law,the plaintiff must demonstrate that there was a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,breach of that duty,injury sustained by the plaintiff,and a causal connection between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury.canal barge torco oil,cir quoting in re.smith,cir alteration in original.
