in this action,brought under diversity jurisdiction,see a,the plaintiffs won a total of in damages.on appeal,the defendant presses four claims of error.none has merit.consequently,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the jury supportably could have found the following facts.on october,the plaintiffs,francis santos and his wife,diane,then visiting puerto rico from massachusetts,were guests at the wyndham condado plaza hotel and casino the hotel.as santos entered the hotel pool,he slipped and fell,sustaining serious injuries.
the steps that santos used to enter the pool were large and semicircular,under water,with glossy tiles at the edge of each step.expert testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiffs indicated that the variable friction between the steps and their edges,the slipperiness of the glossy tiles when wet,the geometric configuration of the semicircular steps,and the absence of a handrail combined to create a perilous condition.knowing that guests used the steps to enter and exit the pool,the hotel neither made them safe for this readily foreseeable use nor warned of the inherent danger.these failures,the jury plausibly could have found,caused the accident 
francis and diane santos charged the hotel with negligence and sued for damages in puerto rico federal district court.see laws ann.tit.the district court empaneled a jury and a trial commenced on may.the plaintiffs presented the bulk of their case in chief on the first day of trial.because their medical expert,carlos grovas,was unavailable,the district court reordered the proof,see.a,and compelled the hotel to present its entire case before the plaintiffs presented grovas testimony the plaintiffs had,however,already presented all of their liability evidence.grovas testified after the defendant rested.the hotel did not ask to recall its medical expert or to present any rebuttal evidence on damages.
after the evidence had closed,counsel offered summations and the court instructed the jury.the hotel proffered an elaborate special verdict form,see.a,but the district court rejected it in favor of a simpler approach.using the court verdict forms,the jurors found negligence on the hotel part,absolved the plaintiffs of any comparative negligence,and proceeded to award francis santos for his injuries and diane santos for consequential damages,loss of consortium.this timely appeal followed.
on appeal,the hotel seeks to challenge i the district court alteration of the order of proof ii its decision to allow the plaintiffs liability expert to testify iii its rejection of a tendered special verdict form and iv its denial of the hotel motion for judgment as a matter of law.we address these claims of error sequentially.
order of proof 
the hotel strives to convince us that it was unfairly burdened,and the plaintiffs unfairly advantaged,by the district court alteration of the order of proof.we are not persuaded.
it is axiomatic that district courts enjoy wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of evidence.morales feliciano rullán,cir see.a mandating that t he court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of presenting evidence.we review determinations for abuse of discretion and will set aside a verdict based on a challenge to such a determination only if the complaining party musters a substantial showing of unfair prejudice.see morales feliciano,at see also elgabri lekas,cir.
here,the hotel complains that it was unduly prejudiced in two ways by having only one hour following the court rule a order within which to gather and prepare its witnesses and by what it characterizes as an improper shifting of the burden of proof on the issue of damages.both plaints lack force.
as to witness preparation,it is plain that such preparation could not have been substantially affected by grovas delayed appearance.after all,grovas trial testimony did not last long it comprises only thirty transcript pages.this means that even if grovas had testified before the defense went forward,the hotel would have had only an extra hour,at most,to gather and primp its witnesses.minor scheduling changes of this sort occur on a daily basis in the course of trial practice,and counsel must be ready to deal with them.in the absence of special none are present tweakings of the order of proof do not work unfair prejudice.
the hotel professed concern about strikes us as chimerical.the district court,sensitive to this possibility,gave a crystal clear set of jury instructions,telling the jurors several times that the burden of proof as to all elements of the case,including damages,rested with the plaintiffs.we can presume that the jury followed these instructions,see richardson marsh,d recognizing the almost invariable assumption that jurors follow their instructions evans avery,cir similar,and the instructions given here cured any conceivable prejudice.
the short of it is that the district court decision to allow a lone witness to testify out of order was not,on the facts of this case,anything close to an abuse of discretion 
expert testimony 
the hotel attacks the admission of testimony from the plaintiffs liability expert,ricardo galdós.it questions both galdós qualifications and his scientific methodology.
galdós testimony admittedly was crucial to the plaintiffs case.he testified,in substance,that a defect in the premises led to santos fall.that dangerous condition was comprised of a combination of factors,such as variable friction between the steps and their edges,the use of an unsuitable type of tile at the edges,the peculiar configuration of the stairs,and the absence of a handrail we review the district court decision to admit or exclude expert opinion testimony for abuse of discretion.see kumho tire carmichael,d.we discern none here.
federal rule of evidence permits opinion testimony by a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education.the hotel notes that galdós has no experience in the construction or design of swimming pools per se,and argues that he should not have been allowed to testify as an expert in this instance.but experts come in various shapes and sizes there is no mechanical checklist for measuring whether an expert is qualified to offer opinion evidence in a particular field.united states hoffman,cir explaining that e xpertise is not necessarily synonymous with a string of academic degrees or multiple memberships in learned societies and emphasizing the value of extensive practical experience.the test is whether,under the totality of the circumstances,the witness can be said to be qualified as an expert in a particular field through any one or more of the five bases enumerated in rule,skill,experience,training,or education.see united states shay,cir united states paiva,cir.
in this case,the record reveals that galdós holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering,that he is certified by the national academy of safety as a tribologist that is,someone who deals with friction and the application of friction to the way pedestrians walk,and that in his professional capacity he has analyzed approximately accidents since.given this background,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in deeming galdós qualified to offer expert testimony in a case.see,correa cruisers,a div.of kcs int l,cir hoffman,at.
rule also requires that the testimony be based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony be the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness ha ve applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.in undertaking this reliability review,an inquiring court may consider a wide array of factors,including but not limited to the verifiability of the expert theory or technique,the error rate inherent therein,whether the theory or technique has been published subjected to peer review,and its level of acceptance within the scientific community.pepsi cola of bottling,cir citing daubert merrell dow,d.in the last analysis,the reliability inquiry must be flexible and.see daubert,at.
galdós testified that,in addition to interviewing francis santos,he visited the hotel pool,
