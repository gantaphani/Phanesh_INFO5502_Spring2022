asserting diversity jurisdiction,the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court seeking damages under texas law for the death of louis acridge in a texas nursing home.the defendants evangelical lutheran good samaritan society,jerry adams,elaine morrow,and sherri lunsford harris appeal the denial of their motion for summary judgment on official immunity grounds.they also raise the issue of whether there is federal subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying proceeding.because we conclude that complete diversity among the parties is lacking,we vacate the district court order denying summary judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
facts and procedural background 
in,louis acridge moved from colorado to new mexico,where he was employed as a sheriff and lived with his wife,mary acridge.in,mary placed louis in a retirement center in new mexico as a result of a rapid deterioration in his mental status caused by alzheimer dementia.mary became dissatisfied with the treatment louis was receiving and,in,transferred him to the farwell convalescent center in farwell,texas by that time,louis was completely unable to take care of himself,was disoriented as to time and place,had little memory,and was virtually unaware of his surroundings.when mary moved louis to texas,she applied for and received medicaid benefits from the texas department of human services.the texas medicaid statute states

after being at the center for more than a year,louis acridge was placed in a room with henry plyler,another resident.plyler had a history of abusive behavior toward past roommates.on june,staff members at the center discovered acridge in his bed,covered in blood a ballpoint pen protruded from his right eye.an investigation revealed that plyler had beaten acridge on the head with a coffee mug and then stabbed him in the eye with a pen.the pen penetrated acridge brain he died eight hours later as a result of this wound.
in their first amended complaint filed june,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants negligently failed to protect louis acridge from plyler and that this failure was the proximate cause of acridge death.the plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants were negligent in failing to warn acridge and his family of the known risks that plyler presented to his roommates.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit on the grounds that no federal subject matter jurisdiction existed the plaintiffs brought suit in federal court under diversity jurisdiction,but the defendants argued that complete diversity was lacking because both louis acridge and the defendants were texas domiciliaries.the district court denied this motion without stated reasons.
the defendants also moved for summary judgment,claiming that each defendant was entitled to official immunity from suit.the defendants further asserted that plyler unforeseeable criminal conduct was a superceding cause of acridge death that absolved the defendants of liability for any alleged negligent conduct.the district court,again without stated reasons,denied the defendants motion for summary judgment.
the defendants now bring this interlocutory appeal of the district court denial of their summary judgment motion,arguing that the court should have granted their motion claiming official immunity.the defendants also urge us to examine whether there is diversity jurisdiction over these claims.
ii.whether diversity jurisdiction exists over these claims 
federal court jurisdiction here hinges on the domicile of mary acridge in her capacity as independent executrix of the estate of louis acridge.under c,the legal representative of the estate of a decedent is deemed to be a citizen of the same state as the decedent for diversity purposes.jurisdiction in this case rests on a single question when mary acridge moved louis acridge into a texas nursing home,did he become a texas domiciliary if he did,then complete diversity among the parties is lacking and the case can not be heard in federal court.temple drilling.ins.guar.ass n,cir.if not,then he remained a new mexico domiciliary and complete diversity with the defendants exists 
general law of domicile 
a brief overview of the law of domicile will be helpful in our exploration of this question.first,while we may look to state law for guidance,the question of a person domicile is a matter of federal common law.coury prot,cir see also moore federal practice a ed reporting cases from eight circuits taking this position.a person acquires a domicile of origin at birth,and this domicile is presumed to continue absent sufficient evidence of change.see,palazzo corio,cir.there is a presumption of continuing domicile that applies whenever a person relocates.coury,at.in order to defeat the presumption and establish a new domicile the domicile of choice,the person must demonstrate both residence in a new state,and an intention to remain in that state indefinitely.id.mere presence in a new location does not effect a change of domicile it must be accompanied with the requisite intent.there is no durational residency requirement in the establishment of domicile once presence in the new state and intent to remain are met,the new domicile is instantaneously established.moore federal practice,ed.
in determining whether a person has changed his domicile,courts have identified many factors which should be considered.coury,at the factors may include the places where the litigant exercises civil and political rights,pays taxes,owns real and personal property,has driver and other licenses,maintains bank accounts,belongs to clubs and churches,has places of business or employment,and maintains a home for his family.the court should,when undertaking this examination,weigh all factors equally no single factor is determinative.id.additionally,statements of intent,either to remain in a previous domicile or to establish a new one,are entitled to little weight if they conflict with the objective facts.id.
law of domicile for incompetent persons 
of course,the intent inquiry becomes more problematic when the person in question has,like louis acridge,become mentally incompetent.only minimal competency is required to choose a new domicile even if the person in question has been adjudged incompetent by a court and is incapable of managing his own affairs,he can change his domicile so long as he understands the nature and effect of his act.juvelis by juvelis snider,cir.however,an incompetent is presumed to lack the mental capacity to change his own domicile.id.at.
where someone acting on an incompetent behalf moves the incompetent to another state,the question becomes whether that move coupled with the trappings of intent for the incompetent to remain in the new state indefinitely should be permitted to change the incompetent domicile.there is a split in the circuits and no fifth circuit precedent on the question of whether someone acting on behalf of an incompetent can change the incompetent state of domicile.
in rishell jane phillips episcopal memorial medical center,cir,the legal guardian of a person rendered incompetent while living in oklahoma relocated the person to louisiana in order to obtain better medical care.id.at.when the guardian then attempted to sue an oklahoma hospital in federal court on behalf of the patient,the hospital moved to dismiss on the grounds that,because the guardian lacked the authority to change the patient domicile,no diversity jurisdiction existed.id.the tenth circuit concluded that,where the incompetent will never regain sufficient mental capacity to choose his own domicile,the law must allow another,vested with
