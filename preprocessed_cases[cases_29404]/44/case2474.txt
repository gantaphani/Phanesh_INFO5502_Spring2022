eric sharp appeals from an order of the district court dismissing his federal tort claims act ftca suit arising out of the death of his brother,earle chadwick sharp chad sharp,in an orv accident at the huron national forest.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court dismissal of this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
factual and procedural history 
the huron national forest covers over acres of northeast michigan.included in the huron national forest is a parcel known as the bull gap hill climb area bull gap,which has a large sand dune and over one hundred miles of trails.in the late,the bull gap area became quite popular with orv enthusiasts,and on holidays such as memorial day and the fourth of july,over one thousand orv riders and spectators would visit bull gap.
in,only two national forest service officers were assigned to patrol the entire huron national forest.in anticipation of a large crowd at bull gap,a law enforcement operating plan for bull gap bull gap operating plan was developed by one of huron national forest officers,officer dallas marroquin officer marroquin.the bull gap operating plan,which was approved by officer marroquin supervisor,thomas barton,provided for other local units,such as the michigan state police,the michigan department of natural resources,and the oscoda county sheriff department,to assist in patrolling bull gap during the memorial day weekend.
among the visitors to bull gap were chad sharp and his brother,eric sharp.at approximately on sunday evening,the orv chap sharp was riding up the bull gap sand dune stalled.chad jumped off the orv,but for reasons unknown,returned to the vehicle just as a pickup truck began racing up the dune.chad was struck by the pickup truck and later died of his injuries.
eric sharp,as representative of chad sharp estate,filed the instant suit against the united states the government under the ftca,alleging gross negligence willful and wanton misconduct by the national forest service.more specifically,sharp suit contends that the national forest service is liable for allowing orvs to operate in the bull gap area hours a day without furnishing adequate lighting,and failing to maintain an adequate presence in bull gap.a bench trial was held,and after hearing the testimony of several witnesses,the district court granted the government rule c motion for judgment on partial findings.in its oral ruling,the district court explained that sharp had not shown the inapplicability of the exception to the ftca and thus had failed to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.sharp now appeals to this court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court below dismissed the instant suit pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,which provides in part that 
i f during a trial without a jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue,the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that can not under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue 
when entering judgment pursuant to rule c,the district court must set forth particular findings of fact,which we then review for clear error.see fed.civ.c advisory committee note.we review de novo,however,the district court legal determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this action.see rich united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
exception to the ftca 
before a suit may be maintained against the united states,the united states must consent to being sued.montez united states,cir citing united states orleans,d.through its enactment of the ftca,congress has waived the united states immunity from suits 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.this waiver of sovereign immunity is subject to a number of limitations,including the exception codified in a.see a stating that b waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.if the exception applies and congress has not otherwise waived the united states immunity,then we lack subject matter jurisdiction over the action.see rich,at.
when determining whether the united states is immune from suit based on the exception,we engage in a analysis.we first consider whether the challenged act or omission violated a mandatory regulation or policy that allowed no judgment or choice.if so,the discretionary function exception does not apply because the employee had no rightful option but to adhere to the directive and thus there was no element of judgment or choice in the complained of conduct.rosebush united states,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
if the challenged action is deemed discretionary,we proceed to step two of the analysis,in which we determine whether the conduct is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.quoting united states gaubert,d.in undertaking such an evaluation,we keep in mind that the discretionary function exception was designed to prevent courts from being required to second guess the political,social,and economic judgments of an agency exercising its regulatory function.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.such judgments are not restricted to those made by an agency policymakers,for it is the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor,that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case.id.at.see gaubert,at.concluding that management of savings and loan by federal regulators fell within scope of exception,explaining that,a discretionary act is one that involves choice or judgment there is nothing in that description that refers exclusively to policymaking or planning functions.we also consider the fact that w hen established governmental policy,as expressed or implied by statute,regulation,or agency guidelines,allows a government agent to exercise discretion,it must be presumed that the agent acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.gaubert,at.
hours of conditions 
sharp first theory of liability is that the national forest service acted negligently in allowing bull gap to remain open during nighttime hours without providing better lighting conditions.according to sharp,the national forest service decisions regarding bull gap hours of operation and lighting conditions do not come within the reach of the exception to the ftca because the forest service manual mandates the protection of visitors health and safety,and the national forest service acted negligently in effectuating this policy.
at the heart of this claim is title of the forest service manual,which provides in part 
objective.the objective of the forest service safety and health program is to ensure adequate protection for forest service employees and property,human resource program participants,and the visiting public 
safety and health of all involved individuals are the highest priorities on any job.
the forest service shall provide safe and healthful facilities for visitors.
br.at.sharp asserts that,while the national forest service issuance of these policies amounts to a discretionary act encompassed by the exception,the national forest service decisions regarding hours of operation and lighting conditions are not similarly protected.we disagree.
as the district court correctly noted,title of the forest service manual contains v ery broad statements that certainly could not be read as eliminating the national forest service discretion in determining how best to carry out such policies.joint appendix at trial
