after receiving an erroneous flood zone determination,mary dobsa brought claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation against landsafe flood determination.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant.for the reasons that will be explained,we reverse and remand.
background 
mary dobsa owned a home in biloxi,mississippi,in which she and neil paul resided.countrywide home loans,was the mortgage lender on the home.prior to financing and in accordance with the national flood insurance act,countrywide selected landsafe to determine whether dobsa home was located in a federal flood zone.dobsa paid for landsafe services.
landsafe indicated that the home was not situated in a area.accordingly,countrywide provided financing without requiring dobsa to obtain flood insurance through the national flood insurance program.unfortunately,hurricane katrina struck on august,and caused substantial damage to this residence for which no flood insurance coverage existed.it was then learned that the home was actually located in a area.
dobsa and to whom we will refer as dobsa subsequently filed a diversity action in the district court,alleging negligence and negligent misrepresentation against landsafe under mississippi law they also sought punitive damages.following discovery,the district court granted landsafe motion for summary judgment.this appeal was timely brought.

standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.xl specialty ins.kiewit offshore,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when the record reflects that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we view facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.mahaffey sec.ins,cir.we must reverse summary judgment if it is determined that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the litigant.see delta pine land nationwide agribusiness ins,cir.
b.the national flood insurance act 
the national flood insurance act was enacted to make homeowner insurance affordable in designated areas.the federal emergency management agency is required to identify areas,publish data,and revise that data as needed.id.a.any federally regulated lender making a loan secured by improved real estate located in a designated zone must as a condition of making the loan require the purchase of insurance through the national flood insurance program.id.b.banks and lending institutions are responsible for determining if a piece of property falls within a designated zone the institutions may delegate the determination to third parties provided the accuracy of the information is guaranteed.id.d.there is no liability for a lender who relies on a previous determination at the time of increasing,extending,renewing,or purchasing a loan id.e.it is unclear how that particular immunity applies to the making of the initial loan.id.d a lender who makes,increases,extends,or renews a relevant loan may rely on a third party to determine status.
several judicial precedents have settled some of the liability issues that arise when a determination is erroneously made that property is not in a zone,insurance was therefore not obtained,and damage from flooding thereafter occurs.we know from these precedents that the act does not create an implied private right of action for borrowers when a determination is erroneously made that property is outside a flood zone.till unifirst fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.two decades later,we observed that every single federal court to consider whether a private right of action arises under section has concluded that it does not.wentwood woodside i,gmac commercial mortgage,cir.
we also find that a panel of this court determined,under texas law,that the federal statutory requirements do not create a standard of conduct,the breach of which would form the basis for a negligence per se suit against the lender.id.at.a federal district court has similarly found that the act does not create a standard for a state negligence per se suit under mississippi law against a determination company.lusins first am.real estate solutions of,wl.june,the negligence per se doctrine,as a species of state tort law,is something for each state to determine.pending state court determinations,federal courts have to predict outcomes.
the plaintiff here disavows reliance on the doctrine either of an implied cause of action under the act or of negligence per se.we note these precedential guideposts on this act and move to what the plaintiff asserts in her effort to avoid these barriers.dobsa maintains that her claim arises solely under mississippi law.this court previously recognized that the lack of a private cause of action under the act would not foreclose relief under state tort law,ironically making that decision in a mississippi case.till,at.the case had been removed from state court based on federal question jurisdiction we remanded so that the district court could return the suit to state court.id.at.we find no published opinion reflecting what occurred after the state trial court regained jurisdiction.unlike in till,in this diversity suit we must address whether there are mississippi remedies.we now turn to that issue.
mississippi law 
as noted,dobsa eschews reliance on the doctrines we have just reviewed.instead,she argues that a cause of action for the very negligence alleged in this suit has already been recognized in mississippi.we examine that case closely since it is the foundation for the claim.
the mississippi precedent arose in the context of a devastating flood in the state capital city on easter sunday.mckinnon batte,so d.late in the year before the flood,mckinnon had hired a surveyor as required by his lender.the surveyor erroneously determined that the home mckinnon was buying was not in a area.id.at.the surveyor as well as the agent who wrote the homeowner insurance policy were defendants in the suit brought on the theory of negligence.there was evidence that the insurance agent had used a map to inform the plaintiff that he did not need to buy flood insurance,while the official map issued in indicated that the property was in a flood zone.id.at.whether such a reason also explained the surveyor error is not stated in the opinion.
the national flood insurance act required in still lender to notify the purchaser of such special flood hazards,in writing,a reasonable period in advance of the signing of the purchase agreement id.at quoting.no party in our case disputes that besides giving this notice to the buyer,a lender must also require flood insurance as a condition for making a loan that is secured by property.see b.the point was disputed in mckinnon,though.a bank lawyer testified that when property was in a flood zone,the lender had to require the purchase of flood insurance.id.at.the closing attorney,however,testified that when property was in a flood zone,he would just ask the lender and buyer if either wanted flood insurance.id.no issue for the court to resolve was raised in the appeal about whether insurance was optional.id.at.a choice for buyers that appears to have been a premise for the court analysis,though,was that they could purchase flood insurance even when the property was not in a flood zone.id.at insurance agent asked why he had not suggested flood insurance be purchased,and it was because property was not in a flood zone.even if that option was available in,we do not know if it was an option available to dobsa.
in mckinnon,a fact issue submitted to the jury was whether the plaintiff had relied on either the insurance agent or surveyor when he decided not to buy flood insurance.there was evidence that the buyer ignored the survey and relied on information from neighbors that the property had never flooded.id.the jury reached a verdict in favor of the defendants.the mississippi supreme court described the standard of care applicable to surveyors as being the skillful discharge of their contractual obligation.id.at.duty,breach,and damages were clearly shown,but the claim failed ba
