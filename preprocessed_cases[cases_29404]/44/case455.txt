bernard flowers appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of darren fiore,michael garafola,lawrence silvestri,and the town of westerly,rhode island town.flowers suit asserted violations of his constitutional rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments as well as pendent state law claims arising out of his stop and detention by members of the westerly police department.
background 
we draw the following recitation of facts from the summary judgment record,which includes flowers complaint,affidavits submitted by the defendant police officers,logs of radio transmissions and telephone calls related to the incident,and a complaint submitted by flowers to the aclu.we note where facts are in dispute.
on september,at approximately,the westerly police received a telephone call from nunzio gaccione,a westerly resident.gaccione guess ed there was a little fight there with butch corbin and a couple other people and that he just got word that corbin is sending two colored people over here to start some trouble.the dispatcher then radioed for officer fiore to respond to the complaint at gaccione residence on ashaway road.fiore arrived at the residence within four to five minutes and met with gaccione.gaccione related that he received a call from maurice,who stated that another individual,michael corbin,was sending two men to gaccione home with a gun.gaccione said that he believed this was because his grandson,jason bolduc,works with a guy that corbin knows and they had some type of falling out.fiore claims to be familiar with corbin and bolduc,as both in the past have been involved in several disturbances and possible drug activity.
gaccione then told fiore that he had seen two men in a small gray or black vehicle drive by his home about five minutes prior to fiore arrival.gaccione believed that these men may have been the ones to whom referred.
at,fiore detailed gaccione complaint,including the description of the suspects,into his log.fiore alerted on his radio that police should be looking for a small gray or black vehicle with two black men,possibly armed.he further stated that he was not too sure what it is and that they made threats over here at the gaccione complex.
next,fiore took a post at the intersection of route and danielle drive,which is about half a mile east of the gaccione residence along route.he chose this particular location upon a belief that the suspect vehicle would return to the gaccione residence after having passed by the gaccione residence the first time.some twenty to thirty minutes later,fiore noticed a small gray car moving through the intersection of route and danielle drive.fiore thought that about twenty minutes had elapsed since he took his position on route.he conceded,however,that the time interval may have been as long as thirty minutes,as radio logs indicated.he caught a side view of the occupant of the car and saw that it was a black male.prior to observing this particular vehicle,fiore did not notice any other cars with male occupants drive by his post.
fiore decided to follow this vehicle because it fit the description of the gaccione complaint and it was heading in the direction of the gaccione residence.although he noticed only one occupant,he believed that the other suspect either could have been dropped off at another location or was hiding in the vehicle.at,fiore notified dispatchers that he was following a vehicle on route.he based his probable cause to stop the vehicle on his belief that the description of the vehicle fit the description by gaccione,there was a black male that was operating the vehicle the close proximity of the time of the call and the fact that it was heading toward gaccione residence.
after following the vehicle approximately one mile,fiore activated his lights and signaled for flowers to pull over.both eventually stopped on high street,approximately half a mile west of the gaccione residence along route.fiore assumed that dispatch would send backup because of the situation,and accordingly pulled flowers over to a location near where he knew backup was coming from a car stop.he instructed flowers over the loudspeaker to remain in the vehicle.next,two backup officers,lawrence silvestri and michael garafola,arrived in separate police cruisers.garafola left his vehicle with a shotgun ready in hand.fiore,again using the loudspeaker,directed flowers to extend his arms out the window and then open the car door and exit the vehicle.flowers complied.fiore then directed flowers to turn around with his hands in the air and walk backwards towards the officers.from the time they arrived and exited their vehicles,each officer had his weapon drawn.
flowers contends that when he reached the officers,his hands were forced behind him,handcuffs were placed on him and he was dropped to his knees.fiore claims that the officers directed flowers to kneel on the road beside his car and lace his fingers behind his head,and that then flowers was handcuffed,frisked,and placed in the back of fiore cruiser.all three officers also claim that they followed standard procedure for a or felony stop and that it was necessary to do so because they felt that there was a danger to their safety 
while flowers was in the back of the police cruiser,the backup officers searched flowers vehicle for weapons and a possible other suspect.fiore claims that when nothing was recovered,he took flowers out of the cruiser,removed his handcuffs,and explained why he was stopped.flowers claims that fiore first approached him and said,gaccione reported two black men threatened him and they had guns so you understand why i had to do what i had to do.fiore then added that the two black men had a gray vehicle.with no apology,flowers was ordered back to his car.
fiore contends that he explained the situation to flowers,at which time flowers became very angry and accused him of racial profiling.flowers then asked fiore to use his phone so he could call his wife who was working nearby and awaiting his arrival.fiore responded that he did not have a phone.he suggested that flowers use the phone at the gym across the street and then ordered flowers to move his car.flowers then went back to his car and drove to the local hospital,where his wife worked.
by this time,both backup officers had driven away.fiore proceeded to make a couple passes by the gaccione residence until the end of his shift.thereafter,he did not a post to look for a suspect vehicle because of the time that had gone by and his belief that the immediate threat had pretty much diminished.
pursuant to,flowers brought this action against officers fiore,silvestri,and garafola,and the town of westerly,claiming that the police officers detained him because of his race,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,const.amend.xiv,and that the officers detained him without probable cause and used excessive force,and that the town failed to properly train and supervise the officers,in violation of his right against unreasonable government search and seizure under the fourth and fourteenth amendments of the federal constitution.flowers also asserted state law claims for assault and battery,false imprisonment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,as well as for violations of his rights under article,sections and of the rhode island constitution.after the close of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that there were no constitutional violations,and that they were shielded from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity.upon determining that no constitutional rights had been violated,the court did not reach the issue of qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants this appeal followed.

a.the stop and detention 
for purposes of determining whether the stop and detention were constitutionally permissible,we must first decide whether the officers actions amounted to an investigatory stop or was so intrusive as to constitute a de facto arrest.the detention of a person whose automobile has been stopped is a seizure within the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.whren united states,d.a brief investigatory detention does not violate the fourth amendment if the officers have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of past or present criminal activity.united states mccarthy,cir.it was in terry ohio,d where the supreme court first gave effect to this notion that some types of encounters between citizens and law as brief detainments in the nature of a stop and frisk could constitute seizures for fourth amendment purposes,yet be sufficiently limited in their intrusiveness to fall outside the traditional understanding of an arrest.see also dunaway new york,d.where police actions taken during the detention exceed what is necessary to dispel the suspicion that justified the stop,the detention may amount to an arrest and is lawful only if it is supported by probable cause.united states quinn,cir.
the supreme court has stated that the exception for limited intrusions that may be justified by special law enforcement interests is not confined to the momentary,detention accompanied by a frisk for weapons involved in terry and adams williams,d.michigan summers,d.since terry,the terry exception allowing detentions without probable cause has been broadened to encompass other situations where officers may make brief investigative stops and detain individuals upon reasonable suspicion that they may have committed,are committing,or are about to commit a crime.there is no test to determine whether a particular detention goes beyond a terry stop and amounts to a de facto arrest.united states,cir quoting florida royer,d.generally,we say that an investigatory stop constitutes a de facto arrest when a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation,in the circumstances then obtaining,to be tantamount to being under arrest.united states zapata,cir quoting berkemer mccarty,d.however,in a borderline case where the detention at issue has one or two features but otherwise is consistent with a terry stop,it will not be obvious just how the detention at issue ought reasonably to have been perceived.such a case requires a inquiry into whether the measures used by the police were reasonable in light of the circumstances that prompted the stop or that developed during the course of the stop.see united states young,cir our cases in this area evince the fact specific nature of the inquiry.in the present case,we conclude that the actions of the police during the stop and detention did not go beyond an investigatory terry stop and did not amount to an arrest.
while terry stops generally are fairly unintrusive,we have repeatedly stressed that officers may take necessary steps to protect themselves if the circumstances reasonably warrant such measures.see united states lee,cir,at united states trullo,cir.similarly,other circuits have held that police officers may draw their weapons without transforming an otherwise valid terry stop into an arrest.see,united states alvarez,cir,cert.denied,d united states taylor,cir united states,cir united states jones,cir,cert.denied,d united states jackson,cir.here,the officers drew their firearms because they were faced with a report of an armed threat.moreover,upon restraining flowers,they immediately holstered their weapons.it was not unreasonable under the circumstances for the officers to execute the terry stop with their weapons drawn.
as for the officers use of handcuffs during the stop,we in the past have required the government to point to some specific fact or circumstance that could have supported a reasonable belief that the use of such restraints was necessary to carry out the legitimate purposes of the stop without exposing law enforcement officers,the public,or the suspect himself to an undue risk of harm,at.where,as here,police officers have information that a suspect is currently armed and that a crime involving violence may soon occur,they are justified in using restraints such as handcuffs without causing an investigatory stop to cross over into an arrest.see washington lambert,cir.
the reasonable use of backup officers is also within the bounds of a terry stop.m ere numbers do not automatically convert a lawful terry stop into something more forbidding.zapata,at.we have previously refused to hold that an investigative stop turned into a de facto arrest where five law enforcement officers were present at the scene of the stop.united states trueber,cir.here,flowers was stopped and detained by only three officers,only one of in direct proximity to him while he was detained in the police cruiser.likewise,the fact that flowers was placed in the back of a police cruiser does not elevate the detention beyond a terry stop.see haynie county of los angeles,cir united states critton,cir.although there may be cases where individually reasonable police actions taken together go beyond the bounds of a terry stop,such is not the case here where the circumstances justified the officers overall handling of the situation.
as for the duration of the stop,we must examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly,during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.united states sharpe,d see also royer,at.summers,at.there is no time limit for a permissible terry stop.sharpe,at.pursuant to westerly police department standard procedure for or felony stops,the officers directed flowers to kneel on the road next to his car,handcuffed,frisked,and placed him in the back seat of the police cruiser.officers silvestri and garafola then searched flowers car for weapons and a possible other suspect.the entire detention took no more than fifteen minutes.upon uncovering nothing,officer fiore promptly took flowers out of the cruiser,removed his handcuffs,explained why he was stopped,and allowed him to return to his own car.we stress that the officers did not determine that flowers was unarmed and that no weapon was hidden in the car until after he had been handcuffed and placed in the cruiser.flowers presents no evidence that the officers were dilatory in their investigation and we see no way that the officers could have substantially shortened the detention if they were to dispel their suspicions meaningfully.
admittedly,this case comes close to the line between a terry stop and a greater intrusion that must be justified by probable cause.however,in addition to our own precedent pointing toward the former,the sixth circuit found that an investigatory terry stop did not escalate into a de facto arrest based on facts almost identical to those at hand.in houston does,cir,the plaintiffs,suspected of a shooting in an area of springfield,ohio,were ordered out of their car at gunpoint by three police officers,placed in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser,and questioned about the shooting,of which the plaintiffs had no knowledge and denied any involvement.they were detained for at least minutes before being released.id.here,besides being held for a far shorter period of time,flowers was never subject to interrogation,which is one intrusive measure less than in houston.
it is also noteworthy that the officers never relocated flowers to a station house or detention area.nor did they read flowers miranda rights.in,we held that the detention of a suspect crossed over to a de facto arrest largely due to the fact that customs officers relocated the suspect from the place of the original airport an official interrogation room some distance from the gate.see at see also royer,at.similarly,the supreme court in dunaway found a de facto arrest where police officers brought the defendant to the police station,read him his miranda rights,and interrogated him.see at.at no point did officers fiore,silvestri,or garafola interrogate flowers or remove him from the scene to an official holding area.the entire episode occurred in neutral a public street.nor did the officers communicate verbally to flowers that he was under arrest or that they wanted to arrest him.
the various incidents of the stop and add up to a situation where the officers responded in an urgent and reasonable fashion to a report of an armed threat that was substantially confirmed by gaccione firsthand observation.we stress again that we do not rely on any single factor as legally dispositive,but assess the cumulative impact of the various elements of the stop.we look at the total factual context of the stop,thereby following our directive to make evaluations and inquiries of the situation as a whole.see young,at.our conclusion is that the officers stop and detention of flowers did not go beyond the boundaries of a terry stop.
accordingly,to determine whether the officers initial stop of flowers was constitutional,we assess whether the officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of past or present criminal activity.mccarthy,at.in determining whether a challenged stop is reasonable,and thus,falls within the range of permissible investigatory stops,we engage in a inquiry,asking whether the officer action was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference in the first place.terry,at.see also united states stanley,cir.the supreme court has explained that the question of reasonableness requires a court to balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on personal security against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.united states hensley,d.again,the inquiry is fact specific and we must consider the totality of the circumstances confronting the police at the time of the stop.united states kimball,cir see also united states,cir,cert.denied,d.we also stress that reasonable suspicion is not amenable to technical formulations that purport to identify the precise types of conduct or sets of circumstances that will or will not permit a police officer to stop and detain an individual.united states sowers,cir citing ornelas united states,d.
the district court held that there was no constitutional violation based on four key factual observations gaccione reported receiving a threat that two black men with guns were coming to his home to cause trouble gaccione reported that two black men in a gray or black car had driven by gaccione home slowly a few minutes later,fiore observed flowers,a black man,driving toward gaccione home in a small gray car and flowers car bore license plates not issued to his vehicle.d at.though we review the record de novo,we will note the district court factual observations as they bear on the appropriateness of its grant of summary judgment to the defendants.
first,flowers contends that there was n ever any serious concern that a crime had been or was about to be committed.he argues that fiore acted unreasonably on gaccione sketchy complaint that itself was attributed to a man named whom fiore had never heard of or met.because fiore never corroborated the threat with himself,flowers argues,fiore had no way to determine or even make a guess as to the credibility of the threats.flowers fails,however,to address gaccione report that since receiving the tip he had seen a gray or black car occupied by two black men pass by his home about five minutes before fiore arrival.gaccione firsthand observation of the vehicle and its occupants,uncontroverted by flowers,lent greater credibility to the reported threat.
flowers also challenges the district court version of when and how fiore discovered a discrepancy between the license plate on flowers car and the vehicle registration.though fiore here on appeal concedes that the discrepancy never figured into his decision to follow and stop flowers,it is nonetheless disputed whether he knew of the discrepancy before or after the stop.see supra note.
third,flowers disputes the district court statement that fiore observed flowers drive past at approximately d at.later in its memorandum and order,the court stated that fiore first noticed flowers only a few minutes after leaving the gaccione home.id.the police department radio log,however,indicates that fiore first notified his dispatcher that he was following a vehicle on route at.as fiore left the gaccione residence at,the log reveals that as long as thirty minutes may have passed before fiore observed flowers and decided to follow him.
finally,flowers claims that the district court erred on the issues of the route of flowers vehicle and the location of the stop.he contends that if fiore positioned himself near the gaccione residence and then followed flowers for approximately one mile before stopping him,fiore either stopped flowers as he was driving away from gaccione residence,or was positioned more than a mile from the residence when he first noticed flowers car.in his affidavit,fiore stated that he posted himself at the intersection of route and danielle drive,which is about half a mile east of the gaccione residence along route.from that intersection,one mile westward along route would put both fiore and flowers well past the gaccione residence.indeed,route intersection with danielle drive is approximately one mile east of its intersection with high street,the site of the stop.the gaccione home on ashaway road is halfway between the two intersections.
the district court noted that fiore observed flowers driving toward gaccione home.d at.the court did not mention that flowers had already passed the residence along route and was at least half a mile east of the residence by the time he was stopped.flowers contends that this fact throws into question whether fiore was reasonable in continuing to follow flowers and stop him after he observed that flowers did not turn into the gaccione complex,but instead proceeded past it along route.
despite these apparent errors by the district court and construing the facts in a light most favorable to flowers,we hold that fiore conduct met the double approach adopted in terry.at.equipped with a description confirmed by gaccione firsthand observation,it was reasonable for fiore to follow the first male in a black or gray car he observed in the immediate area of the gaccione residence.that as long as half an hour may have elapsed after he left the gaccione residence as opposed to twenty minutes arguably attenuates the reasonableness of fiore suspicion that flowers was indeed the suspect.however,we do not believe that a matter of ten minutes disposes of suspicion altogether,especially when a car and driver substantially matching the given description eventually appear.that fiore did not see a second male in the car is adequately countered by fiore explanation that he thought a second man either could have been dropped off or was hiding in the car.against the immediacy and gravity of the reported threat,fiore was justified in following through on his initial observation.
though flowers ultimately passed the gaccione residence along route,fiore acted reasonably in continuing to follow him and stopping him shortly thereafter,given the possibility that the driver could have seen fiore marked cruiser and accordingly decided against turning into the driveway of the gaccione residence.it is important to note that flowers was headed toward the residence along route at the time fiore first observed him.as for the second terry prong,as set out above,all three officers detained flowers in a manner reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference in the first place.terry,at.
as for silvestri and garafola,they were reasonable in suspecting that flowers was one of the armed men in g
