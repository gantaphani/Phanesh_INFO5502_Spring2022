hammed adeleke is presently incarcerated for smuggling heroin into the united states on may.see united states adeleke,ilg.subsequent to conviction,adeleke moved pro se in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york pursuant to.e now rule g for united states of america either to return money and property seized incident to his arrest or to compensate him in money damages for the destruction of that property resulting from terrorist attacks on the world trade center,where the property was stored.because no criminal proceedings were then pending against adeleke,the district court construed the rule g motion as a civil action in equity.see,mora united states,cir.
adeleke now appeals the district court award of summary judgment in favor of the united states on his claim for money damages.he asserts that the district court erred in concluding that,because his property had been destroyed not by any act or omission of the united states but by the unforeseen actions of third parties,equity did not warrant an award of damages.he further appeals the district court rejection of his due process claim that the government property release notice obligated the united states to insure his property against loss or damage during the retrieval period.finally,adeleke insists that he is entitled to pursue damages under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act,stat.air stabilization act,or the federal tort claims act,b,et.
we affirm the judgment of dismissal,albeit on somewhat different grounds than the district court.see,millares guiraldes de tineo united states,cir noting that appellate court can affirm a judgment on any ground that finds support in the record.specifically,we conclude that adeleke equitable claim for money damages should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because sovereign immunity bars a federal court from ordering the united states to compensate for property that can not be returned pursuant to rule g sovereign immunity similarly deprived the district court of jurisdiction over adeleke due process claim.to the extent jurisdiction over this claim may lie in the court of claims under the tucker act,see,no transfer is warranted here because adeleke plainly had no due process right to have the united states insure his seized property.as for adeleke statutory claims,we conclude that the district court lacks jurisdiction under the air stabilization act to order an award from the victims compensation fund and,further,that adeleke is not eligible for such compensation.similarly,his damages claim fails to come within the limited waiver of sovereign immunity in the federal tort claims act.
factual background 
on may,hammed adeleke traveled from lagos,nigeria,to john kennedy international airport in queens,new york.there,he was arrested by united states customs officials when a baggage inspection revealed approximately two kilograms of heroin concealed in the sides of adeleke briefcase.on june,adeleke pleaded guilty to one count of importing heroin into the united states in violation of a,a,b,and on october,he was sentenced to months incarceration.
incident to adeleke arrest,customs officials seized in cash and various items of personal property,which,according to adeleke,included a swiss watch,two gold rings decorated with diamonds,one gold chain,and one gold pendant,having a total value of,an impressive collection of jewelry for a man who,at sentencing,reported his monthly income for the previous ten years at pending resolution of adeleke criminal case,his seized personal property was stored at the united states customshouse located at world trade center in manhattan.
on june,within days of his guilty plea,united states customs sent adeleke a standard baggage release notice advising him of three options to retrieve his personal property adeleke or his designee could pick up his property at world trade center customs would ship the property to any designated address,provided adeleke prepaid the shipping costs or adeleke could hire private shippers to retrieve the property.the notice provided that baggage not picked up within one year of seizure would be considered abandoned and sold at public auction or destroyed.adeleke did not follow any of the procedures outlined in the release notice.thus,when terrorists attacked lower manhattan on september,adeleke unclaimed personal property,still inside world trade center,was destroyed.
four months later,on january,adeleke filed a motion in the district court for the return of his property pursuant to.g.soon thereafter,the united states voluntarily returned the in cash seized from adeleke,thereby rendering that part of his claim moot as for adeleke personal property,the united states moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the destruction was not attributable to any unreasonable conduct on its part so as to warrant an equitable award of money damages.adeleke opposed the motion,maintaining that government negligence was not a prerequisite to an equitable damages award and that the release notice created a due process obligation on the united states to insure his property for the retrieval period.he further argued that the air stabilization act provided for compensation of his loss as a victim of the september attacks.
the magistrate judge to whom the matter was referred agreed with adeleke that circuit precedent did not require a showing of actual negligence by the united states to support an equitable award of damages on a claim for rule g relief.nevertheless,she recommended summary judgment in favor of the united states because adeleke had adduced no evidence that any government conduct had contributed to the loss,destruction,or disposal of his property.the magistrate explained the government merely held plaintiff property at the time it was destroyed.plaintiff loss was caused by the attack on the world trade center on september,which led to many great losses.adeleke united states,magistrate report and recommendation at.she further recommended dismissal of adeleke constitutional and statutory claims for failure to establish enforceable rights.id.at.
by order dated february,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in its entirety and awarded summary judgment in favor of the united states on adeleke request for money damages.
ii.discussion 
sovereign immunity bars adeleke equitable claim for money damages 
the district court concluded that adeleke equitable claim for damages failed because adeleke could not show that the united states conduct contributed to the destruction of his property,a causation requirement inferred from language in mora united states,at the government can be liable for damages when it gives away,loses or destroys a prisoner property and soviero united states,at a plaintiff should be permitted to seek damages if the district court determines the government conduct renders it liable for such.we identify a more fundamental obstacle to adeleke effort to seek compensation from the public treasury the sovereign immunity of the united states.before discussing sovereign immunity,however,we briefly review our prior cases discussing equitable damages awards for lost or destroyed seized property.
federal rule of criminal procedure g permits a person aggrieved by the government unlawful seizure or deprivation of property to move for specific relief the property return.over a decade ago,in mora united states,at,this court held that,even after the conclusion of criminal proceedings,federal courts may exercise equitable jurisdiction to hear rule g motions.further,if demanded property is no longer available for return,mora instructs district courts to consider whether the government conduct renders it liable for damages as an equitable remedy.id.at.later that same year,this court more emphatically recognized the availability of an equitable award of damages when the government can not return seized property simply because the government destroys or otherwise disposes of property sought by the movant,the motion for its return is not thereby rendered moot.when a court possessing equitable powers has jurisdiction over a complaint that seeks equitable relief,it has authority to award whatever damages are incident to the complaint.soviero united states,at citation omitted.the point was reiterated two years later in rufu united states,at that the government has destroyed or otherwise disposed of the property sought by the movant does not render the motion moot,since the court has authority to award damages in lieu of the equitable relief sought.
mora,soviero,and rufu presumably give effect to the rule,derived from common law,that where there is a legal right,there is also a legal remedy.franklin gwinnett county pub,d quoting blackstone,commentaries.in sullivan little hunting park,d,the supreme court explained that the existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies.more recently,franklin gwinnett county public schools,at,similarly noted that if a right of action exists to enforce a federal right and congress is silent on the question of remedies,a federal court may order any appropriate relief.
in identifying money damages as appropriate equitable relief when seized property was unavailable for return pursuant to rule g,neither mora nor its progeny,however,addressed the sovereign immunity implications of such an award against the united states.accordingly,we are free,and obligated,to do so now.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio,this court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.internal quotation marks omitted see also steel citizens for a better env t,d emphasizing requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter garay slattery,cir finding it necessary to address jurisdictional challenge despite prior cases assuming jurisdiction.
it is,of course,axiomatic under the principle of sovereign immunity that the united states may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.united states mitchell,d accord department of the army blue fox,d absent a waiver,sovereign immunity shields the federal government and its agencies from suit.quoting fdic meyer,d.moreover,waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text,and can not simply be implied.united states nordic village,d internal quotation marks omitted accord united states white mountain apache tribe,d and cases cited therein.thus,in united states nordic village,the supreme court refused to infer from the bankruptcy court equitable in rem jurisdiction a waiver of the united states sovereign immunity with respect to incidental monetary awards.drawing a distinction equally applicable to the exercise of equitable jurisdiction in this case,nordic village explained that a suit for payment of funds from the treasury is quite different from a suit for the return of tangible property.at.the sovereign consent to be sued for the latter form of relief does not imply its consent to be sued for the former because precedent teaches that the government consent to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign,and not enlarged beyond what the language requires.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also fdic meyer,at.the terms of the united states consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit internal quotation marks omitted.
in lane pena,d,the supreme court specifically addressed the effect of sovereign immunity on the rule that a legal right presumes a remedy,explaining that when it comes to an award of money damages,sovereign immunity places the federal government on an entirely different footing than private parties.in actions involving private parties,federal courts may well have the power to award any appropriate relief to vindicate the right at issue.id.quoting franklin gwinnett county pub,at.but where the federal government is itself sued,the available remedies are not those that are appropriate,but only those for which sovereign immunity has been expressly waived.id.at.quoting and adopting argument in respondent brief.this may leave some aggrieved parties without relief,but that is inherent in the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
applying these sovereign immunity principles to this case,we now join in the unanimous conclusion of those sister circuits that have addressed the issue rule g,which simply provides for the return of seized property,does not waive the sovereign immunity of the united states with respect to actions for money damages relating to such property.see okoro callaghan,cir united states hall,cir united states potes ramirez,cir united states jones,cir united states bein,cir pena united states,cir see also mcbean united states,cir unpublished thus,although we continue to adhere to the mora and its progeny insofar as those cases recognize federal equitable jurisdiction to order the return of property pursuant to rule g even after the conclusion of criminal proceedings,we here clarify that such equitable jurisdiction does not permit courts to order the united states to pay money damages when,for whatever reason,property is not available for rule g return.such monetary awards are barred by sovereign immunity.
in sum,because subject matter jurisdiction was lacking,adeleke equitable claim for money damages pursuant to rule g was properly dismissed 
adeleke due process claim to insurance is barred by sovereign immunity 
relying on the baggage release notice that advised him that he had one year in which to claim his seized property,adeleke asserts a due process right to government insurance of that property during the retrieval period.this claim also faces the obstacle of sovereign immunity.
on appeal,adeleke cites the tucker act,and the little tucker act,id.a,for the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity.those acts provide subject matter jurisdiction for claims against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress,or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states.sanders bhap housing dev.fund,cir quoting a.the tucker act confers jurisdiction over such claims upon the court of claims,see the little tucker act confers concurrent jurisdiction upon district courts when the amount of the damage claim is or less,see id.a.see clinton goldsmith,d.because adeleke sues to recover substantially more than tucker acts can not provide the waiver of sovereign immunity necessary for him to pursue his claim in the district court.see sanders bhap housing dev.fund,at see also fdic meyer,at.the terms of the united states consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit internal quotation marks omitted millares guiraldes de tineo united states,at any limitations imposed by the waiver statute,whether they be substantive,procedural,or temporal,are to be strictly applied against the claimant.adeleke identifies no other provision empowering the district court to hear his due process claim,and we have found none 
under,if a court lacks jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action to any other such court in which the action could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed,which,in this case,would be to the court of claims.see waters rumsfeld,remanding tucker act claim for more than to the district court for transfer to court of claims see also phillips seiter,cir discussing authority to transfer or dismiss under.we do not remand for transfer in this case,however,because adeleke so plainly fails to allege a property right to insurance that transfer would not serve the interest of justice.see phillips seiter,at declining to remand a meritless claim to the district court for possible transfer to court with jurisdiction see also haugh booker,cir finding it not in the interest of justice to transfer a meritless claim.
