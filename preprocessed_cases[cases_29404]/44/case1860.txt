in february,jacques allemand jacques,a longshoreman employed by american river transportation artco,died when he jumped from the barge on which he was employed into territorial waters in an attempt to save a who had fallen from the barge.following the deaths of jacques and his,artco commenced limitation of liability proceedings.lester anthony allemand and edna allemand the allemands,the divorced parents of jacques,filed a claim in the proceedings.the district court granted summary judgment for artco,dismissing the allemands wrongful death action seeking damages for loss of society.the court held that the allemands could not recover for loss of society,because they had not been financially dependent on their son.as we agree with the district court that parents may not recover for loss of society in maritime wrongful death actions,we affirm.
facts proceedings 
for purposes of this appeal,the material facts are uncontested.jacques,the son of the allemands,was a inmate performing services on artco barge art on the mississippi river.jacques had been incarcerated for the five years immediately preceding his death.he had not provided any financial support to his parents,either before or after his incarceration.
darnell lane was also a inmate performing services on barge art.on the day in question,lane was struck by water from a hose on the barge,causing him to hit his head which rendered him unconscious and fall into the mississippi river.jacques jumped into the river in an attempt to rescue lane.jacques struggled to keep his head above water,but died when two moored artco barges crashed into one another.
prior proceedings 
in june,artco commenced two limitation of liability proceedings,later consolidated,in the eastern district of louisiana,pursuant to app.et.in september,the allemands answered the complaint and made a claim for damages against artco,both as jacques survivors and for their own loss of society caused by the wrongful death of their son.in may,artco filed a motion for summary judgment against the allemands,contending that,as parents of the decedent,they could not recover damages for loss of society in a maritime wrongful death action.in june,the district court orally granted arctco motion.the district court explained its reasoning 
looking at the trends in the fifth circuit and based on what i think the state of the law is definitely should be appealed because it not that i ca see the difference why a longshoreman parents,as an example,do have to be dependent,but everyone else who loses someone in state waters to an accident has to be dependent to recover.
it clear that the law is that all nonlongshoremen who are killed in state waters,in order for their survivors to recover loss of society,they must be dependent survivors.that a clear statement of the law.the mental gymnastics i having trouble with is making the leap as to why a longshoreman would be different 
the district court indicated that an immediate appeal was appropriate,closing the case for statistical purposes at that time.the allemands timely filed notices of appeal.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a we review a district court grant of summary judgment in an admiralty or maritime action de novo whether damages are recoverable is a legal question subject to de novo review 
evolution of the maritime wrongful death cause of action 
in,the supreme court held in the harrisburg that there was no cause of action for wrongful death in maritime law the harshness of this holding was softened by the supreme court later ruling in the hamilton,in which the court held that suits grounded in state wrongful death causes of action could be brought in the federal courts when the death occurred in a state territorial waters although federal courts began uniformly appl ying state wrongful death statutes for deaths occurring in state territorial waters,the harrisburg proscription against maritime wrongful death actions survived.
in,however,congress rejected wholesale the rule against wrongful death when it enacted the jones act and the death on the high seas act dohsa.the jones act created a wrongful death cause of action,sounding in negligence,when a seaman is killed during the course of his dohsa created a similar cause of action,sounding in either negligence or unseaworthiness,when anyone is killed on the high seas,outside territorial waters,whether or not death occurs during the course of employment both of these statutes limit recovery for wrongful death to pecuniary damages 
this series of events produced three anomalies i n territorial waters,general maritime law allowed a remedy for unseaworthiness resulting in injury,but not for death dohsa allowed a remedy for death resulting from unseaworthiness on the high seas,but general maritime law did not allow such recovery for a similar death in territorial waters and in those states whose statutes allowed a claim for wrongful death resulting from unseaworthiness,recovery was available for the death of a longshoreman due to unseaworthiness,but not for the death of a jones act seaman.in moragne states marine lines,the supreme court remedied these anomalies by overruling the harrisburg and recognizing the existence of a general maritime wrongful death action the court reasoned that w here death is caused by the breach of a duty imposed by federal maritime law,congress has established through the passage of the jones act and dohsa a policy favoring recovery in the absence of a legislative direction to except a particular class of cases.
although moragne recognized a general maritime wrongful death cause of action,it did not define the contours of such a claim.then,in services gaudet the court addressed a claim that had been asserted by the widow of a longshoreman who died as a result of injuries sustained in territorial waters.the supreme court held that the maritime wrongful death cause of action allowed the decedent dependents to recover damages for their loss of support,services,and society,as well as funeral expenses.in so holding,the court recognized that allowing a claim for loss of society damages deviated from dohsa limitation of recovery to pecuniary damages,but it nevertheless determined that such a result was compelled if the court was to shape the remedy to comport with the humanitarian policy of the maritime law to show special solicitude for those who are injured within its jurisdiction.thus,the gaudet court recognized that effectuating longstanding maritime policies trumped uniformity with dohsa.
four years after it decided gaudet,the court began to reverse course when it decided mobil oil higginbotham another case addressing the limits of the moragne wrongful death cause of action.in higginbotham,the court gave priority to the goal of achieving uniformity between general maritime law and the jones act and dohsa over the humanitarian goal of maritime law.acknowledging that gaudet had been broadly written without express reliance on the fact that the death occurred in territorial waters,the court nevertheless concluded that gaudet applied only to deaths that occurred on territorial waters thus,as higginbotham involved a death that occurred on the high seas,dohsa and its express limitation on damages,rather than gaudet,determined the damages available in the moragne action.accordingly,the court held that the decedent survivor could not recover damages for loss of society 
the court was again called on to interpret the scope of damages recoverable in a maritime wrongful death action in miles apex marine in miles,the mother of a seaman who had died in territorial waters brought a wrongful death action,alleging negligence under the jones act and unseaworthiness under general maritime law.the plaintiff sought,inter alia,damages for loss of society.the jury found that the ship owner had been negligent but that the ship was seaworthy.it also found that the decedent mother was not dependent on the decedent,so that she was not entitled to damages for loss of society 
on appeal to this court,the panel concluded as a matter of law that the ship had been unseaworthy,reviving the maritime wrongful death claim.the panel therefore addressed whether the decedent mother was entitled to recover for loss of society.relying on an earlier fifth circuit opinion,we held in miles that the mother was not entitled to such damages because she had not been financially dependent on her son 
the supreme court affirmed the judgment that the plaintiff in miles was not entitled to recover for loss of society,but did so on different grounds.after again reviewing the teleology of the wrongful death cause of action,the court held that loss of society damages are not recoverable in a general maritime action for the wrongful death of a jones act seaman noting that there is no right of recovery whatsoever for loss of society in a jones act action,the court reasoned that i t would be inconsistent with the court place in the constitutional scheme were it to sanction more expansive remedies in a judicially created cause of action in which liability is without fault than congress has allowed in cases of death resulting from negligence.accordingly,held the court,there is no recovery for loss of society in a general maritime action for the wrongful death of a jones act seaman.
c.the allemands claim 
under the present state of the law,miles and the jones act recognize that a seaman survivors have a cause of action for wrongful death,whether the death occurred in territorial waters or on the high seas,limited,however,to pecuniary damages and thus no damages for loss of society,regardless whether that cause of action is brought under the jones act,under dohsa,or under general maritime law,and higginbotham and dohsa recognize that the survivors of any person who dies on the high seas have a cause of action for wrongful death,also limited to pecuniary damages,whether that cause of action is brought under the jones act,dohsa,or general maritime law.it is less than pellucid,though,what force,if any,gaudet has in the wake of miles we need not reach this issue,however,because the parties and the district court have framed the question here more narrowly,asking only whether the survivors of a deceased longshoreman or harborworker may recover for loss of society when the death occurs in state waters we conclude that they may not.
first,this result is consistent with our precedent.prior to the supreme court ruling in miles that no survivor of a dependent or recover damages for loss of society in a moragne wrongful death action,we twice addressed whether survivors of seamen may recover for loss of society in a maritime wrongful death action.in sistrunk circle bar drilling parents of deceased seamen filed a maritime wrongful death action seeking damages for loss of society.the district court entered judgment in favor of the parents,and the drilling company appealed 
on appeal,we concluded that the parents were not entitled to damages for loss of society in so holding,we observed that neither of the goals of maritime special solicitude to seamen and achieving uniformity in maritime be achieved by allowing the sistrunk parents to recover.first,the goal of 
providing special solicitude to seamen would not be furthered in any meaningful way by allowing the parents in this case to recover for loss of society to the extent that the purpose of admiralty special solicitude to the survivors of seamen is to provide for their financial support,the special solicitude aim of admiralty has no relevance in this case.the parents in this case were not dependent on their sons 
the sistrunk panel continued 
t he parents could not recover if the seamen deaths occurred on the high seas or were the result of negligence but not of unseaworthiness.admiralty can not provide the parents solicitude at a voyage outset when their right to recover for loss of society is dependent on the fortuity that the deaths occur in territorial waters and are caused by unseaworthiness 
for the same reason,we concluded that the goal of achieving uniformity in the law would not be furthered by allowing the sistrunk parents to recover.t he parents have not explained why this court should extend to them special solicitude when,but for the happenstance that the seamen were killed in territorial waters and by unseaworthiness,congress would have denied them recovery under dohsa and the jones act.accordingly,we held that in a general maritime wrongful death action under moragne,parents may not recover for loss of society where their deceased children were killed in territorial waters and are survived by spouse child.
sistrunk could arguably be limited to situations involving recovery attempts by parents when there is also a surviving spouse or child.not so in miles melrose,however,in which we confronted the issue whether may recover for loss of society when there is no surviving spouse or child,an issue of first impression for this circuit.we answered that query in the negative,concluding that the aims of maritime law would not be served by allowing recovery under such circumstances.we explained that,like the parents in sistrunk,the parents in miles could not recover damages for loss of society under either dohsa or the jones act the fact that the miles decedent had not been survived by a spouse or child did not alter the result as we had in sistrunk,we concluded in miles that the goal of achieving uniformity in maritime law was best served by denying recovery.with respect to the goal of providing solicitude to seamen,we concluded that s ince the parents here were also not dependent on their son and since they too could not recover these damages under the jones act or dohsa,we do not contravene maritime law aim of providing special solicitude to seamen by denying them recovery for loss of society.although the supreme court affirmed miles on other grounds,its holding that there is no maritime cause of action for loss of society for the survivors of dependent or not conflict with our reasoning.
both miles and sistrunk,of course,involved seamen and are therefore distinguishable from this case.the holdings in neither miles or sistrunk,however,rested on the fact that the decedents were seamen.instead,we noted in both cases that the surviving parents would not have a cause of action under either the jones act or dohsa and dohsa,of course,applies to both seamen and nonseamen.if anything,the arguments in favor of denial of recovery advanced in sistrunk and miles are even stronger here,as it would be anomalous to expand the class of beneficiaries of nonseamen who may recover for loss of society in the aftermath of the supreme court denial of any such recovery to the beneficiaries of seamen.
in addition,the circuit courts that have considered the instant issue have almost unanimously agreed with our approach in miles and sistrunk citing miles and sistrunk,the second,sixth,and eleventh circuits have held that a parent of one who dies in territorial waters on a pleasure craft may not recover for loss of society in a maritime wrongful death action although these cases did not involve longshoremen,their reasoning does not turn on the fact that the decedents were nonseafarers instead,the reasoning in each case turned on whether allowing recovery would further the twin goals of maritime law.
appellants urge us to ignore this case law and instead adopt the ninth circuit holding in sutton earles in sutton,parents of several individuals who died on a pleasure craft sued for loss of society damages under general maritime law the ninth circuit first concluded that gaudet authorized recovery of damages for loss of society by the survivors of nonseamen and that neither the jones act nor dohsa applied to limit the damages to pecuniary damages.it further noted that both the jones act and dohsa allow recovery by parents when there is no surviving spouse or child.the court then responded to the argument that such damages should not be available to parents 
we do not consider ourselves free to give such weight as the second circuit does in wahlstrom to the interest of uniformity,in light of gaudet explicit acknowledgement that it was creating a category of damages in territorial waters,and the acknowledgements
