facts and proceedings 
at cdt on august,chios beauty left vera cruz,mexico,bound for new orleans,where it was scheduled to load a cargo of grain.her master was captain nikolaos ntouslazis,who had received his master license in.the ship was equipped with navtex,a dedicated receiver providing worldwide weather reports,as well as imarsat,which provides weather information.at the time chios beauty embarked,ntouslazis mistakenly believed that tropical storm katrina was near the virgin islands.katrina was actually northwest of the bahamas,and she strengthened into a hurricane later that day.
chios beauty was owned by chios shipping,a panamanian corporation,and was operated by harbor shipping trading,harbor shipping.harbor shipping agent in new orleans was sunrise shipping agency,sunrise.on august,a sunrise representative asked a representative of harbor shipping whether the operator wanted the ship to continue to new orleans.harbor shipping instructed sunrise to bring the ship into new orleans,because we do know where the storm is going.
the national hurricane center nhc issued two advisories on august that predicted the hurricane would make landfall somewhere within a stretch of coastline that included new orleans.at the next day,nhc issued another advisory that placed new orleans in the center of the area katrina was predicted to hit.at that same morning,chios beauty arrived at southwest pass,the navigable mouth of the mississippi.minutes after she took on a pilot and entered the river,nhc issued a hurricane watch for an area that included new orleans.a representative of harbor shipping later testified that he did not consider diverting chios beauty,because everybody believed that the cool waters of the mississippi would not let the hurricane head toward new orleans.later that day,the ship moored at a wharf opposite several barges and tugboats owned by plaintiffs.when katrina hit,the ship lines snapped before the winds reached hurricane force.the storm surge carried chios beauty across the river,where it allided with the plaintiffs barges and grounded several tugboats.
plaintiffs filed suit against the chios beauty in rem,harbor shipping,and chios shipping,seeking damages resulting from the allision.the district court ordered the ship arrest and defendants obtained a letter of undertaking to secure its release.this letter provided that the american owners mutual protection and indemnity association,the association undertook to pay plaintiffs any 
sum which either may be agreed between the parties and approved by the association,or which is adjudged to be due in the matter pending in the district court from the vessel,in rem,its owner by final judgment provided that the total of our liability hereunder shall not exceed the sum of inclusive of interest and costs.
the letter also provided that plaintiffs right to challenge the sufficiency of the security is reserved and that the security could be increased or decreased by agreement of the parties or,failing such agreement,by order of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.the letter was to be governed by and construed in accordance with maritime law.this letter was negotiated after the arrest of the vessel and memorialized on september,prior to any appraisal of the vessel.
the district court held a bench trial in and found in favor of plaintiffs.it credited the testimony of plaintiffs expert that chios beauty should not have entered the port of new orleans with hurricane katrina predicted to strike new orleans.additionally,it found that the weather information considered by harbor shipping and captain ntouslazis was grossly insufficient in scope,and their understanding of the weather information was also inadequate.the district court determined that defendants had ample time and information to know not to endanger the vessel by bringing it into the port of new orleans.based on these findings,the district court concluded that defendants had been negligent by failing to prudently monitor and interpret the available weather information concerning hurricane katrina and for sailing the vessel into the port of new orleans and directly into the path of hurricane katrina when there was sufficient time to divert to a safe port in the western gulf of mexico.
in the same order,the district court increased the amount of the security provided by the association letter of undertaking to million,which it found to be the value of chios beauty.final judgment was entered making defendants jointly and severally liable to cooper consolidated for and to crescent towing for,but capping in rem recovery at.the judgment provided for interest from august,to august,and interest thereafter pursuant to.the district court granted the defendants motion for an amended judgment in part by setting the rate of interest at percent,but refused to alter the standard of care to which it had held the defendants.
in august,the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment to provide that interest on the judgment could run against chios beauty in rem in excess of million.the district court denied the motion on the ground that the letter of undertaking provided that security on the vessel would be inclusive of interests and costs.thus,it found that plaintiffs total in rem recovery was limited to million and that they could not collect interest in excess of this amount.the district court entered its final amended judgment on may,awarding plaintiffs in damages,plus pre and interest,but limiting in rem recovery to million.both sides timely appealed.we denied motions by plaintiffs to supplement the record with an updated letter of undertaking and by defendants to supplement it with three katrina strike probability charts issued by the nhc before the storm made landfall.

standard of care 
the defendants claim that the district court erred in applying a regular negligence standard of care,rather than the heightened in extremis standard,in judging whether ntouslazis was negligent in continuing to new orleans rather than running for safety elsewhere in the gulf.
