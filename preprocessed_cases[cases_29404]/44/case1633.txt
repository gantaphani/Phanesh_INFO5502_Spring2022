on rehearing en banc 
brickwood contractors,filed suit against datanet engineering and john cignatta together,the defendants,asserting claims of defamation and tortious interference with business relations.after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the defendants filed a motion seeking sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court imposed against brickwood sanctions in the amount of.brickwood appealed,and a panel of this court reversed the sanctions order.sitting en banc,we likewise reverse the district court order imposing sanctions 
the facts underlying this dispute are as follows.after submitting the lowest bid,brickwood entered into a contract with charles county,maryland,to repair,clean and restore a water storage tank.k k painting,a losing bidder,submitted a bid protest to the county,asking that brickwood contract be terminated.the bid protest included a letter written to k k by defendant john cignatta,president of defendant datanet engineering.in his letter,cignatta stated that the containment method being used by brickwood in connection with the removal of lead paint from the water tank violated various osha regulations,and the letter used the word illegal several times when describing the containment method being used.see.the county later terminated brickwood contract,but for reasons unconnected to the bid protest.after losing the county contract,brickwood filed an action in federal district court against cignatta and datanet,asserting that the cignatta letter amounted to defamation and tortious interference with business relations.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,and brickwood appealed.
a few days after judgment had been rendered but before brickwood filed its notice of appeal,the defendants filed with the district court and served on brickwood a motion requesting monetary sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.in the motion,the defendants claimed that brickwood frivolously filed this action,failed to reevaluate its case throughout discovery,and filed a meritless response to their summary judgment motion.brickwood filed an opposition to the sanctions motion,but did not argue that the defendants failed to comply with rule provisions.see fed.civ.c a.the district court held the sanctions motion in abeyance pending a decision by this court on the summary judgment ruling.after this court affirmed that decision,see brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,wl cir.march,the district court imposed rule sanctions against brickwood in the amount of.
brickwood appealed the sanctions,arguing that the defendants rule motion did not comply with the provisions set forth in rule c a.although brickwood did not raise the issue before the district court,a panel of this court nonetheless concluded that the defendants failure to comply with rule c a precluded the imposition of sanctions.the panel therefore reversed the district court order imposing sanctions.see brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,cir.after a call for a poll by a circuit judge,a majority of active circuit judges voted to vacate the panel opinion and rehear the case en banc.we now reverse the district court order imposing sanctions against brickwood.
at the center of this case is rule c a,which states 
a motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision b.it shall be served as provided in rule,but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless,within days after service of the motion or such other period as the court may prescribe,the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,allegation,or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.
the requirements of the rule are straightforward the party seeking sanctions must serve the rule motion on the opposing party at least days before filing the motion with the district court,and sanctions may be sought only if the challenged pleading is not withdrawn or corrected within days after service of the motion.see id.because the rule requires that the party submitting the challenged pleading be given an opportunity to withdraw the pleading,sanctions can not be sought after summary judgment has been granted.see hunter earthgrains.bakery,cir explaining that the safe harbor provisions of rule c a preclude the serving and filing of any rule motion after conclusion of the case see also in re pennie edmonds llp,cir t he safe harbor provision functions as a practical time limit,and motions have been disallowed as untimely when filed after a point in the litigation when the lawyer sought to be sanctioned lacked an opportunity to correct or withdraw the challenged submission.ridder city of springfield,cir noting that because of the requirements of rule c a,a party can not wait until after summary judgment to move for sanctions under rule.
it is clear from the language of the rule that it imposes mandatory obligations upon the party seeking sanctions,so that failure to comply with the procedural requirements precludes the imposition of the requested sanctions.see,elliott tilton,cir the plain language of rule c a indicates that this notice and opportunity prior to filing is mandatory.plaintiffs did not comply with this procedural prerequisite.therefore,the sanction and payment of costs and attorneys fees ordered by the district court can not be upheld under rule.accord gordon unifund ccr partners,cir radcliffe rainbow constr,cir aerotech,estes,cir ridder,at hadges yonkers racing,cir.in addition,the rule serves to limit the power of the district court to impose sanctions under the rule,by expressly conditioning the court authority to impose sanctions upon compliance with the provisions.see.c if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines that subdivision b has been violated,the court may,subject to the conditions stated below,impose an appropriate sanction emphasis added.
rule c a thus establishes conditions precedent to the imposition of sanctions under the rule.if those conditions are not satisfied,the rule motion for sanctions may not be filed with the district court.if a motion nonetheless is filed with the court,the district court lacks authority to impose the requested sanctions 
in this case,the defendants did not serve their rule motion on brickwood before filing it with the district court.moreover,because the defendants waited until after summary judgment had been granted,brickwood could not have withdrawn or otherwise corrected the complaint even if the motion had been served before it was filed.it seems clear,then,that the defendants utterly failed to comply with the procedural requirements of rule c a.the conclusion that the defendants failed to comply with the procedural requirements of rule c a would be enough,at least in most cases,to require reversal of the district court imposition of sanctions.see,cooter gell hartmarx,d concluding that a district court decision to impose rule sanctions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion gordon,at the district court awarding of sanctions against appellant in contravention of the explicit procedural requirements of rule was an abuse of discretion.
as mentioned previously,however,brickwood did not argue below that the defendants failure to comply with rule c a precluded an award of sanctions under rule.the defendants contend that brickwood failure to raise the issue below prevents it from raising that issue on appeal.see,williams professional,cir issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally not considered absent exceptional circumstances.muth united states,cir as this court has repeatedly held,issues raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered.the question,then,is whether we should in this case apply the general rule that we will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.
a fundamental exception to the general rule,of course,involves issues relating to the court jurisdiction.federal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction they have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto.bender williamsport area sch,d.jurisdiction can not be conferred by the parties,nor can a defect in jurisdiction be waived by the parties.see united states cotton,d.accordingly,questions of jurisdiction may be raised at any point during the proceedings and may or,more precisely,must be raised sua sponte by the court.see bender,at.e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.internal quotation marks omitted.if the requirements of rule c a can be viewed as limitations on the district court jurisdiction,then brickwood failure to timely raise the rule c a issue would be irrelevant.we conclude,however,that rule c a does not implicate the district court jurisdiction,a conclusion that is largely compelled by the supreme court recent decision in kontrick ryan,d 
in kontrick,a creditor filed an objection to the discharge of a chapter debtor.although the objection was not timely under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,the debtor did not raise the timeliness issue until after the bankruptcy court considered the merits of the creditor objection and determined that discharge should be denied.see id.at.in a motion for reconsideration,the debtor argued that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the creditor claim because it was untimely filed.the bankruptcy court rejected that argument and concluded that the debtor forfeited the right to question the timeliness of the objection by not raising the issue before the bankruptcy court ruled on the merits of the objection.the district court and the court of appeals agreed with the bankruptcy court,both concluding that the timeliness provisions of the relevant bankruptcy rules were not jurisdictional and could be forfeited if not timely raised.see id.at.
the supreme court agreed with this conclusion.the court noted that congress had clearly granted the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the creditor objection to the discharge of the debtor and that there were no time constraints contained in any of the statutes governing objections to discharge.id.at.because the district court had jurisdiction over the creditor claim and court procedural rules do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction,id.internal quotation marks omitted,the court concluded that the time constraints in the rule did not implicate the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.instead,the court described the bankruptcy rule as a rule that d id not delineate what cases bankruptcy courts are competent to adjudicate.id.
the court rejected the debtor argument that,while the rule did not implicate the court jurisdiction as that phrase is commonly understood,the rule had the same import as provisions governing jurisdiction and that a debtor should therefore be permitted to raise the timeliness question at any time in the proceedings,even initially on appeal or certiorari.id.at.the court explained 
the equation kontrick advances overlooks a critical difference between a rule governing jurisdiction and an inflexible rule.characteristically,a court jurisdiction can not be expanded to account for the parties litigation conduct a rule,on the other hand,even if unalterable on a party application,can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.
id.at.applying the approach of the kontrick court to this case leads us to conclude that the provisions of rule do not implicate the district court jurisdiction.
kontrick makes it clear that the term jurisdictional should be used very carefully clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.id.at.we believe the court recommendation is applicable here.there is no question that congress has granted federal district courts jurisdiction over the category of case before between completely diverse parties where the amount in controversy exceeds.see west supp caterpillar lewis,d.and the parties point us to no statute that withdraws or otherwise limits this grant of jurisdiction with regard to a procedurally defective rule motion,nor have we found any such statute.the absence of such statutory withdrawal or limitation makes it difficult to conclude that the provisions of rule affect the district court jurisdiction.see kontrick,at.at only congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction.owen equip.erection kroger,d explaining that it is axiomatic that the federal rules of civil procedure do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction snyder harris,d explaining that the court authority is limited by the inability of a court,by rule,to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute internal quotation marks omitted.these rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the united states district courts.
we recognize,of course,that there are some court rules that are consistently described as jurisdictional.for example,cases refer to rule of the rules of appellate procedure,which governs the time for filing a notice of appeal,as mandatory and jurisdictional.see,browder director,dep t of,d alston mci communications,cir rules governing the timing of certain motions,such as rule of the rules of civil procedure,have also been described as jurisdictional.see,schneider fried,cir concluding that district court lacks jurisdiction to grant untimely rule motion weissman dawn joy fashions,cir neither rule b nor rule b gives a district court the power to grant an extension,and we have stated that rule b makes the time limitation jurisdictional so that the failure to make a timely motion divests the district court of power to modify the trial verdict.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.given kontrick admonition that court rules of procedure do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction,at.at,and its directive to use the term jurisdiction only in limited circumstances,it is perhaps possible that the court might begin to describe such rules not as jurisdictional but instead as inflexible rules.assuming,however,that such rules are properly described as jurisdictional,we do not believe that rule c can be so described.
broadly speaking,district courts have jurisdiction over the first round of litigation proceedings,and the courts of appeal have jurisdiction over the second round.in that sense,then,in the language of kontrick,different classes of cases fall within the adjudicatory authority of district courts and appellate courts have authority over trials and appellate courts have authority over appeals.id.appellate rule is thus jurisdictional in that it establishes the point of time at which the jurisdiction of the district court ends and that of the court of appeals begins.see griggs provident consumer disc,d the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.the rules governing the timing of motions likewise involve drawing the temporal line marking the point when the district court jurisdiction over a case ends and the jurisdiction of the appellate court begins.
rule,however,serves no similar purpose.rule simply sets forth,albeit in mandatory terms,the conditions under which sanctions may be imposed while the case is before the district court.rule is not directed at determining the point in time when jurisdiction over a single case shifts from one court to another.because the purpose and operation of rule are far different from those of the other rules discussed above,we do not believe that rule should be placed in the same category as those jurisdictional rules instead,we believe that rule c and the requirements set forth in subsection c a,like the bankruptcy rule before the supreme court in kontrick,are properly characterized as inflexible rule s.kontrick,at.at.
we recognize that the language of the bankruptcy rule at issue in kontrick is substantially different from the language at issue in this case.rule c expressly limits the power of the district court to impose sanctions,whereas the bankruptcy rule in kontrick simply establishes a time for filing an objection,without including any limitation on the court power to act on an untimely objection but we do not believe that the rule limitation on a district court power is determinative of the jurisdiction question.
first,we note that neither rule of the rules of appellate procedure nor rule of the rules of civil procedure contains language expressly limiting the power of the court to act on an untimely filing,yet these rules are considered to be jurisdictional.this suggests that it is not the language of the rule so much as the purpose of the rule that is determinative of the jurisdiction question.and as discussed above,the purpose of rule does not provide a basis for attaching jurisdictional significance to the rule procedural requirements.
moreover,there are other limitations on a district court power to act that do not act as limitations on the court jurisdiction.for example,a district court lacks the power to enter judgment against a party over whom the court lacks personal jurisdiction.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d personal jurisdiction is an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district court,without which the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted insurance of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d the requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction represents a restriction on judicial power as a matter of individual liberty.nonetheless,unlike jurisdiction,the requirement of personal jurisdiction may be waived.see ruhrgas,at.insurance of ireland,at.thus,even if the district court in fact lacked personal jurisdiction over a party,the failure to timely raise the defense may result in the enforcement of a judgment that the district court was,in one sense,powerless to render.
similarly,a district court surely lacks the power to enter judgment in favor of a party who has not alleged or proved a cognizable cause of action.nonetheless,the ultimate failure of a complaint to state a cause of action does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,d it is firmly established in our cases that absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.bell hood.jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.for it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.
thus,a court power to act simply is not with its jurisdiction.that is,a district court may have jurisdiction over a case but yet lack the power to act on a particular claim made within that case.while it may be tempting to equate an express limitation on a court power to act,like that contained in rule,with a limitation on the court jurisdiction,we must remain mindful of the supreme court admonition in kontrick to reserve the jurisdictional label only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.kontrick,at.at.rule does not delineate a class of cases that the district court is authorized to hear,but instead sets forth inflexible rules governing the circumstances under which rule sanctions may be sought and granted.the district court,therefore,does not lose jurisdiction over a sanctions request simply because the requesting party failed to comply with rule requirements.and because rule c a does not implicate the district court subject matter jurisdiction,the issue of whether a party has complied with the rule is subject to forfeiture if not timely raised 
in his separate opinion,judge luttig suggests that in addition to the jurisdictional and rules discussed by the supreme court in kontrick,there is a third category of rules rules which do not implicate a court jurisdiction,but are nonetheless not forfeitable by a party,and which must be enforced by a court without regard to whether compliance with the rule was timely or ever raised by the appropriate party.judge king expresses a similar view in his separate opinion.while their approach to the question is not without appeal,we believe that the supreme court at least implicitly rejected such an approach in kontrick.
the petitioner in kontrick acknowledged that the bankruptcy rule at issue there did not affect the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.the petitioner nonetheless argued that given the unequivocal language of the rule and the fact that the bankruptcy rules place limits on the bankruptcy court power to extend the time limit set forth in the rule,the rule should be treated as if it were a jurisdictional rule and thus should not be forfeitable.see kontrick,at.at see also brief of petitioner,wl,at reply brief of petitioner,wl,at.the supreme court rejected that argument 
though kontrick concedes that rules and b are not properly labeled jurisdictional in the sense of describing a court jurisdiction,he maintains that the rules have the same import as provisions governing jurisdiction.a litigant generally may raise a court lack of jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action,even initially at the highest appellate instance.just so,kontrick urges,a debtor may challenge a creditor objection to discharge as untimely any time in the proceedings,even initially on appeal or certiorari.
the equation kontrick advances overlooks a critical difference between a rule governing jurisdiction and an inflexible rule.characteristically,a court jurisdiction can not be expanded to account for the parties litigation conduct a rule,on the other hand,even if unalterable on a party application,can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.
kontrick,at.at footnote and citations omitted.this analysis seems to indicate that only issues relating to true jurisdiction are not subject to the general rule that issues not timely raised are forfeited.thus,we find it difficult to square the court rejection of the petitioner argument in kontrick with the existence of a third category of rules.while the supreme court may yet recognize such a category,we do not believe it would be proper for us to do so now.
to summarize,we conclude that the provisions of rule are inflexible rules and that a district court exceeds its authority by imposing sanctions requested through a rule motion.however,because rule provisions do not implicate the district court jurisdiction,claims of with those provisions are subject to the general rule requiring issues to be first raised with the district court.failure to timely raise the issue amounts to a forfeiture of the issue.
our conclusion that the protections of rule are not jurisdictional and can be forfeited if not timely raised does not,however,end our inquiry.the rule that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered is a general rule only.under certain circumstances,this court is free to consider issues that would otherwise be forfeited.see,williams,at issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally not considered absent exceptional circumstances.
in criminal cases,a court power to consider an issue is governed by rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,see.b a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention,as fleshed out by the supreme court in united states olano,d setting forth standards to guide the determination of whether a forfeited error should be corrected under rule b.while the federal rules of civil procedure contain no equivalent to rule b,federal courts have long recognized their inherent power to address issues that were not timely raised.see,new york cent.johnson.the public interest requires that the court of its own motion,as is its power and duty,protect suitors in their right to a verdict,uninfluenced by the appeals of counsel to passion or prejudice.where such paramount considerations are involved,the failure of counsel to particularize an exception will not preclude this court from correcting the error.internal citation omitted washington gas light virginia power,cir i f deemed necessary to reach the correct result,an appellate court may sua sponte consider points not presented to the district court and not even raised on appeal by any party.
this court has held that the approach set out by the supreme court in olano should also be applied in civil cases.see taylor virginia union,cir en banc before we can exercise our discretion to correct an error not raised below in a civil case,at a minimum,the requirements of olano must be satisfied,abrogated in part on other grounds by desert palace,costa,d.under the olano standard,there must be an error,that error must be plain,and the error must affect the appellant substantial rights.see olano,at.taylor,at.even if these requirements are met,this court is not required to correct the error.see olano,at.if the forfeited error is plain and affects substantial rights,the court of appeals has authority to order correction,but is not required to do so.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted united states stockton,cir explaining that the correction of a plain error remains within the discretion of the appellate court.we should exercise our discretion to correct the error only if we can conclude,after examining the particulars of the case,that the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.taylor,at 
in our view,the first three olano requirements are easily satisfied in this case.because the defendants failed to comply with rule provisions,it was error to impose the sanctions requested by the defendants.see olano,at.deviation from a legal rule is error unless the rule has been waived.id.at.if a legal rule was violated during the district court proceedings,and if the defendant did not waive the rule,then there has been an error despite the absence of a timely objection.the error is plain,because at least by the time of appeal,caselaw from this and other circuits made it clear that rule provisions are mandatory.see united states promise,cir en banc to be plain,an error must be clear or obvious,at least by the time of appeal.an error is clear or obvious when the settled law of the supreme court or this circuit establishes that an error has occurred.in the absence of such authority,decisions by other circuit courts of appeals are pertinent to the question of whether an error is plain.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.finally,the error affected brickwood substantial rights,because it was subjected to rule sanctions that the district court was not empowered to impose,given the defendants failure to comply with rule c a.see olano,at.explaining that an appellant substantial rights are affected by an error that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.
after carefully considering the particular circumstances of this case and the purposes behind the provisions of rule,we also conclude that correction of the rule error is warranted.as the sixth circuit explained in ridder city of springfield,the provisions were added to rule in order to reduce rule volume,formalize appropriate due process considerations of sanctions litigation,and diminish the rule chilling effect.ridder,at.in addition,
b y providing immunity from sanctions through,the safe harbor period also serves the streamlining purpose that the architects of rule originally envisioned.undoubtedly,the drafters also anticipated that civility among attorneys and between bench and bar would be furthered by having attorneys communicate with each other with an eye toward potentially resolving their differences prior to court involvement.
id.citation omitted.allowing the imposition of sanctions to stand in this case,where there was not even an attempt to comply with the requirements of the provisions,would surely frustrate these important goals.moreover,as discussed above,the very structure of the provisions makes it clear that a sanctions motion must be served and filed before the conclusion of the case.rule c a provides a safe harbor only if the party against whom sanctions are sought in fact has an opportunity to withdraw the challenged pleading.in this case,the defendants did not seek sanctions until after summary judgment had been granted against brickwood,thus making it impossible for brickwood to reconsider its position in the face of a sanctions request.
in sum,a consideration of the purposes underlying rule c a and the extent to which these purposes would be frustrated by affirming the imposition of sanctions in this case suggests that the interests of justice would best be served by the exercise of our discretion to correct the improperly imposed sanctions.this conclusion is strengthened when we consider the fact that all the parties involved in this case were equally blameworthy in creating the error.that is,as counsel for both sides readily admitted at oral argument,rule c a was not complied with by the defendants or raised by brickwood because they were simply unaware of it.under these circumstances,we believe it would be unjust for brickwood to bear the full weight of the consequences of an unfamiliarity shared by all involved.therefore,after careful consideration of all the relevant circumstances,we believe it proper to exercise our discretion to correct the error raised by brickwood for the first time on appeal,and we therefore reverse the district court order imposing rule sanctions.
we pause to emphasize that the determination of whether to exercise our discretion to correct an unpreserved error is a one.see singleton wulff,d the matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.thus,a decision to correct or not to correct an error in a particular case may provide little guidance in a later case arising under substantially different circumstances.for example,the majority in rector,after concluding that rule provisions were subject to forfeiture,did not elect to consider the forfeited rule issue.however,in kirby allegheny beverage,cir,a case relied upon by the panel that originally heard this case,the court elected to correct a rule error that had not even been raised by the sanctioned party on appeal.see id.at.because the facts in rector differ so substantially from the facts in the case at bar,we do not believe rector to be inconsistent with the decision in kirby or in this case nonetheless,given the important purposes served by rule c a and the mandatory nature of its language,we believe that in most cases involving failure to comply with the provisions,a proper application of the olano taylor standards will lead to correction of the error.
to summarize,we conclude that the provisions of rule c a,while mandatory,do not implicate the district court jurisdiction and thus may be forfeited if not timely raised.in this case,brickwood forfeited the compliance issue by not raising it before the district court.nonetheless,exercising our discretion to notice and correct plain errors,we conclude that the district court erred by imposing sanctions on brickwood in the face of the defendants failure to comply with the requirements of rule c a.accordingly,we hereby reverse the district court order imposing sanctions on brickwood.
i concur in the result.
my opinion in this case is expressed in the panel opinion,brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,cir,which has not changed.
federal rule of civil procedure frcp c provides that a court may impose sanctions based on a party motion,but specifies that the imposition of sanctions is subject to the condition that the movant comply with the safe harbor provisions listed in subdivision c a.i concur in the majority opinion to the extent that the majority concludes that rule safe harbor provisions are mandatory,in the sense that failure to comply with th ose procedural requirements precludes the imposition of the requested sanctions that rule c serves to limit the power of the district court to impose sanctions under the rule,by expressly conditioning the court authority to impose sanctions upon compliance with the safe harbor provisions and that the safe harbor provisions are thus conditions precedent to the imposition of sanctions such that i f a motion nonetheless is filed with the court,the district court lacks the authority to impose the requested sanctions.ante at.i believe that these conclusions follow from the plain text of rule.
but despite these conclusions,the majority goes on to hold that if no objection is made to a movant with the safe harbor provisions,and sanctions on that motion are imposed by the lower court,this court may yet address that error if such meets the and ultimately discretion ary requirements of review.ante at.on this score,i do not believe that the majority accords sufficient weight to rule c express conditions on the court authority to impose sanctions.if it is correct that a movant with the safe harbor provisions deprives a court of the power to impose sanctions on a party motion,then i,like judge king,am quite doubtful that that power is recovered through a party failure to note the error.see post at.i certainly do not believe such to be required,and especially not by the supreme court recent opinion in kontrick ryan,d.while i,too,would reverse the district court imposition of rule sanctions on brickwood,in my view the defendants with the safe harbor provisions,even though not objected to below,necessitates reversal of the sanctions.to the extent that the majority holds that reversal on this ground is not required,i concur only in the judgment of the court.
as suggested by the majority,kontrick rested on a dichotomy between mandatory rule s governing jurisdiction,which can not be waived by a party and thus can be raised at any stage in a proceeding although not collaterally,and inflexible rule s,which,even if unalterable on a party application,can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.ante at.as framed by the majority,the question of whether brickwood forfeited its right to assert the defendants with the safe harbor provisions by failing to raise the issue until this appeal is to be decided by determining into which of these two categories rule c falls.in concluding that rule c is not jurisdictional within the intendment of kontrick,and thus can be forfeited,the majority distinguishes rule c from federal rule of appellate procedure frap and frcp,which in the past have been held to be jurisdictional,and which the majority contends are properly termed jurisdictional even.
i agree with the majority that rule is not jurisdictional within the intendment of kontrick.but i disagree with the majority that rules and are jurisdictional under kontrick.as explained below,however,i believe that,while neither rule nor rule nor,in the end,rule c fits within either of kontrick categories,the conditions of all three rules are unwaivable.
as an initial matter,i believe the majority has overlooked the historical and structural reasons that rules and have been considered jurisdictional,and consequently has erroneously dismissed the relevance of rule c text on the basis that neither rule nor rule contains language expressly limiting the power of the court to act on an untimely filing,yet these rules are considered to be jurisdictional.ante at.although that description of the texts of rules and is literally correct,it has little relevance.the jurisdictional character of these rules has been based not alone on their wording,or even so much on their wording,but on the wording of other rules,such as frcp b and federal rule of criminal procedure frcrp b,which limit the court power to enlarge the period in which the relevant rule,rule requires a party to act 
in fact,in holding that rule b is mandatory and jurisdictional,the supreme court emphasized the importance of such language.united states robinson,d.in robinson,the court not only rested on rule b plain and clear language of restriction,reading it to prohibit a court recognition of a late notice of appeal,but also explained that i t is quite significant that the rule not only prohibits the court from enlarging the period for taking an appeal,but,by the same language in the same sentence,also prohibits enlargement of the period for taking any action under rules,and,except as provided in those rules.prior cases interpreting the latter rules,the court emphasized,had concluded that while,for example,the literal language of rule regarding motions for new trial places limit s only on the making of the motion,rule b prescribe s precise times within which the power of the courts must be confined.id.at.
but even apart from the majority failure to recognize the historical and structural explanation for the characterization of rules and as jurisdictional,the majority explanation of how these rules could be called jurisdictional under kontrick can not be reconciled with the supreme court analysis in that case.after explaining that o nly congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction and discussing the misleading description of some court rules as jurisdictional historically,the kontrick court urged that c larity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.at.at emphases added.the majority attempts to characterize trials and appeals as different classes of cases in the language of kontrick for the purposes of jurisdiction and,while admitting that the supreme court might eventually hold to the contrary,essentially concludes that because the limitations of rules and relate to the transition of a case between trial and appeal,they are jurisdictional as meant by kontrick.ante at.
despite the precatory phrasing of kontrick instruction as to the proper use of jurisdictional,there is no suggestion that the court meant for jurisdiction,the determination of which,only paragraphs earlier,the court explained was the exclusive province of congress,to have anything but its ordinary meaning,a meaning that does not at all support the majority conclusions.indeed,the majority analysis in this regard neglects the axioms of jurisdiction recited in kontrick and that opinion application of those principles to support its analogous conclusion about the time limitations at issue in that case.see at.at.quite simply,just as with the time constraints applicable to objections to discharge contained in bankruptcy rules a and b and b,frap and frcp are rules of practice and procedure authorized by the rules enabling act,in this case.id.it is axiomatic that such rules do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.accord willy coastal,d federal courts,in adopting rules,a re not free to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute.
that such is undeniably true for rule is borne out by the federal rules of civil procedure explicit command that t hese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the united states district courts.kontrick,at.at quoting.
the case for frap is somewhat less straightforward due to the absence of a counterpart to frcp in the federal rules of appellate procedure.as a general matter,congress has not granted the supreme court the authority to promulgate federal rules of appellate procedure that enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,and the version of frcp contained in the version of those rules,former frap b reflected that fact.see,charles wright et,fed.prac.proc.juris d supp noting that purported conflict between the prohibition of rule b and the jurisdictional limitations of rules and was not so much a direct conflict as it was a reflection of the chameleon quality of the word jurisdiction.citation omitted.however,rule b was deemed abrogated in,in recognition of statutory amendments that allowed the supreme court to issue rules to define finality for purposes of and to authorize interlocutory appeals not provided for by.fed,comm.notes,amends.according to the advisory committee,once this power was exercised with respect to these unquestionably jurisdictional statutes,some federal rules of appellate procedure would,in fact,extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,obsoleting rule b.id.
but frap was not promulgated pursuant to either amendment,nor is there any indication that congress similarly delegated any authority to the supreme court to interpret or expand on the statutory time limits on civil appeals set forth in which,however,may be independently jurisdictional,see kontrick,at.at.of course,that congress,in making the amendments,felt compelled to explicitly authorize the issuance of court rules of jurisdictional effect suggests that court rules authorized by section alone lack such force,even when they are similar to statutory requirements.
that rule c is not jurisdictional does not,as i suggest above,resolve the question of its waivability.while it seems clear that the supreme court meant to criticize the use of the label jurisdictional for court rules that,like rules and,do not affect a court jurisdiction,there is little evidence to suggest that kontrick meant to upset the settled understandings of the effect of with these rules,notwithstanding a court statutory jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.the requirements of rule,for example,can not be waived accordingly,a court is not prohibited from considering a belated motion to dismiss for an untimely notice of appeal.see,torres oakland scavenger,d.thus,provided that the legal effect of these rules was not changed sub silentio by the court in kontrick,rules like these would comprise a third category of rules beyond the two mentioned in kontrick,presenting the question of whether rule c might not fall within such a third category.
that said,the time limitations imposed by frcp b on frcp,and by frap b on frap,are strikingly similar in language and structure to the time limitations imposed by the bankruptcy rules in kontrick while the latter rules lack the former pedigree,if kontrick truly requires that all court rules be either jurisdictional,and thus unwaivable,or rules,and thus forfeitable,then principled distinction of the two sets of rules might be impossible,meaning that both sets of rules could be waived.
kontrick,however,was decided in the limited context of pleadings and responses thereto.from its opening sentence,which notes consistent with the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure that ryan objections to discharge were included in a pleading,at.at,to its ultimate description of the time limitations at issue as rules,id.at emphasis added,kontrick use of the rules governing,and terminology of,pleadings and responses thereto is pervasive.the opinion concludes that,although,by rule,frcp b h governed that adversary proceeding,and frcp h preserves certain defenses beyond the initial response,under that rule o nly jurisdiction is preserved.id.at.characterizing kontrick argument as an affirmative defense,the court held that because he failed to assert the time constraints in a pleading or amended pleading responsive to the amended complaint and because that defense was not jurisdictional,it was forfeited.id.
given the obvious implications of kontrick for other jurisdictional court rules,i doubt that this emphasis was accidental and,in any event,i would proceed on the assumption that it was not.of particular note for kontrick prospective applicability is that the relevant requirements of rule apply only to defenses to pleadings.that term,of course,is one of art under the federal rules of civil procedure,limited to those papers defined to be such in frcp,a rule that distinguishes between pleadings,which include a complaint and an answer,and motions and other papers.perry sullivan,cir.while a notice of appeal is somewhat obviously not a pleading under these rules,neither are motions for a new trial or for sanctions pursuant to rule.an objection based on with the relevant time limitations for filing of these documents is therefore not subject to rule provisions regarding the presentation and preservation of defenses to pleadings as such,kontrick does not squarely control in such a context whether that objection can be waived.
this is a fine distinction,but i think it is a real and justifiable one the distinction runs throughout kontrick,and stands ready to be developed by the court in the appropriate case.especially given that overruling by implication is disfavored,i believe that the ultimate conclusions of the rule and cases as to their character must remain unchanged by kontrick,and,accordingly,that these rules fall into a third category of rules which,while not limiting the court jurisdiction,have the effect of jurisdictional limitations and,therefore may neither be waived by a party,nor ignored by a court 
however this third category is precisely delineated,i believe that it encompasses rule c and that rule safe harbor provisions.those provisions are sufficiently analogous,in language,structure,and purpose,to either rule or rule as to warrant an equivalent interpretation,as well as the overruling of rector approved fed.sav.bank,cir.in particular,i note that,as with those rules through reference to their respective restriction on enlargements of time,rule c places direct limitations on the court authority to take a certain action except under certain conditions.indeed,if anything,the structural case for rule c unwaivability is slightly stronger,given that its conditions are more directly linked to the ultimate action that is limited.that is,for rule b,it is the court authority to enlarge periods set for filing certain papers that is expressly limited,from which it is inferred that recognizing such papers when untimely is implicitly to enlarge the restricted period.see robinson,at.rule c,however,limits the court authority to grant sanctions on a party motion,directly conditioning that authority on satisfaction of the rule s safe harbor provisions.
arguably,the case for the unwaivability of rule b,for example,is made clearer by the juxtaposition of permissive language specifying when an enlargement of time may be granted generally,with restrictive language specifying for what rules it may not be granted except as provided for in those same rules.see supra at.but,in the end,this distinction is immaterial as with the juxtaposition,the phrasing may,subject to the conditions stated below in rule c suggests,on the one hand,a grant of discretion may as opposed to shall to impose sanctions when warranted but,on the other,makes clear that the exercise of that discretion is predicated on satisfaction of the conditions listed in subdivision c a subject to the se conditions.indeed,as both the majority and judge king conclude,the safe harbor provisions must be read as conditions precedent to granting sanctions.such a construction is entirely consistent with the advisory committee notes regarding rule c,and in particular with its unequivocal statement that the amended rule now provides a safe harbor so that a party will not be subject to sanctions on the basis of another party motion unless,after receiving the motion,the responding party declines its opportunity to modify or withdraw its contention,comm.notes,amends.emphases added see also post at discussing committee notes.therefore,satisfaction of these conditions seems no less a mandatory prerequisite to the imposition of rule sanctions on a party motion,than compliance with the notice of appeal requirements set out in rule,which do not limit an appellate court jurisdiction,seems a mandatory precondition to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.
it is not often that the federal rules of civil procedure grant a court the discretionary authority to take a certain action,but expressly prohibit the court exercise of that discretion except upon a party compliance with specified conditions.when such is the case,and it is clear that those conditions are mandatory prerequisites to
