opinion of the court 
beginning in,hundreds of plaintiffs filed suits against the drug manufacturer merck sharp dohme,alleging that the osteoporosis drug fosamax caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures.each plaintiff brought a tort claim alleging that merck failed to add an adequate warning of the risk of thigh fractures to fosamax drug label.many plaintiffs also brought a variety of additional claims including defective design,negligence,and breach of warranty.
plaintiffs suits were consolidated for pretrial administration in a litigation in the district of new jersey.following discovery and a bellwether trial,the district court granted merck motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims on the ground that they were preempted by federal law.the district court based its ruling on the supreme court decision in wyeth levine which holds that claims are preempted when there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved the warning that a plaintiff claims was necessary.
we will vacate and remand.preemption is an affirmative defense,and merck has not carried its burden to prove that it is entitled to that defense as a matter of law.the wyeth clear evidence standard is demanding and.it requires the factfinder to predict a highly probable outcome in a counterfactual world and,therefore,requires a court sitting in summary judgment to anticipate both the range of conclusions that a reasonable juror might reach and the certainty with which the juror would reach them.here,plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the fda would have approved a warning about the risk of thigh fractures or at the very least,to conclude that the odds of fda rejection were less than highly probable.under wyeth and rule,that is enough for plaintiffs to defeat summary judgment and proceed to trial.
background 
fosamax and atypical femoral fractures 
fosamax is a drug manufactured by merck that belongs to a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates.the food and drug administration fda approved fosamax in the for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
fosamax treats osteoporosis by correcting an imbalance in the bone remodeling process.throughout a person life,bones are continuously broken down through a process called resorption and then reformed by the creation of new bone cells.in postmenopausal women,the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation,thereby causing bone loss.if bone loss continues unchecked,a person may develop osteoporosis,a disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone structure that causes bone fragility and increases the risk of fracture.bisphosphonates like fosamax slow the resorption process,restoring the balance between resorption and formation and reducing the risk of osteoporotic fracture.
plaintiffs claim,however,that fosamax can actually increase the risk of certain bone fractures.they allege that by slowing resorption,bisphosphonates inhibit bone repair.according to plaintiffs,bones frequently develop microcracks,which are ordinarily repaired through the resorption process.an accumulation of microcracks can lead to incomplete bone fractures called stress fractures.the standalone term stress fracture typically connotes a fracture resulting from excessive loading of a normal bone,and is commonly seen in physically active individuals.a insufficiency stress fracture,by contrast,is a fracture caused by normal loading of bone.plaintiffs claim that while stress fractures typically heal on their own,some fosamax users who develop insufficiency fractures have reduced bone toughness,and fosamax prevents the normal repair of the fracture.according to plaintiffs,these patients may then go on to develop what are known as atypical femoral fractures severe,complete fractures of the femur.
plaintiffs in this case are all fosamax users who suffered atypical femoral fractures.they allege,among other things,that fosamax caused these atypical fractures by slowing the resorption process and allowing microcracks to accumulate,and merck was aware of the risk of such fractures but acted unlawfully by failing to warn doctors and patients of those dangers.they claim that merck should have included a warning about atypical femoral fractures in the drug warnings that accompany prescription drugs.the interplay,and potential collision,between warning duties and federal regulatory requirements is the subject of this appeal.
regulatory framework 
the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca regulates the marketing and sale of prescription drugs in the united states.under the fdca,a manufacturer must obtain approval from the united states food and drug administration fda before marketing a new drug as part of a new drug application,the manufacturer must submit a proposed package insert,commonly called the drug label,that sets out the drug medical uses indications and health risks to obtain fda approval,drug companies generally must submit evidence from clinical trials and other testing that evaluate the drug risks and benefits and demonstrate that it is safe and effective for all of the indications prescribed,recommended,or suggested on the drug label.the fda approval of a new drug application is conditioned on its approval of the exact text of the drug label 
drug labels includes two sections relevant to this litigation a warnings and precautions section and an adverse reactions section.the warnings and precautions section must describe clinically significant adverse reactions,including any that are serious even if infrequent.the adverse reactions section requires a description of the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database,including a list of all undesirable effect s,reasonably associated with use of a drug.
after a drug is approved,the fda retains the authority to approve or require amendments to the drug label the fundamental premise of the federal drug labeling scheme,however,is that manufacturers,not the fda,bear primary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times.the manufacturer is charged not only with crafting an adequate label as an initial matter,but also with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.
a manufacturer can fulfill its responsibility to revise the warnings on a drug label in two ways.
first,the changes being effected cbe regulation permits a manufacturer to unilaterally change a drug label to reflect newly acquired information,subject to later fda review and approval under the cbe regulation,the manufacturer may,upon filing a supplemental application with the fda,change a label to add or strengthen a contraindication,warning,precaution,or adverse reaction it need not wait for fda approval to add a warning to the warnings and precautions section through a cbe submission,there need only be reasonable evidence of a causal association with the drug,a standard that could be met by a wide range of evidence.thus,a manufacturer can amend the label to address potential adverse effects even if the evidence for a causal connection would not also support a higher evidentiary standard,such as a finding that there is a preponderance of evidence that a product actually causes a particular kind of adverse event.
for purposes of the cbe regulation,newly acquired information includes new analyses of previously submitted data.this definition accounts for the fact that risk information accumulates over time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in light of subsequent developments.thus,if a manufacturer were to determine that existing warnings were insufficient based on a new analysis of previously submitted data,it could still submit a cbe based on its new analysis of the previous data.a manufacturer ability to change a label via the cbe process is not absolute,however.the fda reviews cbe submissions and retains the power to reject proposed changes that do not meet the regulatory standards 
second,manufacturers can implement major changes to a label by filing a prior approval supplement pas unlike a cbe change,a pas change requires prior fda approval before it can be implemented the key distinction for present purposes is that a proposed label change that qualifies for a cbe supplement including a proposal to add or strengthen a contraindication,warning,precaution,or adverse reaction need not be submitted through the pas process and does not require prior fda approval 
it is important to recognize,however,that the fda does not simply approve warnings out of an abundance of caution whenever the manufacturer posits a theoretical association between drug use and an adverse event.as the fda has recognized,e xaggeration of risk,or inclusion of speculative or hypothetical risks,could discourage appropriate use of a beneficial drug.moreover,labeling that includes theoretical hazards not in scientific evidence can cause meaningful risk information to lose its significance.accordingly,the fda will reject a pas application or cbe amendment if there is insufficient evidence of a causal link between drug use and the adverse event 
fosamax labeling history 
both merck and the fda have long been aware that drugs like fosamax could theoretically increase the risk of atypical femoral fractures.the question that both merck and the fda faced in the years following the drug approval was whether the developing evidence of a causal link between fosamax and atypical fractures was strong enough to require adding a warning to the fosamax drug label.as explained further in section ii of this opinion,the primary question in this appeal is whether,prior to september,the fda would have rejected an attempt by merck to unilaterally amend the fosamax label via a cbe submission to include a warning about the risk of atypical femoral fractures.the following evidence bears on that question.
early studies suggest a possible link between fosamax and atypical femoral fractures 
during fosamax development,merck scientists and researchers discussed the possibility that antiresorptive drugs could inhibit a bone ability to repair microdamage,potentially leading to stress fractures.in,prior to fda approval,merck informed the fda that antiresorptive agents may inhibit microdamage repair by preventing bone resorption at the sites of microdamage.nonetheless,when the fda approved fosamax in for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women,it did not require merck to include a warning about bone fractures.nor did it do so in,when it approved fosamax for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
between and,scores of case studies,reports,and articles were published documenting possible connections between bisphosphonate use and atypical femoral fractures.plaintiffs have directed our attention to six such studies from this period.none of these studies,however,concluded that fosamax caused bone fractures,or even that fosamax use was definitively associated with atypical fractures.rather,they variously stated that fosamax use may potentially increase the risk of fracture or may be associated with insufficiency fractures or that certain findings raise d the possibility that fosamax use led to fractures merck assertion that the link between fosamax and fracturing remained hypothetical and unsubstantiated may be an understatement,but not even plaintiffs suggest that there was definitive proof of a causal connection at this time.
merck kept the fda informed of these and other studies suggesting a possible association between bisphosphonates and fractures,either citing or submitting them in communications with the agency.in march,merck submitted a periodic safety update to the fda that included over pages of information regarding atypical femur fractures and suppression of bone turnover.merck reported that recent publications had implicated a link between prolonged bisphosphonate therapy and atypical fractures.it also stated the reporters related these findings to severely suppressed bone turnover that may develop during use of fosamax later that month,merck forwarded to the fda a letter published in the new england journal of medicine describing a potential link between bisphosphonate use and fractures of the femur.
in june,the fda informed merck that it was aware of reports regarding the occurrence of subtrochanteric hip fractures in patients using bisphosphonates.it also stated that it was concerned about this developing safety signal.the fda asked merck to submit any investigations it had conducted or reports it had received regarding femoral fractures.merck promptly complied.
ii.merck attempts to amend the fosamax label 
in september,while the fda was analyzing merck data,merck submitted a pas to the fda.as discussed above,a pas is a request that,unlike a cbe submission,requires prior approval from the fda in the pas,merck proposed to add language to both the warnings precautions and the adverse reactions sections of the label to address atypical femoral fractures.merck explained that i t is not possible with the present data to establish whether treatment with fosamax increases the risk of these subtrochanteric proximal shaft fractures.but because of the temporal association between these fractures and fosamax use,merck believed that it was important to include an appropriate statement about them in the product label to increase physicians awareness of possible fractures in some osteoporotic patients at risk and allow early intervention,thereby possibly preventing the progression to complete fracture other complications.
merck proposed adding the following language to the warnings and precautions section of the label 
femoral shaft fracture 
fractures of the subtrochanteric and proximal femoral shaft have been reported in a small number of patients.some were stress fractures also known as insufficiency fractures occurring in the absence of trauma.some patients experienced prodromal pain in the affected area,often associated with imaging features of stress fracture,weeks to months before a complete fracture occurred.the number of reports of this condition is very low,and stress fractures with similar clinical features also have occurred in patients not treated with bisphosphonates.patients with suspected stress fractures should be evaluated,including evaluation for known causes and risk factors,vitamin d deficiency,malabsorption,glucocorticoid use,previous stress fracture,lower extremity arthritis or fracture,extreme or increased exercise,diabetes mellitus,chronic alcohol abuse,and receive appropriate orthopedic care.interruption of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with stress fractures should be considered,pending evaluation of the patient,based on individual assessment 
merck also proposed adding femoral shaft fracture to the list of reported adverse reactions in the adverse reactions section of the label as well as the following statement to the patient package insert patients have experienced fracture in a specific part of the thigh bone.call your doctor if you develop new or unusual pain in the hip or thigh.in support of its pas application,merck included an analysis of femur fractures in fosamax users and cited to nine articles reporting cases of femoral fractures in fosamax users.
in april,merck representatives held a telephone conversation with scott monroe of the fda.according to merck internal notes,monroe stated that the fda could agree to add language in the adverse reactions section of the label,but that merck elevation of this issue to a precaution in the labeling was prolonging review the fda wanted to approach the issue of a precaution from the perspective of all bisphosphonates and was working with the office of safety and epidemiology to do so.monroe also stated that because the conflicting nature of the literature does not provide a clear path forward,more time will be need ed for fda to formulate a formal opinion on the issue of a precaution around these data.
later in april,an fda liaison sent merck an email stating that the fda was not prepared to include language about femoral fractures in the warnings and precautions section of the label and would only approve a reference to atypical fractures in the adverse reaction section the fda asked merck to hold off on the warnings and precautions language at this time so that drug evaluators could then work with the fda office of surveillance and epidemiology and merck to decide on language for a warnings and precautions atypical fracture language,if it is warranted.
in may,the fda sent merck a complete response letter,authored by monroe.in the complete response,the fda approved the addition of low energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures to the adverse reactions section,but the fda rejected merck proposed addition to the warnings and precautions section.because the parties vigorously dispute the grounds for this rejection,it is worth excerpting the relevant portion of the fda notice in full 
we have completed the review of your pas applications,as amended,and have determined that we can not approve these applications in their present form.we have described below our reasons for this action and our recommendation to address this issue.
while the division agrees that atypical and subtrochanteric fractures should be added to the adverse reactions,experience subsections of the fosamax labels,your justification for the proposed precautions section language is inadequate.identification of stress fractures may not be clearly related to the atypical subtrochanteric fractures that have been reported in the literature.discussion of the risk factors for stress fractures is not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature and adverse event reporting 
the outcome of this case hinges in large part on how one reads or really,on how a reasonable jury could read this language in conjunction with the fda accompanying actions and communications.plaintiffs claim that the fda was objecting only to merck use of the imprecise and potentially misleading term stress fractures,and that the fda would have approved a proposed warning that specifically discussed the risk of atypical femoral fractures while eliminating the general references to stress fractures.merck claims that this letter,along with the fda other communications,demonstrates that the fda simply did not believe there was sufficient evidence of a causal link between fosamax use and atypical fractures,and would have rejected any proposed warning relating to such a risk.
iii.the fda revises its position on the link between bisphosphonates and atypical femur fractures 
in march,after reviewing the data submitted by merck and other manufacturers,the fda stated publicly that the data reviewed to date had not shown a clear connection between bisphosphonate use and a risk of atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures.the fda announced that it would work with an outside expert task force to gather additional information.
in september,the task force published a report finding that there is evidence of a relationship between bisphosphonate use and a specific type of subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fracture.the report stated that although there was an association between bisphosphonate use and atypical fractures,the association had not been proven to be causal.the fda responded by issuing a drug safety communication stating that,a lthough it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause of fractures,these unusual femur fractures have been identified in patients taking these drugs.regarding the task force recommendation of a label change,the fda stated that it has assembled and is thoroughly reviewing all long term data available on the products,as well as all safety reports and would be considering label revisions.
in october,the fda announced that it would require all bisphosphonate manufacturers to add information regarding the risk of atypical femoral fractures to the warnings and precautions section of the drug labels,based on the fda conclusion that these atypical fractures may be related to bisphosphonate use.it reiterated that it was still not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause,but noted that these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.in a conference call accompanying the announcement,the fda deputy director of the office of new drugs stated that the task force report made the fda confident that atypical femur fractures are potentially more closely related to use of bisphosphonates than the fda previously had evidence for.
the same day,the fda wrote to merck requesting that merck add the following language to the warnings and precautions section of the fosamax label 
atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures 
atypical,or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients.these fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.
atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no impact to the affected area.they may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area,usually presenting as dull,aching thigh pain,weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.a number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids prednisone at the time of fracture.
any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out a femur fracture.subjects presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered,pending a assessment,on an individual basis.
merck responded by proposing additional language that,according to merck,was intended to make clear that doctors should attempt to rule out stress fractures.the proposal contained five specific references to stress fractures.the fda responded to this proposal by eliminating every instance of the phrase stress fractures.in rejecting merck proposal,the fda explained that the term stress fracture was considered and not accepted.the division believes that for most practitioners,the term stress fracture represents a minor fracture and this would contradict the seriousness of the atypical femoral fractures associated with bisphosphonate use.the fda subsequently approved language nearly identical to its original october proposal.that language was added to the fosamax label in january and has remained there since.
procedural history 
after the label change,patients who had taken fosamax and suffered atypical femur fractures filed lawsuits against merck throughout the country.in may,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated these cases for administration in a litigation mdl in the district of new jersey since then,the mdl has been assigned to three different district judges and has swelled to over cases,each involving a separate patient who allegedly suffered a femur fracture after taking fosamax.
although no two complaints in the mdl are identical,all of the actions share questions of fact arising from similar allegations that use of fosamax caused femur fractures or similar bone injuries.the individual plaintiffs in this appeal all allege that they were injured before september,the date the outside expert task force published its report documenting an association between bisphosphonate use and atypical femur fractures.according to plaintiffs the complaints filed by this cohort generally include a products liability claim for failure to warn,alleging that fosamax was defective because merck failed to warn plaintiffs and their physicians about the risk of atypical femur fractures.many complaints also claim that fosamax was defectively designed because the risks of fosamax exceeded the benefits,or because fosamax was unreasonably dangerous or more dangerous than an ordinary consumer would expect.many complaints also include claims for,among other causes of action,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,breach of express and implied warranties,unjust enrichment,punitive damages,and violations of state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practice statutes 
merck has argued since the inception of the mdl that plaintiffs claims are preempted by fda regulations.the district court decided to address preemption after developing a full record in a bellwether trial,the glynn trial.typical of all plaintiffs in this mdl,the lead plaintiff in glynn claimed that she suffered an atypical femur fracture that was proximately caused by merck failure to include adequate fracture warnings on the fosamax label merck moved for judgment as a matter of law on preemption grounds before and during trial,but the district court reserved judgment the jury returned a verdict for merck on the merits,finding that glynn failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she experienced an atypical femur fracture despite this verdict,the district court announced that it would still decide whether the glynns claims were preempted 
in june,the district court issued an opinion concluding that the glynns claim was preempted by federal law.applying the supreme court decision in wyeth,the court stated that claims are preempted when there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a change to the prescription drug label.the district court concluded that the glynns claim was preempted because the fda may denial of merck request to add language about atypical femur fractures to the warnings and precautions section of the label was clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a label change to the precautions section of the label prior to glynn injury.
shortly after the glynn decision,merck moved for an order to show cause why all the cases in the mdl alleging injuries prior to the release of the september task force report should not be dismissed on preemption grounds.plaintiffs opposed the motion on the ground that resolving their claims through a procedure would violate their due process right to individual trials.in august,the district court issued an order to show cause why the claims should not be dismissed on preemption grounds,and the parties submitted briefing.although both sides disputed the propriety of the procedure and the substance of merck preemption arguments,the parties and the district court all agreed that federal rule of civil procedure provides the exclusive mechanism by which the court can resolve the dispositive issues presented by merck preemption defense before trial s.
after briefing,the district court granted summary judgment to merck and ruled that all claims made by plaintiffs who were injured prior to september,were preempted under wyeth.specifically,the court ruled that merck had met its initial burden of demonstrating that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to preemption in glynn,and that plaintiffs therefore bore the burden of producing a genuine issue for trial plaintiffs had failed to create a genuine issue as to preemption it was proper to use a proceeding to apply the glynn preemption ruling to other mdl cases plaintiffs and other claims were also preempted because they sounded in failure to warn and plaintiffs alternate theories that merck should have added information about fractures to the adverse reactions section of the label prior to and should have warned that fosamax benefits were limited should be dismissed.
with respect to the claims,the district court reiterated its conclusion from glynn that the fact that the fda never required merck to submit new language or change the label demonstrates that the fda did not think that the label should have been changed at that time.this evidence remain ed unchanged and provided clear evidence that the fda would have rejected a stronger precautions warning because the fda did reject a stronger precautions warning.as to the claims including claims for design defect,negligence,fraud,breach of warranty,deceptive trade practice,and unjust enrichment,the district court concluded that that these claims are based entirely on the premise that fosamax had risks which should have been disclosed to consumers and therefore ultimately hinge on the adequacy of fosamax warning.because these claims rise and fall with a claim for failure to warn,they too were preempted this appeal followed 
ii.legal background 
the primary issue in this case is whether plaintiffs claims are preempted by federal law under the supreme court decision in wyeth.this is not a straightforward determination.wyeth says only that a claim is preempted when there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a label change.this standard is cryptic and,and lower courts have struggled to make it readily administrable.this appeal,however,requires us to do so.to assess whether merck is entitled to summary judgment on its affirmative preemption defense,we must answer two questions what is clear evidence and who should determine whether clear evidence exists 
for the following reasons,we conclude that the term clear evidence refers solely to the applicable standard of proof,and the ultimate question of whether the fda would have rejected a label change is a question of fact for the jury rather than for the court.by describing the ultimate question as one of fact for the jury,we do not mean to suggest that summary judgment is categorically unavailable to a manufacturer asserting a preemption defense.when there is no genuine issue of material fact that is,when no reasonable jury applying the standard of proof could conclude that the fda would have approved a label change the manufacturer will be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we simply hold that,at the summary judgment stage,the court can not decide for itself whether the fda would have rejected a change,but must instead ask whether a reasonable jury could find that the fda would have approved the change.
federal preemption doctrine impossibility preemption and the supreme court decision in wyeth levine 
impossibility preemption 
the supremacy clause establishes that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land.the supremacy clause,therefore,preempts state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.there are several varieties of preemption the one at issue here is called conflict or impossibility preemption.impossibility preemption applies,and state law must give way,when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.the question for impossibility is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.
in this case,plaintiffs claim that state law obligated merck to add a warning about atypical femur fractures to the fosamax label.at issue is whether federal law here,fda regulations prevented merck from adding the type of warnings that plaintiffs claim were required under state law.the supreme court confronted a similar question in wyeth,and its opinion governs our analysis here.
ii.the wyeth decision 
in wyeth,the supreme court addressed whether and to what extent claims are preempted by the fdca and federal regulations.the court held that claims against drug manufacturers generally are not preempted by fda approval of the drug warning label.but such a claim is preempted by federal law when there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved the warning that a plaintiff claims was necessary.
the plaintiff in wyeth developed gangrene when a physician assistant injected her with the antinausea drug phenergan.she brought a claim against wyeth,the manufacturer of phenergan,for failing to provide an adequate warning about the risks involved with various methods of administering the drug.a jury concluded that the plaintiff injury was caused by wyeth inadequate warning label.wyeth argued on appeal that the claims were preempted because it was impossible to comply with both warning duties and federal labeling obligations 
the supreme court rejected wyeth argument.it began by citing the central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.under this rule,a manufacturer is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.thus,when the risks of a particular drug use become apparent,the manufacturer has a duty to provide a warning that adequately describe s that risk.
in response to wyeth contention that federal law made it impossible to add the warnings the plaintiff claimed were necessary,the court observed that drug manufacturers are allowed to strengthen an warning label without fda approval through the cbe process wyeth therefore could not establish impossibility preemption because the cbe regulation permitted wyeth to provide a warning of the risk of gangrene before receiving the fda approval.
the supreme court cautioned,however,that the mere availability of a cbe label amendment would not always defeat a manufacturer preemption defense,because the fda retains authority to reject labeling changes.thus,where there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a change to the label,federal law preempts claims premised on the manufacturer failure to make that change impossibility preemption applies in that instance because the manufacturer would be legally prevented by the fda from taking the very action that state law ostensibly requires 
the manufacturer in wyeth could not take advantage of the exception because it had offered no such evidence that the fda would have rejected the warning sought by the plaintiff but the supreme court made it clear that if a manufacturer does present clear evidence that the fda would reject a plaintiff proposed warning,it would have a complete preemption defense to any claims.
in this case,merck claims that the fda rejection of its proposed label amendment is just such clear evidence.
defining clear evidence 
courts applying the wyeth preemption rule confront an immediate question what is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a change the wyeth court did not define the clear evidence standard or explain how courts should apply it.the only guidance the court offered was to call impossibility preemption a demanding defense.in the absence of explicit direction or a coherent doctrinal framework,lower courts have been understandably reluctant to articulate firm definitions of the standard or its requirements.for example,several of our sister circuits have decided preemption cases by simply treating the facts of wyeth as a yardstick if the evidence for fda rejection in a given case is less compelling than the manufacturer evidence in wyeth,the thinking goes,then there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a label change and the manufacturer preemption defense fails many district courts have adopted a similar,if more complex,approach of exhaustively surveying the case law and then testing the facts of a particular case against prior decisions both approaches produce valid outcomes in individual cases,but neither clarifies or builds out the doctrine.the result is an anomaly in our preemption jurisprudence the number of cases applying the clear evidence standard continues to grow,yet the clear evidence standard remains undefined.
today,we hold that the supreme court intended to announce a standard of proof when it used the term clear evidence in wyeth.
the wyeth court articulated the clear evidence exception as follows a bsent clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a change to phenergan label,we will not conclude that it was impossible for wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.this formula has three components a legal rule that defines the circumstances in which a manufacturer is absolved of liability it must be impossible for the manufacturer to comply with both federal and state requirements a factual showing that satisfies the legal rule the fda would not have approved the proposed label change and a standard of proof that specifies how convincing the factual showing must be the manufacturer must show that the fda would not have approved the proposed label change by clear evidence.the term clear evidence therefore does not refer directly to the type of facts that a manufacturer must show,or to the circumstances in which preemption will be appropriate.rather,it specifies how difficult it will be for the manufacturer to convince the factfinder that the fda would have rejected a proposed label change.the manufacturer must prove that the fda would have rejected a warning not simply by a preponderance of the evidence,as in most civil cases,but by clear evidence.
our conclusion that the wyeth court intended the term clear evidence to denote a standard of proof is supported by the supreme court prior usage of the term.for example,the court has consistently held that a complainant alleging official government misconduct must present clear evidence of unlawful behavior clear evidence in this context is understood to be a standard of proof,rather than a condition on the type of facts that must be proven similar examples are found in the bankruptcy and patent settings 
nor must we look far to discern the meaning of clear evidence,as supreme court usage confirms that the term is synonymous with clear and convincing evidence.the latter is a intermediate standard of proof more demanding than preponderance of the evidence,but less demanding than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.black law dictionary defines clear and convincing evidence as evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain.we adopt that definition here.it is consistent with both settled understanding and wyeth instruction that the test is a demanding defense meant to represent a longstanding presumption against.
we therefore conclude that for a defendant to establish a preemption defense under wyeth,the factfinder must conclude that it is highly probable that the fda would not have approved a change to the drug label.
whether the fda would have rejected a label change is a question of fact for the jury 
once clear evidence is understood as a standard of proof rather than a condition on the type of facts to be proven,the wyeth test narrows to a single inquiry would the fda have approved the label change that plaintiffs argue was required 
oral argument in this case revealed a fundamental yet unexplored disagreement between the parties.merck claimed that the wyeth preemption test presents a pure question of law that must be decided by a court,not a jury.plaintiffs argued that wyeth preemption poses a mixed question of fact and law that may require jury factfinding in appropriate circumstances.the distinction is crucial in this case because it dictates the course of our summary judgment analysis.if the question of whether the fda would have rejected plaintiffs proposed warning is a question of law for the court,then we may simply answer it ourselves but if it is a question of fact for the jury,then we must instead attempt to anticipate the range of answers that could be given by reasonable jurors applying the clear evidence standard and then determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.having reviewed the case law and the parties supplemental briefing on the issue,we conclude that the question of whether the fda would have rejected a proposed label change is a question of fact that must be answered by a jury the court role at the summary judgment stage is therefore limited to determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude judgment as a matter of law.
conflict preemption can require fact determinations by a jury 
merck makes two general,threshold arguments in favor of treating wyeth preemption as a purely legal question to be answered by the court.
first,merck notes that the vast majority of courts applying wyeth have assumed,either explicitly or implicitly,that wyeth preemption presents a question of law.this observation is only somewhat accurate and wholly unpersuasive.
wyeth does not indicate whether the clear evidence test poses a legal or factual question.nor is it possible to divine a clear answer from the supreme court application of the test in wyeth itself however,the supreme court did decide that the evidence presented in wyeth was not sufficient to pass the clear evidence test.therefore,in light of the court definitive holding that the evidence in wyeth did not pass muster,the many federal courts that have applied the wyeth preemption test have simply compared the evidence presented in their cases to the evidence presented in wyeth.for example,in mason smithkline beecham,the seventh circuit walked through the record evidence and concluded that,in light of the extensive showing required by wyeth,the manufacturer did not meet its burden of demonstrating by clear evidence that the fda would have rejected a label change.the ninth circuit took a similar approach in gaeta perrigo pharmaceuticals,and explicitly stated that since the only guidance this court has is that the evidence presented in wyeth was insufficient to meet the clear evidence standard,the manufacturer would not meet the clear evidence standard if the evidence in this case is less compelling than that in wyeth.many other circuits have followed this approach and have found no preemption because the evidence in those cases fell short of the record in wyeth 
it is possible to characterize this approach as a tacit acknowledgment that the clear evidence test is a legal question to be answered directly by the court.mason,for example,was an appeal of a grant of summary judgment,but the court did not engage in a rule analysis or consider whether a reasonable jury could reach a contrary conclusion.at the same time the court also did not explain why the wyeth test should be resolved by the court in the first instance.we do not lightly discount the wisdom of our sister circuits and the district courts that have grappled with these issues.but there is a difference between rejecting another court considered judgment,on the one hand,and taking up an issue that has not been thoroughly analyzed,on the other.furthermore,the approach taken by our sister circuits would be entirely consistent with our decision that the clear evidence test is a fact question that is ultimately for a jury to decide.after all,by comparing the evidence presented in these cases with the evidence presented in wyeth,these circuits are in fact engaging in a summary judgment analysis,even if they do not name it.
second,merck asserts that conflict preemption always presents a pure question of law.to be sure,we have made numerous offhand statements that seem to support merck position and as merck points out,several district courts relying on similar language have concluded,albeit without substantial analysis,that a manufacturer entitlement to the wyeth preemption defense is a question of law for the court rather than the jury 
the rule merck cites,however,is one of thumb rather than law.it is true that most preemption cases present purely legal questions for example,whether congress intended to preempt state law,how to interpret the scope of an express preemption provision,or whether two regulatory schemes are facially incompatible.but it is equally clear that preemption can be,and sometimes must be,a fact question for the jury.
the supreme court opinion in boyle united technologies illustrates the distinction.in boyle,as in wyeth,the supreme court defined the scope of conflict preemption in a particular setting and announced the factual showing that a defendant must make to prove the affirmative preemption defense.specifically,the court held that l iability for design defects in military equipment can not be imposed,pursuant to state law,when the united states approved reasonably precise specifications the equipment conformed to those specifications and the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states.the court clarified that whether the facts establish the conditions for the defense is a question for the jury.the proper question on summary judgment,therefore,was whether a reasonable jury could,under the properly formulated defense,have found for the petitioner on the facts presented.it would be error,the court said,for a court to assess on its own whether the defense had been established.
while our court has not gone so far as to declare that any one species of preemption defense categorically requires jury factfinding,we have acknowledged that the availability of the defense can turn on questions of fact.in md mall associates,llc csx transportation,we determined that the question of whether storm water trespass claims conflicted with federal regulations had to be addressed under the circumstances of this particular case.we therefore held that whether the defendant railroad could reasonably comply with federal drainage requirements while also complying with pennsylvania law regarding storm water trespass is a question of fact.having so concluded,we remanded for further development of the factual record.
boyle and md mall confirm that the availability of a conflict preemption defense is not automatically a question of law that must be kept from the jury.the question,therefore,is whether there are independent jurisprudential or practical reasons to conclude that wyeth preemption,specifically,requires a legal or a factual determination.
ii.whether the fda would have approved a label change is a factual question appropriate for the jury 
there are no general,rules that we can use to distinguish fact questions from legal ones the supreme court has candidly acknowledged that the appropriate methodology for distinguishing questions of fact from questions of law has been,to say the least,elusive.in the absence of a governing principle,we look to the distinctions drawn by our court in similar cases,practical considerations regarding the allocation of authority between judge and jury,and the text of wyeth itself.what we discern from these sources is that the question at the heart of the wyeth test would the fda have approved the label change plaintiffs argue was required is little different from the type of fact questions that are routinely given to a jury.
at root,wyeth requires the decisionmaker to use an existing fact record to predict the outcome of a hypothetical scenario.the question posed to the decisionmaker in this case is based on the contemporaneous medical literature and the interactions between merck and the fda that actually did happen,what would have happened if merck had proposed the warning plaintiffs say was required we think this question is one of fact,for three reasons.
first,we have recognized that an assessment of the probability of a future event should generally be categorized as a finding of fact,even if that finding automatically generates a legal consequence.in kaplun attorney general of the united states we held that a determination of the probability of future torture was a fact question subject to review.in so doing,we observed in general terms that a present probability of a future event is something distinct from its legal effect that is made up of facts and actually exists but is not a tangible thing,or actual occurrence.even though the future event has not occurred,and even if the prediction as to that event likelihood is dispositive of a legal issue,the likelihood itself remains a factual finding that can be made ex ante the actual outcome.the kaplun panel cited a number of other cases in which we or other circuits have held that inferences drawn from historical facts concerning the likelihood of future events are findings of fact,not law here,the corresponding conclusion is that the task of assessing the probability that the fda would have rejected a particular warning is a factual inquiry rather than a legal one 
second,wyeth requires the decisionmaker to weigh conflicting evidence and draw inferences from the facts tasks that the supreme court tells us are jury functions,not those of a judge.
the present case is illustrative.plaintiffs,for their part,rely heavily on the may letter from scott monroe of the fda rejecting merck proposed warning.according to plaintiffs,the text of this letter demonstrates that the fda or at least monroe objected only to the allegedly misleading term stress fractures,and does not establish that the fda was unconvinced of the link between bisphosphonate use and atypical femur fractures.merck,meanwhile,directs our attention away from monroe letter and instead toward a series of informal fda communications from the same time period between monroe and merck,which they claim demonstrate that the fda or at least monroe was unconvinced of a link between bisphosphonates and atypical fractures in short both sides ask us to draw competing inferences from separate pieces of record evidence and weigh those inferences against one another.these are tasks reserved for jurors,not judges.
third,the task of predicting the fda likely actions requires multiple assessments of fda officials motives and thought processes.consider,for example,some of the questions that must be answered to arrive at a determination of whether the fda would have rejected plaintiffs warning.how convinced or skeptical were fda officials of the link between bisphosphonates and atypical femur fractures even if fda officials were unconvinced of a firm link,might they nonetheless have agreed that there was reasonable evidence of a causal association,as the cbe regulation requires did the fda reject merck proposal because it was unconvinced by the science or because it disliked the language what,if anything,can we infer from monroe contemporaneous oral statement that the conflicting nature of the literature concerning a possible fracture link does not provide a clear path forward whatever the fda position might have been on the association between bisphosphonates and atypical femur fractures,was that position an accurate predictor of its likely response to a proposed warning in other words,how confidently can we extrapolate fda officials hypothetical reactions from their previous statements and actions 
these are all,essentially,inquiries about motive or state of mind what were fda officials thinking,and how would that disposition have conditioned their response to plaintiffs hypothetical proposed warning and questions of motive,intent,and state of mind are typically understood to be fact questions committed to the jury rather than the court 
as a fallback position,merck argues that even if the wyeth inquiry is factual in nature,it should be committed to the court rather than the jury for reasons of institutional competence merck relies heavily on markman westview instruments,in which the supreme court held that construction of a patent,including terms of art within its claim,is exclusively within the province of the court.the markman court based this conclusion,in part,on the general rule that t he construction of written instruments is one of those things that judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors.here,the question of how the fda would have responded to a proposed warning is informed by the regulations that constrain fda action in this case,the cbe regulation.that regulation permits the fda to add an adverse reaction in the warnings and precautions section as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug.agency guidance clarifies that reasonable evidence is a standard that could be met by a wide range of evidence,including evidence that would not also support a higher evidentiary standard,such as a finding that there is a preponderance of evidence that a product actually causes a particular kind of adverse event.merck therefore claims that application of the clear evidence standard should be left to the courts because it calls for the interpretation of regulations and agency records freighted with legal meaning.
this argument misapprehends the nature of the factfinder task under wyeth.that task is to predict how the fda would have reacted in a hypothetical scenario.the jury therefore is not being asked to supply a plenary construction of the cbe regulation or any other written instrument in the first instance.it is instead being asked to apply the requirements of that regulation to the facts,in aid of a prediction as to the fda behavior.
the operative language in the cbe regulation is neither uncommon nor abstruse.the reasonable evidence of a causal association standard requires applications of the sort that courts routinely give to juries in tort cases.it combines two classic jury questions whether a causal link between two events is too attenuated,and whether the evidence meets a certain proof threshold.these determinations are well within the province of a properly instructed jury,and we do not think that their inclusion in the larger wyeth inquiry merits reallocation of the factfinding function.
plaintiffs,meanwhile,argue that judicial is required when a preemption determination depends on construction of final,written regulatory actions by the fda.they further claim that the fda may response letter is just such a final document,and urge us to construe it as a matter of law.we will not go so far.as noted above,it is true that courts are typically charged with determining the construction,the legal effect of a writing,as opposed to its interpretation,the semantic meaning of specific terms.but that general rule has little bearing on the disposition of this case.the question for preemption purposes is whether the fda would have approved a different label amendment than the one it actually rejected in the may letter.the factfinder therefore must parse the fda may letter not to determine its legal effect in the first instance,but rather to discern what it suggests about the fda likely response to a differently worded proposal.this too is an appropriate task for the jury 
accordingly,we do not see any convincing prudential reasons to commit the wyeth inquiry to a court rather than a jury.the basic question that wyeth poses to a factfinder in a counterfactual setting,what do you think the fda would have done requires an evaluative inference about human behavior based on correspondence,agency statements,contemporaneous medical literature,the requirements of the cbe regulation,and whatever intuitions the factfinder may have about administrative inertia and agency processes.this assessment is certainly complex,but it does not require any special legal competence or training.
we therefore conclude that the question of whether the fda would have approved a plaintiff proposed warning is a question of fact for the jury.a claim will only be preempted if a jury concludes it is highly probable that the fda would not have approved a label change.
this decision would change how the preemption defense is presented and utilized in only a subset of cases.as before,drug manufacturers are free to raise a preemption defense,and either party may move for summary judgment on this issue after discovery.upon summary judgment,district courts will compare the evidence presented with the evidence in wyeth,to determine whether it is more or less compelling.this is in effect what the other circuits have done.a trial by jury would only be necessary in those cases where the evidence presented is more compelling than that in wyeth but no smoking gun rejection letter from the fda is available.and this need not be at a great expense to either the litigants or the taxpayers.a combined trial may be conducted on both the liability and the defense similar to patent infringement cases where the plaintiffs present their infringement case at the same time as the defendants present their patent invalidity defense particularly because the evidence presented will likely overlap.in sum,today holding will not drastically change how defendants will litigate the preemption defense.
iii.analysis 
having clarified the clear evidence standard,we now turn to the merits of merck preemption defense 
plaintiffs causes of action fall into three groups.the first group comprises plaintiffs claims that merck failed to warn fosamax users of the risk of atypical femur fractures by failing to add a warning to the warnings and precautions section of the label before september the warnings and precautions claims.the second group comprises plaintiffs claims that merck failed to warn fosamax users of the risk of femur fractures by failing to add atypical femur fractures to the adverse reactions section of the label prior to may the adverse reactions claims.the third group comprises all of plaintiffs claims,including design defect,negligence,breach of implied and express warranties,and violations of state consumer fraud and trade practice statutes the claims.the district court ruled that the warnings and precautions claims were preempted under wyeth that the adverse reactions claims failed on the merits and that the claims were functionally indistinguishable from the warnings and precautions claims and therefore preempted to the same extent.
plaintiffs present four arguments on appeal.first,plaintiffs argue that the warnings and precautions claims are not preempted as a matter of law because a reasonable jury could conclude that the fda would have approved a properly worded warning.second,plaintiffs argue that merck is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs adverse reactions claims because those claims were properly pleaded and there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find for the plaintiffs.third,plaintiffs argue that even if both sets of claims are preempted,plaintiffs remaining claims are not preempted because they do not sound in failure to warn and are supported by competent evidence.fourth,plaintiffs claim that the district court misapplied rule when it tried to resolve merck affirmative preemption defense via a proceeding.
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the warnings and precautions claims are not preempted as a matter of law because a reasonable jury could find it less than highly probable that the fda would have rejected plaintiffs proposed warning merck is not entitled to summary judgment on the adverse reactions claims and the claims are not preempted as a matter of law.because we are vacating the district court summary judgment order,we do not reach the propriety of the order.
summary judgment standard 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary and we affirm only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.because merck moved for summary judgment,we must draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor when considering the evidence our inquiry is confined to whether the evidence of record is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.we therefore can not grant summary judgment in merck favor unless a reasonable juror would be compelled to find its way on the facts needed to rule in its favor on the law.
special considerations arise in the preemption context.impossibility preemption is an affirmative defense on which merck bears the burdens of production and persuasion crucially,the inquiry involved in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.as discussed above,wyeth clear evidence standard of proof requires the manufacturer to prove that it is highly probable that the fda would not have approved a change to the drug label.therefore,the question for summary judgment purposes is not just whether a reasonable juror could find that the fda would have approved plaintiffs proposed warning.it is whether a reasonable juror could find that it is highly probable that the fda would have rejected the warning.put differently even if it seems possible or plausible that the fda would have rejected the proposed warning,could a reasonable juror nonetheless conclude that the odds of rejection were something less than highly probable in el southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority,we said that if there is a chance that a reasonable factfinder would not accept a moving party necessary propositions of fact,judgment can not be granted.the corresponding proposition here is if there is a chance that a reasonable factfinder would not find that it is highly probable that the fda would have rejected plaintiffs warning,judgment can not be granted.
in summary to affirm the district court decision that the warnings and precautions claims are preempted,we must find that no reasonable juror could conclude that it is anything less than highly probable that the fda would have rejected plaintiff proposed warning had merck proposed it to the fda in september.
merck is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs warnings and precautions claims 
merck ultimate task under wyeth is to prove by clear evidence that the fda would not have approved the warning about the link between fosamax use and atypical femur fractures that plaintiffs say was required under state law.merck primary argument on appeal is that prior to september,the fda would have opposed any warning about atypical femur fractures in the warnings and precautions section because the fda did not believe that the science supported such a warning.as merck points out,the fda sought and analyzed information regarding atypical femur fractures in merck responded with data and then proposed warning language for both the warnings and precautions and adverse reactions sections of the fosamax label the fda rejected merck proposed language for the warnings and precautions section and in correspondence surrounding the rejection,fda officials stated that the conflicting nature of the literature does not provide a clear path forward,and more time would be need ed for the fda to formulate a formal opinion on the issue of a precaution around these data.given this sequence of events,merck argues that there is clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a cbe submission adding an warning to the warnings and precautions section.
it is undisputed that the fda was aware of the possible link between fosamax and atypical fractures well before september.in march,merck submitted a comprehensive safety update to the fda reporting the existence and results of numerous studies suggesting just such an association.the fda responded that it was concerned about this safety signal,but did not require merck to update its label in march,after reviewing the data submitted by merck and other manufacturers,the fda stated that the data reviewed to date had not shown a clear connection between bisphosphonate use and a risk of atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures.and in october,an fda deputy director stated that the september task force report was the finding that for the first time made the fda confident that atypical femur fractures are potentially more closely related to bisphosphonates than the fda previously had evidence for.merck argues that this evidence demonstrates that prior to september,the fda would have rejected any cbe application that attempted to add an atypical fractures warning to the fosamax label because the fda had concluded that there was no reasonable evidence of a causal link.
merck also emphasizes the fda april asking merck to hold off on the warnings and precautions language at this time so that drug evaluators could work with the fda office of surveillance and epidemiology and merck to decide on language for a warnings and precautions atypical fracture language,if it is warranted.after the task force issued its report in september,by contrast,the fda revised merck proposed language and quickly approved a label amendment.merck argues that the only logical conclusion from this course of proceedings is that the fda thought adequate scientific support showing a connection between bisphosphonates and atypical femur fractures was lacking in but present in after the task force report,all of which accords with the fda public statements on the issue.
merck also rejects plaintiffs theory that the fda rejected merck proposed warning based on a language quibble about stress fractures rather than a fundamental disagreement about the science.merck strongest argument for summary judgment is that plaintiffs theory of the case rests on an unreasonable inference that the fda recognized a need to include risk information about atypical femur fractures and therefore would have accepted a warning about such fractures,but was so troubled by the stress fracture language that it preferred to deprive physicians of that risk information rather than allow merck to add its proposed language or authorize inclusion of revised language.merck buttresses this argument by pointing to statutory language requiring the fda to notify a drug manufacturer when it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of the drug and to initiate discussions to reach agreement on whether the labeling for the drug should be modified to reflect the new safety information if it is dissatisfied with the manufacturer response merck points out that if the fda actually thought that an warning was warranted,it could have proposed revisions rather than simply rejecting merck proposal.the fda engaged in just such a revision process in after it directed merck to add a warning and merck responded by adding language.the fact that the fda did not similarly reach out in,merck says,demonstrates that it would not have accepted plaintiffs proposed warning prior to the issuance of the task force report in september.
we do not discount the force of this evidence or its potential to sway a jury.the problem for merck,however,is that we are not assessing in the first instance whether there was clear evidence that the fda would have rejected a change.we are instead trying to anticipate whether a reasonable juror,looking at all the evidence and trying to reconstruct a hypothetical event,could conclude that it is less than highly probable that the fda would have rejected the change.and crucially for the plaintiffs,we are drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.this confers a unique advantage when the factfinder task is to guess what could have happened in a counterfactual setting.
plaintiffs argument against preemption centers on two claims first,that there was sufficient evidence of a causal link to allow merck to unilaterally amend the fosamax label via the cbe process and second,that the fda rejection of merck pas application was based on merck misleading use of the term stress fractures rather than any fundamental disagreement with the underlying science.in our view,a reasonable jury could accept both contentions and conclude that the fda would not have rejected plaintiffs proposed warning or,at least,that the fda was not highly probable to do so.
first,a reasonable jury could conclude that merck could have amended the fosamax label via the cbe process.to add a warning to the warnings and precautions section of a drug label through a cbe submission,there need only be reasonable evidence of a causal association with the drug,a standard that could be met by a wide range of evidence.to gain fda approval,therefore,the agency does not need to be affirmatively convinced of a causal link between the drug and the adverse event.here,there is evidence that the fda recognized a fracture risk and the possible need for warnings before september.in june,for example,the fda stated that it was aware of reports regarding the occurrence of subtrochanteric hip fractures in patients using bisphosphonates,that these and atypical femoral fractures were reportedly rare in patients with osteoporosis not on bisphosphonates,and that it was concerned about this developing safety signal.and in may,the fda approved merck request to add a reference to low energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures in the adverse reactions section of the label even if the fda did not perceive a clear connection between fosamax and atypical fractures,as it said in early,a juror could conclude that the fda would still have determined that reasonable evidence of a link existed or more precisely,that the possibility of rejection was less than highly probable.
second,a reasonable jury could also conclude that the fda rejected merck proposed warning about femoral fractures in not because it denied the existence of a causal link between fosamax and fractures,but because merck repeatedly characterized the fractures at issue as stress fractures.merck proposed warning used the phrase stress fractures six times according to plaintiffs expert,stress fractures are commonly seen in physically active people atypical femoral fractures are,as the name suggests,highly unusual stress fractures are usually incomplete fractures that heal with rest,while atypical femoral fractures often are complete fractures that require surgical intervention the fda response to merck pas application stated your justification for the proposed precautions section language is inadequate.identification of stress fractures may not be clearly related to the atypical subtrochanteric features that have been reported in the literature.discussion of the risk factors for stress fractures is not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature and adverse event reporting.the fda did not give any other reason for rejecting merck proposed warning.
in,when merck attempted to revise the fda proposed warning by adding references to stress fractures,the fda again struck out the references.it explained that the term stress fracture was considered and was not accepted because for most practitioners,the term stress fracture represents a minor fracture and this would contradict the seriousness of the atypical femoral fractures associated with bisphosphonate use.
as discussed above,merck argues that if the fda had been truly concerned about the risk of atypical fractures,it could have revised and approved a warning without the offending references.as a matter of law,however,the burden and the responsibility to correct a drug label rests with the manufacturer,not the fda once the fda rejected merck proposal,the ball was back in merck court to submit a revised,corrected proposal.a reasonable juror could therefore conclude that it was merck failure to a revised cbe or pas without language,rather than the fda supposedly intransigent stance on the science,that prevented the fda from approving a label change.
plaintiffs evidence certainly does not compel the conclusion that the fda would have accepted an atypical fracture warning that omitted the language about stress fractures.but our inquiry at this stage is not about who has the best evidence it is about what a reasonable jury applying a heightened standard of proof could conclude on the basis of the evidence.because the wyeth test requires the factfinder to speculate about hypothetical scenarios using inferences drawn from historical facts,reasonable jurors could reach a broad range of conclusions when confronted with this record.to that inherent uncertainty we then add all the reasonable inferences that rule requires us to draw in plaintiffs favor the fda would have agreed that the evidence of an association was reasonable prior to the fda rejected merck proposed warning because it was primarily concerned with the misleading references to stress fractures rather than the underlying science the fda refrained from an acceptable warning in because it considered it merck responsibility to submit a revised warning the fda affirmatively reached out to merck in because it recognized that the science was now so strong that amending the label was a legal imperative,not because it was acknowledging a sufficient risk for the first time.
a reasonable juror reviewing the evidence in this case could find it less than highly probable that the fda would not have approved a warning about the risk of atypical femur fractures that eliminated or revised references to stress fractures.accordingly,merck is not entitled to summary judgment on its preemption defense to plaintiffs warnings and precautions claims 
merck is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs adverse reactions claims 
plaintiffs claims focus primarily on the assertion that merck should have added a fractures warning to the warnings and precautions section of the fosamax label prior to september.but plaintiffs also contend that their claims encompass a related but distinct allegation that merck should have added atypical fractures to the adverse reactions section prior to may the date the fda actually approved merck addition of atypical fractures to the adverse reactions section,and that merck failure to do so proximately caused their injuries the district court ruled that this claim was insufficiently pled and not supported by the evidence,and entered summary judgment for merck on the merits.this ruling was in error.
as an initial matter,the adverse reaction claims are not preempted by wyeth,and merck does not argue otherwise.merck requested that atypical fractures be added to the adverse reactions section in,and the fda approved the request.merck has not shown by clear evidence that the fda would have rejected such a warning had merck proposed it earlier.
turning to the merits,the district court dismissed the adverse reactions claims on two grounds the first basis for the district court ruling was its conclusion that plaintiffs did not specifically plead a claim based on the adverse reactions label section in any of their complaints.whether or not this is an accurate assessment we do not have every mdl complaint before us to confirm,and there is no indication that the district court reviewed each of the hundreds of complaints at issue either we think it beside the point.plaintiffs direct us to a number of complaints alleging generally that the fosamax label did not adequately warn patients and doctors of the fracture risk,without specifying the particular warnings that should have been included or the particular failings of each label section the parties and the district court all accept that these general allegations adequately pled the warnings and precautions theory discussed above.it is therefore difficult to understand why the district court faulted the same complaints for failing to specify every section of the label that should have included a warning.at any rate,such specificity is not required by the federal rules of civil procedure merck does not argue that the complaints failed to put it on notice of the adverse reactions claim,and that concession closes the door on any claim that the complaints themselves failed to adequately plead the adverse reactions theory.
the district court also stated,without elaboration,that plaintiffs had failed to set forth evidence indicating that any doctor would not have prescribed fosamax if the occurrence of femoral shaft fractures had been mentioned in the adverse reactions section prior to.even if true,this does not justify summary judgment on the merits.the proper inquiry for summary judgment purposes is whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable juror to conclude that a doctor would not have prescribed fosamax if fracture language had been added to the adverse reactions section prior to.to this end,plaintiffs submitted several declarations from their treating physicians declaring that if they had been informed that fosamax posed a risk of femoral fractures,they likely would not have prescribed fosamax or likely would have discontinued treatment these declarations do not specify which sections of the label should have contained such a warning.a reasonable juror could conclude that some of these physicians would not have prescribed fosamax if atypical femur fractures had been listed in the adverse reactions section.accordingly,the district court should not have granted merck summary judgment on the merits of plaintiffs adverse reactions claims.
there is a deeper problem lurking in the district court decision to grant merck a merits judgment in all of the mdl cases.a mass tort mdl is not a class action.it is a collection of separate lawsuits that are coordinated for pretrial proceedings and only pretrial proceedings before being remanded to their respective transferor courts some purely legal issues may apply in every case.but merits questions that are predicated on the existence or nonexistence of historical facts unique to each plaintiff,whether a particular plaintiff doctor would have read a warning in the adverse reactions section and ceased prescribing fosamax as a result generally are not amenable to resolution.each plaintiff deserves the opportunity to develop those sort of facts separately,and the district court understandable desire to streamline proceedings can not override the plaintiffs basic trial rights as a technical matter,merck actual burden at the summary judgment stage was to prove that there is no genuine dispute in every single mdl case that plaintiffs doctors would have continued to prescribe fosamax even if the fracture warning had been added to the adverse reactions section before may.it could not do so,and the district court grant of summary judgment on the merits was therefore erroneous.
merck is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claims 
the district court held that plaintiffs claims sounded in failure to warn and were therefore preempted to the same extent as the warning and precautions claims.accordingly,our decision vacating the district court preemption ruling as to the warnings and precautions claims reinstates the claims as well we pass no judgment on the merits of those claims or on whether they do in fact sound in failure to warn.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to merck and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

our discussion of the allocation of authority,both here and elsewhere in this opinion,applies in cases tried to a jury.in a bench trial,of course,judicial factfinding will be both appropriate and necessary.
had wyeth come up on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,for example,the court would have been forced to address whether the question of what the fda would have done should be answered by a court or by a jury.but wyeth was an appeal of a motion for judgment,following a full jury trial and proceedings in which the trial court made explicit fact findings,based on the trial record,directed at the preemption issue.wyeth,at.the supreme court concluded on the basis of that complete record that there was no evidence that the fda would have rejected a warning.id.at.the combination of a complete fact record that contained zero evidence to support preemption eliminated the need for remand,and thereby obviated the need to explain which judicial actor should make findings in the first instance.and since the complete record contained no evidence whatsoever indicating that the fda would not have approved a label change,the supreme court had no reason to consider whether a jury could have reached a contrary conclusion.

we recognize that the wyeth test is something of an oddity.in a typical case,the historical facts are in dispute and the jury is tasked with figuring out what actually happened.in the case before us,the historical facts are largely undisputed,and the primary disputed fact is the ultimate fact of what would have happened.this fact is in turn wholly determinative of the legal question.the law is clear,however,that an issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate constitutional question.miller,at.that is the same basic conclusion we reached in kaplun just because a fact finding completely resolves a legal issue does not alter its fundamentally factual character.

see,at treating issues of intent as factual matters for the trier of fact is commonplace.monteiro city of elizabeth,cir.motive is a question of fact that must be decided by the jury grant city of pittsburgh,cir.t he issue of state of mind will always be a question of fact.one might object that the fda acts as a body rather than through individuals,thereby rendering questions of motive and intent irrelevant in this setting.the key evidence in this case belies that assumption.at oral argument,merck counsel stated that the single best piece of evidence that the fda would have rejected a revised warning is a set of notes,prepared by a merck employee,recounting a telephone conversation with monroe of the fda the same official who wrote the may letter formally rejecting merck proposed additions to the warnings and precautions section.according to the employee notes,monroe said that merck elevation of this issue to a precaution in the labeling was prolonging review,that the fda would like to approach the issue of a precaution from the perspective of all bisphosphonates,and that because the conflicting nature of the literature does not provide a clear path forward,more time would be need ed for the fda to formulate a formal opinion on the issue of a precaution around these data.a.to gauge the import of these statements,a decisionmaker would need to,at a minimum,make a credibility determination regarding the merck employee who drafted the notes determine the veracity and accuracy of the notes determine the semantic meaning of monroe statements infer monroe intent and state of mind when making the statements and weigh that inference against whatever competing inferences can be drawn from monroe subsequent letter rejecting merck proposed warning.these are precisely the types of personal evaluations and assessments that we commit to jurors in the first acknowledge,of course,that the wyeth inquiry may sometimes require the factfinder to impute motive or intent to the fda as a whole.but as the supreme court has recognized,the difficulty of assessing collective intent is not a reason to treat the assessment as something other than a factual inquiry.for example,the court has held that the question of whether a corporation harbored discriminatory intent is a question of fact,at d iscriminatory intent is not a question of law and not a mixed question
