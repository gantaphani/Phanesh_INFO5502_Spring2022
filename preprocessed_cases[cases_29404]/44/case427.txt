this case raises the question of recognition of an informant privilege and the associated public interests which underlie the privilege.the issue comes to us on arguments from a investigative arm of an association of private race tracks,that the district court,under fed.civ,erred in failing to recognize those interests when it ordered disclosure of the identities of informants who told of illegal activities by the plaintiff.we vacate the order and remand.
michael gill,an owner of thoroughbred race horses,filed a false light defamation action against a florida race track,gulfstream park,and the race track president,scott savin,in new hampshire federal court,based on diversity jurisdiction.
the case alleged defamation from statements by the gulfstream defendants to reporters for sports illustrated magazine,which published an article about allegations that gill had engaged in illegal horse racing practices.the relevant state racing agency,the florida division of wagering fdpmw,in fact had investigated gill.gill claims that the defendants misrepresented the status of the investigation.
gill learned during discovery about an investigative report on his horse racing practices which had been prepared by the appellants,the thoroughbred racing protective bureau trpb and one of its investigators,anthony otero.neither are parties to the defamation case.
gill then amended the complaint to assert that trpb acted as the gulfstream defendants agent in preparing this defamatory report.gill did not seek then to add otero or trpb as parties.gill subpoenaed trpb files concerning the investigation.trpb counsel declined to produce certain documents containing the names of the informants on grounds of privilege and confidentiality,but then inadvertently disclosed the documents with the names of these informants to gill counsel.gill revealed the informants names to his client,filed the documents containing the names under seal with the district court,and withdrew from the case.
gill successor counsel filed a motion to unseal and to use the inadvertently disclosed names,which was opposed by trpb.trpb sought a protective order,arguing that the names of the tipsters were protected from disclosure,under.c,by the informant privilege under state law,and by other interests.the district court granted the motion to unseal and denied trpb request for a protective order.it did not reach the question of waiver of privilege through inadvertent disclosure.
trpb filed an interlocutory appeal,arguing that the informant privilege does attach and in any event the district court erred in not considering,for rule purposes,the public interest in encouraging informants to divulge information about horse racing corruption to the industry watch dog group and the corresponding interests of the informants in confidentiality and privacy 
trpb,one of the appellants in this case,describes itself as the arm of the thoroughbred racing associations of north america,tra,a trade association of the major thoroughbred race tracks in the united states and canada.the stated mission of trpb is to assure the security of thoroughbred racing participants and spectators and the integrity of thoroughbred races by working in close conjunction with civil and criminal enforcement authorities at every level of government,federal,state and local,to investigate allegations of wrongdoing at tra member tracks,including criminal law violations.
in january,trpb began to investigate plaintiff michael gill,an owner of thoroughbred race horses,and gill horse trainer and veterinarians.at that time,gill horses were winning a high percentage of races at gulfstream park in hallandale beach,florida,owned by gulfstream park racing association.in early january,an unnamed,confidential tipster had alerted anthony otero,an investigator with trpb,of suspicious activity at the barn of gill trainer,specifically that stable employees were being posted at the barn as lookouts during medication time.otero also spoke with other unnamed,confidential tipsters gill claims that there were in total three separate tipsters,who told of other suspicious activities involving gill horses at gulfstream and its satellite training facility.for example,the tipsters told trpb that gill horses were being shipped to a nearby trotting center where they received extracorporeal shock wave therapy eswt four days out from a race gulfstream rules made a horse receiving eswt treatment ineligible to start in a race until more than seven days have elapsed.the tipsters also said that one of gill veterinarians was blocking the joints of gill horses on race day with a pain killer further,the tipsters told otero that on race days,gill trainer administered to the horses a hormone that stimulates and regulates red blood cell production thus infusing a system with a richer supply of oxygen.after receiving this information,gulfstream track veterinarian decided that if any of gill horses had to be euthanized following injury,fluids should be drawn from the joints for testing and a necropsy performed.
on february,one of gill horses,casual conflict,injured its right front leg during a race and had to be euthanized.the injured part of the horse right front leg was amputated and was oddly missing by the time gulfstream track veterinarian arrived to draw fluids from it for testing.the missing right front leg was later retrieved from one of gill veterinarians,who admitted to having removed it without permission.
on february,the fdpmw chief investigator contacted otero and other trpb personnel to advise them that the agency was taking over the investigation into the horse death.the fdpmw taped interviews of gill,his trainer,and veterinarians.otero was present during most of these interviews.at least three conflicting explanations were given by the interviewees for why the leg of the horse was removed.fdpmw investigators then took some leg tissue from the horse for testing.the testers could not draw joint fluid for testing,but the other tests revealed no banned substances.
it was not uncommon for trpb and the fdpmw to cooperate in investigations,and otero and the fdpmw investigators stayed in contact during the subsequent investigations.trpb continued to investigate,presumably in cooperation with the fdpmw,and to watch for suspicious activity as to gill other horses.trpb also conducted searches of the veterinarians vehicles,which fdpmw investigators witnessed.one of gill veterinarians was then excluded from gulfstream for failing to comply with dea regulations,and another veterinarian was not allowed to practice medicine there for failing to sign the gulfstream waiver of liability agreement.
on march,trpb issued an investigative report on the gill investigation to trpb personnel,to some race track members of the tra including gulfstream and savin,and to the fdpmw.it is not clear how it was determined who would be on the distribution list.the report included the allegations provided by the unnamed,confidential informants that gill and his staff engaged in illegal or improper treatments of the horses.as gill reads the report,the investigation did not uncover evidence to confirm these alleged illegal or improper activities.but there was some evidence of improper activity in the report 
the state agency investigation into casual conflict death ultimately closed without producing any administrative charges against gill trainer.however,the fdpmw did refer the cases regarding gill veterinarians to the florida agency overseeing veterinarian licenses and the fda.
on march,sports illustrated magazine published an article titled nagging questions about gill unprecedented success at gulfstream and the suspicions surrounding that success.savin,the president of gulfstream,was quoted in the article,commenting on gill success i t like mark mcgwire.people thought,he must be on steroids.anytime somebody doing something that never been done before,it a source of conspiracy theories.
the procedural history was given earlier.we turn to the arguments made to the district court on the discovery motions.
trpb made a number of arguments.first,trpb argued that it had good reason to keep the identities of the tipsters confidential.trpb investigations supported the public interest in law enforcement and the fairness and integrity of the thoroughbred racing industry,and confidentiality of the informants identities was necessary for trpb work.trpb investigators often rely upon information provided by tipsters whose identities are kept confidential.in order to protect the privacy rights of such individuals and to further the public interest in law enforcement by facilitating communications from such individuals,trpb notes and file information underlying its reports are never released to any party.absent the protection of such confidentiality,trpb would be unable to conduct meaningful investigations.
second,trpb argued it was entitled to a protective order under.trpb maintained that the balancing of interests required by the rule favored the protective order because gill asserted interests in the identities of the confidential tipsters were outweighed by the public interest in the fairness and integrity of the races,trpb interest in its ability to protect that public interest by maintaining the confidential identities of its informants characterized as an informer privilege or informant privilege,and the privacy interests of the informants themselves.on the matter of the existence of a privilege,trpb argued that florida privilege law,rather than new hampshire,should govern the privilege analysis and whether the privilege was waived in this case.under that analysis,the privilege was not waived and the sealed documents should not be disclosed.but even if new hampshire law or federal common law were to apply,trpb argued that the result would be the same.
gill,in turn,argued that the documents should be unsealed because trpb could not meet the burden of showing that an informant privilege applied to the documents at issue.gill argued that the applicable law was new hampshire law,which affords no such privilege to a private entity such as trpb.even assuming that a privilege existed,trpb waived it through the disclosure to gill former counsel.disclosure of the identities of the tipsters,gill argued,was central to his defamation claim because the information would help to resolve the questions of whether the tipsters sic statements were motivated by,whether the tipsters were agents of the defendants,and whether the tipsters had a business relationship with the defendants sufficient to motivate them to publish their defamatory statements to a private person knowing that publication of the statements would adversely affect plaintiff business.
on june,the district court allowed gill motion to unseal and denied trpb motion for a protective order.the district court found it unnecessary to resolve the choice of law question because both new hampshire and florida law recognize an informant privilege in circumstances in which confidential information is provided to government entities in criminal and civil litigation.however,the privilege did not apply to the context of confidential information being provided to a entity such as the trpb,and if the informant might be able to give information that would be relevant to a fair determination of a material issue in the case,the court may require disclosure.
the district court found the identities of the tipsters relevant because the confidential informants would likely have information that would be relevant to a fair determination of whether gulfstream and savin used reasonable care in publishing the information about gill that he claims was false and defamatory.the district court then concluded no other privilege or reason to protect those documents from disclosure has been asserted therefore,gill counsel may use those documents in any appropriate manner.
trpb timely filed a notice to appeal and moved to stay the june,order.the district court stayed the order pending appeal.this court initially required trpb to show cause for why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.after trpb response,this court allowed the appeal to proceed and directed the parties to address appellate jurisdiction along with the merits in their briefs.
interlocutory appeal 
ordinarily,litigants may not seek immediate appeal of discovery orders because they are not final decisions and orders of the district court.see fdic ogden,cir.but,by refusing to comply with the discovery order,the party resisting it can gain the right of appeal by defying it,being held in contempt,and then appealing from the contempt order,which would be a final judgment as to him.id.at quoting corporacion insular de seguros garcia,cir alterations in fdic.the requirement that appellants gain the right to appeal by disobedience followed by contempt serves efficiency interests because it encourages reflection both by the party seeking discovery and by the party resisting it.id.
one exception to the rule that an appellant must be held in contempt before appealing a discovery order exists where,as here,the documents being sought are not in the hands of the appellants trpb,but in the hands of a third party sealed and filed with the district court.see,perlman united states.an exception in such circumstances is necessary because disobedience followed by contempt is not an option for the appellant when the discovery order is not directed at him,but at the third party,who presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance.church of scientology united states,d.
not all such discovery orders are immediately appealable,however,and s ome tension exists in our precedents as to whether the availability of immediate review in cases such as this should be gauged by the perlman rule or by the more encompassing cohen collateral order doctrine.fdic,at see cohen beneficial indus.loan.perlman,at.briefly stated,in this circuit,for a discovery ruling to be immediately appealable under the cohen collateral order doctrine,an order must 
concern a collateral issue so conceptually distinct from other issues being litigated in the underlying action that an immediate appeal would neither disrupt the main action,nor threaten to deprive the appellate court of useful context which might be derived from subsequent developments in the litigation 
completely and conclusively resolve the collateral issue 
infringe rights which appellant could not effectively vindicate in an appeal after final judgment in the case and 
involve an important or unsettled legal issue,rather than merely challenge discretionary trial court rulings.
united states,cir quoting united states,cir.these requirements have been interpreted to be narrower than the broad statement of the perlman rule that a discovery order addressed to a sometimes may be treated as an immediately appealable final order a party who claims to hold an applicable privilege.fdic,at 
trpb argues that appellate jurisdiction is appropriate under either the collateral order test or the perlman rule.we agree.despite the tension in the case law over whether and the degree to which the perlman rule has been absorbed into or limited by the collateral order doctrine,this case qualifies for appellate review under both doctrines.
first,this appeal fits the classic perlman mold appellants are third parties the district court is in possession of the documents and has ordered that the documents in question be unsealed and turned over to the plaintiff and his new counsel,who may use those documents in any appropriate manner the appellants have no control over the documents,which have been filed with the court,and thus are powerless to avert the mischief of the order,perlman,at.and unless immediate appeal is granted,the identities of the informants would become public knowledge,rendering an appeal nugatory,fdic,at.
second,this appeal satisfies the test for the cohen collateral order doctrine used in this circuit.the issue of whether the identities of the tipsters should remain protected is conceptually distinct from the invasion of privacy,defamation,and tortious inference claims.there is thus no danger that immediate appeal in this case would engender repetitive review,the avoidance of which is the rationale for the conceptually distinct requirement.see,at.the district court order completely resolves the issue of whether the identities of the tipsters will be protected.as well,once the documents are turned over to gill with no clear limitation on what he may do with them,the cat is out of the bag,and there will be no effective means by which trpb can vindicate its asserted rights after final judgment.finally,trpb argument is that the district court committed legal error.fdic,at quoting united states billmyer,cir.
gill,citing fdic,at,argues that circuit law requires that trpb in this case raise a substantial privilege claim emphasis added by gill to obtain immediate review under either perlman or the cohen collateral order doctrine.since trpb can not point to any case law justifying the extension of the government informant privilege to private parties except for two cases,apex oil dimauro,and ross bolton,the argument goes,its appeal from the district court order does not involve a substantial privilege claim,and this court has no jurisdiction.under gill view,we must resolve the merits question in order to decide the appellate jurisdictional question.
this argument misreads fdic.fdic involved a subpoena duces tecum directed at a law firm,a to the underlying contract dispute who had represented the interests of the defendant.fdic,at.the subpoena ordered the law firm to produce documents that the defendant asserted were protected by the privilege.id.at.after acknowledging that it was unclear under circuit law whether appealability should be measured by the perlman rule or the collateral order doctrine,the fdic court concluded that it was not necessary to answer that question in order to resolve jurisdiction under either approach,a substantial privilege claim that can not effectively be tested by the through a contemptuous refusal ordinarily will qualify for immediate review if the claim otherwise would be lost.id.at.read in context,the language gill relies on makes a substantial privilege claim a sufficient but not a necessary condition for appealability under either the collateral order doctrine or the perlman rule.fdic delineates one set of cases which may be immediately appealed under either approach but does not define all such cases.
it is not a requirement for interlocutory appeal of discovery orders conclusively determining rights that the appellant assert a substantial,claim of privilege.the perlman doctrine requires only that the appellant have a significant interest in the matters involved in the discovery order claims of privilege are by far the most common,but a proprietary interest also may suffice.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed emphasis added.
indeed,were gill argument correct,it would read out the fourth prong of the collateral order doctrine that important or unsettled legal issues in discovery orders can qualify for review.in our view,the claims asserted here are both important and unsettled.the supreme court has explained that important in the cohen collateral order doctrine sense means being weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.digital equip.desktop direct,d.
the appellants here,supported by an amicus brief from the association of racing commissioners international,contend that an important public interest which may be irretrievably lost weighs against the disclosure contemplated by the district court order.this is just the sort of important legal question that immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine is supposed to resolve.see fdic,at see also in re sealed case medical records,noting that discovery order was appealable under either collateral order doctrine or perlman and holding that district court erred by not engaging in rule balancing of the probative value of discovery order against privacy interests of the appellants montgomery ward zenith radio,asserting appellate jurisdiction under both the collateral order and perlman doctrines over corporation appeal of trial court order compelling government to disclose an investigative report containing confidential business information of the appellant court expressly did not reach the confidentiality of the file or any applicable privilege and stated that the courts have not limited interlocutory appeals of discovery orders to those involving assertions of absolute or constitutional privileges.we are satisfied that the minimum threshold for appellate jurisdiction has been met,and we turn to the merits.
there are two orders at issue the district court allowance of the order to unseal and its denial of trpb request for a protective order.trpb argues that the district court erred in the protective order analysis because it was obligated to,and failed to,engage in balancing of gill interest in the identities of the confidential tipsters against trpb claims of informer privilege,public interest privilege,and privacy rights.it follows that if the protective order analysis was flawed,then the order to unseal must also fall.
b provides,parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party all discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by rule b i,ii,and iii.id.emphasis added.discovery of both privileged and unprivileged information may be limited by rule b 
under rule,the trial court is required to balance the burden of proposed discovery against the likely benefit.see in re sealed case medical records,at farnsworth procter gamble,cir bruno stillman,globe newspaper,cir.the district court abuses its discretion in balancing the conflicting interests in discovery of confidential information when a relevant factor that should have been given significant weight is not considered,when an irrelevant or improper factor is considered and given significant weight,or when all proper and no improper factors are considered,but the court in weighing those factors commits a clear error of judgment.in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir quoting united states hastings,cir.
as we read the district court order,it ruled that once it had decided there was no informant privilege,it had no need to engage in any balancing of any other interests on the part of trpb.also,as we read the order,the court thought that the only interest asserted was a formal informant privilege.we have carefully reviewed the record and understand trpb arguments differently.
trpb in fact struck at least three distinct themes the informant privilege is applicable to trpb maintaining the confidentiality of the tipster identities is,in any event,in the public interest and implicates concerns of a much larger group of people than the parties to this suit and the confidentiality and privacy rights of the tipsters and the appellants weigh against disclosure.the district court order addressed only the first argument and not the others,and so did not consider significant relevant factors.
a.the informant privilege 
since this case is a diversity suit involving only claims,trpb claim that the documents here are protected by an evidentiary privilege is governed by state law under.see charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at.ed.the parties disagree over whether the privilege law of florida or new hampshire should govern the existence and scope of the privilege.like the district court,we conclude that new hampshire and florida law are so similar on this point that there is no need to make a choice.
both new hampshire and florida allow a government entity to assert a privilege not to disclose the identities of informers who provided information relating to violations of the law.see evid.foster state,so d,see also roviaro united states,d recognizing privilege under federal law.the privilege is applicable in both criminal and civil proceedings.see evid.in re forfeiture of dodge no,so d.usually,the privilege is limited to government officials.see generally edward imwinkelried,the new wigmore a treatise on evidence,at wigmore on evidence mcnaughton supp.neither new hampshire nor florida has ruled on whether a private entity in the position of trpb may
