richard lloyd carr,an engineer who develops privately financed public infrastructure projects,brought this action asserting that forbes,incorporated defamed him by publishing an article casting doubt on the integrity of his conduct and his representations concerning those projects.because carr is a public figure who has forecast no evidence that forbes acted with actual malice in publishing the article,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to forbes.
carr has spent his career managing the development of public infrastructure projects he assembles construction proposals,finds teams of engineers to build such projects,and identifies sources of funding for them.in,an engineering company that carr owned ran into financial trouble leading to its demise and carr personal bankruptcy.carr then contacted a former employer,the dana larson roubal group dlr,a large national engineering and architectural firm,and convinced dlr to provide seed money to form a new company,interwest management,through which carr,as president and ceo,could continue managing the development of public infrastructure projects with financing methods.
in the early,carr contracted to develop a sewer for the town of quartzsite,arizona.carr served as his firm public representative for the project and maintained a prominent profile in the project development.the sewer project tapped into local political passions and,in when the town elected a new mayor who had campaigned against the sewer system,the town canceled construction of the sewer and refused to pay interwest for the work that the firm had completed.interwest and the town proceeded to arbitration,resulting in an award in interwest favor.after the town refused to honor the award,interwest sued to recover its fees.
as interwest was developing the quartzsite project,officials in apache junction,arizona,who were familiar with carr work in quartzsite,contacted carr seeking to develop a sewer system for their town.in august of,these officials and carr firm signed a contract to build a similar sewer in apache junction.regulators had imposed a building moratorium on apache junction,the largest town in the united states without a sewer,because of its inadequate sewage disposal system yet,local voters had twice voted against the tax increases necessary to finance such a system.carr proposed that the town form a private sewer district that could operate the sewer by collecting fees and thereby avoid new taxes.after carr arranged to create a sewer district,that district hired interwest to build and manage the project and financed it through the issuance of bonds,all of which the allstate insurance company,purchased.however,interwest had apparently relied on unreasonably optimistic projections and an erroneous database of potential customers.due to a lack of customers,the sewer district was unable to pay off its bonds and ultimately filed for bankruptcy.allstate then sued all members of the interwest team for fraud.
in july,as the apache junction sewer project neared completion,south carolina officials solicited bids to build the southern connector,a highway intended to connect with in greenville county,south carolina.carr and interwest arranged that a new corporation,interwest carolina,llp,be formed to bid for the contract to build this highway.carr had no ownership stake in interwest carolina,which,like interwest,was controlled by dlr.the record does not reveal whether carr was an officer in interwest carolina,but indisputably he continued to serve as president and ceo of interwest itself.bob farris,a former federal highway administration commissioner,was the public face of interwest carolina.carr served as the project manager and facilitator and shared with farris joint authority for the project.
after a competitive bidding process in march of,south carolina selected interwest carolina to complete the southern connector project.among the many firms carr drew together to form the interwest carolina team was wilbur smith associates.
controversy immediately ensued over the highway project.indeed,its opponents brought suit,contending that the project required a local referendum,a position the south carolina supreme court ultimately rejected.when word of the allstate lawsuit against interwest reached south carolina,state officials developed concerns as to the competency and honesty of interwest carolina.the allstate suit became the topic of local news coverage and local officials investigated the allegations in that suit to determine whether interwest carolina should continue on the project.south carolina officials decided to take no action and interwest carolina continued its work on the southern connector.
in its july,edition,forbes magazine printed an article entitled moonshine bonds that was centered on carr.the article suggested that carr was a shady businessman with a troubled history.the article criticized carr throughout.for example,it alleged that carr smelled money in financing,that he exploited the tax law,and that he sought to target a larger federal funding program as bigger game which was right on his turf.in the table of contents,the magazine referred to carr as the moonshine man.forbes noted carr personal bankruptcy,the failure of his prior business,and that he had once hired a convicted felon who had served time in connection with an insurance fraud scheme.the article alluded to the quartzsite that it ended in a legal mess and focused on carr involvement with the apache junction and southern connector projects.
based on the allegations in the allstate suit,moonshine bonds charged carr with personally defrauding allstate and the town of apache junction the article explained that the apache junction sewer district had busted because the feasibility study done by carr company had grossly overstated the number of residents who would sign up for sewage connections.although the magazine noted that carr has an explanation for all his failures,specifically the failure of apache junction,it suggested that any explanation was false by highlighting the fact that carr company drew million in project management fees from the project.
moonshine bonds further stated that,while apache junction residents were nursing their wounds,carr had moved on and was now pushing yet another project,the southern connector.the article claimed that carr firm was awarded the southern connector contract because it had secured a study by wilbur smith associates,which project ed traffic and toll revenues higher than a previous study conducted by that same firm.forbes implied that,like the arizona project,the south carolina project would fail because it was based on a fraudulent feasibility study.the article noted that carr had now set his sights on even bigger game because he intended to participate in a new federal financing program.it concluded with the statement count on one thing those bond sellers for the southern connector wo be calling on allstate to unload the carolina bonds and recommended that readers take a pass on the southern connector bonds.
the author of moonshine bonds,matthew schifrin,began work on the article after a bond watchdog,richard lehman,alerted him to the potential story.lehman put schifrin in touch with george price,a south carolina activist working to defeat the southern connector.price provided schifrin with a notebook of material that he had collected about the project.schifrin subsequently conducted independent research.in addition to speaking with price and lehman,he talked with several other sources,including an allstate attorney involved in the lawsuit,a financier,a local arizona town official,and carr,himself.schifrin also examined relevant documents including the complaint in the allstate action and project proposals relevant to the southern connector.a forbes employee schifrin article and verified all of its material facts.
soon after the forbes company published moonshine bonds,dlr,believing carr to be a public relations problem and no longer marketable,terminated his employment with interwest.carr subsequently brought this defamation suit in june against forbes,schifrin,and several john does hereafter,collectively forbes.the district court granted forbes summary judgment,reasoning that carr was a public figure who could not prove by clear and convincing evidence that forbes had acted with actual malice.carr now appeals.
we first consider whether carr is a public figure.if so,the first amendment,as authoritatively interpreted by the supreme court,requires that he bear a substantial burden of proof in this defamation action.
the court has long recognized that defamation claims potentially chill the free speech rights jealously protected by the first amendment.were speakers threatened with potential liability every time they wished to criticize,they would hesitate to provide the public with many important facts and ideas.a free people must have access to all relevant the laudatory and the choosing a course of public policy.for this reason,the court has held that a public person essentially part of the public only recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct if he proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times sullivan,d.
moreover,a person need not be a public figure in all respects to trigger the actual malice standard.the supreme court has also held that,in certain circumstances,the constitution treats private citizens who are not otherwise public figures as public figures for the purpose of comment upon certain issues.see hutchinson proxmire,d wolston reader digest,d time,firestone,d gertz robert welch,d.when a person thrusts himself into the forefront of public debate,he is treated as a public figure for purposes of comment on issues arising from that debate.such public figures,like other public figures,may only recover for defamatory statements made with actual malice.forbes contends,and the district court held,that carr is such a public figure with respect to the issues discussed in moonshine bonds.
whether a person has achieved the status of a public figure is a question of law,which we consider de novo.foretich capital,cir.in answering that question,we conduct a inquiry.first,we ascertain whether a public controversy gave rise to the defamatory statement.second,we determine whether the plaintiff participation in that controversy sufficed to establish him as a public figure within the context of that public controversy.id.at.the defendant bears the burden of proving the plaintiff public figure status.
determining whether a public controversy gave rise to the article at issue in this case requires review of the scope of the alleged defamatory statements and the facts surrounding them.a public controversy does not encompass every conceivable issue of interest to the public.time,at.rather,public controversy is a legal term of art the term only encompasses a dispute that in fact has received public attention because its ramifications will be felt by persons who are not direct participants.foretich,at.
the forbes article primarily addresses the financing and construction of the apache junction sewer and the southern connector highway.on one hand,carr argues that neither of these subjects gave rise to a public controversy he maintains that the article comments only upon isolated local issues that had no ramifications for nonparticipants.on the other hand,forbes contends that the article describes a broad ranging,important public controversy over financing deals with nationwide implications.
neither formulation is wholly accurate.the record clearly demonstrates that the arizona and south carolina projects engendered local controversies,but that these controversies do constitute parts of a greater,more general public controversy.one need not,however,inflate this public controversy,as forbes would,into its most general and amorphous financing as a general capture its significance.rather,most accurately,the facts before us demonstrate a public controversy over the soundness of privately financed public projects of carr interwest companies,as exemplified by the apache junction sewer and southern connector highway.
unquestionably,public attention focused on the legitimacy of the projects described in moonshine bonds.the apache junction project received significant publicity in the arizona community and media both at the time that interwest developed the project and after its completion.the press also published articles concerning the litigation arising out of the apache junction project.similarly,the local community in south carolina discussed and debated the southern connector.furthermore,after word of the apache junction lawsuit against interwest reached south carolina,a public debate ensued over whether the facts alleged in the suit indicated that interwest carolina participation in the southern connector would result in similar problems.indeed,the suit led south carolina authorities to investigate interwest carolina to determine whether its contract to build the southern connector should be canceled.
the fact that the controversy addressed by forbes stirred public debate may be enough to satisfy the requirement that a true public controversy gave rise to the publication.see foretich,at that child custody dispute stirred public discussion of and civil contempt was enough to create public controversy affecting the public.in addition,however,carr conduct in developing public works projects had a concrete impact on the lives of people outside the controversy.public projects,by definition,exist for the public at large.when public projects are mismanaged and bonds issued to finance those projects fail,those projects may in turn fail,thereby harming the public.the citizens of apache junction,arizona now live in a town with a mismanaged,sewage system that was forced to the brink of bankruptcy.the citizens of south indeed all travelers who might use the southern likewise suffer were the bonds financing that project to fail.
in sum,moonshine bonds addressed a public controversy.
we next ask whether carr participation in this controversy is sufficient to justify treating him as a public figure for purpose of comment upon it.to become a public figure for a limited range of issues,one must voluntarily inject himself or be drawn into a particular public controversy.gertz,at.
therefore,a public figure is essentially one who has assumed a role of public prominence in the broad question of concern.hutchinson,at.
we have devised a test to determine whether the plaintiff has thrust himself into a controversy to the extent necessary to trigger public figure status.we consider whether the plaintiff has access to channels of effective communication,the plaintiff voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in the controversy,the plaintiff sought to influence the resolution of the controversy,the controversy existed prior to the publication of the defamatory statements,and the plaintiff retained public figure status at the time of the alleged defamation.see fitzgerald penthouse int l,cir.in this case,review of these five factors requires the conclusion that carr has taken the affirmative steps necessary to inject himself into the controversy surrounding the soundness of his public projects and therefore to become a public figure.
the heart of our test is the second and third factors,which we have sometimes combined into the question of whether the plaintiff has voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in a public controversy by attempting to influence the outcome of the controversy.reuber food chem.news,cir en banc.one does not become a public figure merely by contracting with the government or accepting public money,see hutchinson,at,but one who contracts with the government can become such a public figure because of the way in which he conducts himself in connection with those public contracts.see,mcdowell paiewonsky,cir architect who built public works became public figure through his acts in conjunction with those projects.in this case,carr did not merely contract with the government he personally and affirmatively took actions that invited public attention in connection with public contracts
