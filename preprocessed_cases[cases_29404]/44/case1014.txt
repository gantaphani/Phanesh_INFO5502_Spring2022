we have before us an appeal in a bankruptcy case.after plaintiffs obtained a dollar verdict in california state court against peter bogdanovich,bogdanovich and his wife,louise,filed a petition for bankruptcy in the southern district of new york.in so doing the debtors obtained an automatic stay preventing plaintiffs from reducing their favorable verdict into a final judgment.in response to the stay,plaintiffs began an adversary proceeding in the same bankruptcy court arguing that the stay be lifted because the debt owed by the california not one dischargeable in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy judge agreed and,on appeal,so did the district court judge.the debtors have appealed the order that lifted the automatic stay.
congress made it a central purpose of the bankruptcy code to give debtors a fresh start in life and a clear field for future effort unburdened by the existence of old debts.this policy is limited to the honest debtor,such that certain debts incurred,for example,by fraud are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.yet,when determining whether a given debt was obtained by fraud,the nature of the misrepresentations that led to the incurring of debt must be carefully analyzed,inasmuch as this nondischargeability exception itself has an exception.that is,false oral statements made by a debtor regarding his financial condition lead to a debt that is dischargeable,while false written statements of financial condition do not.
as the reader will see in the opinion that follows a question exists as to whether some of the misrepresentations in the case at hand satisfy the nondischargeability exception for fraudulent statements under a a.it is not clear what evidence was submitted to the california jury for consideration.as we explain below,the evidence relied on by the jury in the california action is the key to whether the california verdict is dispositive of the nondischargeability question.thus,to justify lifting the stay,we would have to speculate on what evidence was presented to the jury.we decline to engage in such speculation because it could result in an advisory opinion.in light of this uncertainty in the california proceedings,the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it lifted the stay,and so the district court affirmance of that order must be vacated and the case remanded with instructions.
background 
sale of plaintiffs home 
in plaintiffs aly and barry spencer decided to try to sell a home they owned in beverly hills.in july of that year they met william peiffer,business manager for peter and louise bogdanovich,who told the spencers that the bogdanovichs might be interested in purchasing plaintiffs home and that he was acting as their agent.
during the ensuing negotiations for a possible sale,peiffer is said to have made various oral representations that are the subject of the adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court.in particular,peiffer allegedly indicated the bogdanovichs authorized him to find them a place to live.he also said the bogdanovichs wanted him to represent them in all financial matters,giving him full control over and access to their funds,requesting further that he manage their money for them and pay their bills on time.peiffer,according to the spencers,said he was hired after peter bogdanovich declared bankruptcy.it was his task to help bogdanovich live within his means by monitoring and controlling his spending.
he maintained that as a result of his efforts the bogdanovichs were now free of debt and had good credit.peiffer also declared bogdanovich bankruptcy was a recent one that would prevent him from seeking such protection from his creditors for years.the agent also assured the spencers that peter bogdanovich could afford to purchase their property and would make timely payments.he told the spencers they could feel secure in the transaction because the bogdanovichs would be stable buyers since peter bogdanovich hated to move.peiffer characterized peter bogdanovich as an extremely honest and honorable man,one who paid his debts,as evidenced by the fact that the bogdanovichs in the past had borrowed large sums of money from him,but always repaid him.peiffer made other statements pertaining to bogdanovich career.the spencers aver that he told them peter bogdanovich was a busy hollywood movie director who did not have time to attend to his own business affairs,and had several iron clad movie deals that guaranteed him several million dollars.
relying on peiffer representations,the spencers sold their beverly hills home to the bogdanovichs in for million.the spencers kept the mortgages,on which the bogdanovichs were to make monthly payments for ten years,with title to pass upon full payment of the purchase price.
the spencers now believe all of peiffer representations were false because several important facts were concealed from them.for example,they claim bogdanovich bankruptcy filing was not recent in relation to the real estate negotiations,but occurred four years prior to the sale of the house.they further think the movie deals were far from certain,and that the studios were not at all obligated to make any movies with peter bogdanovich.as for the purchasers previous residences,the spencers declare the bank holding the mortgage foreclosed on the prior home owned by the bogdanovichs,and that although the bogdanovichs continued to live there for years they failed to make mortgage payments,and had since lived in other homes without meeting payment obligations.the bogdanovichs are also said to have accumulated a vast amount of debt by living beyond their means and paying only those creditors who either pressed or sued them.the spencers believe the bogdanovichs could not afford the monthly payments to them on their house and had no intention of making them.
the bogdanovichs moved into the spencers house in november and lived there for several years,but eventually stopped making payments.as a result,the spencers were forced to default on their mortgage payments and lost their home to foreclosure in march.
state court proceedings 
in february the with gerald schneiderman,an assignee of a portion of the spencers suit in california superior court.defendants included the bogdanovichs,peiffer and other individuals,entities and does alleged to be agents,principals,partners,associates,joint venturers,employees of the bogdanovichs.the spencers complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract,fraud and negligent misrepresentation.it did not identify all of the misrepresentations and concealments,but instead stated that liability would also be premised on other representations and concealments according to proof.
the case was tried against peter bogdanovich and three in may,but plaintiffs dropped their claims against his wife,louise bogdanovich.after ten days of trial,the jury returned a general verdict solely against peter bogdanovich,awarding schneiderman in damages and the spencers in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.the jury had been instructed that it could award punitive damages only upon a predicate finding of oppression,fraud or malice.
on may,day after the jury returned its bogdanovichs filed a chapter petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york garrity.pursuant to a,the bogdanovichs assets became subject to an automatic stay,which thereby prevented the spencers from taking any further action on their favorable california verdict.
bankruptcy proceedings 
the spencers and schneiderman thereupon filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court on september,seeking to establish the nondischargeability of the debt that was owed them under the verdict of the california state court.in april they moved to lift the automatic stay so that a judgment could be entered in california superior court and so that any appeals involving peter bogdanovich could be taken.the spencers indicated that if a favorable final judgment were obtained in state court,they intended to move for summary judgment in the adversary proceeding on the basis of collateral estoppel.the bogdanovichs opposed the motion to lift the stay and moved to dismiss the adversary proceeding.in december the bankruptcy court granted relief to the spencers by lifting the automatic stay,and denied the bogdanovichs motion to dismiss the proceeding.
the bogdanovichs filed a timely notice of appeal with the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,which heard oral argument on november.on november it issued a decision affirming the lifting of the automatic stay.with respect to the bogdanovichs motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding,the district court determined that the bankruptcy court order was interlocutory,which meant the bogdanovichs were not entitled to an appeal as of right.after reviewing the nature of the underlying motion,the district court in its discretion denied the bogdanovichs leave to appeal the interlocutory order denying the motion to dismiss.judgment was entered on january.
although the bogdanovichs appealed each of the district court decisions,only the decision relating to the lifting of the stay is properly before us.we earlier dismissed that part of the appeal pertaining to the bogdanovichs motion to dismiss because it was not a final appealable order.for this reason,although schneiderman is listed as an appellee in the caption of the pending appeal,he is not involved in the instant dispute because he was not a party to the motion to lift the stay.
with that recitation of the facts and the prior proceedings,we turn to a discussion of the law.
discussion 
i standard of review 
because the district court acted as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case,its decision is subject to plenary review.mccord agard in re bean,cir.we therefore independently review the legal conclusions and factual determinations of the bankruptcy court de novo,bell bell in re bell,cir,mindful that the original decision to lift the stay may be overturned only for an abuse of discretion,mazzeo lenhart in re mazzeo,cir.
ii lifting the stay 
justification for relief 
pursuant to a,the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay to give a debtor a short respite from creditors demands,during which a debtor will have the opportunity to develop and implement plans to right his financial affairs.in re bleecker.relief from the stay may be granted after notice and a hearing,among other reasons,for cause.d.the burden is on the moving party,here the spencers,to make an initial showing of cause.absent such showing,relief from the effect of a stay will be denied.in re mazzeo,at.
although the term for cause is not defined in the bankruptcy code,we have adopted factors to consider when deciding whether or not to lift a stay in order that litigation may continue to completion in another tribunal.sonnax,tri component prods.in re sonnax indus,cir.these factors are set forth in the margin not every one of these factors will be relevant in every case.in re mazzeo,at.the ultimate determination whether to lift a stay depends upon the facts underlying a given motion.see in re sonnax,at.sonnax factors,and are relevant to the facts of this case.these factors are whether relief would result in a partial or complete resolution of the issues the interests of judicial economy and the expeditious and economical resolution of litigation and the impact of the stay on the parties and the balance of harms.id.
as noted,the spencers contend that if the stay were lifted to allow them to obtain a final judgment in california,that judgment would be dispositive of the issues raised in the adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court.in examining the spencers proposition we begin by observing that a federal court decides whether to give preclusive effect to state judicial proceedings by looking to the law of preclusion in that state.marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.under california law,a judgment much less a verdict,which is all the spencers have here is not final for collateral estoppel purposes until the appellate process has concluded or the time to take an appeal has passed.conopco,roll int l,cir wright turner in re turner,cir.collateral estoppel would then apply only with respect to issues actually and necessarily decided by the jury.people howie,th,d.the bankruptcy court in the bogdanovich case made no determination regarding whether collateral estoppel would apply instead it deferred decision on that issue until a final judgment had been entered in california.
the spencers adversary proceeding relies exclusively on the nondischargeability provisions in a a and a.section a a provides that a debt for money will not be dischargeable in bankruptcy if obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.section a further states that a debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor is nondischargeable.the spencers reason that these sections are applicable in light of the california jury finding of fraud and conduct warranting punitive damages.
the bogdanovichs counter that pursuit of a final judgment is futile.they argue that even were the verdict embodied in a judgment,the nondischargeability rule in a a would not apply because it contains an exception for a statement respecting the debtor financial condition.according to a b,such statements can form the basis for a nondischargeable debt only if in writing.oral statements relating to a debtor financial condition thereby remain dischargeable.see also in re kiernan,noting that as between oral and written statements of financial condition,only the latter provide a basis for nondischargeable debt.the bogdanovichs point out that peiffer representations were never reduced to writing,and they argue that his oral statements related solely to their financial condition.they then suggest that the absence of actionable statements under a means no cause of action can be sustained under a.see mccrary barrack in re barrack,cir.
the bankruptcy court addressed the bogdanovichs argument respecting a a by itemizing only those allegations from the adversary complaint that it considered actionable under the statute.the district court recognized at oral argument that the bankruptcy court did not attempt to rule on the actionability of all of the statements,and the district court,in its own decision,held that some of the statements were not respecting the debtor financial condition.emphasis added omission in original.both courts believed that the actionability of at least a few of the statements warranted an opportunity for the california appellate courts to enter a final judgment,which then might help determine whether the debt is nondischargeable and thereby save time and expense in the adversary proceeding.
as the bogdanovichs maintain,however,such partial findings with respect to the findings of the california jury will prevent the california judgment from having collateral estoppel effect in the bankruptcy proceeding.this obstacle is explained in bender tobman in re tobman.in the in re tobman case,the plaintiff sued in federal court alleging,among other things,fraudulent inducement.id.at.after obtaining a favorable verdict and judgment,the plaintiff initiated an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against the and sought an order barring the discharge of the judgment debt pursuant to a a.id.at.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff based on collateral estoppel.id.
on appeal,the district court determined that the fraudulent inducement claim in the underlying federal action was based on several statements,some of which met the requirements for nondischargeability and some of which did not.id.at.because the verdict sheet reflected only that the jury had found for the plaintiff on his fraudulent inducement claim,without indicating which statements formed the basis for that finding,the district court reasoned it could not know whether the jury had actually decided that the debtor committed fraud cognizable under a a.id.at.nor did the court think the jury award of punitive damages sufficient by itself to invoke collateral estoppel without knowing whether the fraudulent activity was based upon statements other than those relating to the defendant own financial condition.id.accordingly,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court gr
