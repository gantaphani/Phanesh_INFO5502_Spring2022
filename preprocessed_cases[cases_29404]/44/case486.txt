sunday dixon orekoya is a black nigerian national who brought suit asserting he was the victim of racial and national origin discrimination by an overzealous united states secret service agent who was investigating financial fraud crimes by nigerian nationals.orekoya asserted that this agent and another violated the privacy act of,in two instances.in,agent melissa walsh obtained and then released to orekoya employer,the bank of new england,information about orekoya which turned out to be inaccurate from the files of the immigration and naturalization service.in,agent james mooney is alleged to have released to the employer information from a federal bureau of investigation record.orekoya also asserts that agent mooney,through these and other actions,violated his fifth amendment rights.
the district court dismissed his privacy act claims after a bench trial.a jury had earlier rejected his claims under.in this appeal,orekoya argues that the jury was not properly instructed on his fifth amendment claims of discrimination,brought under the bivens doctrine.see bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d.he also attacks the district court privacy act conclusions,claiming errors of fact and law.on the bivens jury instruction claim,we affirm.on the privacy act claims,we affirm,holding that the act permits an award of emotional distress damages,subject to firm requirements for proof of emotional distress plaintiff proof of emotional distress damages was insufficient and an agency may not immunize itself from liability for its unauthorized disclosure on the grounds that the records disclosed did not come from its files but were obtained from a system of records maintained by another agency.
background 
factual background 
orekoya was born in lagos,nigeria in and came to the united states to attend college in.he attended roxbury community college and took courses at northeastern university and the new england banking institute.in,orekoya began working for the bank of new england bne as a teller.in,he was promoted to a position as a fund accountant in the commercial lending department and transferred to bne headquarters.
in,the united states secret service usss and other federal agencies set up task forces in a number of cities to combat a rise in crime by nigerian nationals.the immigration and naturalization service ins estimated that a majority of the nigerian nationals in the united states were involved in criminal activity.this activity revolved primarily around financial transaction and insurance fraud,and a typical suspect worked in a bank.
james mooney 
on january,orekoya loaned his car to isaac olopade,another nigerian national.olopade was stopped by the providence police for speeding.he was the subject of a usss credit card investigation,and so the police called the providence office of the usss to request an agent presence at the scene of the traffic stop.james mooney,an agent specializing in counterfeiting and fraud investigations who knew olopade,arrived.he discovered that the car belonged to sunday dixon.this name was not unfamiliar to mooney a car with a license plate registered in that name had previously appeared at businesses subject to investigation and surveillance by the usss.
in march,mooney was contacted by the rhode island police,who were investigating an allegation that orekoya had raped a woman in cranston.the woman named sunday dixon as the rapist and identified orekoya photo.mooney discovered through the owner of the apartment where the rape occurred that orekoya worked for bne.mooney then contacted bne and discussed orekoya with christopher carney,director of corporate security for bne.mooney informed carney that the usss was conducting an investigation into the use of bne credit cards in a fraud scheme involving stolen rental cars.orekoya later claimed that mooney also told carney about the rape investigation and orekoya prior arrest for robbery,information supposedly derived from the federal bureau of investigation fbi,and that mooney asked for information about orekoya bank accounts.
on march,orekoya was arrested at bne by the boston police.mooney interrogated him about the sexual assault and the involvement of nigerians in credit card fraud.he also took a picture of orekoya at the police station and kept it.orekoya claimed that mooney periodically showed the picture around the usss office.
as a result of his arrest,orekoya was suspended from work without pay.on june,the rape case was dismissed because the victim would not testify in court.that month orekoya attempted to regain his job but was told that the position had been eliminated.
melissa walsh 
in,bne began conducting an internal investigation into overdraft activity in orekoya personal bank account.in the course of the investigation,carney noticed that orekoya passport had expired.on june,carney contacted the usss and asked melissa walsh,an agent,about orekoya immigration status.she called carney back the next day and reported that she learned from immigration that orekoya was present in the united states illegally.when a bne official contacted the ins,it refused to release any information over the phone.
because orekoya had lost his green card,he could not produce any legal documents proving his immigration status.as a result,on july,bne temporarily suspended orekoya,with pay.he went to the boston ins office and returned to bne the next day with a stamp on his passport proving eligibility.he was immediately given back his position.
procedural history 
orekoya filed a complaint against usss and mooney.he claimed that he had been the victim of discrimination and alleged violations of the fourth,fifth,and ninth amendments,and the massachusetts civil rights act.laws ch.he also claimed that the usss had violated the privacy act,and the financial privacy act.finally,he alleged counts of slander and abuse of process against mooney 
orekoya filed his first complaint in.he filed an amended complaint in early.since that time,for a variety of reasons including illnesses and recusals,the case has been heard by no less than four federal district court judges.it has been over a decade since the first complaint was filed.we briefly navigate the contours of the procedural history,setting aside the niceties until they are relevant to the discussion.
in a summary judgment ruling in,the district court dismissed the fourth,fifth,and ninth amendment claims and the claim.it dismissed the fifth and ninth amendment claims against mooney based on a finding that he was entitled to qualified immunity.
in,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants for any remaining fourth,fifth,and ninth amendment claims.it also dismissed the massachusetts civil rights act and slander claims.after this order,all that remained were the claim and the privacy act and financial privacy act claims.the court also made clear that the claim could encompass discrimination based on ethnicity and ancestry,but that orekoya could not bring a separate claim for discrimination based on national origin under bivens.
the claim was tried in front of a jury in march.orekoya asked that the court submit a bivens claim for national origin discrimination to the jury as well as the claim for discrimination for race or ethnicity.the request was denied.on march,the jury found for the defendants.
on march,the district court held a bench trial.on february,the district court found for the defendants on the privacy act claim it found that walsh disclosure to bne did not violate the act because it did not involve the usss own records system,which does not maintain records regarding citizenship,and because orekoya did not prove that he suffered adverse effects.it found that the privacy act did not allow recovery for emotional damages or other injuries,and that in any case orekoya had not proven emotional distress.
plaintiff timely appealed both the refusal of the bivens jury instruction and the district court privacy act claims.
ii.discussion 
a.the privacy act,b 
when reviewing the decisions of the district court in a bench trial,we review the court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error.drilling inner space,cir.
in the privacy act of,congress imposed restrictions on the ability of government agencies to disclose certain information on individuals which they had maintained in a system of records.see b.since then,congress has amended the statute several times,most recently in,taking further incremental steps to protect the privacy of individuals.this court has had very few occasions to interpret or apply the act.see,fed.labor relations auth.dep t of the navy,cir beaulieu irs,cir usher sec y of hhs,cir.
at issue here is the bar on unauthorized disclosures 
no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,or to another agency,except pursuant to a written request by,or with the prior written consent of,the individual to whom the record pertains 
b.if an agency,acting intentionally or willfully,violates this command in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,congress has authorized the filing of a civil action for damages by the affected individual.id.g.both actual damages sustained by the individual and statutory minimum damages of are available,along with attorney fees.id.g.
in sum,the key elements of a cause of action under the privacy act for damages for disclosure are 
agency disclosure by any means of communication 
to an individual or another agency 
of a record contained in a system of records 
which is unauthorized by the individual,and 
which is not within an exception 
and has an adverse effect on the individual a requirement which contains two components i an adverse effect standing component ii a causal nexus between the disclosure and the adverse effect 
and that the agency action be in a manner which was intentional or willful,which means proof somewhat greater than gross negligence.
see quinn stone,cir waters thornburgh.the privacy act prohibits more than dissemination of records themselves,but also nonconsensual disclosure of any information that has been retrieved from a protected record.bartel faa,
the district court entered summary judgment on multiple grounds on the two sets of alleged actions of agent walsh and the actions of agent mooney.we discuss only three of those grounds.the district court held that unauthorized disclosure from one agency system of records by another agency to a third party is not a violation of the act that mental or emotional distress are not encompassed within the phrase actual damages under the act and that plaintiff proof failed to permit a reasonable factfinder to find any compensable emotional distress caused by the alleged violations.we disagree with the first two grounds.but we do agree as to the third ground and so ultimately affirm the summary judgment.
disclosure and system of records 
the district dismissed orekoya claims concerning agent walsh disclosure on the basis that usss did not maintain a system of records concerning immigration status and walsh therefore did not rely on any usss record about plaintiff citizenship.the plaintiff alleges that agent walsh called the ins and obtained information from the ins system of records,and then disclosed the information to bne,orekoya employer,without orekoya consent.similarly,as to usss agent mooney,the court concluded that if he disclosed to bne information from fbi files about orekoya prior arrest for unarmed robbery,that was not an actionable disclosure.
we hold that the unauthorized disclosure by one agency of protected information obtained from a record in another agency system is a prohibited disclosure under the act,unless the disclosure falls within the statutory exceptions.we stress that the issue is not the disclosure by one agency to another,but the disclosure by the second agency to a member of the public.we reject the district court reading on the grounds that it is contrary to the plain language of b and would defeat the purposes of the act.the statute says that no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records.b emphasis added.a system of records is defined as a group of any records under the control of any agency.id.a.the statute also prohibits unauthorized disclosure to another agency.id.the language does not support the view that an agency may immunize itself from liability by obtaining information from a different agency system of records and then saying its further unauthorized disclosure is protected because its own system of records was not the original source.such a reading would create a tremendous loophole in privacy protection,one surely not intended by congress.
even if the initial disclosure by an agency from its own system of records here the ins to another agency here the usss were within one of the exceptions,see,b permitting disclosures between agencies for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity upon a written request,that would not permit the recipient agency to then make an unauthorized disclosure to a third party if the latter disclosure did not itself fall within an exception.the ninth circuit reached a similar conclusion in wilborn department of health human services,cir.
availability of emotional distress damages under the privacy act 
the district court ruled as a matter of law that no recovery is available under the privacy act for emotional distress damages.the question presented is not whether pecuniary costs occasioned by emotional distress,such as payments to therapists for treatment,are actual damages they surely are.the government agrees that such losses are actual damages within the meaning of the statute,but argues that damages are restricted to only such expenses.
what appears to be a simple question is instead a complicated series of questions.the privacy act provides 
in any suit brought under the provisions of subsection g c or d of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful,the united states shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of 
a actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure,but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of and 
b the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.
g.this in turn raises a series of questions concerned with the relationship between the statutory requirement that there be an adverse effect on an individual,id.g d,the actual damages requirement,id.g a,and the statutory damages provision for a person entitled to recovery,id.
first is the question of whether an individual must show merely an adverse effect to receive in statutory damages,or whether he must also show actual damages in order to receive even statutory damages.the statutory adverse effect requirement,id.g d,is generally viewed as a standing requirement and a causation requirement which enables an individual to bring a civil action to enforce civil remedies.quinn,at.if showing an adverse effect is sufficient to get statutory damages,then the initial question is whether provable emotional distress constitutes an adverse effect.five circuits have held that an allegation of emotional distress was sufficient to show adverse effect,and that a plaintiff asserting emotional distress could recover at least the third circuit,see id.at the fifth circuit,johnson irs,cir the tenth circuit,see parks irs,cir the eleventh circuit,see fitzpatrick irs,cir and the circuit,see albright united states.whether under actual damages the plaintiff could recover more than statutory damages is another question for this group of courts.one circuit,the fourth,over a dissent,has held that an individual must suffer actual damages in order to be considered a person entitled to recovery and thus eligible for the statutory minimum damages of.doe chao,cir.that court agreed that an adverse effect may be shown by emotional distress,but disagreed that an adverse effect is sufficient to obtain emotional distress statutory damages,while acknowledging the issue to be close id.at.
inherent in these cases allowing statutory damages is an analysis that congress would not have granted
