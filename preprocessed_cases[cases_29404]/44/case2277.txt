in this appeal,we are asked to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion filed by plaintiff marty stanifer,pursuant to a and,to transfer venue from the western district of kentucky,where the plaintiff resided and where his complaint was filed,to the northern district of alabama,where the two defendants resided and where all the events that gave rise to this litigation occurred.the motion was filed in response to the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction to try this diversity action,denied the plaintiff motion to transfer,and dismissed the case pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the only question on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding to dismiss rather than transfer the case.we find no such abuse.
the plaintiff filed his complaint,citing subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity,in the western district of kentucky.the claim was one for damages arising from personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff in an automobile accident that occurred in decatur,alabama,allegedly due to the negligence of defendants alpheus brannan and thelma alldredge,both residents of alabama.rather than file an answer to the complaint,the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue.the plaintiff did not attempt to establish valid grounds for jurisdiction,instead filing a motion to transfer venue to the northern district of alabama,which the district court denied.
it bears repeating that other than moving to transfer,the plaintiff made no effort to avoid dismissal.he nevertheless asserts on appeal that the district court erred both in denying his motion to transfer and in granting the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.in his brief,however,he fails to offer any argument,let alone a citation,to support the contention that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants and was,therefore,mistaken in dismissing the complaint.we therefore consider that claim waived.see vance wade,cir.
what the plaintiff does argue is that the district court erred in denying his motion to transfer venue and instead entering the order of dismissal.he bases this claim on the provision in a that requires dismissal of a case laying venue in the wrong division or district,unless the district court finds in the interest of justice that the case should be transferred to the district in which it could have been brought,rather than dismissed.a similar provision in permits transfer of a case when the court finds a want of jurisdiction,if the court also finds that transfer to the appropriate district is in the interest of justice.as the district court correctly noted,these statutes confer broad discretion in ruling on a motion to transfer.nevertheless,the district judge declined to exercise that discretion in this case,finding that the interest of justice would not be served by a transfer 
plaintiff filed this complaint in kentucky without having the slightest reason to believe that he could obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendants within this jurisdiction.whether the filing of this complaint here was a matter of oversight,inattention or wilful abuse of process,this court does not know and need not determine.the fact is,plaintiff having misused the processes of the court,the interests of justice are not well served by allowing plaintiff to maintain his suit as filed.
under different circumstances,the court could be persuaded to exercise its discretion to effect a transfer.here,the lawsuit so obviously lacks merit as to jurisdiction over these defendants that it would be unfair to give defendants anything less than the complete remedies that they request.that the result of this decision may be the complete loss of plaintiff claim is not a fact which carries particular weight under these circumstances.the interest of justice analysis which might permit this court to exercise its discretion by transferring venue should not permit plaintiff to resurrect a claim which might be lost due to a complete lack of diligence in determining the proper forum in the first instance.
taking issue with the district court decision,the plaintiff cites our opinion in roman ashcroft,cir,contending that it involves the exact question presented in this case and that the district court should have transferred venue from the northern district of ohio to the western district of louisiana,where the putative sic defendant would be subject to personal jurisdiction because the need for judicial economy established that the transfer would be in the interest of justice.but only the broadest of readings would permit us to interpret the convoluted procedural situation in roman as presenting the exact question as in the case now before us.
roman was an alien being held in an ins detention facility in louisiana prior to his forced removal from this country,based on criminal offenses for which he had been tried and convicted in ohio.his attorney filed a petition for habeas relief in the northern district of ohio against various ins officials and the united states attorney general,under whose direction the ins was operating at the time.the district court granted habeas relief,rejecting the respondents motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,in which they contended that the immediate custodian rule controlled the jurisdiction question and that the petitioner immediate custodian was the ins district director in new orleans,over whom the district court in ohio had no jurisdiction.id.at.the district court held that the united states attorney general,also a respondent in the suit,could be considered the petitioner custodian and denied the motion to dismiss.there is no indication that a motion to transfer venue under either a or was filed in the district court.indeed,the suggestion that a transfer under those provisions might be in order originated in our court,after we applied the immediate custodian rule and declined to invoke the exception to this general rule urged by the petitioner.that exception,recognized by some courts,allows the attorney general to be named as the respondent in an alien petition for a writ of habeas corpus under extraordinary circumstances.id.at.
the district court determined,in effect,that a backlog of habeas petitions filed by those in the western district of louisiana awaiting deportation created a risk that petitioner roman request for relief from removal might not be heard before his deportation was effected.id.at.on appeal,we held that this conjecture by the district court did not constitute a sufficiently extraordinary circumstance to avoid application of the immediate custodian rule.we could not determine from the record,however,whether the district court might have had jurisdiction over one of the other named respondents,because personal jurisdiction as to those respondents had not been considered by the district judge.we therefore remanded the case to the district court to make a full assessment on the issue of jurisdiction,but also a matter of if the court found a complete lack of jurisdiction,the case should be transferred to the western district of louisiana under section,in the interest of justice.id.at.
we have engaged in an extended discussion of roman principally to demonstrate how utterly different that case is from the one now before us.aside from the dissimilar procedural posture of the two cases,it is clear that petitioner roman had at least a colorable basis for filing his action in the northern district of ohio and a plausible reason for failing to file in the western district of louisiana.by contrast,stanifer has failed to offer even one reason,plausible or not,for filing in what was obviously the wrong no reason at all for failing to file in the proper district.true,stanifer counsel may have needed to file his client complaint promptly in order to toll the running of the alabama statute of limitations,but that necessity would not justify filing a complaint in what amounts to the nearest federal courthouse.
