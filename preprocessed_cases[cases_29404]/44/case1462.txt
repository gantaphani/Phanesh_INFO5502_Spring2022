defendant appellant oldendorff carriers gmbh.kg oldendorff appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict under b of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,b the act.the claim arose when the longshoreman,plaintiff appellee richard bunn,slipped and fell on oldendorff ship,the christoffer oldendorff the ship,during loading operations in the baltimore port.for the following reasons,we reject oldendorff challenges and affirm the judgment.
bunn,who worked for the stevedore,cnx marine terminals,cnx,slipped on ice and injured himself while loading coal onto the ship,a bulk carrier,on february.we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to bunn,the prevailing party at trial.
cnx shift supervisor joseph white boarded the ship around on february,to tell chief officer andriy fediv that cnx employees intended to start loading that night.although the ship had been docked a few days,cnx had been unable to load the vessel because of some winter weather.id.at.when white boarded the ship,he noticed that there was ice covered throughout the ship,with the exception of a pathway back from the gangway to the deckhouse.id.at.white instructed fediv,w e need a clear path to the holds to be able to load this vessel.id.fediv,who knew which hatches the cnx employees were going to be loading,responded t hat the ship crew would salt and sand between the holds.id.at 
based on this conversation,white told longshoreman christopher moxey before the loading operation started that the ship crew was going to treat the ship and make sure it was safe by s alt ing it,sand ing it,and shovel ing it.hours later,when moxey and bunn walked onto the ship,they found the area between the gangway and the deckhouse,and between the starboard rail and hatch number five,p erfectly clear of ice.id.at.
meanwhile,bunn had arrived at the terminal at on february,and began his hour shift an hour later.his job was to clean the terminal and to spread salt,and to go around and make sure all the equipment was fueled and running.sometime between midnight and on february,white approached bunn to discuss loading the ship.id.at.specifically,white instructed bunn to work onboard the ship during the night to assist moxey in the loading operation.bunn asked 
well,you want me to go now white said no,take your time,finish lunch.he said they getting the ship ready and we still finishing up getting the terminal ready.
id.at.white told bunn he would call him or moxey by radio when the ship was safe to load.id.at.
in due course,bunn and moxey had the instruction that it was okay to go up on the ship,the ship was ready,and the two boarded the ship around on february.bunn testified 
when we first got up on the deck,we could see a clear path to the number five hatch,and looking towards the deckhouse,you could see there was a path made to the deckhouse.
id.at.bunn and moxey began loading coal into the number five hatch.id.at.during the loading process,coal moves from a silo to a ship loader,id.at,a giant crane that hangs over the ship,id.at.
it has a boom with a conveyor belt on it that carries the coal.at the end of the boom,it has a spoon that comes down that goes in the hold.it has a spoon that rotates,and that directs the coal.
id.at.bunn job was to be on the ship and help guide the coal as it was loaded into the holds.
being that the ship loader operator is up in the air,and he sits on one side of the machine,he ca see exactly what we can see when we close to the hold.so in order to keep everything safe,we have to watch his equipment,that he does hit the hatch cover,and also direct him on where the proper places to put the coal t he only way i see it is if i lean forward over the hold,i can see down in there how the coal is building up.
after loading the number five hatch,bunn told moxey to warm himself in the deckhouse bunn walked forward to load the number three hatch,holding onto the hand rail on the side of the ship,whereupon the accident occurred 
it was nighttime.it not much lighting when you get further past the beginning of the ship.at the beginning of the ship,the deckhouse has lights.but as you get down,the lighting is very poor.
well,i remember coming off the path,and it felt like i stepped up a little bit.i could tell my surface changed a little.
i took a couple steps,and the next thing i knew,i had slipped and fell right then,boom but i caught myself with my knees and my hands when i fell.
well,then i realized that i kind of hurt myself,so i took my time.then i figured well,maybe i just on a patch of ice that i did see and maybe i need to find where this path is.
so i stood up and i said i going to slowly walk,take little steps toward the hold.i still needed to get to the hold so i started to walk towards the hold,and no more than one,two steps and boom.my feet came out from underneath of me and i landed on my back and my elbow.
after bunn fall,moxey told chief officer fediv that the ship was icy forward and that it needed to be salted.fediv responded that he only had a limited supply of salt.id.at.about a half hour later,moxey loaded coal into hatch number seven.id.at.when he returned to hatch number three,he noticed that it was still icy.id.
at the close of bunn case,and again at the conclusion of all the evidence,oldendorff moved for judgment as a matter of law the company argued as it had in seeking summary judgment earlier that it owed no duty under the act to warn of the open and obvious danger posed by the presence of ice in the areas where the longshoremen would be working.the district court denied the motions,reasoning that liability can attach to a ship owner that voluntarily and affirmatively undertakes to remedy an otherwise open and obvious unsafe condition,but fails to do so.bunn oldendorff carriers gmbh,no.wmn,wl,at.july.the court noted that,based on white testimony,the jury could conclude that the ship on the unquestioned authority to do so of the chief officer,voluntarily assumed the responsibility for salting and sanding the ice in the places where he knew cnx personnel would be working.id.at.
the district court also declined to give the following jury instruction,requested by oldendorff 
in the absence of any agreement,the ship is not responsible for any open and obvious condition.
the court instructed the jury as follows 
the plaintiff claims in this case are governed by the law that is set out in what we know as the longshoreman and harbor workers act.in accord with the law,your basic determination in this case is going to be to decide whether negligence on the part of the operator of the vessel christopher oldendorff caused or directly contributed to the plaintiff accident on or about february,and the damages claimed to have resulted from that occurrence 
negligence,simply stated,is the failure to exercise reasonable care under the existing circumstances.
but once the loading or the unloading of a ship by a stevedoring company has begun,the responsibility for safe working conditions is generally the burden of the terminal or the stevedoring company,in this case,cnx marine terminal.a shipowner,oldendorff carriers in this case,will only be responsible or liable for injury resulting directly from an unsafe condition on the ship of which it was aware and which it voluntarily agreed and undertook to remedy,but failed to do so.
the jury found oldendorff negligent and calculated in pecuniary and damages.the jury further found,however,that bunn was also negligent,and that he was percent at fault for the accident.id.
oldendorff renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved alternatively for a new trial,arguing that the court had erred in refusing to give an instruction on the open and obvious defense.mot.for as a matter of law,docket,bunn,cv wmn.may.the court denied the motions,and this timely appeal followed.
oldendorff raises two principal assignments of error.first,oldendorff argues that the district court erred in denying the motions for judgment as a matter of law.second,oldendorff argues that the district court misinformed the jury about the applicable law,and therefore erred in denying the motion for new trial.we discern no reversible error 
oldendorff first argues that the district court erred in denying its motions for judgment as a matter of law because t he open and obvious nature of the icy deck was established beyond dispute,and oldendorff had a responsibility to warn only of hidden dangers.opening br,those assertions are correct statements of the law,as far as they go.the problem for oldendorff is that its liability does not depend on the duty to warn rather,as the district court repeatedly and correctly indicated,this is a simple case of primary negligence.
section b of the act permits a longshoreman to seek damages in a negligence action against the owner of the vessel on which he was injured.howlett birkdale shipping.the act does not,however,specify the acts or omissions of the vessel that constitute negligence rather,the contours of a vessel duty to longshoremen have been resolved through the application of accepted principles of tort law and the ordinary process of litigation.howlett,at internal quotation marks omitted.in scindia steam navigation,de los santos scindia,the supreme court outlined the three general duties shipowners owe to longshoremen.id.at citing scindia.
the first,which courts have come to call the turnover duty,relates to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations.the second duty,applicable once stevedoring operations have begun,provides that a shipowner must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to longshoremen in areas that remain under the active control of the vessel.the third duty,called the duty to intervene,concerns the vessel obligations with regard to cargo operations in areas under the principal control of the independent stevedore.
id.internal citations omitted citing scindia,at.here,only the turnover duty is at issue.
the turnover duty has two components.lincoln reksten,cir.
the first involves the shipowner duty with respect to the ship gear,equipment,tools,and work space that the stevedore will utilize during its operations.the shipowner must at least exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.
id.alteration in original emphasis added quoting scindia,at.as a corollary to this initial turnover duty,the shipowner must 
warn the stevedore of any hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment that are known to the vessel or should be known to it in the exercise of reasonable care,that would likely be encountered by the stevedore in the course of his cargo operations and that are not known by the stevedore and would not be obvious to or anticipated by him if reasonably competent in the performance of his work.
id.emphasis added quoting scindia,at.the duty to warn attaches only to latent hazards,id.quoting howlett,at i f a defect is open and obvious and the stevedore should be able to conduct its operations around it safely,the shipowner does not violate the duty to warn,id.
in denying oldendorff judgment as a matter of law,the district court reasoned that t he validity of the open and obvious rule or its applicability to ice on the deck under general circumstances was never in dispute.bunn,wl,at emphasis added.
what was in dispute was whether fediv voluntarily assumed the responsibility for salting and sanding the ice in the places where he knew cnx personnel would be working.
id.the court further reasoned that,while ice on the deck may have be en open and obvious,it was not obvious that the ship owner would promise to take care of the hazard,and then not do so.id.
w hen a ship owner voluntarily and affirmatively undertakes to remedy an unsafe condition,but fails to do so,liability can attach to the ship owner thus,there was no question that the central determination regarding liability to be reached at trial was whether fediv had promised to clear those portions of the deck where those unloading the vessel would need to traverse.
id.at.because the jury could reasonably credit white testimony that fediv had promised to treat ice leading to and around the cargo holds,the court concluded that the jury could reasonably find oldendorff liable for affirmatively undertaking,and failing,to remedy the unsafe condition.id.at.that is,the jury could reasonably find oldendorff liable for simple negligence.
we find no error in the district court reasoning.several other circuits have long held that a shipowner may be liable under the act for promising,yet failing,to remedy a dangerous condition that injures a longshoreman.see lieggi maritime of the philippines,cir affirming a judgment against a shipowner whose agent had affirmatively undert aken,but failed,to remove wire and grease spots that caused a longshoreman injuries because,by making this affirmative undertaking,the owner had eliminated any possible reasonable basis for relying on the stevedore to correct the hazardous condition bueno united states,cir finding that a shipowner may be liable for a longshoreman injury aboard the ship when it voluntarily undert akes to check the safety of the vessel on a regular basis webster moolchand,sethia liners,cir affirming a jury finding of liability against a shipowner because there was evidence that the winch that injured the longshoreman was not operating properly,that this was brought to the crew attention,and that their repair efforts failed 
holding a shipowner liable for promising,but failing,to remedy a dangerous condition comports with accepted principles of tort law,which inform a shipowner duties under the act.howlett,at these principles include the general rule that undertakings can create a duty of care.dan dobbs,paul hayden ellen bublick,dobbs law of torts ed noting that one who voluntarily assumes a duty must then perform that duty with reasonable care.an undertaking in this sense is a kind of explicit or implicit promise,or at least a commitment,conveyed in words or in conduct.id.footnote omitted.
the general rule is that the defendant is under a duty to perform undertakings made for safety purposes and is liable for physical harm he causes the plaintiff by negligently performing or quitting performance once it has begun.
id.at.accord dalldorf higgerson buchanan,cir a nyone who does an affirmative act is under a duty to others to exercise the care of a reasonable man to protect them against an unreasonable risk of harm to them arising out of the act.internal quotation marks omitted.because the credible evidence showed that fediv promised to treat the ice but failed to do so,the jury reasonably concluded that fediv had failed to exercise due care.
holding a shipowner liable for promising,yet failing,to remedy a hazard also comports with a principle of the turnover duty the scope of that duty depends on the circumstances of each particular case.see lincoln,at noting that a shipowner must exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship in a reasonably safe condition emphasis added.when the circumstances include a promise to remedy a dangerous situation,the shipowner may fail to exercise reasonable care if it does not fulfill its promise here,the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to bunn established that fediv promised to treat the ice,and failed to do so perhaps because he had a limited supply of salt,see supra,at.these circumstances provide a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for holding oldendorff liable for bunn injuries.
apart from the fact that the jury verdict permissibly rested on a finding of simple negligence,oldendorff argument that the ice was open and obvious conveniently overlooks the fact that the presence of untreated ice was assuredly not open and obvious,and betrays the company misplaced,narrow view of the turnover duty that a shipowner generally need not warn of open and obvious dangers does not negate the shipowner duty to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to ensure that the ship is in a reasonably safe condition.lincoln,at quoting scindia,at.after all,the duty to warn is a mere corollary to the turnover duty,not the sole manner of measuring the reasonableness of a shipowner actions upon turnover.see id.quoting scindia,at.in other words,failure to warn of a latent hazard is but one way a shipowner may violate its turnover duty promising,but failing,to remedy a dangerous condition may also establish a shipowner failure to exercise ordinary care.
in any case,imposing liability on a shipowner that promises,but fails,to remedy a dangerous condition,and then fails to warn of its own failure,is not inconsistent with our prior cases on the open and obvious rule.although a shipowner need not warn of hazards that would be obvious to or anticipated by a stevedore,lincoln,at quoting scindia,at,a reasonably competent stevedore has no reason to anticipate a hazard that the shipowner has promised to remedy but fails,without warning,to do so here,for instance,the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to bunn established that fediv promised to treat the ice accordingly,a jury could find that neither cnx the stevedore nor bunn the longshoreman had reason to anticipate untreated ice aboard the ship,even though one might otherwise have expected such a hazard following a winter storm 
we are not persuaded by oldendorff argument that,regardless of fediv promise to treat the ice,the untreated ice remained an open and obvious condition as a matter of law,absolving it of liability,even without fediv communicating the presence of the untreated ice to the stevedore 
moreover,a shipowner is absolved of its duty to warn only if the condition is both open and obvious and the stevedore employee is able to conduct operations around the hazard safely.lincoln,at citing bonds mortensen lange,cir the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to bunn,showed that oldendorff breached its duty to warn of the ice near the number three hatch because it was impossible for bunn to safely navigate around the untreated ice to perform the cargo loading operations.see,moxey testimony that the area around hatch number three was so icy that it was unsafe to complete operations 
we emphasize that our discussion of the duty to warn is merely dictum.
for all these reasons,we are not persuaded that the jury lacked a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for its verdict,gregg,at,and,thus,we conclude that the district court did not err in its denial of the motions for judgment as a matter of law.
before moving on to consider oldendorff second issue on appeal,we feel it appropriate to offer a few respectful responses to our good friend in dissent.
our colleague laments that 
the focus of the parties on the shipowner promise,rather than the character of the icy conditions,and the alternatives bunn had in facing those conditions,left the jury with insufficient evidence to find oldendorff breached its turnover duty.
post,at.but we need not decide whether there was any justification for the parties focus on the shipowner promise,there clearly was,as the promise was among the circumstances that defined the standard of care.see lincoln,at noting that shipowners must exercise ordinary care under the circumstances.moreover,the parties to a lawsuit are entitled to frame the issues as each deems best.see,greenlaw united states,in our adversary system,in both civil and criminal cases,in the first instance and on appeal,we follow the principle of party presentation.that is,we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present t he parties know what is best for them,and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.internal quotation marks omitted.the problem for oldendorff one from which it can not be rescued at this that it has elected to litigate this case solely on the theory that it did not breach the duty to warn,that is,that oldendorff owed no duty to warn of untreated ice after having promised,hours before actual turnover of the vessel for loading,to treat the ice and thereby render the areas around and abutting the holds safe.although we have offered up plenty of dicta to question the legal correctness of that assertion,our affirmance of the judgment is based not on the duty to warn but on the more general turnover duty of safe condition.that is,we conclude that the district court did not err in treating the breach of oldendorff promise,under the circumstances,as a failure to exercise reasonable care in executing oldendorff more general turnover duty.in short,the evidence supported the jury finding of simple negligence.
adopting oldendorff misguided view that the lawsuit implicates only the duty to warn,the dissent asserts that the center of our disagreement is the question of whether a shipowner unfulfilled promise to remedy an open and obvious hazard affects its turnover duty.post,at.this characterization misses the mark,not only for the reasons articulated above but because it wrongly assumes that the hazard created by the presence of ice on the deck and around the hatches remained precisely the same after fediv promise to treat it as it was before he made and then breached his promise perfectly open and obvious.see,post,at reasoning that a s long as an unremedied hazard remains open and obvious,a shipowner liability is thus extremely limited emphasis added.for the reasons stated above,the risk of injury from the untreated ice was decidedly not open and obvious after fediv made and then breached his promise to treat it.we agree to disagree on that score 
our dissenting colleague insists that a shipowner turnover duty is narrow,see,post,at,and that stevedores and longshoremen bear the primary burden for ensuring safe working conditions for longshoremen,see,post at observing that a shipowner can,ordinarily,reasonably rely on the stevedore and longshoremen to notice obvious hazards and to take steps consistent with their expertise to avoid those hazards where practical to do so alterations in original quoting kirsch plovidba,cir.indeed,the dissent suggests that bunn could have prevented his injury by,inter alia,clear ing the ice himself.post,at.but that,of course,would have required bunn to know about the untreated ice,which he discovered only upon taking a few steps and immediately falling.moreover,the evidence at trial overwhelmingly established and the jury was entitled to find that the responsibility for removing ice aboard a ship customarily rests with the shipowner.see supra.as the dissent concedes,see post,at,custom,like any other circumstance surrounding an accident,may inform a shipowner duties to longshoremen and,of course,any negligence on the part of a stevedore here,cnx,acting through its agent white does not absolve a shipowner such as oldendorff of its own duty of care.see,woodruff united states,cir noting that a shipowner will be liable for the full extent of a longshoreman injuries notwithstanding proof of concurrent negligence contributing to the injury on the part of the stevedore,diminished only by the longshoreman contributory negligence.citing edmonds compagnie generale transatlantique.
for the reasons set forth,we think to say the turnover duty is narrow is to speak descriptively,not prescriptively we do not believe the supreme court has built the kind of impenetrable silos of theories cabining shipowner negligence with the rigidity that the dissent believes exist.if,indeed,that is the import of the rule adopted by the third,fifth,and ninth circuits,as the dissent reliance on their precedents suggests,we choose a different path.
in any event,distilled to its essence,the dissent real concern seems to rest on its unstated belief that the jury should have found bunn percent at fault rather than merely the percent the jury did find.see post,at suggesting that bunn shirk ed his duty to act with reasonable care but see supra.but whether bunn failure to exercise reasonable care for his own safety constituted the sole proximate cause of his injuries the crux of the dissent is not presented as an issue in this case.
finally,we confess we find somewhat puzzling the dissent assertion that the proper outcome is neither affirmance nor judgment for oldendorff as a matter of law,but rather,a new trial or other proceedings.post,at.yet our good friend fails to explain what such proceedings would accomplish.oldendorff has not,for example,challenged the sufficiency of the verdict on the grounds that the district court allowed the jury to consider unreliable,and therefore,inadmissible evidence.see,weisgram marley.nor has bunn,as appellee,asked for a new trial if we find the district court erred in denying oldendorff motions for judgment as a matter of law.see.e neely martin elby constr,observing that a may be entitled to a new trial if t he erroneous exclusion of evidence would have strengthened his case or the trial court itself caused the insufficiency in the case by erroneously placing too high a burden of proof on him at trial,cited post,at.the task before us,then,is quite simple,and requires no further proceedings we need only decide whether a jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to bunn,could have properly reached the conclusion reached by this jury.baynard malone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons stated above,we conclude that the answer is yes,and affirm the denial of oldendorff motions for judgment as a matter of law.
finally,oldendorff argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for a new trial because the court refusal to give the company requested open and obvious instruction deprived the jury of a full and accurate understanding of the law,and deprived oldendorff of the opportunity to argue effectively the significance of the open and obvious defense.opening br.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a motion for new trial,and will not reverse such a decision save in the most exceptional circumstances.figg schroeder,cir internal quotation marks omitted similarly,w e review a trial court jury instructions for abuse of discretion,keeping in mind that a trial court has broad discretion in framing its instructions to a jury.volvo trademark holding aktiebolaget clark mach,cir.instructions will be considered adequate if construed as a whole,and in light of the whole record,they adequately informed the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing the jury to the prejudice of the existing party.king mcmillan,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.even if a jury was erroneously instructed,however,we will not set aside a resulting verdict unless the erroneous instruction seriously prejudiced the challenging party case.coll.loan slm,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
preliminarily,we hold that oldendorff has failed to preserve a challenge to the jury instructions,as the company has provided no record of an objection to the district court.see.c a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.when challenging instructions on appeal,a party must furnish the court of appeals with so much of the record of the proceedings below as is necessary to enable informed appellate review.faigin kelly,cir finding that appellant fail ure to supply a transcript of the rule sidebar conference gave rise to a presumption that none of his challenges to the jury instructions were properly preserved,cited in belk,meyer,cir finding that appellant had waived its challenge to any jury instructions because it had failed,inter alia,to provide a record citation to where it objected to any given or omitted jury instruction.see also maltby winston,cir finding that the appellant had failed to preserve his challenge to jury instructions because the instruction conference in the district court was not memorialized in the record,and the appellant had not otherwise ma d e a sufficient record.
here,oldendorff has provided only its requested instructions,and those that the court ultimately gave the jury.importantly,the mere tendering of a proposed instruction will not preserve error for appeal.kevin,et,fed.jury practice instructions ed.see also city of richmond,madison mgmt,cir where a party who has violated rule can point to nothing more than the court denial of a requested instruction,a reading of rule loose enough to permit preservation of the point would effectively delete rule insofar as allegations of error in the failure to give an instruction are concerned.
in any event,even were we to reach the issue,we would conclude it is meritless.for the reasons stated above,see supra part,the court properly informed the jury that a shipowner may be liable for injury resulting directly from an unsafe condition on the ship of which it was aware and which it voluntarily agreed and undertook to remedy,but failed to do so.that a shipowner generally need not warn of an open and obvious hazard does not absolve the shipowner of its more general duty to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to ensure that the ship is in a reasonably safe condition.lincoln,at quoting scindia,at.thus,we can not see how oldendorff was prejudiced,let alone seriously prejudiced,by the absence of any specific instruction on the open and obvious defense.coll.loan,at.
moreover,oldendorff proposed instruction in the absence of any agreement,the ship is not responsible for any open and obvious condition.was an incomplete statement of the law in any event.in fact,a shipowner may still be liable for failing to warn of an open and obvious hazard if a stevedore employee would not be able to work around the hazard.lincoln,at.accordingly,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of the motion for a new trial.
like ships passing in the night,plaintiff bunn,the district court,and the jury,on the one hand,understood this case was principally one of simple negligence,whereas on the other hand,oldendorff has insisted,here to the very end,that it was solely a case.for the reasons set forth herein,we reject oldendorff assertion and therefore affirm the judgment.
with respect,i dissent.in my view,the focus of the parties on the shipowner promise,rather than the character of the icy conditions,and the alternatives bunn had in facing those conditions,left the jury with insufficient evidence to find oldendorff breached its turnover duty 
at the center of my disagreement with the majority is the question of whether a shipowner unfulfilled promise to remedy an open and obvious hazard affects its turnover duty.
it is well established that b of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act imposes upon a shipowner a narrow turnover duty.see scindia steam navigation de los santos,kirksey tonghai,cir.this duty relates to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations and has two components.lincoln reksten,cir.
first,a shipowner must exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.scindia,at emphasis added.this duty is known as the turnover duty of safe condition.see,ludwig pan ocean shipping,cir 
as a corollary to the turnover duty of safe condition,a shipowner must also 
warn the stevedore of any hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment that are known to the vessel or should be known to it in the exercise of reasonable care,that would likely be encountered by the stevedore in the course of his cargo operations and that are not known by the stevedore and would not be obvious to or anticipated by him if reasonably competent in the performance of his work.
scindia,at emphasis added.this duty is known as the turnover duty to warn.see howlett birkdale shipping co.
thus,b imposes on a shipowner duties at turnover that are very narrow.see kirsch plovidba,cir t he shipowner duty is only to provide a workplace where skilled longshore workers can operate safely.see also scindia,at.the turnover duty of safe condition merely requires that a shipowner exercise ordinary care,under the circumstances,to provide an expert and experienced stevedore or longshoreman,who exercises reasonable care,the ability to carry out its operations with reasonable safety.scindia,at.the corollary turnover duty to warn requires only that a shipowner exercise ordinary care to provide to a reasonably competent stevedore or longshoreman notice of hazards.id.at.
indeed,the openness and obviousness of a hazard to a stevedore provides a shipowner with a complete defense to a turnover duty to warn claim,no matter how unreasonably dangerous the hazard.see kirksey,at.the majority errs in asserting that a shipowner has a duty to warn a stevedore of even an open and obvious hazard if the stevedore is un able to conduct operations around the hazard safely.ante at.in fact,the supreme court has explicitly rejected this view of the turnover duty to warn 
the duty attaches only to latent hazards,defined as hazards that are not known to the stevedore and that would be neither obvious to nor anticipated by a skilled stevedore in the competent performance of its work.
howlett,at see also ludwig,at the shipowner had no duty to warn ludwig the longshoreman of the hazard.it was obvious,so its mere presence carried a warning.
of course,the openness and obviousness of a hazard does not absolve the shipowner of its turnover duty of safe condition.see manuel cameron offshore boats,cir kirsch,at ludwig,at.but when a hazard is open and obvious,the shipowner has a diminished turnover duty of safe condition.see,kirksey,at hill reederei laeisz,rostock,cir keller united states,cir pimental ltd can.pac.bul,cir ludwig,at.
as the third circuit has explained,a shipowner may be negligent for failing to eliminate an open and obvious hazard that it could have eliminated only when it should have expected that an expert stevedore or longshoreman could not or would not avoid the hazard and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely.kirsch,at emphasis added.
this standard recognizes that a shipowner can,ordinarily,reasonably rely on the stevedore and longshoremen to notice obvious hazards and to take steps consistent with their expertise to avoid those hazards where practical to do so.id.at see also howlett,at ludwig,at an expert and experienced longshoreman can avoid open and obvious hazards in a number of ways,for example by fixing the hazard himself,see albergo hellenic lines,cir,or completing operations while avoiding the hazard,see bjaranson botelho shipping,manila,cir morris compagnie.des chargeurs reunis,cir.so long as an expert longshoreman has available such an option,a shipowner can not be held liable for a breach of its turnover duty of safe condition.rather,the shipowner can reasonably rely on the longshoreman to exercise an alternative option.
the majority largely ignores the above principles.instead,relying primarily on lieggi maritime of philippines,cir and two similar active operations duty cases,the majority holds that a shipowner may be liable under the act for promising,yet failing,to remedy a dangerous condition that injures a longshoreman.ante at the case at hand,however,does not concern the active operations duty.and the logic of the active operations duty does not extend to the turnover duty context.
contrary to the majority suggestion,a stark contrast exists between the turnover duty and the active operations duty.see davis portline transportes.internacional,cir.the turnover duty covers the shipowner conduct before the stevedore cargo operations have begun,while the active operations duty covers a shipowner conduct after cargo operations have begun in those areas remaining under control of the shipowner.see scindia,at davis,at.
the active operations duty does not rest on whether an expert stevedore and its expert longshoremen could have completed operations with reasonable safety.instead,that duty rests on whether a shipowner negligently exposes longshoremen to any hazards even avoidable ones in areas under the shipowner control during stevedoring operations.see serbin bora,cir.for this reason,the obviousness of a hazard does not presumptively bar recovery under an active operations duty claim.id.at pimental,at.
but the obviousness of a hazard does presumptively bar recovery under a turnover duty claim.see kirksey,at kirsch,at pimental,at ludwig,at.and a shipowner promise to remedy an open and obvious hazard does not itself affect the openness and obviousness of the hazard at turnover.rather,a shipowner can reasonably rely on an expert stevedore and its expert longshoremen to notice and avoid an open and obvious hazard.see kirksey,at kirsch,at 
moreover,a shipowner promise to remedy a hazard does not create a duty actionable under b.this is so because in the absence of a contract provision,positive law,or custom to the contrary,all b claims must fall under one of the duties identified by the supreme court in scindia.see at kirsch,at.an expert and experienced longshoreman can not,by the mere virtue of a shipowner promise,shirk his duty to act with reasonable care in the face of an open and obvious hazard.holding otherwise raises a promise to the level of a contract,and impermissibly shifts responsibility for longshoreman safety from stevedore and the longshoreman himself to shipowner.
as long as an unremedied hazard remains open and obvious,a shipowner liability to an injured longshoreman is thus extremely limited.absent a contract provision,statute,regulation,or custom to the contrary,scindia,at,the shipowner is liable only to the extent it should have expected that an expert stevedore or longshoreman could not or would not avoid the hazard and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely,kirsch,at.
considering the evidence in the light most favorable to bunn,and with these legal principles in mind,i can not agree with the majority disposition of this appeal.
i n many cases the obviousness of a hazard will be a jury question,kirsch,at,and if that were the situation here,i would join the majority in sustaining the jury verdict.but,both before this court and in the district court,bunn expressly conceded that the condition of the deck was open and obvious.resp.br.at see also bunn oldendorff carriers gmbh,cv wmn,ecf,at.this concession took this important question out of the hands of the jury at trial,and binds us as we consider the proper application of the law on appeal.
given this concession,the only remaining question is whether the evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that the shipowner,oldendorff,violated either component of its turnover duty by turning over the ship with open and obvious icy conditions.it seems to me that the answer to that question is certainly no.
the parties focus on the turnover duty to warn and the majority extensively discusses that duty,sometimes suggesting that oldendorff violated it.see ante at.but the majority ultimately characterizes this discussion as plenty of dicta,and expressly disavows it as a basis of its holding.the majority explains that its affirmance of the judgment is based not on the duty to warn but on the more general turnover duty of safe condition.ante at emphasis original see also ante at l iability does not depend on the duty to warn.this disavowal seems appropriate and inevitable given the clear directive of howlett that the duty to warn attaches only to latent not obvious hazards.at emphasis added.
however,affirmance on the basis of the turnover duty of safe condition the sole basis for the majority holding is not possible because no evidence at trial established a violation of this duty.that is,the jury had insufficient evidence to find that the shipowner,oldendorff,should have expected that an expert longshoreman could not or would not avoid the hazard here,icy conditions near hold three and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely.kirsch,at 
indeed,the only relevant evidence presented to the jury on this critical point suggests that an expert longshoreman,in bunn position,might have avoided this open and obvious hazard in several ways.he might have avoided the icy condition near hold three altogether by loading another hold or undertaking another task.burchett cargill,cir bjaranson,at.alternatively,he might have cleared the ice himself,see pimental,at albergo,at,or enlisted a crew member to do so,see kirsch,at.of course,these options and others may have been unavailable to bunn,but the record provides no evidence to this effect.
nor does the record contain any evidence that bunn was required to finish the job quickly,making him unable to avoid the hazard.see teply mobil oil,cir.to the contrary,bunn shift supervisor provided unrebutted testimony that if a longshoreman encounters a hazardous condition on a ship h e is empowered to shut the operation down.ja.and another longshoreman,moxey,did shut down operations when the icy conditions around hold three remained hazardous several hours after bunn fall.ja 
implicit in the majority holding may be the view that an expert and experienced longshoreman would be unable to distinguish between treated and untreated ice and so have no reason to pursue another option.this may be so,but the record contains no evidence on this point either.
of course,as the majority notes,bunn argues in his briefs that the lack of treatment with sand and salt in the area where he was obliged to work was not open and obvious.see,resp.br.at.no evidence,however,supports this argument.rather,at trial,bunn himself testified that in areas of the ship he could distinguish between treated and untreated portions of the deck.ja.only in the dark,very poor ly lit area around hold three was bunn unable to tell whether the ice had been treated.ja.bunn own testimony therefore supports just one conclusion that his failure to notice the icy conditions was solely because it was dark,not because treated and untreated ice are indistinguishable.see resp.br.at conceding that bunn had testified that the darkness in the area around hatch prevented him from discovering that the ice in that area had not been treated.
but to the extent that darkness constitutes a hazard,it is assuredly obvious,and easily remedied by an expert longshoreman or indeed anyone with a flashlight.see,harris marine,chapman bizet shipping,landsem isuzu motors,aff,cir table.therefore,darkness provides no basis for a shipowner liability under its turnover duties.nor can darkness render an obvious hazard latent.harris.at chapman.at.otherwise the scope of a shipowner turnover duties on identically hazardous ships could differ depending solely on the time of day when the turnover occurred 
in response to this record evidence and these legal principles,the majority is left to contend that not just poor lighting but also the unfulfilled promise and a purported custom of shipowners removing onboard ice constitute the totality of the circumstances that renders oldendorff liable.ante at emphasis in original.but,as explained above,like poor lighting,an unfulfilled promise does not render an otherwise obvious hazard latent.see ante at.and bunn has never even argued that custom rather than the turnover duty forms the basis for his claim.see ante at.thus,the record provides no support for the view that the totality of these circumstances barred oldendorff from reasonably relying on an expert longshoreman in bunn position to notice and avoid the obvious icy conditions.see kirksey,at kirsch,at 
in sum,the record is bereft of evidence that oldendorff should have expected that an expert longshoreman could not or would not avoid the hazard here,icy conditions and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely,kirsch,at,and contains considerable evidence suggesting the contrary.accordingly,the jury lacked an evidentiary basis to find that oldendorff breached its turnover duty of safe condition.
this is a complex case,made only more so by the parties failure to develop facts concerning the character of the icy conditions and the alternatives bunn had in facing those conditions.on the one hand,the record does not provide a legally sufficient evidentiary basis from which a jury could find that oldendorff breached its turnover duty.on the other hand,the record does not clearly foreclose oldendorff possible liability for violating its turnover duty.rather,the record is simply inadequate to allow a jury to resolve one way or the other the dispositive legal question in the case whether an expert longshoreman could not or would not avoid the hazard and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely.kirsch,at.
the supreme court has recognized that in limited circumstances where the court of appeals sets aside the jury verdict because the evidence was insufficient to send the case to the jury,as i believe it was here,it is not so clear that the litigation should be terminated.neely martin eby const.in my view,this is such a case.accordingly,i would vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for a new trial or other proceedings consistent with this opinion.see.b weisgram marley,neely,at.
fediv,the chief officer,testified that the ship deck was icy but he denied that he and white discussed using salt and sand to treat the ice.of course,the jury was entitled to reject fediv testimony and credit white,as it did.
see mot.for as a matter of law,ecf,bunn oldendorff carriers gmbh,cv wmn.may.the joint appendix includes neither a complete trial transcript nor excerpts of the oral motions and the district court reasons for denying them.accordingly,we infer that information from the court memorandum opinion denying oldendorff motion for judgment as a matter of law.
oldendorff also argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment made at the conclusion of discovery because,as a matter of law,the icy condition of the ship was open and obvious,and therefore oldendorff had no duty to warn of the danger the same argument made at and after trial.although neither party has addressed the propriety of oldendorff purported appeal of the summary judgment ruling,it is well settled that we will not review,under any standard,the pretrial denial of a motion for summary judgment after a full trial and final judgment on the merits.varghese honeywell int l,cir quoting chesapeake paper prods.stone webster eng g,cir.there is no reason to deviate from that rule here.
our applicable standard of review in these circumstances is we review the denial of a rule b motion de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,and will affirm the denial of such a motion unless the jury lacked a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for its verdict.first union commercial gatx capital,cir.gregg ham,cir.
