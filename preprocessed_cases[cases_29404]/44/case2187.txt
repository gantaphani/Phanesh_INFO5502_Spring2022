carmen and antonio lebron sued the united states individually and as next friends of their daughter,karina,under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,et,for damages suffered as a result of an army doctor medical malpractice at fort hood,texas.the doctor negligent delivery of karina left her with severe,permanent brain damage.the government admitted liability but contested damages.after a bench trial,the district court awarded the plaintiffs in all for karina each to carmen and antonio for medical and attendant care for karina until her age of majority an additional to carmen and an additional to antonio the court also awarded the plaintiffs costs,including fees for services rendered by karina lebron guardian ad litem gal.
the government appeals on three grounds,contending that the maximum recovery rule requires a reduction of million in certain intangible damages awarded to the three plaintiffs that because the million in damages awarded to karina exceeds the million specified in the amended administrative claim that the lebrons filed on her behalf,the million should be reduced to million and that the cost of certain legal services provided by the gal,who is an attorney,should have been deducted from karina recovery and should not have been taxed as costs to be paid by the government.the government does not contest any other damages awards.
we conclude as follows.the maximum recovery rule requires a reduction in the awards contested by the government,and a remand is necessary to clarify whether portions of karina medical expenses award are duplicative.because the lebrons have not met the requirements of b for obtaining damages exceeding the amount stated in the administrative claim,karina can not recover more than million.the district court erred in failing to determine what part of the services rendered by the gal are legal fees to be awarded out of the recovery.on remand,the court must make this determination.
whether the maximum recovery rule requires a reduction of million in certain intangible 
a district court damages award is a finding of fact,which this court reviews for excessiveness using the clear error standard.douglass delta air lines,cir.put otherwise,w e do not reverse a verdict for excessiveness except on the strongest of showings,but when a jury award exceeds the bounds of reasonable recovery,we must suggest a remittitur ourselves or direct the district court to do so.dixon int l harvester,cir.w hen this court is left with the perception that the verdict is clearly excessive,deference must be abandoned.eiland westinghouse,cir.this court power to grant a remittitur of excessive damages is the same as the district court.dixon,id.
w e apply the loosely defined maximum recovery rule when deciding whether a remittitur is in order.this rule essentially provides that we will decline to reduce damages where the amount awarded is not disproportionate to at least one factually similar case from the relevant jurisdiction.douglass,at emphasis in original the rule applies regardless of whether the award was made by a jury.id.at.the rule does not necessarily limit an award to the highest amount previously recognized in the state indeed,the rule does not become operative unless the award exceeds of the highest previous recovery in the relevant jurisdiction for a factually similar case.id.at.because the facts of each case are different,prior damages awards are not always controlling a departure from prior awards is merited if unique facts are present that are not reflected within the controlling caselaw.id.at.see wheat united states,cir wakefield united states,cir.
the district court applied the maximum recovery rule in this case by relying on a number of state and federal cases applying texas law in which larger aggregate sums were awarded than the total amount that the court decided to award in this case none of these awards is officially reported,except for one that was reversed on appeal in a reported decision,on which we therefore do not rely.the same is true of some of the decisions cited by the plaintiffs we decline to use unreported decisions as benchmarks for this purpose.unreported decisions generally lack precedential value.see.cir.exxon,banque de paris et des,cir under texas law an unreported opinion is not precedential.our court has not previously considered unreported decisions when invoking the maximum recovery rule.see in re air crash disaster near new orleans,on july,cir citing highest reported awards in relevant jurisdiction hansen prods,cir award was substantially greater than any we have discovered in other reported cases emphasis added.and from a practical standpoint,the comparability of unreported decisions is hard to judge from the records available.the lebrons offer a mix of summary reports of verdicts from an unofficial publication,the blue sheet of texas,and attorney affidavits.use of such hearsay would create more problems than it would solve by provoking irrelevant disputes over the comparability of unreported decisions.
the government argues for two particular applications of the maximum recovery rule.we address them in turn.
award to parents for loss of consortium 
first,the government argues that the court award to carmen and antonio lebron for loss of consortium should be reduced from million million each to million million each.in ingraham united states,cir,an ftca case that arose in texas,a parent was awarded for loss of society and other losses arising from severe brain injuries suffered by her child.this court rejected the government argument that the award was so excessive as to warrant correction on appeal.id.at.this is the highest award we have found in a reported case for loss of consortium awarded to a parent for injuries to his or her child.wellborn sears,roebuck,cir rejecting challenge to million total award to parent under texas law,arising from death of child in accident,where award included award for loss of companionship and society.
the government,treating douglass as if that case formulated a rigid cap on application of the maximum recovery rule,suggests we add to the ingraham award for each parent.this would result in million to each parent.we disagree with the government characterization of douglass because it framed a guideline for invoking rather than a formula for capping recoveries under the rule.douglass,at,the rule does not become operative unless the award exceeds of the highest previous recovery in the state emphasis added.nevertheless,the government concession is generous,and we agree that the lebrons award is too high.we adopt the government suggestion to reduce the lebrons total loss of consortium award to million 
awards to karina for various intangible injuries 
second,the government argues,relying on paul med.ctr.cecil,and pipgras hart.worth,that the court award to karina lebron for intangible injuries should be reduced from million to.in cecil,a case involving serious brain injuries caused to an infant during his delivery,the jury awarded the plaintiffs for past physical pain and mental anguish,for future physical pain and mental anguish,for past physical impairment,and for future physical impairment in all for intangible damages.at.in pipgras,a case involving seemingly less serious brain injuries to a child,the court rejected challenges to awards of for future physical impairment and for physical pain and mental anguish.at.
the intangible awards in cecil and pipgras are not precisely analogous to the intangible awards in this case they were made for categories of injury that overlap with or otherwise differ from the categories of harm articulated by the trial court here.douglass,at.and in neither cecil nor pipgras is there an award for disfigurement,a category of noneconomic damages that clearly applies to karina.jones stores,cir moreover,the injuries at issue at least in pipgras are significantly less severe than the injuries suffered by karina.with all these qualifications,however,the awards in cecil and pipgras permit some comparison.
the aggregate figure requested by the government is based solely on comparison with cecil and pipgras.a recent texas case,however,supports a higher award and undercuts the governments proposed reduction,though not the general principle of comparison.in roberts williamson,petition for review filed,motion to dismiss denied,the court rejected challenges to awards for the benefit of a child amounting to million in damages for past and future physical impairment,for physical pain and mental anguish,and for from brain injuries analogous to those sustained by karina in this case.in williamson as in this case,the brain injuries were sustained in the first days of the child life.williamson represents by far the highest reported judgment we have found applying texas law to comparable facts.
the intangible damages in williamson are many times as high as those in pipgras and cecil,yet the intangible damages awarded by the district court here outstrip the verdict in williamson by a factor of seven.the purpose of the maximum recovery rule is to bring rough consistency into comparable damages awards.whether karina award is viewed on an comparison of specific noneconomic damages components or on an aggregate basis,it is grossly excessive.horrible as are the facts underlying the judgment,they are not dissimilar to the facts in cecil and williamson,and we find no novel grounds for such a grand departure in the award of damages.douglass,at.while recognizing that a remittitur necessarily involves a subjective component,caldarera eastern airlines,cir,we conclude that a reduction of karina total noneconomic damages award from million to million satisfies the maximum recovery rule.
one additional contention raised by the government requires a response.noting that the district court failed to explain the reasoning for its specific awards,the government argues that the district court noneconomic damages award may have been duplicative of its medical expenses award.in sosa lago izabal,cir,this court concluded that to the extent that certain rehabilitative items were not medical expenses but devices to alleviate physical suffering or mental anguish,they duplicated a separate award for pain and suffering,bodily injury,mental anguish,and loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life.id this court remanded for a determination of which items were compensable medical expenses and which duplicated the award for pain and suffering.see id.
as in sosa,we can not determine from the trial court opinion in this case whether part of the medical expense award may duplicate part of the awards for intangible harms.for instance,the former award included equestrian and aquatic therapy,which the court described in terms suggesting that it was at least in part compensating for the emotional harms caused by the defendant negligence.we therefore remand for a determination of which items were compensable medical expenses and which duplicated the intangible awards.
if the district court concludes on remand that the medical expense award and intangible injuries awards are not duplicative,then our remittitur will remain intact.if the district court concludes that the awards are duplicative,it must make appropriate reductions in the awards.
whether ftca b requires that the million award to karina lebron be reduced to the million sought in her administrative claim 
in may,the lebrons filed an administrative claim seeking million on behalf of karina.in april,they filed an amended administrative claim for karina seeking million.in their original complaint,filed in may,they sought an unspecified amount.after the army denied the administrative claim,they moved in february to amend their complaint to seek million for karina.the united states opposed the motion,arguing that the lebrons had not met the standard set out in b,which provides that an ftca action 
shall not be instituted for any sum in excess of the amount of the claim presented to the federal agency,except where the increased amount is based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time of presenting the claim to the federal agency,or upon allegation and of proof of intervening facts,relating to the amount of the claim.
the district court granted the lebrons motion.the court ultimately awarded karina about million.
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred in allowing the lebrons to seek damages in excess of the million specified in her amended administrative claim.in light of b,this contention is correct.karina award can be no more than million 
the plaintiff in an ftca suit who seeks to exceed his administrative claim has the burden to show that the addition is based on newly discovered evidence or intervening facts within the meaning of b.see,michels united states,cir spivey united states,cir.to satisfy this burden,the plaintiff must show that the evidence was not reasonably capable of detection at the time the administrative claim was filed.low united states,cir.in other words,the information must not have been discoverable through the exercise of reasonable diligence.id.
in low,the plaintiff sought in her administrative claim for injuries done to her son brian during childbirth.in court,she later sought million for the same injuries.the district court awarded the plaintiff million,asserting that the plaintiff had presented newly discovered evidence or intervening facts under b concerning the extent of brian condition,the prospects for his recovery,the limited extent of any recovery,and his life expectancy.id.at.this court disagreed with the district court reading of the requirements of b.we concluded that the evidence cited by the district court did not meet these requirements because it went only to the precision with which the severity of brian injury could have been known.
the new evidence does not alter the fact that when the administrative claim was filed low already knew that brian had cerebral palsy,a seizure disorder,and was blind,deaf,and mentally retarded.there is no evidence that these conditions became worse or that other conditions developed after the claim was filed this is not a case in which the claimant did not know or reasonably could not have known the basic severity of brian handicap it was indubitably of grave severity and of i f the exact nature,extent and duration of each recognized disability must be known before b will be given effect,that section will be rendered useless and the government will be unable to evaluate any claim made against it without the threat that,if it does not settle,its liability may increase substantially.such matters are of their nature dubious,partaking of the uncertainties of life itself in which unexpected deaths and equally unexpected recoveries occur.
id.at.this court remanded for a reduction of the damages award to million.
low makes clear that new information can not surmount the bar created by b if the information merely concerns the precision with which the nature,extent,or duration of a claimant condition can be known.information can be newly discovered evidence or an intervening fact,however,if it sheds new light on the basic severity of the claimant is,if it materially differs from the prognosis of which the claimant knew or could reasonably have known when the claim was filed.see,fraysier united states,cir,cited in low,at.requiring the plaintiff to guard against a scenario in preparing his claim gives the government full notice of its maximum potential liability in the case.this encourages settlement of ftca cases in accordance with the statute purposes.see low,at reilly united states,cir.
in this case,the district court concluded that when the administrative claim was filed,it was impossible to determine the nature and extent of karina injuries because reliable cognitive and tests could not be conducted until karina was four to five years old.the court pointed to evidence that a life care plan could not be drafted for karina until she was about five.citing tests and an examination conducted after the filing of the claim,the court concluded that karina condition was significantly worse than believed when the administrative claim was filed karina needs and the care and treatment she will require will cost nearly twice what was previously expected.it is not j
