we first address the appeal of crown auto,moss,and aaron from the district court denial of their rule motions for judgment as a matter of law.in so doing,we begin with a review of the trial evidence on adkins common law fraud claim,then outline the relevant procedural history of this case and,finally,assess the court rejection of the rule motions.
crown auto operates a used car business in danville,virginia,whose inventory includes wrecked automobiles that have been repaired or rebuilt for resale on july,adkins purchased from crown auto an automobile that she was led to believe was a hyundai tiburon that had undergone minor repairs.her sales contract with crown auto on the tiburon was for including financed through crown auto,plus in taxes and fees.aaron,a salesman for crown auto,assured adkins that the tiburon had sustained cosmetic damage only in a collision.aaron also told adkins that the repairs involved replacing the hatchback,rear bumper,and a rear quarter panel,and then painting the entire vehicle.crown auto title reflected that the tiburon had a single vehicle identification number vin and had been driven a total of miles.
in fact,however,the tiburon had been clipped together from the remnants of two separate wrecked and salvaged vehicles the front half itself useable only after extensive repairs of a tiburon from maryland,with mileage of miles and bearing the vin reflected on the title delivered to adkins and the rear half of a tiburon from texas,with mileage in excess of miles and an entirely different vin in the process of clipping together two salvaged vehicles,the front portion of a salvaged vehicle is welded together at the factory seam with the rear portion of another salvaged vehicle.the title of a clipped car in virginia bears the original vin and total mileage of the front half of the vehicle.to apply for a title on any repaired or rebuilt salvaged vehicle,a form is must be submitted to the virginia department of motor vehicles.the form includes an illustration of a vehicle with twenty numbered areas,with instructions to circle the number of each area that has been repaired,as well as a checklist of the parts replaced or repaired,with a blank space for other parts not listed.
in closing the crown auto sale of the clipped car to adkins,aaron provided her at her request a copy of the form is on the tiburon the is.circled numbers on the is indicated that repairs to the clipped tiburon were not limited to the rear end repairs previously disclosed by aaron,but also included repairs to the vehicle roof,windshield,hood,and front driver side quarter panel and interior.nearby handwritten notations on the is reflected that the tiburon had undergone in repairs these notations included the words paint all.another handwritten notation,in the blank space for other parts replaced or repaired,stated rear clip.id.the is prompted adkins to inquire why everything on the vehicle basically had been circled.id.at.in response,aaron pointed to the notation paint all and explained that the circles merely reflected a paint job.id.at.adkins also asked aaron what the notation rear clip meant aaron responded that rear clip referred to attaching the rear bumper to the quarter panel.assured by aaron that a rear clip was nothing major and no big deal,adkins took him at his word and completed her purchase of the tiburon.id.at 
shortly after buying the tiburon,adkins began experiencing problems with its steering.rebuffed in her efforts to have crown auto make repairs,she sought services elsewhere and learned that the tiburon was in fact a clipped car that had been welded poorly portions of two separate salvaged vehicles.in may,a few days after learning that the tiburon had been clipped,adkins returned to the crown auto dealership and confronted moss,a crown auto manager who had signed the is.adkins attempted to return the tiburon to crown auto,because she did want a car,had been misled into believing that the vehicle had sustained only minor cosmetic damage,and had not known that she was buying a piece of junk.moss and crown auto refused to accept her return of the tiburon,and this lawsuit ensued.
on june,adkins filed suit against five crown auto,moss,and aaron collectively,crown auto in the western district of virginia.by her amended complaint of april,adkins alleged four causes of action,including a claim of actual fraud under virginia common law the fraud claim.the district court possessed supplemental jurisdiction over the fraud claim pursuant to 
in its statement of facts,the amended complaint details adkins purchase of the tiburon,the vehicle history,and crown auto misrepresentations and concealment of the extensive repairs made to it,including the fact that it was a clipped car.see am.compl.for example,the amended complaint alleges that crown auto failed to disclose that the vehicle was in fact two cars cut apart and then poorly welded together,that other severe damage had been done to the car,and that it was not a hyundai tiburon,but partly a and partly a.id.
later,under the heading actual fraud,the amended complaint spells out adkins fraud claim.see am.compl.in pleading the fraud claim,the amended complaint incorporates by reference all preceding allegations including the statement of facts and its assertions with respect to the clipping of the tiburon.see id.the amended complaint makes additional allegations in support of the fraud claim in its paragraphs through,which focus on crown auto false representations and lack of full disclosure regarding the tiburon mileage.among these allegations is the following the paragraph allegation 
in representing that mileage of the whole car was but,and concealing the fact that the rear of the car mileage was considerably higher,defendants made false representations of fact as to the true mileage of the vehicle upon which they knew or should have known that purchasers such as the plaintiff would rely.
id.additionally,the amended complaint asserts,inter alia,that crown auto knowingly and intentionally misrepresented the tiburon mileage with the intent to mislead adkins into purchasing the vehicle,see id,that adkins justifiably relied on the false representations of mileage,which played a material and substantial part in leading her to purchase the vehicle and to pay the price agreed,id.and that,as a result of her reliance on the false representations,she suffered substantial damages and losses,id.the amended complaint seeks,in addition to compensatory damages,an award of punitive damages.see id.
in june of,the district court conducted a trial on the fraud claim before a jury in danville.relying on rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure requiring fraud to be pled with particularity,crown auto sought throughout the trial to limit adkins evidence to the amended complaint allegations under the actual fraud heading excluding the paragraph incorporating by reference all preceding allegations.in particular,crown auto contended that,consistent with its interpretation of the paragraph allegation,adkins should be confined to the theory that the sole misrepresentation on which she relied was that the mileage of the whole car was but,when in truth the rear of the car mileage was considerably higher.am.compl.under crown auto theory,adkins success on the fraud claim depended on proof that she would not have purchased the tiburon had she not been misled about the higher mileage of the vehicle rear half,without regard to the fact that the tiburon was a clipped car the claim was doomed to fail,however,if the evidence established that adkins real concern was the fact that the mileage of the tiburon rear half was simply different whether higher or lower than that of its front half because the vehicle had been clipped.
rather than accepting crown auto theory of the fraud claim,the court permitted adkins to present evidence supporting a broader theory of her claim that she had relied not only on crown auto false representations of the mileage of the tiburon including the concealment of the different mileage of its front and rear ends,but also the interrelated concealment of the fact that the tiburon was a clipped car.the court also allowed adkins to present evidence of other the concealment of the tiburon repair the limited purpose of showing crown auto intent to mislead 
at trial,adkins testified that she would not have purchased the tiburon if she had known that it had been clipped together from portions of two wrecked and salvaged vehicles.her testimony posited several circumstances under which she might have learned the tiburon was a clipped car and refused to consummate the purchase,being informed that the nose of the vehicle was from maryland and its tail was from texas that the front and rear portions had two different vins and,significant to the fraud claim as pled,that the rear end mileage was more than double that of the front end.adkins averred that she absolutely would not have made the purchase if she had been informed by crown auto of the different mileage of the tiburon front half and its rear half.
following the presentation of adkins,crown auto made an oral motion,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,for judgment as a matter of law.in so moving,it relied on the proposition that adkins was limited under the paragraph allegation to the theory of the fraud claim.according to crown auto,the fraud claim was unsustainable because of adkins testimony indicating that she would not have bought the tiburon under any circumstances if she had known it was a clipped car,including the circumstance that the mileage of the rear half was less than that of the front half.in response,adkins pointed out that the mileage differential is one of those pieces of information that would have let her know that the car was clipped,and that what crown auto concealed.the court took crown auto rule a motion under advisement,and the trial proceeded.
at the close of all the evidence,the court conducted a charge conference on the jury instructions and a motion filed by adkins,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,to conform the pleadings to the evidence.in her rule b motion,adkins asserted that several fraud addition to the fraud theory pled in the amended been presented at trial by consent of the parties.these theories were based on,inter alia,misrepresentations and concealment of the separate vins of the tiburon two halves and the repair history of the vehicle front end.most notably,the rule b motion sought to again amend the complaint to allege fraud in the concealment of the fact that the tiburon was a clipped car an allegation that adkins had already insisted and the court had accepted was inextricably intertwined with the issue of the vehicle varying mileage.the court denied the rule b motion because evidence relating to the additional fraud theories had been admitted only over crown auto objection and for the limited purpose of proving its intent to mislead.nevertheless,the court allowed adkins to proceed on her theory of the fraud claim.
the court then instructed the jury on the elements of the fraud claim,which,under virginia law,adkins was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence the court explained to the jury that a n actual fraud is a misrepresentation of a material fact knowingly and intentionally made to mislead another person,which that person relied upon with the result that he was damaged by it.trial tr.vol.iv,june.the court defined reliance as a belief that a representation is true,which causes a person to take action he would not otherwise have taken.id.at.and the court instructed the jury that i f a party conceals a fact that is material to a transaction,knowing that the other party is acting on the assumption that no such fact exists,the concealment is as much of a fraud as if the existence of the fact were expressly denied,or the reverse of it expressly stated.id.at.after deliberating,the jury,on june,returned its verdict awarding adkins in compensatory damages 
following the trial,crown auto filed another motion,under federal rule of civil procedure b,seeking judgment as a matter of law on the fraud claim,relying on the grounds advanced in support of the rule a motion taken under advisement during trial.by memorandum opinion of july,the court denied the rule a and b motions.see adkins crown auto,no,wl.july,the memorandum opinion on july,judgment was entered in favor of adkins.crown auto timely noted an appeal from the judgment,and we possess jurisdiction under.
we review de novo the district court denial of crown auto rule motions.see abt.prods.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.under rule,the issue we must assess is whether there was a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to adkins as the prevailing party,to find for her on the fraud claim.see id.citing.a bryant aiken reg l med.ctrs,cir.and,as with other legal rulings,we review de novo the conclusions of law on which the court denial of judgment as a matter of law was premised.see id.citing benner nationwide mut.ins,cir.
in its memorandum opinion,the district court offered an explicit rejection of the underlying premise of crown auto rule motions that adkins fraud claim must be limited under rule b to crown auto interpretation of the paragraph allegation in the amended complaint,its theory of the claim.as explained in the memorandum opinion,crown auto contended that the actual representing of the mileage as was not material to adkins decision to purchase the car citing testimony in which she states that she would not have purchased the vehicle even if the rear portion had zero miles on it.mem.the court observed,however,that this argument ignores the fact that this representation inherently conceals the fact that the car possessed varying mileage,and it was this very concealment which would have alerted adkins to the fact that the car was clipped.id.at.simply put,the court rejected crown auto fraud theory in favor of adkins broader theory of her claim.
in concluding that the amended complaint sufficiently alleged the theory of the fraud claim,the court observed,inter alia,that the paragraph allegation concerned not only the representation of the mileage as,but also the concealment of the fact that the mileage of the rear portion was higher.mem.in other words,according to the court,not only was the representation of mileage material to adkins decision to purchase the car,but also the concealment of the fact that the car possessed varying mileage from front to back while her decision may not have actually turned on the specific mileage she was told,this does nothing to absolve crown of concealing the fact that was the whole story.id.
additionally,the court recognized that in pleading the fraud claim under the heading actual fraud,the amended complaint first incorporated by reference all preceding allegations,including the statement of facts in its paragraphs through detailing the clipping procedure,its concealment by crown auto,and the resulting problems experienced by adkins.see mem.accordingly,the allegations in the statement of facts,together with the paragraph allegation,were sufficient to place crown auto on notice that the fraudulent conduct complained of constituted not only the misrepresentation of mileage,but an intentional concealment of the larger fact that the car had been clipped.id.finally,the court ruled that adkins had presented sufficient evidence on the elements of the fraud claim to sustain the verdict returned in her favor.see id.at 
in challenging on appeal the district court denial of its rule motions,crown auto stands by its position that the pleading requirements of rule b restrict the fraud claim to its theory.having carefully considered the issue,ho
