this case was birthed in louisiana state court by barry and sheryle bernhard.it was adopted by the middle district of louisiana when the defendants,capital one and whitney national bank,removed it on the basis of a federal question.whitney appeals a decision of the district court,granting summary judgment in whitney favor on the federal claim,yet remanding the state claims.because we hold that,under the unusual circumstances of this case,the district court lacked federal question jurisdiction,we vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions that the case be remanded to the custody of the state court.
barry and sheryle bernhard brought this suit against whitney national bank and capital one bank,llc,in louisiana state court in july.they alleged violations of louisiana civil code articles and their claims arose out of alleged unauthorized transfers from their checking account at whitney bank by a contractor with whom the bernhards did business,robert williams.the bernhards alleged that williams had used capital one online banking system to make unauthorized electronic transfers from the whitney account,using the routing and account numbers from the bernhards personal check.they alleged that capital one and whitney breached duties owed to them by allowing williams to make the unauthorized transfers and by failing to maintain adequate security procedures 
the unauthorized transfers began in november and continued through november,totaling.the bernhards notified whitney of the unauthorized transfers in november and were credited for some of the unauthorized withdrawals.
the bernhards alleged in their petition that the defendants are liable for an amount to compensate them for losses sustained,legal interest,and all costs of these proceedings,including attorney fees.
the defendants removed the case to the federal district court for the middle district of louisiana.they contended that the facts alleged and the actions complained of by the bernhards actually involve and include alleged violations of federal law,namely the electronic fund transfer act,et the efta,and its implementing regulations resolution of the bernhards claims requires the interpretation of these federal laws.the defendants also argued that,because the bernhards sought attorneys fees,which are available under the efta but not under state law,the claims necessarily arise under federal law.
the bernhards moved to remand the case to the state court,arguing that they sought relief only under state law.the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation that the motion to remand be denied.the magistrate judge found that plaintiffs claims arise under federal law even though the plaintiffs have characterized them as state law claims.citing this court decision in medina ramsey steel,cir,the magistrate judge found that,if the remedy that the plaintiff seeks in his or her complaint is exclusively available under federal law,then a federal court has jurisdiction of the case.the magistrate judge concluded that,because the attorneys fees sought by the bernhards are exclusively available under federal law,the district court had federal question jurisdiction over the case under.the magistrate judge also found 
secondly,even though the plaintiffs only assert causes of action under state law in their petition,automated clearing house transactions like those at issue are governed by federal law,efta and its implementing regulations,regulation e.in order to determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys fees as requested,it will be necessary for the court to engage in an analysis of whether efta was violated by the defendants.accordingly,this case necessarily involves an embedded issue of federal law affording the court original jurisdiction under grable sons metal prod.daru e eng g,d.
the magistrate judge cited the provision of the efta defining its relationship to state laws,interpreting it to provide that state laws which are inconsistent or afford consumers less protection than efta relating to electronic fund transfers are by efta.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation over the bernhards objection and denied their motion to remand.
capital one and whitney filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted the motions for summary judgment as to claims arising under the efta.the district court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to no further reimbursement from whitney under the efta because the plaintiffs failed to report the unauthorized transfers to whitney in a timely manner.under the efta,whitney was not legally obligated to reimburse the bernhards for unauthorized transfers occurring more than sixty days after the receipt of the bank statement showing the first unauthorized transfer and before notice was given to whitney.the district court found that the bernhards could not set forth a cause of action against capital one under the efta because capital one is not a financial institution with respect to the bernhards as provided by the efta.
the court found that it had supplemental jurisdiction under a over all claims that are so related to the claims over which the court has original jurisdiction that the related claims are part of the same case or controversy.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and remanded the remaining state law negligence claims to state court.
whitney filed a motion under rule e to alter or amend the judgment for clarification.e.whitney contended that the district court did not properly specify in its order that the only negligence claims remanded to state court were those against capital one.whitney sought clarification that the efta preempts louisiana state law,thus the bernhards have no state law claim against whitney to remand.
the district court denied whitney motion,reaffirming its previous determination not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any remaining state law claims in the case.whitney appealed to this court.
whitney contends that the district court granted its motion for summary judgment in a manner inconsistent with its earlier conclusion that the bernhards state law negligence claims were,in fact,federal claims under the efta and were preempted by the efta.whitney contends that the court therefore erred in denying whitney rule e motion to reconsider its judgment.
