opinion of the court 
introduction 
when congress offers money to the states,it often imposes conditions on acceptance.states welcome federal funding to help underwrite many of the core services they provide to their citizens.education,healthcare,and public safety,to name a few,while typically state concerns,are usually funded in part by federal dollars that come with strings attached.this case raises the new,but of first impression in this court following gonzaga university doe,d of what happens when a state allegedly fails to live up to the conditions imposed on it by congress.
plaintiffs are a class of mentally retarded adults in need of medical services from an intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation services.although they qualify for state assistance to obtain these services under the medicaid act,that assistance has not been forthcoming.in an effort to force pennsylvania to provide the needed services,plaintiffs,pursuant to,sued the secretary of the pennsylvania department of public welfare.pennsylvania argues that it would provide assistance if it could but that it can not,and that,in any event,the sole remedy for its with the medicaid act is the suspension or revocation of funding from congress.we disagree 
the district court,relying heavily on gonzaga university,concluded that congress had not unambiguously conferred the rights that plaintiffs sought to vindicate under,and dismissed the suit sabree houston,d.at first blush,language in gonzaga university would appear to support that conclusion.in gonzaga university,the court foreclosed the ability of a student to enforce,by means of,provisions of the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa gonzaga,at.the chief justice,writing for the court,stated emphatically we now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under.id.emphasis added.
the court,no doubt,has set a high bar for plaintiffs.nonetheless,after having considered the relevant provisions of the medicaid act against the backdrop of gonzaga university,we are convinced that congress unambiguously conferred the rights which plaintiffs here seek to enforce.accordingly,we will reverse the order of the district court.
ii.discussion 
title xix of the social security act,codified at and popularly known as the medicaid act,established a cooperative program under which the federal government furnishes funding to states for the purpose of providing medical assistance to eligible persons.pharm.ass houstoun,cir.states are not required to participate in the program,but states that do accept federal funding must comply with the medicaid act and with regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services hhs.participating states must devise and implement a state medical assistance plan that is approved by the secretary of hhs.a state that fails to comply with its medical assistance plan runs the risk of having its funding revoked by the secretary.
there is no dispute that plaintiffs qualify for services under pennsylvania medical assistance plan.nor is it disputed that plaintiffs have languished on waiting lists for years,unable to obtain these services.the only dispute,and the one now before us,is whether plaintiffs may sue pennsylvania under to enforce the provisions of title xix that require a state to provide medical assistance covering services,and to do so with reasonable promptness.a a and a 
that plaintiffs merit sympathy does not escape our notice,but neither does it govern our reasoning.rather,gonzaga university provides the dispassionate lens through which this matter must be viewed.a analysis is required.first,we must examine gonzaga university to determine the essential characteristics of an unambiguously conferred right.second,we must assess whether the statutory language of title xix imparts an unambiguously conferred right.third,we must an individual right has been unambiguously congress has precluded individual enforcement of that right.this analysis,which,as will become clear,is assuredly not for the timid,compels the conclusion that the provisions invoked by a,a,and a unambiguously confer rights vindicable under.
gonzaga university doe and unambiguously conferred one 
as the court explained more than twenty years ago,i n legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power,the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to terminate funds to the state.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.nonetheless,as the court observed in gonzaga university,in some instances congress has unambiguously conferred rights that may be vindicated by individual suits brought under 
in gonzaga university,the plaintiff sought to enforce conditions imposed on the state of washington by ferpa congress enacted ferpa under its spending power to condition the receipt of federal funds on certain requirements relating to the access and disclosure of student educational records.gonzaga,at.ultimately,the court rejected the viability of plaintiff claim because it concluded that in ferpa congress had not intended to create a federal right.id.at.emphasis in original see also id.at.breyer,concurring the ultimate question,in respect to whether private individuals may bring a lawsuit to enforce a federal statute,through or otherwise,is a question of congressional intent.emphasis added.
accordingly,we must determine whether congress intended to confer the rights claimed by plaintiffs.gonzaga university instructs that congressional intent is manifest only when statutory language unambiguously confers such rights.id.at.to determine what statutory language is necessary to confer rights unambiguously,we turn first to the cases in which the court addressed statutory actions brought under.we then consider what the court means in gonzaga university when it requires language.id.at.
statutory rights and 
since pennhurst,only twice has the court recognized a congressional intent to confer statutory rights vindicable via wright roanoke redevelopment housing authority,d,addressing the public housing act and wilder virginia hospital ass n,d,addressing title xix of the social security act.the court has foreclosed suits in two equally significant cases in addition to gonzaga university suter artist,d,addressing the adoption assistance and child welfare act of and blessing freestone,d,addressing title of the social security act.
while in gonzaga university the court reject ed the notion that its cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under,it carefully avoided disturbing,much less overruling,wright and wilder.gonzaga,at.indeed,as the ensuing analysis will demonstrate,the court relied on those cases in crafting gonzaga university.accordingly,we will assess the rights claimed by plaintiffs in light of wright,wilder,suter,and blessing,as construed by gonzaga university.
a wright roanoke redevelopment housing authority 
in wright,the court permitted a suit by tenants to recover past overcharges under a provision of the public housing act as explained in gonzaga university,three factors motivated the wright court to conclude that the provision unambiguously conferred a mandatory benefit focusing on the individual family and its income.gonzaga,at.quoting wright,at.first,t he key to the court inquiry was that congress spoke in terms that could not be clearer.id.second,congress conferred entitlements sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as enforceable rights under pennhurst.id.quoting wright,at.third,the federal agency charged with administering the public housing act had never provided a procedure by which tenants could complain to it about the alleged failures of state welfare agencies to abide by the act provision.id.quoting wright,at.
b wilder virginia hospital ass 
in wilder,the court permitted a action brought by health care providers to enforce a reimbursement provision of title xix of the social security act,the same title at issue here according to gonzaga university,the wilder court was persuaded because the relevant medicaid provisions explicitly conferred specific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs required states to pay an objective monetary entitlement to individual health care providers,with no sufficient administrative means of enforcing the requirement against states that failed to comply and because congress left no doubt of its intent for private enforcement.gonzaga,at.quoting wilder,at.
c suter artist 
in suter,the court foreclosed an action under brought by a class of parents and children who sought to enforce provisions of the adoption assistance and child welfare act,which required that states have a plan to make reasonable efforts to keep children out of foster homes according to gonzaga university,the suter court recognized that because the adoption act conferred no specific,individually enforceable rights,there was no basis for private enforcement,even by a class of the statute principal beneficiaries.gonzaga,at.citing suter,at.writing for the court in suter,the chief justice explained 
careful examination of the language does not unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the act beneficiaries.the term reasonable efforts in this context is at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather generalized duty on the state,to be enforced not by private individuals,but by the secretary in the manner of reducing or eliminating payments.
suter.quoted approvingly by gonzaga,at.
d blessing freestone 
in blessing,the court rejected the claim under of five mothers whose children were eligible to receive child support services from the state of arizona pursuant to title of the social security act title of the social security act enumerated various entitlements without claiming any specific rights under title,the plaintiffs asserted that they had an enforceable individual right to have the state program achieve substantial compliance with the requirements of title,as required of the state in title blessing,at.
in gonzaga university,the court explained the logic of the unanimous blessing holding 
because the provision focused on the aggregate services provided by the state,rather than the needs of any particular person,it conferred no individual rights and thus could not be enforced by.we emphasized to seek redress through,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.
gonzaga,at.quoting blessing,at.emphasis in original.that blessing garnered unanimous support is not surprising it is an easy case.the plaintiffs never asserted any individual rights but,instead,attempted to enforce congress right to demand substantial compliance with the terms of a conditional grant of money.to have allowed the action to proceed would have transformed from a vehicle to vindicate personal rights into a qui tam mechanism.
to evaluate whether congress had conferred enforceable individual rights in a statute,the blessing court drew on wright,wilder,and suter,and formulated a test a statute must be intended by congress to benefit the plaintiff,not be vague and amorphous,and impose an unambiguous binding obligation on the states.blessing,at.while in gonzaga university the court did not abandon this test,it did dispel 
the confusion that has led some courts to interpret blessing as allowing plaintiffs to enforce a statute under so long as the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect something less than what is required for a statute to create rights enforceable directly from the statute itself under an implied private right of action.
gonzaga,at.the court clarified and emphasize d that it is only violations of rights,not laws,which give rise to actions.id.at.citing blessing,at.emphasis in original.
significantly,in blessing the court did not decide that title does not,in fact,confer individual rights.rather,the court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to assert any specific rights,instead relying on the general requirement that arizona substantially comply with its child welfare plan.blessing,at.we do not foreclose the possibility that some provisions of title give rise to individual rights but,it is not at all apparent that respondents sought any relief more specific than a declaration that their rights were being violated and an injunction forcing arizona child support agency to substantially comply with all of the provisions of title.consequently,the court remanded the case for a determination of whether specific provisions of title gave rise to individual rights.id.at.
to confer rights,congress must use language.gonzaga,at.such language must clearly impart an individual entitlement,and have an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.id.quoting blessing,at,and cannon university of chicago,d.alexander sandoval,d statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons quoting california sierra club,d.
the chief justice invoked the implied private right of action cases to demonstrate the type of terms that unambiguously confer rights.
t he question whether congress intended to create a private right of action is definitively answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class.touche ross redington,d.for a statute to create such private rights,its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.cannon university of chicago,d.we have recognized,for example,that title vi of the civil rights act of and title ix of the education amendments of create individual rights because those statutes are phrased with an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class,at.emphasis added.
gonzaga,at.
as with implied private rights of action,statutory claims under must be premised on an unambiguous articulation and conferral of rights by congress w here the text and structure of a statute provide no indication that congress intends to create new individual rights,there is no basis for a private suit,whether under or under an implied right of action.id.at.with this in mind,the court evaluated ferpa.first,and most importantly,the court contrasted the individually focused language of title vi and ix no person shall be subjected to discrimination with ferpa general provisions addressing the secretary of education no funds shall be made available to any educational agency or institution which has a prohibited policy or practice.gonzaga,at.the court noted that ferpa nondisclosure provisions speak only in terms of institutional policy and practice,not individual instances of disclosure.id.at.the contrast between the language of titles vi and ix and that of ferpa is stark.the specific,mandatory,individually focused language of titles vi and ix confers individual rights,while the aggregate,programmatic focus of ferpa language merely creates law applicable to the states.the distinction is dispositive rights are enforceable under laws are not.gonzaga,at.citing blessing,at.
despite the clarity of the statutory language,the court went on to bolster its analysis by considering the structural elements of ferpa,which emphasize the programmatic and aggregate focus of the statute.although references to the individual appear throughout the text of ferpa,i n each provision the reference is in the context of describing the type of policy or practice that triggers a funding prohibition.id.indeed,the fact that congress expressly authorized the secretary of education to deal with violations and to establish or designate a review board buttressed the court assessment that ferpa did not confer enforceable rights.id.at.citing f g finally,the court highlighted statutory language reminiscent of that in blessing that counseled against a finding of individual rights.see id.recipient institutions can further avoid termination of funding so long as they comply substantially this,too,is not unlike blessing,which found that title failed to support a suit in part because it only required substantial compliance with federal regulations.citing blessing,at,d.
having traced the court treatment of statutory rights under,we now turn to the text and structure of title xix.gonzaga,at.
statutory text 
we begin with the familiar canon of statutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.consumer product safety comm gte sylvania,d.
plaintiffs seek to enforce the right to acquire services,by virtue of a and a the language of the statute requires that a state must provide medical assistance to all eligible individuals,and includes intermediate care facilities in the definition of medical assistance.a a.plaintiffs also seek to enforce the right to acquire services with reasonable promptness,as required by a the language of the statute declares that a state must provide assistance with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.a.
in each of these provisions,the statutory language is clear and unambiguous.indeed,we can hardly imagine anyone disputing that a state must provide the assistance necessary to obtain services,and that it must do so with reasonable promptness,and the government does not do so.our inquiry,however,does not end there.indisputably,these provisions create law,binding on those states choosing to accept medicaid funding.whether the same provisions confer rights,enforceable by individuals,is another question,and is the question we are called upon to answer.
to determine whether these provisions provide plaintiffs with unambiguously conferred rights,we begin with what has come to be called the blessing test.blessing,at.as discussed above,the plain language of the statute clearly conveys that a state must provide plaintiffs with medical assistance,including services,with reasonable promptness.a,a,a.without difficulty,we conclude that these provisions satisfy the blessing test because plaintiffs were the intended beneficiaries of a,a,and a the rights sought to be enforced by them are specific and enumerated,not vague and amorphous and the obligation imposed on the states is unambiguous and binding.id.
but,again,our inquiry does not end there because,as is explained in gonzaga university,the blessing test may only indicate that plaintiffs fall within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect something less than what is required for a statute to create rights enforceable directly from the statute itself gonzaga,at.to ensure that congress unambiguously conferred the rights asserted,we must determine whether congress used terms.id.at.
the court identified the text of titles vi and ix as exemplars of language.gonzaga,at.viewing titles vi and ix,we find it difficult,if not impossible,as a linguistic matter,to distinguish the import of the relevant title xix language a state plan must provide from the no person shall language of titles vi and ix.just as in titles vi and ix,the relevant terms used in title xix are mandatory rather than precatory.blessing,at.further,the individual focus of sections a,a,and a is unmistakable.gonzaga,at.the relevant title xix provisions enumerate the entitlements available to all eligible individuals.see,a.the provisions do not focus on the entity regulated rather than the individuals protected.alexander sandoval,at.neither do the statutory references to the individual appear in the context of describing the type of policy or practice that triggers a funding prohibition.gonzaga,at.
in requiring states which accept medicaid funding to provide services with reasonable promptness,congress conferred specific entitlements on individuals in terms that could not be clearer.gonzaga,at.quoting wright,at.there is no ambiguity.where,as here,the plain meaning of the text is evident,we need not look further to determine congressional intent.see,darby cisneros,d recourse to the legislative history is unnecessary in light of the plain meaning of the statutory text.
statutory structure 
as a general rule of statutory construction,where the terms of a statute are unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete.adams fruit barrett,d.general rules,however,are susceptible to exceptions,and we have before us one of those instances in which our inquiry does not end with the plain language of the statute.we recognize,of course,that s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,and,at a minimum,must account for a statute full text,language as well as punctuation,structure,and subject matter.united states bank independent ins.agents of,d quoting united savings ass of texas timbers of inwood forest associates,d.in gonzaga university,the court instructs that not only should the text of the statute be examined,but also its structure.gonzaga,at.this instruction makes good sense we can not presume to confer individual is a task for congress.as the court aptly put it,we may play the sorcerer apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.alexander sandoval,at.our judicial function is limited to recognizing those rights which congress unambiguously confers,and in doing so we would be remiss if we did not consider the whole of congress voice on the statute in its entirety.
turning our sights beyond the narrow provisions invoked by plaintiffs gives us some pause.indeed,the district court,basing its decision largely on the structural elements of title xix,reached the opposite conclusion from that we reach.the district court in large part grounded its analysis on and,and concluded that those provisions do not contain the language required by gonzaga university.sabree,d at.undoubtedly,the court was correct in that regard.
the opening section of title the appropriations and general introductory statement of the medicaid act as that section explains,title xix was enacted f or the purpose of enabling each state to furnish medical assistance.this language says nothing of individual entitlements or rights,but reminds us that we are dealing with an agreement between congress and a particular state,and recalls the axiom of pennhurst in legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power,the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to terminate funds to the state.pennhurst state sch,at.
turning next,as did the district court,to section c does not help in the search for language.sabree,d at.section empowers the secretary of hhs to suspend payments to a state if it fails to comply substantially with the requirements of title xix this language not only confirms that title xix by its terms creates a relationship between congress and a particular state,but it recalls,as well,the comply substantially language in blessing and gonzaga university.blessing,at.gonzaga,at.of course,in blessing and gonzaga university,such language counseled against the recognition of an unambiguously conferred right.
but while the district court correctly recognized that sections and do not contain the sort of explicit,language found in title vi,it did not consider the existence of language in other relevant provisions of title xix.sabree,d at.the language used by congress in a,a,and a,however,explicitly creates rights.admittedly,plumbing for congressional intent by balancing the specific language of a few discrete provisions of title xix against the larger structural elements of the statute is a difficult task.nonetheless,it is evident,at least to us,that the statutory language,despite countervailing structural elements of the statute,unambiguously confers rights which plaintiffs can enforce.
we conclude that section,the appropriations and general introductory statement,can not neutralize the language of sections a,a,and a.our confidence in this conclusion rests securely on the fact that the court has refrained from overruling wright and wilder,which upheld the exercise of individual rights under statutes that contain similar or,in the case of wilder,identical provisions to.
section was in effect at the time of wilder,in which the court allowed claims to proceed under title xix,and a similar provision was in effect when the court allowed claims to proceed in wright.but gonzaga university did not overrule wilder rather,it explained that congress left no doubt of
