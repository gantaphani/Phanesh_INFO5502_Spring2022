opinion of the court 
appellants janet and david hirst the hirsts appeal the final judgment of the district court in favor of appellee ranger american of ranger following a jury trial and verdict.the hirsts contend that the district court committed legal error at trial by allowing ranger president to give improper lay opinion testimony concerning the issue of proximate causation in violation of federal rule of evidence.we agree.for the reasons stated below,we will vacate the district court entry of judgment and remand for a new trial.
background 
on july,the hirsts filed a complaint in the district court of the virgin islands against inverness hotel corporation,alleging negligence and loss of consortium in connection with the july,rape of janet hirst at the chenay bay beach resort chenay bay in croix.on july,the hirsts amended their complaint,adding a number of individual and corporate defendants,including ranger,the security services company employed by chenay bay.by the time the case went to trial,ranger was the only defendant that remained.
beginning on november,the case was tried before a jury in croix.over the course of the trial,the jury heard evidence that,on july,after returning from an evening fireworks display,janet hirst was raped in her vacation cottage at chenay bay by a man wearing latex gloves and a bandana that covered his face.according to hirst,the was never found a grocery bag as a condom and was careful to wipe down various areas of the room before he fled.
the hirsts introduced evidence that chenay bay had contracted with the defendant,ranger,to provide nighttime security services for the resort.ranger was to provide a uniformed security guard every evening between and.the guard duties were outlined in a document drafted by ranger known as post orders app.see also app.and included,inter alia,patrolling the entire complex twice an hour without exhibiting a pattern,monitoring all incoming and outgoing activities to ensure that unauthorized refrain from accessing the properties,and escorting late arriving guests to their rooms app.see also.the post orders also required the security guard to carry a flashlight and a radio.
the night of hirst rape,the ranger security guard on duty,felix rose rose arrived for his shift some minutes before ten.he was provided with neither a flashlight nor a radio.rose testified that,during his shift,he failed to perform several of the duties enumerated in the post orders.for example,rose patrolled the resort only once an hour,instead of twice an hour as the post orders required.additionally,rose did not patrol at all the area of the resort where hirst was raped.according to rose,he did not patrol the area where the hirsts cottage was located because his supervisor told him that the area was too dark for his own safety.app.rose believed that without a flashlight or without any light,somebody could jump out and knock him down or knock him out.app 
in addition to hirst and rose,the jury heard from several other witnesses,including ranger president,juan bravo bravo,whose testimony is the subject of this appeal.at the very conclusion of bravo direct examination ranger counsel asked bravo whether ranger could have been able to prevent hirst rape,immediately prompting an objection.the trial transcript reveals the following exchange 
q based on your knowledge of the facts of this case,could ranger american,within the limited scope of its functions,have been able to prevent the attack against hirst 
hirsts counsel objection.no foundation.calls for speculation.not an expert witness.
the court well,he not an expert witness.he the president of the defendant company,and if he has an opinion when he being,his company is being sued with regard to this incident,i do think it unfair to give him an opportunity to express an opinion with regard to that.
a given the facts that i have been presented,there was no way that this alleged incident would have been prevented by us or by anyone.
the court by whom 
a by us or by anyone.
the court all right.
after the close of evidence,the jury found that,although ranger was in fact negligent in providing security services on july,its negligence was not a proximate cause of hirst rape.accordingly,on january,the district court entered judgment in favor of ranger.on january,the hirsts filed a timely notice of appeal.we now have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
as recognized above,the hirsts contend that district court erred in allowing ranger president,juan bravo bravo,to give improper lay opinion testimony in violation of federal rule of evidence.according to the hirsts,bravo testimony was particularly harmful,as he was permitted to express an opinion concerning the very issue upon which the jury ultimately based its verdict proximate causation.they ask that we vacate the district court judgment and remand for a new trial.
in response,ranger insists that the hirsts failed to properly preserve their rule argument in the district court.according to ranger,t he objection raised on appeal by appellant is clearly improper as it was not raised at trial.appellee br.viii.on the merits of the hirsts argument,ranger maintains that the district court decision to admit bravo opinion testimony was appropriate id.at vii and contends that,in any event,the testimony had no major effect on the jury verdict id.at vi.
at the outset,we find absolutely no basis for ranger contention that the hirsts failed to preserve their rule argument for appeal.it could not be more clear from the trial from the hirsts direct and accurate citation of the record in their brief see appellants br.that the hirsts raised a proper objection to the testimony they now challenge on appeal to be certain,the relevant transcript excerpt,as cited above,indicates that counsel objected on several grounds to the question posed.while counsel did not say improper lay opinion,the stated grounds for his objection lack of foundation,speculation,and n ot an expert witness point to the same concerns,as discussed further below.
counsel objection provided both ranger and the court with sufficient notice of the bases for the objection and an opportunity to correct the alleged error and the court response demonstrates that it was aware of and understood the hirsts position finding no support in either law or fact for ranger argument,we easily conclude that the hirsts have adequately preserved this issue on appeal.
ii.federal rule of evidence 
we next address whether bravo testimony should have been prohibited under federal rule of evidence.while we generally review a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion,our review is plenary as to the court interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.marra philadelphia housing authority,cir.
rule,entitled opinion testimony by lay witnesses,provides that 
if the witness is not testifying as an expert,the witness testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are a rationally based on the perception of the witness,b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.
the plain language of rule establishes that lay opinion testimony must satisfy the criteria set forth in subsections a,b,and c in order to be admissible.bravo testimony satisfies none of these criteria.
first,a lay opinion must be rationally based on the witness perception and firsthand knowledge of the factual predicates that form the basis for the opinion.gov t of knight,cir citing.a advisory committee note see also united states glenn,cir a lay opinion must be rationally based on the perception of the witness.this requirement is the familiar requirement of knowledge or observation.a witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.
bravo opinion was not based on his own perception.in his videotaped deposition,which appears to have been played in full to the jury,bravo clearly testified that he had
