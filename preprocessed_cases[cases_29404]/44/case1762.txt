theodore smith hung himself on january,while confined in the drunk tank at the old marion county jail the old jail.renisa brumfield,smith daughter,instituted this action under against marion county and against sheriff richard rip stringer,deputy sheriff solomon ray hollins,deputy sheriff clarence louge,deputy sheriff delano butch thornhill,and deputy sheriff charles bumper bryant in their individual and official capacities.the district court awarded summary judgment to each defendant sued in his individual capacity on the basis of qualified immunity.after the case went to trial,the district court directed a verdict in favor of all remaining county and stringer,hollins,louge,thornhill,and bryant in their official capacities.brumfield now appeals,seeking reversal of the district court order granting sheriff stringer qualified immunity and its order directing a verdict in favor of marion county and each defendant in his official capacity we affirm.
factual background 
on january,at pm,bryant pulled over smith for driving erratically.bryant administered a portable breathalyzer test,determined that smith blood alcohol level was above the legal limit for a person operating a motorized vehicle,and placed smith under arrest.because this would be smith third arrest for drunk driving,smith knew he was facing a felony charge and significant jail time if convicted.
at the old jail,columbia police officer chris brumfield administered another breathalyzer exam.smith blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit of.according to the marion county log,smith belt,watch,jacket,and hat were removed from his person smith was allowed to keep his shoes and his shoelaces.at approximately pm,smith was placed in the old jail drunk tank.the old jail had no requirement that the jailers routinely check on pretrial detainees,but the drunk tank was only ten feet away from the jailer desk.inmate trusties relayed detainees requests and concerns to the jailer on duty.
thornhill was the jailer on duty when smith arrived at the old jail.at approximately pm,smith knocked on the drunk tank door and asked darryl stogner,the inmate trusty on duty,to transfer him to another cell where he could have a bed.stogner relayed smith request to thornhill,but thornhill said not to let smith out until pm.at approximately pm,with thornhill approval,stogner let smith out of the drunk tank to get a drink of water.smith also requested that he be able to call his mother.again,thornhill denied the request and instructed that smith not be let out of the drunk tank until pm.shortly thereafter,smith began beating on the drunk tank door and continued to do so for the next twenty or thirty minutes.
hollins relieved thornhill from duty sometime between pm and pm.hollins left smith in the drunk tank.at am,stogner asked hollins for the keys to smith cell.after unlocking the door,stogner found smith lying on the floor.smith had used his shoelaces to hang himself,the shoelaces apparently had broken,and smith body had fallen to the floor.stogner checked smith pulse and told hollins that smith was dead.hollins also checked smith pulse and found none.hollins then radioed officers louge,ryals,and bryant to immediately come to the old jail.as soon as louge,ryals,and bryant arrived,ryals entered the drunk tank and checked both smith wrist and carotid artery for a pulse,again finding none.louge directed hollins to call for emergency personnel and to notify sheriff stringer.after calling for an ambulance and notifying sheriff stringer,hollins took pictures of smith body and the drunk tank.at no time did any of the officers attempt to resuscitate smith or remove the shoelace from smith neck with which smith had hung himself.
fifteen to twenty minutes after stogner discovered smith body,the paramedics arrived.the paramedics cut the shoelace from smith neck and escorted him to the hospital where smith was pronounced dead.
on august,renisa brumfield,on behalf of herself and the heirs of smith estate,sued marion county and sheriff stringer,hollins,louge,thornhill,and bryant in their individual and official capacities under.on july,the district court awarded summary judgment to each defendant sued in his individual capacity on the basis of qualified immunity.however,on august,the district court denied summary judgment to the individual defendants in their official capacities and to marion county,reasoning that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether marion county was liable under for practicing a custom or policy of deliberate indifference toward the needs of its pretrial detainees.the case went to trial on november.
after brumfield rested her case,the district court directed a verdict in favor of all remaining defendants based on brumfield failure to prove a violation of any constitutional right.the district court also found a lack of causal connection between the failure to train or implement policy and smith suicide,and no evidence demonstrating a pattern of similar prior incidences necessary to demonstrate objective deliberate indifference by marion county.the district court entered a final order and judgment disposing of brumfield claims.
brumfield now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in three respects by granting summary judgment to sheriff stringer in his individual capacity on the basis of qualified immunity by prohibiting brumfield from presenting expert testimony indicating that smith was alive when the paramedics arrived at the old jail and by directing a verdict for marion county and all the individual defendants in their official capacities.
ii.discussion 
sheriff stringer liability in his individual.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.bolton city of dallas,cir.our inquiry is limited to the summary judgment record before the trial court.topalian ehrman,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d,and the movant has the burden of showing this court that summary judgment is appropriate.celotex catrett,d.summary judgment is appropriate where the competent summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.bolton,at see.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could enter a verdict for the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
qualified immunity protects public officials from suit unless their conduct violates a clearly established constitutional right.mace city of palestine,cir.although nominally an affirmative defense,the plaintiff has the burden to negate the defense once properly raised.
the defendant official must initially plead his good faith and establish that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority.once the defendant has done so,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut this defense by establishing that the official allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established law.
bazan ex rel.bazan hidalgo county,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see,pierce smith,cir we do not require that an official demonstrate that he did not violate clearly established federal rights our precedent places that burden upon plaintiffs.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,because sheriff stringer properly raised the issue of his qualified immunity,the burden of negating that defense lies with brumfield,even on summary judgment.see bazan,at.
claims of qualified immunity require a analysis.we must first determine whether brumfield has adduced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact suggesting sheriff stringer conduct violated an actual constitutional right.mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc.if the answer is no,then our analysis ends.freeman gore,cir.if the answer is yes,we must then consider whether sheriff stringer actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the conduct in question.id.at.t he qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.mendenhall riser,cir quoting malley briggs,d.
the district court held that brumfield claims must fail as to sheriff stringer in his individual capacity because no evidence indicated sheriff stringer knew or directly participated in smith arrest or incarceration therefore,he was entitled to qualified immunity.on appeal,brumfield concedes that sheriff stringer neither deliberately harmed smith nor personally participated in the events of the evening in question.instead,brumfield argues that sheriff stringer is not entitled to qualified immunity because he is individually liable as a supervisory official.brumfield contends that sheriff stringer was deliberately indifferent to smith constitutional rights by failing to adopt any written policy pertaining to inmate supervision or medical care,and failing to train or supervise the jailers he hired.we will address in turn each of brumfield two contentions.
failure to promulgate policy concerning inmate supervision and medical care 
pretrial detainees have a constitutional right to medical care and protection from harm during their confinement.hare city of corinth,cir en banc hare i.brumfield alleged that sheriff stringer failure to implement policies pertaining to inmate supervision and medical care deprived smith of his constitutional right to adequate protection and reasonable medical care.while this allegation alone might be enough to survive a motion to dismiss,in response to a summary judgment motion,brumfield must bring forward sufficient evidence to raise a fact issue on this point.mcclendon,at.
brumfield has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact demonstrating that sheriff stringer is not entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of failing to promulgate concerning inmate supervision and medical care.brumfield places great weight on the fact that sheriff stringer had no written policies and procedures at the old jail similar to the ones at a nearby facility known as the new jail.from this,she concludes that sheriff stringer implemented no policies at all.but we have acknowledged that the validity of prison policies is not dependent on whether they are written or verbal.a policy is a policy talib gilley,cir.indeed,verbal policies existed concerning inmate supervision and medical care,and sheriff stringer,bryant,louge,hollins,and thornhill all testified to that effect.
specifically,at least one jailer was to be on duty at all times.when an arresting officer booked a detainee who was over the legal limit of intoxication,the detainee would be administered a breathalyzer test and then sent through the booking process.after an officer obtained the detainee personal information and specified personal belongings,the intoxicated detainee was to be placed in the drunk tank,a cell ten feet away from the jailer desk.according to the summary judgment evidence,if a detainee was placed in the drunk tank after pm,the earliest release time would be am the following morning for detainees brought in before pm,the amount of time spent in the drunk tank varied depending on the detainee condition.if the detainee appeared suicidal,then the detainee was to be placed in the observation cell a plexiglass room directly next to the jailer desk.if a detainee asked for assistance,an inmate trusty checked on the detainee and reported back to the jailer with any of the detainee concerns or requests.if any of those concerns or requests stemmed from a detainee immediate need for medical attention,the jailers were to either call medical personnel at the new jail or,if necessary,call for an ambulance to notify a supervising officer and to notify sheriff stringer himself.while the old jail policies gave officers discretion in performing their duties and lacked the specific directives brumfield would have preferred to have been in place,policies nonetheless existed.
even assuming arguendo that brumfield has raised a fact issue on the first step of the qualified immunity analysis,her evidence fails the second step.as discussed above,the second step of our inquiry requires us to determine whether sheriff stringer conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of smith death.freeman,at.the dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d.at the time of smith death,clearly established law required that in a claim alleging failure to promulgate policy as a basis for liability,the failure must be an intentional choice and amount to subjective deliberate indifference rhyne henderson county,cir.in other words,it must be obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy will be a deprivation of civil rights.evans city of marlin,cir quoting rhyne,at.in the qualified immunity analysis,t he subjective deliberate indifference standard serves only to demonstrate the clearly established law in effect at the time of the incident u nder that standard actions of the individual defendants are examined to determine whether,as a matter of law,they were objectively unreasonable.hare city of corinth,cir hare ii emphasis in original.brumfield has failed to offer any evidence to support such a finding 
failure to 
brumfield also contends that sheriff stringer is not entitled to qualified immunity because he failed to train or supervise his subordinates.as we noted in our discussion of brumfield first contention,her allegation alone might be sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss,but to survive summary judgment,brumfield must bring forward sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on this point.mcclendon,at.
brumfield has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact demonstrating that sheriff stringer is not entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of failing to train or supervise his subordinates.the summary judgment record does not reflect a failure to train or supervise.sheriff stringer,thornhill,and hollins testified that deputies were first trained at the new jail and then sent to work at the old jail.thornhill and louge further testified that they received training.while there may be disparities in the deputies testimony regarding the extent of their training,there is no question that they did indeed receive training.brumfield dissatisfaction with sheriff stringer training efforts can not negate the fact that the training occurred.
even assuming arguendo that brumfield has raised a fact issue on the first step of the qualified immunity analysis,her evidence again fails the second step.the law at the time of smith death pertaining to liability for failure to train or supervise provided 
a sheriff not personally involved in the acts that deprived the plaintiff of his constitutional rights is liable under section if the sheriff failed to train or supervise the officers involved there is a causal connection between the alleged failure to supervise or train and the alleged violation of the plaintiff rights and the failure to train or supervise constituted deliberate indifference to the plaintiff constitutional rights 
thompson upshur county,cir.in this specific context,a showing of deliberate indifference generally requires a showing of more than a single instance of the lack of training or supervision causing a violation of constitutional rights.burge tammany parish,cir quoting thompson,at.a plaintiff must demonstrate at least a pattern of similar violations arising from training or supervising that is so clearly inadequate as to be obviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.id.quoting thompson,at.a limited exception for liability exists only where the facts giving rise to the violation are such that it should have been apparent to the policymaker that a constitutional violation was the highly predictable consequence of a particular policy or failure to train.id.at.
brumfield has failed to offer any evidence to support such a finding.the summary judgment record does not support a causal connection between the alleged failure to train and smith tragic death.nor does the summary judgment evidence indicate a pattern of
