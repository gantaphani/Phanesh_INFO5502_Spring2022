while attempting to use a taser to stop frederick henry from fleeing arrest,somerset county maryland deputy sheriff robert purnell mistakenly drew his firearm,rather than his taser,from his holster.not realizing the mistake,purnell then shot and wounded henry.consequently,henry filed this action under,and articles and of the maryland declaration of rights,claiming that purnell violated his right to be free from the use of excessive force during arrest.purnell moved for summary judgment,arguing that he did not violate henry rights and,in any event,that he is entitled to qualified immunity on the claim and maryland statutory immunity on the claim.the district court denied the motion,henry purnell,d,and purnell now appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order in part,vacate it in part,and remand this case for further proceedings.
we have jurisdiction to review final decisions of district courts,and a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.our jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of the denial of qualified immunity also provides a basis for consideration of other district court rulings that are inextricably intertwined with the decision of the lower court to deny qualified immunity or when consideration of the additional issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the qualified immunity question.taylor waters,cir.claims are inextricably intertwined when the resolution of one claim necessarily resolves the other claim.altman city of high point,cir.
qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular government conduct.saucier katz,d.thus,qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.
when a government official properly asserts qualified immunity,the threshold question that a court must answer is whether the facts,when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier,at.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.id.however,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established that is,whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
the answer to both saucier questions must be in the affirmative in order for a plaintiff to defeat a motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.batten gomez,cir the plaintiff bears the burden of proof on the first,whether a constitutional violation occurred.bryant muth,cir once the defendant raises a qualified immunity defense,the plaintiff carries the burden of showing that the defendant alleged conduct violated the law see also britton,d noting that the court qualified immunity holding in harlow related only to the scope of an affirmative defense and did not change the plaintiff burden of proving a constitutional violation carr deeds,cir affirming summary judgment in qualified immunity appeal because the plaintiff failed to bring forth admissible evidence from which the jury could conclude that the officer used excessive force figg schroeder,cir noting that a plaintiff must prove the illegality of the seizure.the defendant bears the burden of proof on the second,entitlement to qualified immunity.wilson kittoe,cir the burden of proof and persuasion with respect to a claim of qualified immunity is on the defendant official.see also bailey kennedy,cir same tanner hardy,cir it is a well established principle that qualified immunity is a matter on which the burden of proof is allocated to the defendants.logan shealy,cir the good faith immunity of individual police officers is an affirmative defense to be proved by the defendant dennis sparks,d noting that in a action the burden is on the official claiming immunity to demonstrate his entitlement but harlow,at.explaining that the court had not decided which party bears the burden of proof 
with these principles in mind,we begin our saucier analysis by considering the initial question of whether the facts,when viewed in henry favor,show that purnell used excessive force in arresting him and,therefore,violated his fourth amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure.see graham connor,d holding that all claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive or the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure of a free citizen should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard.purnell primarily argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because he did not seize henry within the meaning of the fourth amendment.see county of sacramento lewis,d noting that the fourth amendment covers only searches and seizures.
the first step in assessing whether purnell violated henry fourth amendment right is to determine the relevant facts.scott harris,d.because the parties do not challenge the district court basic statement of the underlying facts,which appear to be presented favorably for henry,we adopt and set forth that statement 
on october,an arrest warrant was issued for henry for failing to obey a court order to either pay his child support arrearage or report to a detention center to serve a jail sentence for failure to pay.on october,purnell went to henry last known address in eden,maryland,in an attempt to arrest him.the officer discovered henry at that address but henry avoided arrest by lying about his identity.soon thereafter,purnell learned that the man he had talked to was in fact henry.three days later,purnell noticed henry in a passing truck,followed him,and pulled into a driveway alongside the truck.purnell ordered henry out of the truck.henry complied but fled before he could be handcuffed.purnell claims henry pushed him in the course of escaping henry denies that occurred.in any event,purnell pulled out a glock caliber handgun and shot the fleeing henry in the elbow.henry stopped running and was arrested.
the parties have stipulated that purnell did not intend to shoot henry with his handgun.rather,he intended to unholster and discharge his taser,a device that immobilizes a suspect via an electromuscular disruption.the taser was holstered on purnell right side,just below his holstered handgun.purnell has testified on deposition that he reached for the taser because he felt endangered by henry actions.he asserts that he thought henry might be running to get a weapon.
purnell did not realize he had fired the handgun until after the weapon discharged.he immediately told henry and another witness at the scene that he had not meant to shoot henry and that he had grabbed the wrong weapon.henry,d at 
having identified the relevant facts,we now turn to the question of whether these facts establish that purnell seized henry within the meaning of the fourth amendment.a person is seized by the police and thus entitled to challenge the government action under the fourth amendment when the officer,by means of physical force or show of authority,terminates or restrains his freedom of movement,through means intentionally applied.brendlin california,d citations and internal punctuation omitted emphasis in original.purnell unquestionably terminated henry freedom of movement by means of physical force when he shot him however,he contends that because he intended to shoot henry with the taser,rather than the glock,he did not terminate henry freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.the district court rejected this argument,as do we.
in brower county of inyo,d,the court considered whether a complaint stated a fourth amendment claim based on allegations that police,by creating a roadblock to stop a vehicle involved in a chase,seized the driver of the vehicle when it crashed into the roadblock.the court noted that v iolation of the fourth amendment requires an intentional acquisition of physical control,and although a seizure occurs even when an unintended person or thing is the object of the detention or taking,the detention or taking itself must be willful.at.the court explained 
i f a parked and unoccupied police car slips its brake and pins a passerby against a wall,it is likely that a tort has occurred,but not a violation of the fourth amendment.and the situation would not change if the passerby happened,by lucky chance,to be a serial murderer for whom there was an outstanding arrest if,at the time he was thus pinned,he was in the process of running away from two pursuing constables.it is clear,in other words,that a fourth amendment seizure does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused termination of an individual freedom of movement the innocent passerby,nor even whenever there is a governmentally caused and governmentally desired termination of an individual freedom of movement the fleeing felon,but only when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.
id.at.emphasis in original.
the court then observed that a roadblock is designed to produce a stop by physical impact if voluntary compliance does not occur,and it rejected any inquiry into whether the police subjectively intended for the roadblock to cause the driver to stop on his own before crashing or whether the roadblock was designed to produce a collision.id.at.in doing so,the court cautioned against drawing too fine a line i n determining whether the means that terminates the freedom of movement is the very means that the government intended,or else courts will be driven to saying that one is not seized who has been stopped by the accidental discharge of a gun with which he was meant only to be bludgeoned,or by a bullet in the heart that was meant only for the leg.id.at.applying these principles,the court held 
we think it enough for a seizure that a person be stopped by the very instrumentality set in motion or put in place in order to achieve that result.it was enough here,therefore,that,according to the allegations of the complaint,brower was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the that he was so stopped.
we are not presented with a case where police stopped someone by mere happenstance,such as the passerby who is pinned when a police car slips its brake,or by the unintended consequences of an attempted seizure,such as the fleeing suspect who crashes his vehicle.instead,the undisputed evidence in the record establishes that purnell specific intent was to stop henry from fleeing by means of firing a weapon,and henry was in fact stopped by the very instrumentality,the glock that purnell set in motion.we recognize that purnell did not intend to use the glock,but we are also mindful of the brower court admonition that we should not draw too fine a line in determining whether the means that terminate a person freedom of movement is the very means that an officer intended.if,as the court noted,a seizure would occur when a person is stopped by the accidental discharge of a gun that an officer meant to use only as a club,then we believe that a seizure surely occurred here where purnell intended to stop henry by firing a weapon at him and succeeded in doing so accordingly,we affirm the portion of the district court order finding that purnell seized henry.see d at 
our determination that purnell seized henry does not end the inquiry as to whether a fourth amendment violation occurred.rather,we must next decide whether purnell acted unreasonably because the fourth amendment does not proscribe all seizures it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.florida jimeno,d.as noted,henry contends that purnell used excessive force while attempting to arrest him,thereby rendering the seizure unreasonable.
typically,the level of force that a plaintiff claims to be excessive is the level of force that a law enforcement officer intentionally used regardless,of course,of whether the officer intended the ultimate consequences.however,this case is atypical because henry claim is based on the fact that purnell shot him with the glock,which is not the level of force that purnell intended indeed,henry has stipulated that purnell intended to use the taser and used the glock only as the result of a mistake although we have rejected purnell argument that the fact of his mistake establishes that he did not seize henry,the fact of the mistake does bear on the question of whether the seizure was nonetheless reasonable because a mistaken understanding of the facts that is reasonable in the circumstances can render a seizure based on that understanding reasonable under the fourth amendment.milstead,at see also maryland garrison,d recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants mclenagan karnes,cir noting that does not purport to redress injuries resulting from reasonable mistakes.in accord with this principle,mistakes made by officers during the course of their duties have been held to be reasonable for fourth amendment purposes in a variety of circumstances.see,garrison,mistaken search of the wrong premises hill california,d mistaken arrest of the wrong person mazuz mistaken search of the wrong premises milstead mistaken fatal shooting of an innocent person.
the district court concluded that purnell was not entitled to summary judgment because of the existence of disputed facts concerning the objective reasonableness of his belief that he was firing a taser when he shot henry with a handgun.d at.combining its fourth amendment and qualified immunity discussions,the district court explained 
purnell violated henry fourth amendment rights if his belief he was using a taser was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances he was confronting,as he then reasonably perceived them to be.likewise,these rights were clearly established because under graham it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that it was unlawful to use deadly force on the basis of an objectively unreasonable belief about the nature of the weapon being discharged.
id.although the district court noted that a jury ultimately might agree that purnell conduct was objectively reasonable it then identified various facts purportedly in dispute that it deemed relevant to the reasonableness of purnell actions 
the nature of the training purnell had received to prevent incidents like this from happening,whether he acted in accordance with that training,whether he would have discovered that he was holding a handgun rather than a taser if,as he apparently had been trained to do,he had attempted to flip the thumb safety device on what he thought was the taser,whether henry trickery in eluding him three days before heightened purnell sense of danger,warranting the need for hurried action,or whether henry earlier trickery angered purnell,causing him to act with undue haste and inconsistently with his training.
id.the district court noted in conclusion that r esolution of any disputes about these facts and the effect of the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them must await trial.id.
before purnell moved for summary judgment,henry had filed a discovery motion seeking to compel purnell to produce certain documents that were used by the somerset county sheriff office,including training materials relating to the glock and taser.purnell objected to producing these documents on relevance grounds.on the day that purnell filed his summary judgment motion,henry requested that the district court rule promptly on the discovery motion,asserting that the discovery documents may prove to be vital to his summary judgment opposition.although there was some additional a
