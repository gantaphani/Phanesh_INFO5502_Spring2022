aaron james appeals the district court decision to grant summary judgment in a title vii case to his former employer hamilton,bah.this case centers on the reassignment of james from his role as project manager for bah contract with the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata.james continued to serve as a bah senior associate,but he was asked to focus on outside marketing and business development opportunities for the company,while continuing to work on the wmata contract.this role was consistent with preexisting responsibilities and goals that were laid out in his job description and annual evaluations.james continued to perform work,received a raise and a sizable bonus,and remained on course toward future promotion.we agree with the district court that the reassignment did not satisfy the threshold title vii requirement of an adverse employment action,and thus affirm the dismissal of the action.
appellant james is an african american male and an electrical engineer with more than experience in urban rail transportation.from october to may,james worked for the transportation practice group of bah.in he voluntarily left bah.two years later,he was recruited to return and rehired as a senior associate level iv,a promotion from his previous position.james job description envisioned his working multiple years as a senior associate and assuming a variety of roles.
from to february,james served as the project manager for bah contract with wmata.under this contract bah provided engineering services to prepare for and oversee the procurement of new rail cars for the metro system.gary schulman directly supervised james and served as the bah principal in charge of the wmata project which james managed.ghassan salameh,as a bah and the head of the transportation group,also oversaw james.during the time that james managed the wmata project,wmata expanding needs caused bah contract revenues to grow from approximately million to million annually.james eventually assumed responsibility for supervising a group of to thirty employees who worked on the wmata contract.
james title vii complaint focuses on bah decision to reassign him in february and on his subsequent annual performance evaluation.james received mixed evaluations that included both praise and criticism throughout his tenure at bah.james received a rating of effective in his annual bah evaluation.this evaluation noted that james needed to improve his personal time management practices and the timeliness of work delivery,to refine his client handling skills,and to build strong relationships with key wmata officials.james received the highest rating of excellent in his evaluation.but this evaluation noted difficulties in james relationship with his wmata counterpart,ray stoezer,which some reviewers attributed to james being too administratively focused and rigid.the evaluation directed james to expand his role in developing bah transportation practice by cultivating new clients and business opportunities.
during the spring of,bah responsibilities under the wmata contract greatly increased when wmata contracted with a foreign firm to build a new series of subway cars.simultaneously,wmata officials voiced concerns to salameh about bah level of support for the contract.on june,james responded to salameh request for input on how to improve bah performance by writing a memo that largely attributed bah problems to the shortcomings of his counterpart,wmata stoezer.salameh subsequently met with wmata deputy general manager and discussed how to resolve wmata concerns.on july,salameh submitted a proposal to wmata to provide additional staff support,and subsequently hired richard trabucco to serve as bah direct liaison with stoezer,so that james could focus on his managerial duties.
in september,james bypassed established channels of communication with the client and discussed parts of the wmata contract with a wmata senior executive without notifying stoezer or david tarantino,the wmata contracting officer responsible for the project.tarantino responded with a letter sharply criticizing james conduct.james supervisor gary schulman did not fire or reassign james after this incident.instead,schulman apologized to wmata officials for any misunderstandings,and proposed a series of meetings and other measures to avoid future miscommunication.
over the next several months,schulman and salameh continued to receive feedback from wmata officials and bah workers about shortcomings in the technical depth,support,and speed of turnaround of the consulting work that james oversaw.these complaints focused on the failures of an document control system,delays in laying out an inspection plan for the cars and in lining up qualified personnel for the inspections,and unsatisfactory draft specifications for an overhaul of wmata cars.
on december,wmata deputy general manager chuck thomas sent a letter to salameh reiterating that wmata wanted an organizational structure with a single point of contact.this letter noted that t o date,a major problem for the wmata pm stoezer has been associated with obtaining timely and reliable performance from the bah engineering support staff.this situation appears to be approaching resolution and the bah engineering and program support team performance has been improving since the arrival of richard trabucco.the district court made reference to this letter from the client in finding that bah had a legitimate business purpose in reassigning james.
in january,wmata and bah officials discussed a new organizational chart for the wmata contract in which james would retain a broad coordination and oversight role as director of projects.but bah program auditor burt and bah liaison to wmata trabucco reported to james supervisors,salameh and schulman,that wmata officials continued to have concerns about both bah performance under the contract and bah management structure.given these reports,documented client concerns,and a history of personal difficulties between james and his client counterparts,schulman and salameh decided to reassign james.
on february,bah reorganized the project and hired karl berger,a white male,to head the wmata contract.james was asked to focus on his preexisting marketing and business development objectives to identify and acquire new clients and new opportunities for bah.during this time james was no longer in a managerial role,but he continued to work as a staff member on parts of the wmata contract.this allowed james to continue to have billable hours,even while he focused his efforts on cultivating new business opportunities for bah.
from the time of james reassignment in february,to his resignation in july,james remained a senior associate level iv.he received a highly effective rating on his next annual evaluation,a five percent salary increase,and a bonus.this highly effective rating was lower than the excellent rating he received the year before,but it was higher than the effective rating he received in.
in march,one month after his reassignment,james founded an independent minority contractor business under the name of james transportation engineering consultants.he also applied to a bah competitor to serve as a subcontractor,a position he eventually accepted immediately prior to his resignation from bah in july.on march,james filed a charge of race discrimination against bah with the equal employment opportunity commission and prince george county human relations commission pgchrc,alleging that he had been treated differently than similarly situated white employees.after an investigation,the pgchrc dismissed the charge as unsubstantiated.
on october,james filed suit in the district court for the district of columbia alleging a discriminatory demotion and a new claim that his april annual evaluation of highly effective was tainted by racial bias.on march,james amended his complaint and dropped the allegations concerning his performance appraisal.however,james continued to rely extensively on this evaluation in his brief as evidence that he faced adverse employment action.the case was later transferred to the eastern district of virginia,and after discover
