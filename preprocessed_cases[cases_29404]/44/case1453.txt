appellants,roger and judy hoschar collectively appellants,filed this civil action in the circuit court of mason county,west virginia,against appellee,appalachian power company apco,and defendant,industrial contractors,ici,seeking damages for an infectious lung disease called histoplasmosis that roger hoschar allegedly contracted while working as a boilermaker at one of apco power plants.apco removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.appellants,west virginia residents,sought to remand the action to state court,arguing that apco principal place of business is in charleston,west virginia,and that complete diversity is therefore lacking.the district court denied appellants motion,concluding that under the nerve center test,apco principal place of business is in columbus,ohio.after discovery,the district court awarded summary judgment to apco,holding that,pursuant to west virginia law,apco did not owe a duty to hoschar.
in this appeal,appellants challenge both the district court denial of the motion to remand and the district court grant of apco motion for summary judgment.because the record amply demonstrates that the location where apco officers direct,control,and coordinate apco activities is columbus,ohio,we conclude that apco has carried its burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction.with respect to apco motion for summary judgment,we hold that apco did not have actual or constructive knowledge of a potential histoplasmosis risk,and therefore,apco did not owe hoschar a duty to guard against it.accordingly,we affirm.
apco owns the philip sporn power plant sporn near new haven,west virginia.sporn is a power plant,generating electricity by burning coal to create steam and then passing the steam through a turbine.the power plant has five precipitators,which remove granular ash particles fly ash from the gasses produced by burning coal.when in operation,a precipitator generates significant heat,which can cause corrosion to its exterior steel siding and result in fly ash leakage.
ici was hired by apco to perform general maintenance at sporn,which included welding metal patches to the exterior of the precipitators to prevent fly ash leakage.hoschar was a boilermaker employed by ici from march to march.during that time,he worked exclusively at sporn.his typical maintenance assignment consisted of hanging from a pick that is,a suspended platform like those used by window washers and welding steel patches over corroded portions of the ducts leading into and out of the unit precipitator unit.during his time at sporn,hoschar frequently worked in and around unit,spending by his estimate at least five months there.of note,he did not spend five consecutive months working on unit.rather,according to hoschar work records,he spent a total of days performing elevated welding work on the exterior of unit over the course of months.
before welding any steel patches,hoschar and other workers had to remove debris that had built up in the steel channels.because unit is an outdoor structure,pigeons sometimes perched on its steel channels and left their droppings behind.therefore,the debris usually consisted of approximately three to four inch accumulations of bird manure and two inch accumulations of fly ash.hoschar removed the debris from the steel channels either by hand,with a wire brush,or using compressed air.when removing debris and while welding the steel patches,hoschar wore a respirator over his face.
in march,hoschar was terminated from his employment with ici.in,as part of a routine preoperative test before hoschar underwent knee surgery,which was unrelated to his work at sporn,a chest revealed the presence of a mass on his right lung.hoschar physician feared the mass was cancerous and recommended he undergo a lobectomy to remove the portion of his lung containing the mass.after a portion of hoschar lung was removed,a biopsy revealed that the mass was not cancer,but instead was a disease called histoplasmosis.
histoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by inhaling the spores of a naturally occurring fungus called histoplasma capsulatum.the histoplasma capsulatum fungus is endemic in the ohio valley region,in which sporn is located,because it grows best in soils with high nitrogen content.once an individual inhales the fungus,it colonizes the lungs.however,the vast majority of people infected by histoplasmosis do not experience any symptoms of infection or suffer any ill effects.
while hoschar was working at sporn,the occupational safety and health administration osha website maintained a page entitled,respiratory protection hazard recognition.one of the reference documents found on that page was a publication by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh called,histoplasmosis protecting workers at risk the niosh publication.the niosh publication explained that the histoplasma capsulatum fungus seems to grow best in soils having a high nitrogen content,especially those enriched with bird manure or bat droppings.at it further noted that the fungus can be carried on the wings,feet,and beaks of birds and infect soil under roosting sites or manure accumulations inside or outside buildings.id.
on january,appellants sued apco and ici for negligence in the circuit court for mason county,west virginia,seeking damages for hoschar histoplasmosis infection.appellants allege hoschar contracted histoplasmosis while working at sporn as a result of inhaling contaminated dust when he swept out the mixtures of bird manure and fly ash that had accumulated in unit steel channels.appellants also allege apco did not provide any written or verbal warnings concerning the presence of aged bird manure around unit or of the health risks associated with accumulations of bird manure,such as histoplasmosis.
on march,apco removed this action to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia pursuant to,explaining that apco principal place of business is in columbus,ohio,and complete diversity therefore exists between appellants and apco and ici appellants filed a motion to remand the case to state court on march,arguing that apco principal place of business is in charleston,west virginia,and complete diversity is thus lacking.
prior to the initiation of this lawsuit,appellants counsel representing other clients also west virginia residents in a different case also pending in the southern district of west virginia against apco took the deposition of mark dempsey,apco vice president of external affairs.the deposition was conducted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which required apco to designate a representative to testify about topics relating to apco principal place of business.after taking the deposition,plaintiff counsel in that case filed a motion to remand the action to west virginia state court.that case settled,however,before a decision on the motion to remand was issued.because the same jurisdictional issue arises in this litigation,appellants attached dempsey rule b deposition taken in the other case to his motion to remand in this case.in opposing appellants motion,apco submitted an affidavit from dempsey.the following description of the facts relevant to apco principal place of business is based on dempsey deposition testimony and his affidavit.
apco a subsidiary of american electric power company aep is incorporated in virginia and maintains offices in charleston,west virginia and columbus,ohio.
in his deposition,dempsey testified that the charleston office is an administrative office,but they refer to it as headquarters.in fact,apco website lists charleston as its headquarters.with respect to apco charleston office being referred to as apco headquarters,dempsey testified,headquarters is probably a misnomer when applied to apco.id.at.he explained that it became known as the headquarters simply because apco former president,dana waldo,lived in charleston.waldo is no longer employed by apco.
according to dempsey,of apco officers,only the following five officers work in the charleston office.charles patton,apco president and chief operating officer,oversees and directs all aspects of apco operations from charleston.he coordinates the allocation of apco resources as well as apco communication with employees and the public.with respect to the employees who report directly to him,patton performs a number of administrative tasks,including evaluating job performance and assigning goals.patton also acts as apco chief representative with the regulatory agencies in west virginia,virginia,and tennessee.in addition to patton,philip wright,apco vice president of distribution,is responsible for overseeing apco electricity distribution operation,which involves the actual delivery of electricity to residential and business customers.dempsey himself interacts with state and local governments and monitors legislation that affects apco business.jeff lafleur,apco vice president of generating assets,oversees the operation of apco power plants.lastly,chris potter,apco vice president of regulatory affairs,oversees apco regulatory operations in west virginia,virginia,and tennessee.
the remaining out of apco officers maintain their offices in columbus,ohio.these officers include the chief executive officer,chief financial officer,secretary,and treasurer.in addition,all nine of apco directors are based in columbus.from its columbus office,apco officers are responsible for deciding the location and construction of power plants and transmission lines operating hydroelectric facilities,pump storage facilities,power plants,and gas power plants negotiating and executing contracts for the procurement of fuel for those generating plants handling environmental permitting for work at apco west virginia generating plants negotiating and executing contracts to purchase fleet vehicles collecting and disbursing revenues calculating and paying taxes owed on its west virginia facilities controlling and directing filings made with the securities and exchange commission the sec and the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc determining human resource policies and codes of conduct and overseeing apco legal affairs.
the district court considered these facts and denied appellants motion to remand,finding that columbus,ohio,is apco principal place of business.the court explained that although many of the business activities of apco are conducted in charleston,the ultimate power,which directs,controls,and coordinates the activities of apco,is carried out in columbus.hoschar appalachian power,wl,at.may.therefore,the district court concluded that complete diversity existed between the parties and that federal jurisdiction was proper.
after the completion of discovery,apco and ici filed separate motions for summary judgment,which the district court granted on november,see hoschar appalachian power,d.with respect to apco motion for summary judgment,the district court held that,as a matter of law,the histoplasmosis hazard posed by the accumulations of aged bird manure was not reasonably foreseeable to apco,and apco therefore did not owe hoschar a duty to protect against it.see hoschar,d at.appellants timely appealed both the district court denial of the motion to remand and the district court grant of apco motion for summary judgment.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
like all questions implicating the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts,we review de novo the denial of a motion to remand to state court.lontz tharp,cir citing dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc.the burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction is placed upon the party seeking removal.mulcahey columbia organic chemicals,cir citing wilson republic iron steel.we review the district court factual findings with respect to jurisdiction for clear error.velasco gov t of indonesia,cir.
we review a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.glynn edo,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.glynn,at.however,to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists,the party must set forth specific facts that go beyond the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence.id.quoting anderson liberty lobby.
the threshold issue we must resolve is whether the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute.appellants contend that in analyzing this question,the district court erroneously held that complete diversity existed among the parties after incorrectly concluding that apco principal place of business is in columbus,ohio,rather than in charleston,west virginia.appellants argue that the district court incorrectly applied the nerve center test,as set forth by the supreme court in hertz friend.according to appellants,both they and apco are west virginia citizens,which means diversity jurisdiction does not exist.we disagree.
although originally filed in west virginia state court,apco removed this action to federal court pursuant to.section provides,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.a.
apco claimed basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction in support of removal was diversity of citizenship.pursuant to,a federal district court has original jurisdiction over all civil actions between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy exceed.a.section requires complete diversity among the parties,meaning the citizenship of each plaintiff must be different from the citizenship of each defendant.see caterpillar lewis.for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.c.
in determining a corporation principal place of business,we previously employed two tests the nerve center test and the place of operations test.see athena,inc digregorio,cir.however,the supreme court in hertz definitively held that,for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,a corporation principal place of business is its nerve center.hertz,at.accordingly,we apply the nerve center test to determine whether apco principal place of business is in charleston,west virginia or columbus,ohio.
in hertz,the supreme court rejected the more general business activities test,which measured the amount of business a corporation conducted in a particular state to determine its principal place of business.see hertz,at.the court explained,administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute,and the nerve center approach is simple to apply comparatively speaking.id.at emphasis in original.nevertheless,the supreme court recognized that there will be hard cases.id.at.for instance,in this era of telecommuting,some corporations may divide their command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations,perhaps communicating over the internet.id.at.even under these circumstances,however,the nerve center test points courts in a single direction,towards the center of overall direction,control,and coordination.id.at.although the nerve center test will not,in all instances,automatically generate a result,it nonetheless provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply.id.
as the supreme court explained,the phrase principal place of business refers to the place where the corporation high level officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities.hertz,at.this is the corporation nerve center.id.at.while the court noted that in practice,the nerve center should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters,for a headquarters to qualify as the nerve center,it must be the actual center of direction,control,and coordination,and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings for example,attended by directors and officers who had traveled there for the occasion.id.at.similarly,if the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipulation for example,that the alleged nerve center is nothing more than a mail drop box,a bare office with a computer,or the location of an annual executive retreat courts should analyze the place of actual direction,control,and coordination,in the absence of such manipulation.id.at.
the supreme court acknowledged that the nerve center test may in some cases produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale for.hertz,at.as an illustration,the court explained 
i f the bulk of a company business activities visible to the public take place in new jersey,while its top officers direct those activities just across the river in new york,the principal place of business is new york.one could argue that members of the public in new jersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the corporation than persons in new the corporation will still be entitled to remove a new jersey state case to federal court.and note too that the same corporation would be unable to remove a new york state case to federal court,despite the new york public presumed prejudice against the corporation.
id.emphasis in original.despite such seeming anomalies,we must accept them in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule.id.indeed,a ccepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system.id.
to date,the only decision from this circuit to apply hertz is central west virginia energy mountain state carbon,llc,cir.the plaintiff in mountain state carbon was a west virginia corporation,and it brought suit in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.id.at.one of the defendants,severstal wheeling,filed a motion to dismiss due to a lack of complete diversity,arguing that its principal place of business was in wheeling,west virginia.id.at.we applied hertz nerve center test and held that severstal wheeling principal place of business was in dearborn,michigan,which was where the majority of corporate officers were located and where those officers were responsible for oversight and strategic.id.at.
in support of our holding in mountain state carbon,we focused particularly on the location with a critical mass of controlling corporate officers,observing that s even of severstal wheeling eight corporate officers including its chief executive officer,chief operating officer,chief financial officer,and general counsel and secretary all maintain their offices in dearborn,michigan.at.only the eighth corporate officer,a vice president and general manager,maintains his office in wheeling,west virginia.id.as such,we explained that even though the operations are conducted in wheeling,severstal wheeling has fail ed to show how any of this is relevant to the nerve center test under hertz.id.we concluded that if a corporation operations are managed in one state,while its officers make significant corporate decisions and set corporate policy in another,the principal place of business is the latter.see id.at.
in view of the legal principles outlined above,we conclude apco has met its burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction.in this case,the record demonstrates that the place where apco officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities is columbus,ohio.hertz,at.
apco entire board of directors is located in columbus.additionally,from its office in columbus,out of apco officers including its chief executive officer,chief financial officer,secretary,and treasurer make significant corporate decisions and set corporate policy such that they direct,control,and coordinate apco activities.together,they decide the location and construction of power plants and transmission lines,and they negotiate and execute contracts for the procurement of fuel for apco hydroelectric facilities,pump storage facilities,power plants,and gas power plants all of which are decisions at the core of apco business.the columbus officers handle environmental permitting for work at apco west virginia facilities and calculate and pay taxes owed on these facilities.moreover,they collect and disburse revenues,control and direct the filings made with the sec and the ferc,determine human resource policies and codes of conduct,and oversee apco legal affairs.
on the other hand,only five out of apco officers are based in charleston,west virginia.the charleston officers are responsible for implementing the directives received from columbus and for managing apco operations in west virginia,virginia,and tennessee.for example,patton oversees all aspects of apco operations.wright oversees apco distribution operations is,the guys in the line trucks and the service trucks.dempsey interacts with state and local government and monitors legislation,while lafleur oversees the operation of apco power plants.and,finally,potter oversees the regulatory operations in west virginia,virginia,and tennessee.
the responsibilities of apco officers are exactly the kinds of operations and public interface that we found insufficient in mountain state carbon to support a finding that west virginia is the corporation nerve center.see mountain state carbon,at.indeed,the corporation operations are not relevant to the nerve center test under hertz.id.at.when a corporation operations are managed in one state and its officers make significant corporate decisions and set corporate policy in another,the corporation nerve center and principal place of business is the latter.see id.at.the record demonstrates that apco operations are managed in charleston,while its officers direct,control,and coordinate apco activities from columbus.therefore,apco principal place of business is in columbus,ohio.
appellants further contend the district court misapplied the nerve center test by looking to the location of ultimate control over apco activities,rather than the location of actual control over apco activities.see appellants br.this is a distinction without a difference.first,looking to the location of ultimate control over a corporation activities is not inconsistent with hertz.this is because ultimate control is actual control,provided that ultimate control amounts to directing,controlling,and coordinating the corporation activities.see hertz,at explaining that some corporations divide their command among different locations but that the nerve center test points courts in a single direction,towards the center of overall direction,control,and coordination emphasis supplied.
moreover,the supreme court use of the word actual was simply in the context of distinguishing a nominal nerve center from a legitimate nerve center.see hertz,at explaining that normally the corporation nerve center is its headquarters,provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction,control,and coordination and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings emphasis supplied id.at explaining that if the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipulation,the courts should instead take as the nerve center the place of actual direction,control,and coordination emphasis supplied.therefore,under either phrasing,apco principal place of business is in columbus,ohio,because that is the location where apco officers direct,control,and coordinate its activities actually and ultimately 
finally,appellants argue that apco nerve center must be charleston because some of apco officers have referred to the charleston office as the company headquarters.and,indeed,apco website lists charleston as its headquarters.however,dempsey rule b deposition clarified that the use of the term headquarters to refer to apco charleston office was a misnomer.rather,as dempsey affidavit makes clear,the decisions that is,setting the overarching direction and control of apco occur in columbus.to hold otherwise would run afoul of hertz.
as the supreme court in hertz explained,in practic
