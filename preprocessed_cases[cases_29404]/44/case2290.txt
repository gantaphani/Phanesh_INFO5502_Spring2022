plaintiffs,elizabeth gass and deborah dejonge,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants,ecolab,ecolab and marriott hotel services,marriott.plaintiffs sued defendants under michigan law,claiming that they were poisoned by pesticides during their stay at a marriott hotel in maui,hawaii.plaintiffs allege that employees of ecolab,which provides extermination services for marriott,sprayed their belongings with an unknown pesticide and filled their hotel room with toxic vapors,causing plaintiffs to become ill.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,holding that no reasonable jury could conclude that defendants negligence caused plaintiffs injuries.we disagree,and accordingly reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand this case to the district court for trial.
background 
factual history 
on september,plaintiffs were guests in a maui hotel operated by marriott.that day,dejonge filed a complaint with the hotel after she discovered a dead cockroach in her room,and a hotel employee eventually removed the roach.the next day,while plaintiffs were away from their room,three employees of ecolab entered plaintiffs room,bringing with them at least one unidentified pesticide.ecolab provides pest extermination services to marriott.
plaintiffs exposure to pesticides 
although the parties offer opposing views of what happened while the ecolab exterminators were in plaintiffs hotel room,defendants concede that the summary judgment standard requires this court to credit plaintiffs testimony regarding the exterminators actions.according to plaintiff dejonge,she was relaxing on the beach with plaintiff gass when she decided to retrieve lunch money from the hotel room.dejonge left the beach and walked to the hotel room,entering through a sliding glass door.immediately upon entry,she discovered three men in the room.two of the men were wearing metal tanks on their backs and masks on their faces,and were spraying a chemical from those tanks.according to dejonge,there was a thick,horrid,acrid putrid odor in the room,and the air was sort of cloudy.dejonge also states that the haze of chemicals in the room was so thick that she could see it,smell it,taste it,feel it.
upon noticing the three men,dejonge immediately began screaming at the men to stop spraying,and accused them of ruining her stuff,much of which was laid out in suitcases on the floor.in response to her demands,dejonge testified that one of the men shot her a dirty look,yelled something in a language she did not understand,and resumed spraying.at this point,dejonge picked up the phone,called the hotel desk,and asked for the manager to meet her outside of the hotel room.she then left the room to wait for the manager.
when the manager arrived,dejonge relayed what had happened in the room,and demanded that they be given a new room immediately because we need to get our stuff out of there before it gets more ruined.dejonge added that i ca stand the smell in there.i think it making me sick.id.the manager acquiesced,and called a bellhop to help dejonge move her belongings to a new room.dejonge then left to find gass and let her know what happened.
dejonge found gass and explained why they needed to retrieve their belongings and switch rooms.by the end of this conversation,which lasted about six or seven minutes,dejonge began to feel ill.nevertheless,both women returned to the room,where they spent about minutes gathering their belongings.neither dejonge nor gass identified the specific chemical that ecolab used to fumigate their room.
although defendants concede that the summary judgment standard requires that this court accept plaintiffs version of events,defendants offer a different version of how the exterminators acted.according to testimony by michael medeiros,an ecolab exterminator,he and one entered plaintiffs room just thirty seconds before dejonge arrived.according to medeiros,neither ecolab employee had sprayed any pesticides before dejonge entered the room.medeiros claims that his made two quick squirts of an insecticide from an aerosol can similar to those commercially available at retail stores,and that no other chemicals were sprayed in the room.medeiros further testified that,immediately after the exterminator made these quick squirts,dejonge became very upset,and began yelling at medeiros and his.id.the two men left the room,and medeiros claims that he heard dejonge say my stuff is ruined as they were leaving.id.
medeiros also testified regarding the kinds of chemicals ecolab typically used in servicing the marriott hotel,identifying three kinds of insecticides used to target cockroaches.the first,and least potent,of these chemicals is a pesticide called,which is normally sprayed from a aerosol can.additionally,medeiros identified two pesticides suspend sc and demand cs that were commonly used by ecolab at the time of plaintiffs trip to hawaii.suspend sc and demand cs are sold in concentrated form,then mixed with water in a pump sprayer or similar container to apply the pesticide.medeiros claims that,on september,the day plaintiffs room was sprayed,only was used,and a report he filed that day corroborates his claim.
plaintiffs illness 
a short time after their exposure to pesticides in the hotel room,plaintiffs contacted the hotel manager and complained of numbness to their tongues,stomach aches,and seeing stars.the manager arranged transportation to a nearby urgent care center,and plaintiffs received medication for their symptoms.
upon their return to michigan,plaintiffs initially sought treatment from robert dejonge,an osteopathic physician and plaintiff dejonge husband dejonge,however,eventually referred plaintiffs to gerald natzke,a physician specializing in environmental medicine during her appointment with natzke on october,dejonge informed natzke that she had developed various symptoms within fifteen minutes of her exposure to the pesticides,including a headache,swelling of her tongue,hands,feet and face,profuse itching,dizziness,shortness of breath and drooling.by the time of her appointment,dejonge symptoms included a slurring and swollen tongue,complaints of a foul taste in her mouth,drooling and complaints of fatigue and pain in her muscles and joints,in addition to a need to take afternoon naps which was the case before the incident on september,diarrhea and a droopy left eye.id.
gass had her first appointment with natzke on october,and complained of achiness all over,chills,sweats,fever,blisters on her tongue,droopiness on the right side of her face,muscle spasms,dizziness,blurred vision and memory problems.like dejonge,gass told natzke that within ten to fifteen minutes of her exposure to the pesticides,she developed weakness and fatigue and had a tongue which she said turned black about weeks later.id.
according to natzke,both women also exhibited neurological symptoms,including brain fog,memory loss and mood swings.he administered a visual contrast sensitivity test to gass,which natzke said she failed miserably and had one of the worst test results i have seen.id.gass poor performance on the vision test indicated to natzke that she was exposed to neurotoxins.id.natzke added that a ll pesticides contain neurotoxins.id.natzke also noted that both women exhibited black tongues at some point since he began treating them,a symptom that he attributed to pesticides in their system.id.
based on their symptoms,natzke diagnosed both dejonge and gass with acute pesticide exposure.however,he could not identify the particular pesticide to which plaintiffs were exposed.although a test for pyrethroids and other chemical compounds found in the least potent of the three pesticides purportedly used at the marriott in maui did not reveal detectable levels of such compounds in plaintiffs systems,natzke did not rule out the possibility that gass and dejonge were exposed to because the concentration of chemicals from the pesticide contamination would have been diluted in their blood by the time i saw them in.natzke did not test plaintiffs for other toxins because there are tens of thousands of chemicals and it is impossible to test for all such chemicals without specifically knowing what chemical a person was exposed to.id.
defendants experts 
despite the uncertainty regarding which toxin or toxins plaintiffs were exposed to,defendants introduced substantial expert testimony indicating that could not have caused the symptoms experienced by plaintiffs.first,defendants point to a report by marcia van germert,a toxicologist with a doctorate in pharmacology and biochemistry.although van germert did not examine the toxic effects of any substance other than,she concludes that no peer reviewed study demonstrates that the chemicals in have ever produced a toxic effect in humans,or produced the symptoms alleged by the plaintiffs when those chemicals are used merely for crack and crevice application.
similarly,the record contains a report by james wedner,md,chief of the division of allergy and immunology medicine of the washington university school of medicine.according to wedner,throughout the ages there have been individuals who have developed conditions that have defied characterization.wedner suggests that plaintiffs may be suffering from such a condition which do es not seem to have an obvious cause.id.nevertheless,wedner concluded that neither gass nor dejonge suffered any health problems that are related to their potential exposure to sic in their hotel room in maui on september.wedner provides no analysis regarding the possible effect of suspend sc,demand cs,or any other pesticide on plaintiffs 
finally,the record contains a report by elissa benedek,md,a clinical psychiatrist who holds faculty appointments at three universities.benedek attempts to dismiss plaintiffs symptoms as merely psychosomatic,concluding that both dejonge and gass have demonstrated a tendency to react to stress in the past with physical symptoms,and now continue to react to psychological stressors with physical symptoms and complaints,according to benedek,gass and dejonge symptoms resulted from nothing more than a psychological reaction to stress.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs filed this diversity case in the western district of michigan on december,alleging that defendants negligently exposed them to pesticides and that this exposure was the cause of their subsequent illness.after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.on may,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
choice of law 
federal courts sitting in diversity apply the choice of law provisions of the forum state.nilac int l mktg.group ameritech,cir.because plaintiffs filed this case in the western district of michigan,michigan choice of law provisions apply.id.
michigan choice of law provisions favor allowing michigan residents to bring suit in michigan courts under michigan law.see olmstead anderson.generally speaking,a tort claim filed in a michigan court will be governed by michigan law unless a rational reason exists to displace it.watkins son pet supplies iams,cir quoting olmstead,at.moreover,the fact that a tort took place outside of michigan is not itself a sufficient reason to apply a different state law.see olmstead,at holding that the fact that an accident occurred outside of michigan is of no great or particular significance in determining which state law to apply in a tort suit.additionally,although michigan courts recognize that applying michigan law rather than the law of the state in which the tort allegedly took place might lead to forum shopping,t here is no concern when the forum is also the plaintiff state of citizenship.id.at.
plaintiffs are michigan residents,and they present no arguments why the law of hawaii or any other state should apply.accordingly,we see no reason to displace michigan presumption that michigan substantive law governs tort suits brought within its borders.see id.at.however,under erie railroad tompkins,federal law governs procedural issues,including evidentiary rulings made pursuant to the federal rules of evidence.legg chopra,cir.
ii.the admissibility of plaintiffs experts testimony 
standard of review 
we review a district court ruling regarding the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.aetna cas.sur.leahey const,cir.in the context of an evidentiary ruling,abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made regarding admission of evidence.id.quoting polk yellow freight,cir.
as a threshold matter,plaintiffs contest the district court decision to exclude statements by dejonge and natzke as unreliable opinion testimony.generally,a treating physician may provide expert testimony regarding a patient illness,the appropriate diagnosis for that illness,and the cause of the illness.see fielden csx,cir.however,a treating physician testimony remains subject to the requirement set forth in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,that an expert opinion testimony must have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline.id.at.under daubert,before allowing an expert testimony to be considered by the jury,a trial court should consider whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the expert testimony is scientifically valid and whether that reasoning or methodology properly could be applied to the facts at issue to aid the trier of fact.united states smithers,cir.
in assessing whether dejonge and natzke testimony satisfies the requirements of daubert,the district court concluded that dejonge and natzke could testify as to plaintiffs symptoms,tests,diagnosis,and treatment.gass marriott hotel,d.the district court determined that both doctors are experienced physicians and are qualified to diagnose medical conditions and treat patients.id.at.however,with respect to the doctors causation opinions,the district court concluded that natzke and dejonge have not demonstrated a scientifically reliable method to support their conclusions as to causation in this particular matter and may not be permitted to testify as to the cause of plaintiffs symptoms.id.at.the district court reasoned that t he ability to diagnose medical conditions is not remotely the same as the ability to deduce,delineate,and describe,in a scientifically reliable manner,the causes of those medical conditions.id.at quoting wynacht beckman instruments,d.because natzke and dejonge have not based their causation opinions on any testing data,and the only blood tests which natzke relied on did not reveal any detectable levels for the products the lab tested for,the district court found that neither physician had a scientific basis for their causation opinion.id.at,
insofar as the district court permitted dejonge and natzke to offer a diagnosis,while excluding testimony on matters outside of their professional experience,the district court decision is similar to dickenson cardiac thoracic surgery of eastern,cir.in dickenson,we considered the expert testimony of johnson,a cardiac surgeon,regarding the cause of a patient brain injuries.johnson testified that the patient injuries resulted from premature removal of her ventilation tube,id.at,and that the patient cardiac surgeon was responsible for the decision to prematurely extubate the patient,id.at.in holding that johnson could testify that the patient suffered injuries as a result of premature extubation,the court in dickenson disagreed with the district court conclusion that,because johnson was neither a pulmonologist nor familiar with scholarly literature in the field of pulmonology,he was not qualified to provide expert testimony regarding whether the patient should have been extubated.id.at.
according to dickenson,a physician need not demonstrate a familiarity with accepted medical literature or published standards in an area of specialization in order for his testimony to be reliable in the sense contemplated by federal rule of evidence.id.rather,the text of rule expressly contemplates that an expert may be qualified on the basis of experience.id.quoting.advisory committee note see also kumho tire,carmichael,d n o one denies that an expert might draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized experience.the exclusion of a medical doctor professional opinion,rooted in that doctor extensive relevant experience,is rarely justified in cases involving medical experts as opposed to supposed experts in the area of product liability.dickenson,at.because johnson stated in his affidavit that he is involved with extubation decisions on almost a daily basis,the court concluded that his significant experience qualified him to testify as to whether another physician prematurely extubated a patient.id.at.
the court in dickenson reached the opposite conclusion with respect to johnson testimony that the patient cardiac opposed to the patient at fault for the decision to prematurely extubate the patient.id.at.the court reasoned that there was no support for johnson opinion that the patient cardiac surgeon was at fault for the premature extubation because johnson testified to nothing in his experience which supported his theory that the cardiac surgeon was somehow responsible for the pulmonologist decision.thus,dickenson stands for the proposition that a medical doctor is generally competent to testify regarding matters within his or her own professional experience.see id.at.when,however,the doctor strays from such professional knowledge,his or her testimony becomes less reliable,and more likely to be excluded under rule.see id.at.
in light of this reading of dickenson,we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion.both dejonge and natzke relied on professional experience in diagnosing and treating plaintiffs.specifically,natzke stated in an affidavit that he relied on his experience treating thousands of patients for environmental medicine issues including pesticide other chemical contamination.under dickenson,both dejonge and natzke are competent to testify with respect to plaintiffs diagnosis to the extent that they rely on professional education or experience.see at.conversely,nothing in dejonge or natzke medical expertise would provide a basis to determine the exact chemical plaintiffs were exposed to at the marriott hotel.in addition,because defendants did not disclose that plaintiffs possibly were exposed to demand cs or suspend sc until very late in the discovery process,the doctors could not run tests to determine whether plaintiffs actually were exposed to such chemicals,which would have provided a basis for the doctors causation opinion.accordingly,similar to the expert witness in dickenson who lacked a basis in experience or personal knowledge regarding which doctor made the decision to prematurely extubate a patient and,as a result,could not testify regarding which doctor ordered the extubation,dejonge and natzke can not rely on their general knowledge of pesticides to testify regarding the specific pesticide that caused plaintiffs symptoms,or when plaintiffs exposure to that pesticide occurred.
the district court correctly permitted dejonge and natzke to testify regarding their diagnosis of plaintiffs,and properly excluded their testimony regarding where and when plaintiffs were exposed to pesticides.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting dejonge and natzke testimony to matters within their professional experience or personal knowledge.
iii.the district court grant of summary judgment 
standard of review 
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants with respect to plaintiffs negligence claims.gass,d at.a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.farhat jopke,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment should be affirmed when the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact as to an essential element of the party case.c.an issue of fact is genuine if a reasonable person could return a verdict for the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.after the moving party has satisfied its burden,the burden shifts to the party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.when no genuine issues of material fact exist,this court reviews de novo the district court conclusions of substantive law.farhat,at.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the grounds that,absent expert testimony linking plaintiffs symptoms to a particular pesticide,no reasonable jury could have found that defendants negligently caused plaintiffs illness.we agree.
we first emphasize that,in deciding a motion for summary judgment,we must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of plaintiffs as the party,and plaintiffs evidence is to be believed.martin toledo cardiology consultants,cir citing liberty lobby,at.according to plaintiff dejonge,she returned to her hotel room to find men in masks spraying chemicals.she testified that there was a thick,horrid,acrid putrid odor in the room,and that the air was sort of cloudy.the haze of chemicals in the room was so thick that she could see it,smell it,taste it,feel it.within fifteen minutes of her exposure to the cloud,dejonge claims that she became ill.similarly,plaintiff gass testified that she began to experience symptoms shortly after her exposure to the cloud of pesticides in the hotel room.we conclude that,should a jury credit plaintiffs testimony and the other evidence supporting plaintiffs claim,a reasonable jury could find that defendants are liable for causing plaintiffs injuries.
plaintiffs claim that defendants negligence caused their illnesses.accordingly,as in any case alleging simple negligence under michigan law,plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendant owed them a duty of care,that defendant breached that duty,that plaintiffs were injured,and that defendant breach caused plaintiffs injuries.henry dow chem.defendants argue on appeal,and the district court held,that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate both that defendants breached a duty of care and that such a breach caused plaintiffs injuries.we consider each of these arguments below.
duty of care 
defendants characterize plaintiffs negligence claim as an allegation that defendants violated the professional standard of care governing exterminators,and therefore conclude that plaintiffs claim must fail because plaintiffs failed to present expert testimony to establish the standard of care applicable to exterminators.the dissent agrees and,although it acknowledges that the case is not a professional care case,dissenting op.at,it argues that,i n michigan,expert testimony in professional negligence and toxic tort cases like this one is required to avoid summary judgment,id.however,michigan law does not require expert testimony under the circumstances presented in this case.the cases the dissent cites,such as lince monson,address medical malpractice claims against,for example,a surgeon performing a complex medical procedure,not an exterminator spraying pesticides.
the dissent also asserts that these cases require expert testimony in complex,professional,or negligence cases.dissenting op.at.while the dissent statement is literally malpractice cases do involve complex,professional,and dissent use of such cases to require plaintiffs to produce expert testimony under the circumstances is entirely misleading.in the medical malpractice context,as demonstrated by the cases the dissent relies on,the applicable standard of care generally is beyond the ken of laymen.thomas mcpherson cmty.health.as a result,in an action for malpractice against a hospital,expert testimony is required to establish the applicable standard of conduct,the breach of that standard,and causation.id.as the michigan supreme court has recognized,proving negligence and causation in medical malpractice cases is different than in ordinary negligence cases.in a case involving conduct,like that of a surgeon,resting upon judgment,opinion,or theory,the ordinary rules for determining negligence do not prevail.lince,at internal quotation marks omitted citation omitted.pervasively spraying pesticides within an enclosed room inhabited by humans,however,is not conduct resting upon judgment,opinion,or theory,and is not a matter of special knowledge strictly involving professional skill.id.although michigan courts require plaintiffs to produce an expert in medical malpractice cases to explain the applicable standard of care,michigan law does not require plaintiffs to present expert testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to spraying chemicals in the confined quarters of an occupied room.
accordingly,plaintiffs claim in the present case that defendants negligently sprayed pesticides is more akin to an ordinary negligence case than a claim involving professional negligence.the dissent attempt to classify plaintiffs claim as one involving professional negligence is not supported by michigan case law.thus,even in the absence of expert testimony regarding how the room should have been sprayed or how the risk of chemical poisoning should have been reduced,dissenting op.at,michigan law does not prevent plaintiffs from avoiding summary judgment in the absence of expert testimony where the factfinder is able to weigh and evaluate the evidence based on his or her ordinary experience.
through their testimony,plaintiffs allege that men in masks entered their hotel room and,despite the presence of plaintiffs suitcases and similar indications that the room was in use,sprayed such a thick concentration of pesticides that a thick,horrid,acrid,putrid cloud of toxic chemicals filled the room.expert testimony is not necessary to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that such actions are negligent,inasmuch as an ordinary person understands that it is unacceptable to enter a place where another is residing and fill that place with airborne poison,without providing for evacuation of the inhabitants,appropriate ventilation,or taking other precautions.
plaintiffs also have introduced evidence indicating that defendants were aware of potential injuries that result from contact with at least two of the pesticides commonly used in exterminating cockroaches.by federal regulation,manufacturers of hazardous chemicals must produce a material safety data sheet msds,and employers using such chemicals must keep a copy of the msds for each chemical that they use.g.each msds must detail t he health hazards of the hazardous chemical,including signs and symptoms of exposure,and any medical conditions which are generally recognized as being aggravated by exposure to the chemical.g iv.according to the msds for suspend sc,one of the pesticides used by defendants,suspend sc is h armful if inhaled,and the msds warns that a person who does inhale the product should be remove d to fresh air and given medical attention.the msds for demand cs offers even more serious warnings,instructing persons who may come in contact with the pesticide to wear protective clothing to avoid u nprotected contact with the chemical,and to either ensure that areas where demand cs is being applied are or to have persons in the area wear respirators.indeed,mere skin contact with demand cs is dangerous,and the msds for this pesticide warns that if the pesticide gets on a person skin or clothing,that person should t ake off contaminated clothing,r inse skin immediately with plenty of water for minutes,and c all the manufacturer,a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.
a reasonable person would understand that he or she could seriously injure another person by filling an occupied hotel room with a cloud of toxic or hazardous chemicals.based on this fact,and the evidenced introduced by plaintiffs indicating that defendants were aware that at least some of the chemicals they routinely use could cause serious illness,a jury reasonably could find that defendants were negligent in inundating an occupied hotel room with pesticide spray in the absence of any warnings to the occupants.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the ground that plaintiffs failed to introduce expert testimony establishing that defendants breached a duty of care.
defendants offer two arguments supporting their belief that no reasonable jury could find that the chemicals plaintiffs allegedly were exposed to caused their illness.first,defendants argue that,because plaintiffs do not know exactly which chemical they were exposed to,a reasonable jury could not conclude that they were exposed to a chemical,dispensed by these defendants,which could have caused their particular symptoms.additionally,defendants claim that expert testimony is required to establish causation.neither of these claims has merit.
defendants use three different chemicals to exterminate cockroaches at the marriott in maui,demand cs,and suspend sc,and defendants admit that exterminators were in plaintiffs hotel room in response to plaintiffs earlier complaint of a dead cockroach in the room.nevertheless,defendants citing any,because plaintiffs do not know exactly which chemical they were exposed to,as a matter of law they can not competently establish that such a mystery substance caused their claimed ailments.def.br.
michigan law,however,requires only that a plaintiff claiming negligence prove his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence,and does not require that a plaintiff alleging exposure to a harmful substance prove with certainty that he or she was exposed to a particular chemical.see liberty mut.ins.bay city,water.therefore,plaintiffs may survive summary judgment if a reasonable jury could find that it is more likely than not that defendants caused plaintiffs to be exposed to a sufficient quantity of a hazardous substance capable of causing their injuries.
although defendants introduced substantial expert testimony indicating that exposure to could not have caused plaintiffs illness,they declined to offer any evidence regarding the toxic properties of demand cs and suspend sc.while the record contains little evidence regarding the toxic effects of suspend sc,based on the msds for demand cs,a reasonable jury could conclude that demand cs is capable of producing many of the symptoms experienced by plaintiffs,especially because defendants failed to introduce any evidence rebutting the msds description of demand cs as a highly dangerous toxin capable of causing a myriad of symptoms.
according to natzke,plaintiff dejonge experienced a wide range of symptoms,including a headache,swelling of her tongue,hands,feet and face,profuse itching,dizziness,shortness of breath a slurring and swollen tongue,complaints of a foul taste in her mouth,drooling and complaints of fatigue and pain in her muscles and joints,in addition to a need to take afternoon naps which was the case before the incident on september,diarrhea and a droopy left eye.plaintiff gass experienced achiness all over,chills,sweats,fever,blisters on her tongue,droopiness on the right side of her face,muscle spasms,dizziness,blurred vision and memory problems weakness and fatigue and tongue which she said turned black about weeks later.
the msds for demand cs warns that it can cause many of these symptoms,including central nervous system depression,irritation to eyes,skin and respiratory tract,headaches,dizziness,anesthesia,drowsiness and other central nervous system effects.moreover,according to the msds,the chemicals in demand cs target the liver,nervous system,kidney,blood,respiratory tract,skin and eye.although the msds does not account for all of plaintiffs symptoms,such as their discolored tongues,natzke stated in his affidavit that this symptom could be attributed to pesticide poisoning.
accordingly,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the parties,a reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs symptoms were caused by their exposure to the pesticides sprayed by defendants.plaintiffs have produced ample evidence to demonstrate that at least one of the chemicals defendants routinely used to exterminate cockroaches,demand cs,is capable of causing their symptoms.plaintiffs further have testified that they were exposed to a visible and pungent cloud of pesticides after defendants sprayed pesticides in their room while plaintiffs occupied the room.it is also significant that plaintiffs began experiencing symptoms within fifteen minutes of their alleged exposure to pesticides in their hotel room.in addition,defendants have offered no evidence to refute the msds representation of demand cs as a chemical which could have caused plaintiffs symptoms.
despite this evidence,defendants argue that this court decision in kalamazoo river study group rockwell international,cir,requires plaintiffs to introduce an essential element of admissible expert testimony in order to prove causation.that case,however,can not be read so broadly.kalamazoo river was an environmental contamination case,involving miles of shoreline which was polluted by the chemical polychorinated biphenyl pcb.id.at.the defendant in kalamazoo river owned an automotive parts manufacturing plant,located feet from an entry into the tainted waterways,which leaked pcb into the surrounding soil in.id.at.in,the defendant,acting with the approval of state environmental authorities,undertook to repair any environmental damage caused by the leak.as a result of these efforts,the defendant excavated approximately cubic yards of soil from the area surrounding the leak,and conducted soil studies revealing that pcb had traveled no farther then feet away from the site feet short of the nearby waterway.id.at.nevertheless,in,the defendant was named in the kalamazoo river lawsuit,which alleged that the leak had contributed to the pcb contamination along the miles of shoreline.id.at.
in holding that the defendant could not be held liable for the pcb contamination along the shoreline,the court noted that the plaintiff presented no reliable expert testimony which refuted evidence showing that pcb from the leak never reached the nearby waterway.id.at.accordingly,the court held that,t he analytical gap between the evidence presented by the plaintiff and the inferences to be drawn is too wide.under such circumstances,a jury should not be asked to speculate on the issue of causation.id.at quoting turpin merrell dow,cir.
contrary to defendants assertions,the principle governing kalamazoo river is not applicable to plaintiffs claims.unlike in kalamazoo river,where the defendant presented scientific evidence affirmatively demonstrating that it was not responsible for any pcb contamination along the shoreline,defendants have presented nothing more than statements by their own exterminator who works for that neither demand cs nor a similarly toxic chemical was used in plaintiffs hotel room.in other words,while the kalamazoo river defendant proved an absence of causation by introducing objectively verifiable scientific evidence,defendants have not done so.though it is certainly reasonable,as this court held in kalamazoo river,at,to require a party to refute scientific evidence with scientific evidence,plaintiffs are not required to produce expert testimony on causation where defendants have failed to offer scientific evidence regarding the effects of demand cs or suspend sc.
the complexity of the factual issue presented in kalamazoo river also justified requiring the plaintiff to support its case with expert testimony.kalamazoo river concerned whether a chemical spill,allegedly cleaned up in,traveled through feet of soil to a nearby waterway,and then spread out along miles of shoreline.id.at.such an inquiry is beyond the capacity of twelve lay people,absent some assistance from an expert.
in contrast,plaintiffs allege that they entered a room defendants filled with a cloud of toxic chemicals,and became ill within fifteen minutes of their exposure to the toxins.moreover,the record shows that exterminators acting on behalf of defendants entered the room to exterminate cockroaches,and that at least one pesticide that defendants use to control capable of producing many of the symptoms from which plaintiffs suffer.it does not take an expert to conclude that,under these circumstances,defendants more likely than not are responsible for plaintiffs injuries.
if anything,the decision in kalamazoo river bolsters plaintiffs case.like the defendant in kalamazoo river,who introduced scientific evidence showing that it was not responsible for pcb contamination along the shoreline,plaintiffs have introduced scientific shows that demand cs is capable of causing their symptoms.see at.defendants,like the plaintiff in kalamazoo river,have introduced no evidence regarding the toxic effects of demand cs.see id.at.defendants can not excuse their failure to introduce expert testimony by accusing their adversaries of the same failure where other scientific evidence exists that tends to prove plaintiffs case.
should a jury credit plaintiffs testimony,it reasonably could conclude that the alleged cloud of unidentified toxic chemicals sprayed in plaintiffs hotel room caused plaintiffs injuries.the dissent,however,asserts that plaintiffs were required to produce expert testimony linking their exposure with their symptoms.according to the dissent,ordinary understanding of everyday medical problems does not include the proposition that black tongue is ordinarily caused by spraying of pesticides.dissenting op.at.the dissent appears to believe that a jury in plaintiffs case would have to use its own knowledge to link pesticide exposure to plaintiffs illness and its symptoms however,natzke stated in his affidavit that,based on his experience in treating patients who have been exposed to pesticides,a discolored tongue is attributable to pesticide poisoning.thus,contrary to the dissent assertions,our conclusion that plaintiffs were not required to produce expert testimony with respect to causation is not a conclusion that the causes of a black tongue are within the ordinary understanding of the jury.
we conclude that when a plaintiff claims that a defendant was negligent in filling a hotel room with a cloud of a poisonous substance,and there is evidentiary support for such claims,expert testimony is not required to show negligence,and the district court erred in holding otherwise.
iv.plaintiffs motion to extend discovery 
finally,we note that,at oral argument,plaintiffs claimed that they would have presented more evidence indicating that they were injured by demand cs or suspend sc,but they were frustrated in their efforts to conduct discovery because defendants did not provide plaintiffs with documents showing that these two pesticides were used at the maui marriott until after the close of discovery.although plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court seeking to extend the length of discovery in light of defendants alleged failure to reveal damaging documents in a timely manner,the district court denied this motion,and plaintiffs do not appeal the district court ruling.accordingly,we decline to review the district court decision not to permit additional discovery.see united states corrado,cir arguments not developed in briefs on appeal are deemed waived by this court.we leave it to the district court on remand to determine whether to reopen discovery to expand the record prior to trial.
conclusion 
accordingly,for the reasons set forth above,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to defendants and remand this case to the district court for a jury trial.
this case basically boils down to the relative import of two latin phrases post hoc ergo propter hoc and res ipsa loquitur.the former is a well known logical fallacy recognized as such since aristotle rhetoric.it is the fallacy of saying that because effect a happened at some point after alleged cause b,the alleged cause was the actual cause.such logic has never been enough to survive summary judgment.see,abbott federal forge,cir p ost hoc,ergo propter hoc is not a rule of legal causation.
the latter phrase applies to a narrow class of cases in which the connection between an untoward effect and some type of fault is so clear and the likelihood of an alternative explanation so low that no other evidence is required to uphold a jury verdict.the original,and classic,exposition of this principle is byrne boadle,eng.exch,a nineteenth century english case where a pedestrian on the streets of liverpool was struck by a barrel of flour that came flying out of the window of a commercial storeroom.as i will explain below,it seems clear to me that the venerable british case does not describe the case before us.a barrel of flour is extremely unlikely to come flying out onto a city street without some fault by those charged with the care of similar barrels,and it is also extremely unlikely that the flying barrel of flour came from any place other than the adjacent flour warehouse.
in our case,the plaintiffs symptoms,which worsened at a later time and after medical care,and which are known to have a wide variety of possible causes,are much less obviously connected to an unspecified dose of a potentially poisonous pesticide.instead,finding fault,without more,in the latter circumstances represents classic post hoc reasoning.something potentially causative happened at one time something untoward happened at a later time.therefore,plaintiffs allege,the latter must have been caused by the former.the applicable law of michigan does not permit that unsubstantiated connection to be made,and that is why expert opinion is required.i therefore respectfully dissent from the majority invocation of res ipsa in a case where it is not warranted.
this case involves assessing the connection between exposure to some chemical substance and a series of physical symptoms that are generally attributable to a wide variety of causes.the district court held that the experts that the plaintiffs relied on to connect the alleged exposure and the defendant behavior relating to it to the plaintiffs symptoms could not testify to any causal relationship.the majority affirms that decision but nevertheless reverses summary judgment,holding that ordinary experience suffices to connect any chemical used regardless of composition or dose to the symptoms.in my view,this resolution is not supported by common sense or by the michigan law that governs the case.both counsel that a lay juror can not be expected to understand the complex medical and scientific facts that necessarily underlie any such an attribution of fault and,accordingly,require expert explanation prior to allowing a jury verdict.the majority assessment that in this case and,one supposes,unlike in most toxic tort cases there is sufficient evidence for the jury to charge plaintiffs illnesses to the defendants because the illness began to develop reasonably soon after the is only post hoc ergo propter rather than refutes this preference for expertise.
to fully understand the weight that the majority asks the post hoc fallacy to bear,it is useful to begin with a point of agreement between the majority and this opinion.the plaintiffs hoped that their treating physicians could testify not just to the physical symptoms with which they were diagnosed but also to the likely cause of such symptoms.that testimony would have concluded that the plaintiffs illnesses were explained best by chemical poisoning and that the exposure to whatever pesticides defendants had used was the best explanation of how plaintiffs came in contact with the chemicals that poisoned them.as rehearsed and affirmed in the majority opinion,the district court held that these doctors lacked sufficient expertise to make the causal connection alleged by plaintiffs.
plaintiffs also proffered the testimony of a second set of experts to demonstrate duty and breach.these liability experts whose exclusion was not challenged on appeal would have testified to the dangers of pesticides and an appropriate standard of care for their use.the district court excluded them because they prepared no report and did not plan to give an opinion about the chemicals that defendants actually used or the precautions defendants actually undertook.
together,this missing expert testimony means that the summary judgment record contains no admissible evidence that directly shows a breach of duty or that shows causation between the alleged breach and the illnesses.to be sure,the plaintiffs evidence recounts the spraying of the pesticide and details the potential toxicity at some unspecified dose of the chemicals that probably were sprayed by defendants.but establishing these propositions does not establish how the room should have been sprayed or how the risk of chemical poisoning should have been reduced.that is,the evidence does not tend to prove that the defendants activities,in light of the relevant standard of care,were negligent or that the chemicals that were sprayed caused the illness.
of course,the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.the majority holds that in the place of the absent evidence there is sufficient circumstantial evidence of breach and causation.specifically,the historical fact that some illness came quickly on the heels of exposure speaks for itself and makes up for the otherwise missing causal links.
thus presented,the question is whether the plaintiffs needed expert testimony in this case to prove how much chemical exposure is too much chemical exposure or to prove whether the amount of exposure actually caused the alleged harmful consequence.in my view,the majority pays too little attention to this issue,rushing from the fact of exposure and odd symptoms to the legal conclusion of fault.it is of course correct that under michigan law some complex cases involve breach or causation questions within the ken of the jury notwithstanding the professional or scientific nature of the litigation.see thomas mcpherson health center.but the majority assumes,without citation or authority,that this case is such a case.
in michigan,expert testimony in professional negligence and toxic tort cases like this one is required to avoid summary judgment unless the lack of professional care is so manifest that it would be within the common knowledge and experience of the ordinary layman that the conduct was careless lince monson.the michigan courts do not provide a test for what is common knowledge,but do require more than a bad result,jones porretta,and have frequently held that negligence can not be inferred based on ordinary knowledge simply from an unexpected injury.see,woodard custer,w hether a leg may be fractured in the absence of negligence when placing an arterial line in a newborn leg is not within the common understanding of the jury.this approach comports with the general view that injuries in professional negligence cases,especially those involving complex chemicals and human health,are usually not immediately obvious and the connection between exposure and injury is not a matter of common sense or everyday experience.in re meridia,d.
as i understand it,these cases require expert testimony in complex,professional,or negligence cases in order to limit the dangers associated with indulging the post hoc impulse it is too easy to charge an uncommon harm to the presence of a mysterious substance.properly credentialed expert testimony operates as a bulwark against such fallacious attribution of guilt.as in the daubert context,our concern in applying these cases should be to assure that the powerful engine of tort liability points towards the right substances and does not destroy the wrong ones.general electric joiner,d breyer,concurring.
while our case is not a professional care case,in a very recent,albeit unpublished,decision,the michigan court of appeals applied this wisdom to a case similar to ours.the court,citing favorably to the district court opinion in this case,held that without expert testimony directly connecting the level of pesticide exposure to the plaintiff mysterious illness,a plaintiff alleging pesticide poisoning could not get to the jury.see trice oakland development.partnership.lexis at,citing gass marriott,d.specifically,the dose of chemicals to which plaintiff had been exposed had not been determined,id.at,and so without evidence that plaintiff had been exposed to any chemicals at a level that would be harmful,plaintiff could not establish specific causation.id.at.
it is against this background that i disagree with the majority conclusion that the plaintiffs proof,without expert testimony,survives summary judgment.
as a general matter,the weakness in the majority reasoning is demonstrated by reference to the emotive language used to characterize the facts.the words assume negligence and,accordingly,make it easy to agree that a
