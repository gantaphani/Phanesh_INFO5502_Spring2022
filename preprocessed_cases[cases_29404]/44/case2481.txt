phillip now philecia barnes barnes was living as a transsexual in when he failed the probationary period required to become a police sergeant in the cincinnati police department cpd.barnes passed the sergeants exam,but failed the probationary period after he was subjected to a rigorous training program.barnes brought suit against the city of cincinnati in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,claiming that his failure of probation was due to illegal sex discrimination based on his failure to conform to sex stereotypes.the city argued that barnes failure was due to poor performance during his probationary period.the city filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,both of which were denied.a jury returned a verdict in barnes favor in the amount of.the city filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial,both of which were also denied.the district court awarded barnes in attorneys fees and in costs.the city appealed the verdict on thirteen separate grounds and appealed the district court award of attorneys fees.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
barnes started his career with the cpd in as a police officer.barnes passed a promotional test to become a sergeant on july.barnes placed eighteenth out of officers who sat for the exam.at the time of his promotion,barnes was a transsexual who was living as a male while on duty but often lived as a woman off duty.barnes had a reputation throughout the police department as a homosexual,bisexual or.no other male sergeant was known to be gay or have a feminine appearance.the cincinnati vice squad photographed barnes at night.
following his promotion,barnes was assigned to district one for his probationary period.the purpose of a sergeant probationary period is to allow superior officers to observe the individual to determine whether the person should remain in the position.eighteen standard traits are used for rating a probationary sergeant,with judgment being the most important category.rating scales are used to measure performance and are described throughout the cpd procedures.the city presented evidence at trial that sergeant is the most important rank in the organization and the city makes no exceptions for anyone.even exceptionally good police officers may not possess the skills required to be a good supervisor.barnes admitted the transition from officer to sergeant was more difficult than he expected.barnes also stated there was a difference between an officer and a sergeant responsibilities and there were areas in which he needed to improve throughout the probationary period.
one of barnes alleged weaknesses was lack of command presence.according to sergeant shearer,command presence means that an individual projects a certain image of confidence.several other officers testified that barnes lacked command presence,which,according to them,meant that he did not have the respect of his subordinates.barnes expert testified that employers who use subjective factors,like command presence to evaluate an employee are engaging in stereotyping.nearly every evaluator who spoke to barnes command presence defined the term differently.
barnes was assigned to lieutenant wilger when he arrived at district one.wilger openly spoke about the number of lesbians in the cpd and did not believe he violated any policy by speaking about the sexual orientation of female police officers while on duty.ross testified that when barnes arrived at district one for his probationary period,people did not take him as seriously as they should.barnes was living as a woman,had a french manicure,had arched eyebrows and came to work with makeup or lipstick on his face on some occasions.within a month of barnes promotion,wilger reported to the head of district one,captain demasi,that barnes was having trouble fulfilling his duties.wilger noted that barnes had trouble preparing documents,exercising proper judgment in the field and completing assignments on time.after the meeting,barnes was placed in a new training program.
the new training program required barnes superiors to evaluate him on a daily basis over a three month period.a special form was created to evaluate barnes.the program was designed and approved by chief streicher,the cpd chief.the program required seven other sergeants to rate barnes on a daily basis.barnes was rated in each of the standard eighteen categories on a scale of zero to.barnes was also told not go into the field alone,was required to wear a microphone at all times and ride in a car with a video camera during the last weeks of his probation.no other sergeants were evaluated in this manner.barnes claimed that this experience was demeaning and it made those around him think that he was incompetent and ignorant.barnes did admit,however,that he did not want to speculate on the issue of whether he was singled out based on his transsexual characteristics.sergeant ford testified that t he purpose of the program was to scrutinize him and to document every mistake that he made so that he could be failed on probation.
nearly a month into barnes evaluation program,he was stressed and flustered from his assignment to the program.barnes was referred to cpd psychologist,james daum,who recommended that barnes receive counseling.daum sent his report to chief streicher because he wanted the police division to know that barnes needed help.barnes claimed that many of his problems during probation were related to his elevated stress level,which would not have occurred but for his superiors singling him out in the manner they did.
barnes received evaluations from five different sergeants between february and april.on april,demasi recommended to chief streicher that barnes fail probation because he had shown little improvement in his performance and because barnes had violated cpd rules and procedures.chief streicher denied demasi recommendation.barnes was instructed to choose a mentor and he chose sergeant hoffbauer.sergeant hoffbauer was barnes last evaluator,and evaluated barnes between april and may.hoffbauer initially gave barnes mediocre evaluations,but gave barnes scores of zero in some categories by the middle of may.
in june,colonel twitty instructed demasi to submit a second report recommending that barnes fail probation.demasi reiterated his concern over barnes lack of improvement and detailed several instances of dishonesty.demasi also noted two instances where barnes failed to comply with grooming and uniform standards,a day where barnes committed multiple radio infractions and barnes failure to display appropriate command presence.chief streicher relied on twitty report and approved barnes failure of probation on june.
chief streicher testified at trial that barnes had a lack of command presence and that he flunked barnes from probation.sergeant ford,one of barnes reviewing sergeants,testified that barnes was improving over the course of the training and that barnes was placed in the special program to target him for failure.
the city agrees that twitty told barnes he did not appear to be masculine,and that he needed to stop wearing makeup and act more masculine prior to barnes promotion.twitty stated the objective of such statements was to correct barnes grooming deficiencies.twitty also stated that the decision to fail barnes from probation had nothing to do with barnes transsexual characteristics.however,sergeant ford warned barnes that he heard rumors that barnes was going to fail probation because barnes had not been acting masculine enough.
barnes expert,industrial psychologist cranny,found that barnes met the general standard identified for passing sergeant probation,as his scores were above the minimum required range for passing.barnes expert testified that he was unable to understand how barnes could have failed probation.barnes scores on the sergeant evaluation tests were higher than at least one other probationary sergeant.barnes was the only person to be put in a sergeant field training program and the only one to fail probation between and.
barnes challenged his demotion from sergeant under title vii and the equal protection clause.the city filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment,which were both denied by the district court.the city argued that a legitimate reason,poor performance,justified the demotion in this case.the claims were submitted to a jury,which returned a verdict in barnes favor.the jury awarded in compensatory damages,in front pay and in back pay.the city moved for judgment as a matter of law,which was also rejected by the district court.the district court awarded barnes in attorneys fees and in costs on february.the city filed this timely appeal alleging thirteen claims of error at trial and appealing the district court award of attorneys fees.
ii.analysis 
barnes produced sufficient evidence at trial to establish a claim for sex discrimination under title vii.
the city states,without making it entirely clear which decision of the district court it is appealing,that barnes failed to make out a prima facie case of sex discrimination under title vii.in cases where an appellant made a rule motion for summary judgment that was denied,reiterated those same arguments in a rule a motion at the close of evidence that was also denied,lost in front of a jury,and then renewed its arguments in a rejected rule b motion after the entry of judgment,we will review only the denial of the rule b motion.k t enters.zurich,cir.
we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law or a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.united states alpine,cir.judgment as a matter of law may only be granted if,when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.gray toshiba am.consumer,cir see also williams nashville network,cir.
the city argues on appeal that barnes did not plead or prove a prima facie case of sex discrimination under title vii.the city also argues that the district court erred by not granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law and by denying its motions for summary judgment and to dismiss for the reasons stated below,we find that the city claim that barnes failed to plead and prove a prima facie case lacks merit and hold that the district court did not err when it denied the city judgment as a matter of law.
when reviewing the facts of a discrimination claim after there has been a full trial on the merits,we must focus on the ultimate question of discrimination rather than on whether a plaintiff made out a prima facie case.see noble brinker,cir noting that when the case proceeds to a full trial on the merits,the district court is in a position to decide the ultimate factual issue in the case,that is,whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.thus,the proper inquiry following the presentation of all evidence in a title vii case is whether plaintiff has proven its case by a preponderance of the evidence.eeoc avery dennison,cir.nonetheless,the evidentiary underpinnings of a plaintiff prima facie case are not irrelevant or insulated from our examination to aid our determination whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.noble,at.
in order to establish a claim of sex discrimination,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is a member of a protected class he applied and was qualified for a promotion he was considered for and denied the promotion and other employees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected class received promotions.mcdonnell douglas green,d.
in this case,barnes claims that the city intentionally discriminated against him because of his failure to conform to sex stereotypes.the city claims that barnes failed to establish the first and the fourth elements of a prima facie case,because he was not a member of a protected class and he failed to identify a similarly situated employee who passed probation.
smith city of salem,ohio,cir,instructs that the city claim that barnes was not a member of a protected class lacks merit.in smith,this court held that the district court erred in granting a motion to dismiss by holding that transsexuals,as a class,are not entitled to title vii protections,stating 
sex stereotyping based on a person gender behavior is impermissible discrimination,irrespective of the cause of that behavior a label,such as transsexual,is not fatal to a sex discrimination claim where the victim has suffered discrimination because of his or her gender.
id.at.by alleging that his failure to conform to sex stereotypes concerning how a man should look and behave was the driving force behind defendant actions,smith stated a claim for relief pursuant to title vii prohibition of sex discrimination.id.at.following the holding in smith,barnes established that he was a member of a protected class by alleging discrimination against the city for his failure to conform to sex stereotypes.
next,the city claim that barnes failed to establish a prima facie case because he did not identify a similarly situated employee who was not a member of barnes protected class who passed probation also lacks merit.barnes need not demonstrate an exact correlation with the employee receiving more favorable treatment in order for the two to be considered similarly situated.rather,barnes and the employee with whom he seeks to compare himself must be similar in all of the relevant aspects.ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir noting that inflexible criteria for establishing the requirement would mean that a plaintiff whose job responsibilities are unique to his or her position will never successfully establish a prima facie case absent direct evidence of discrimination.an exact correlation with the comparable employee is not required.id.barnes presented evidence that he was the only police sergeant to fail probation between and and that one other sergeant,who had lower probationary scores than barnes and was not a member of barnes protected class,passed probation following the holding in ercegovich,barnes also established the fourth element of a prima facie case for sex discrimination.
the ultimate question in this case is whether the city demoted barnes or discriminated against barnes because of his failure to conform to sex stereotypes.it is not sufficient for a jury to merely disbelieve the reason offered by the defendant.mary honor center hicks,d.the jury must believe the reason offered by the plaintiff,that is,it must believe that the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.id.at,d.the court stated that proving the employer reason false becomes part of and often considerably assists the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination.id.at,d.
there is evidence in the record to support barnes claims,and therefore,the district court did not err in denying the city judgment as a matter of law,because a reasonable jury could find in favor of barnes.the evidence barnes produced at trial showed barnes performance ratings as a probationary sergeant,though low,surpassed those of at least one other probationary sergeant who passed probation no other probationary sergeant had ever failed probation barnes ambiguous sexuality and his practice of dressing as a woman outside of work were within the cpd one of barnes supervisors told him he was not sufficiently masculine,and numerous supervisors and peers criticized him for lacking a quality known as command presence two months into his probation,barnes was placed in a sergeant field training program under the constant scrutiny of other sergeants who recorded every mistake he made the intensive oversight of the program caused barnes significant stress the stress caused barnes to commit mistakes in fulfilling his duties as a sergeant barnes dishonesty,including lying to a supervisor,stemmed from his fear of failing under the intense scrutiny of the training program no probationary sergeant before or since barnes has been placed in a program similar to barnes barnes was told by one of his superiors that he was going to fail probation for not acting masculine enough.
the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the city explanation that barnes was demoted because he was not qualified to fill the role of sergeant.disbelief of a defendant explanation is not enough to support plaintiff jury verdict.it is clear,however,that barnes produced evidence at trial that tended to show that the city proffered reason for demoting barnes was false and that the real reason for his demotion was unlawful discrimination.see hicks,at,d.while we may have reached a different conclusion sitting as the,it is not our role to substitute our judgment for that of the jury.douglass eaton,cir.rather,we are left to examine whether barnes produced sufficient evidence at trial to carry his burden of proof.we are convinced that he properly pled a prima facie case under smith,at,and that he produced sufficient evidence at trial for a reasonable jury to find that the city intentionally discriminated against him.noble.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in denying the city motion for judgment as a matter of law.
barnes had standing to bring his claims against the city.
the city argues in its brief that barnes did not have standing to bring a title vii or equal protection claim against the city because he was not a member of a protected class,and because he conceded that the city had legitimate motives to fail him from probation.the city also argues that barnes did not have standing to seek injunctive relief.the issue of standing is reviewed de novo.lynch leis,cir.the standard of review for the grant of an injunction is abuse of discretion.united states miami,cir.
to establish article iii standing,a litigant must show an injury in fact a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.for purposes of an article iii standing analysis,an injury in fact means an invasion of a legally protected interest.northeastern.chapter,associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville,d.generally,an equal protection claim requires a plaintiff to allege that a defendant has intentionally discriminated against him or her because the individual is part of a vulnerable minority class of protected individuals.village of arlington heights metropolitan housing dev,d.
the city argument that barnes lacked standing because he was not a member of a protected class fails,as barnes is a member of a protected class as defined in title vii.smith,at.the city claim that barnes did not have standing to bring an equal protection claim based on his status as a transsexual also fails,as barnes is a member of a protected as a man or a woman.see see also village of arlington heights,at,d.the city final standing argument,that the district court erred in granting an injunction enjoining the city from further discrimination against barnes is equally meritless.the district court explicitly found substantial reasons existed in favor of granting an injunction,and this court will not overturn the district court decision to grant an injunction,as there is no indication that the district court committed a clear error in judgment.miami,at.
c.the district court did not commit reversible error in instructing the jury.
claims of error in jury instructions require the instructions to be reviewed as a whole in order to determine whether they adequately informed the jury of the relevant considerations and provided a basis in law for aiding the jury in reaching its decision.beck haik,cir citing detroit,home ins,cir.this court may reverse a judgment on the basis of improper jury instructions only if the instructions,when viewed as a whole,were confusing,misleading and prejudicial.united states wells,cir see also barnes fiberglas,cir stating that w e will not reverse a decision on the basis of an erroneous jury instruction where the error is harmless.
the district court instruction was a correct statement of the law and did not confuse or mislead the jury.
the city argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury on.the city argued at length in its brief that the trial court erred by not requiring barnes to prove that chief streicher legitimate reasons for failing barnes from probation were a pretext for unlawful discrimination.the city argued that this is a pretext case and under mcdonnell douglas green,d,the burden of proof shifted back to barnes to show pretext after the city produced evidence of its allegedly legitimate motive to demote barnes.
in this case,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
your verdict will be for plaintiff if you find that plaintiff demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff failure to conform to sex stereotypes was a motivating factor in defendant decision to demote plaintiff,even if other factors also motivated defendant decision.however,if you find that defendant treatment of plaintiff was motivated by both plaintiff failure to conform to sex stereotypes and lawful reasons,you must decide whether plaintiff is entitled to damages.plaintiff is entitled to damages unless defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff even if plaintiff failure to conform to sex stereotypes had played no role in the decision.remember that plaintiff is not obligated to show that defendant legitimate reasons played no role in the decision to demote plaintiff,nor does plaintiff need to show that the prohibited factor was the sole or principal reason or the true reason.
in order for an instruction to be proper under m,a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.desert palace,costa,d citing m.in desert palace,the court upheld a district court decision to instruct the jury in a title vii sex discrimination case,where the district court used the same language as the district court used in this case.desert palace,at,d.
a jury instruction will not automatically be erroneous simply because it does not precisely follow the legal niceties of mcdonnell douglas,d and texas of cmty.affairs burdine,d.see brown packaging of,cir see also wexler white fine furniture,cir stating that criticism of an employee performance,even if true,which is linked to stereotypes associated with a plaintiff membership in a protected class is therefore squarely within the rubric of a analysis.
in this case,barnes presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that sex was a motivating factor for the city employment decision.see,supra.a district court is not bound by the mcdonnell douglas analysis when giving jury instructions.brown,at.as the district court did in this case,courts may give jury instructions where the plaintiff has presented enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that sex was a motivating factor in the decision to demote plaintiff.desert palace,at,d.the district court instructed the jury using a mixed motive instruction that tracked the language in desert palace.after reviewing the instruction and the jury instructions as a whole,it is clear that the instruction was proper under desert palace.accordingly,we can not say that the instructions were confusing,misleading and prejudicial and we hold that the district court did not err by giving a instruction to the jury.
we need not address arguments related to the district court equal protection clause jury instructions.
the city next argues the district court erred by overbroadly instructing the jury that the equal protection clause epc prohibits discrimination against public employees on the basis of an employee perceived sexual orientation,gender identity,transsexuality,or failure to conform to sex stereotypes.the city also argues the district court diluted barnes burden of proof by instructing the jury that it could not consider whether plaintiff own actions contributed to his injury.as the city conceded at oral argument,however,we need not reach these challenges if we uphold the title vii verdict.as a result,we will not address these arguments 
the district court did not err by instructing the jury it could find discrimination based on sexual stereotype.
the city argues that it was improper,under price waterhouse hopkins,d,to instruct the jury that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on sexual stereotypes.a claim for sex discrimination under title vii,however,can properly lie where the claim is based on sexual stereotypes.the district court therefore did not err when it instructed the jury that it could find discrimination based on sexual stereotypes.see smith.
d.the district court did not commit reversible error in its evidentiary rulings.
a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states cline,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.see also united states kingsley,cir abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.united states haywood,cir holding that a district court decision to admit evidence under rule b is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.
the district court did not err in admitting a statement and in allowing barnes to argue about such statement.
the city argues the district court erred by denying the city motion in limine as to statements allegedly made by wilger regarding lesbians in the city police department and the use of the word fag.the city also argues the district court erred by allowing barnes to make a misleading argument to the jury,based on these statements.
there is nothing in the record that gives this court a firm conviction that a mistake has been made.the district court did not make any erroneous findings of fact,improperly apply the law or use an erroneous legal standard.cline,at.wilger statement could certainly be construed as probative of his intent to ensure that barnes was demoted.indeed,the district court ruled that the statement reflected wilger intent,and was therefore admissible under.b.without citing,the city argues in its brief that the statement was highly prejudicial.while it is clear that the city would have preferred that the jury not hear this statement at trial,the evidence of intent was admissible under b,and the city has failed to show that it was irrelevant or overly prejudicial under.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony.
the district court did not commit reversible error by admitting testimony regarding sergeant ford statements.
the city argues the district court erred in allowing barnes to testify regarding an alleged out of court declaration by a sergeant about alleged rumors.the city argues that the statement constituted double hearsay and it was highly prejudicial to allow barnes to testify that sergeant ford whispered in my ear and said that i have heard rumors that you are going to fail probation because you just have not been acting masculine enough.
this court reviews a district court ruling to admit evidence over a hearsay objection de novo.united states jinadu,cir citing united states fountain,cir.we will vacate a jury verdict based on a district court erroneous admission of hearsay evidence only if the testimony admission amounted to more than harmless error.field trigg county,cir citing argentine united steelworkers of,cir.the improper admission of hearsay evidence is harmless error unless it is more probable than not that the error materially affected the verdict.united states hernandez,cir quoting united states toney,cir.
the city argues that the admission of this testimony unfairly prejudiced its case.several cases from this circuit instruct our holding that the statement was not unfairly prejudicial.hill spiegel,cir holding that it was reversible error to admit hearsay evidence where there was no evidence that the employees who made hearsay declarations were acting within the scope of their employment.the city also cites field,and states that the admission of hearsay testimony was highly prejudicial and reversible error where such admission was the strongest evidence available to the defendant.however,our circuit has also held that the possible erroneous admission of hearsay evidence was harmless error where sufficient other evidence supported the verdict.united states rogers,cir.
even assuming arguendo that the statement was inadmissible,we believe that barnes presented a sufficient amount of other evidence related to the city decision to terminate barnes for his failure to conform to sex stereotypes,such that any possible error was harmless when examining the statement in light of other evidence produced at trial.see field.therefore,the city is not entitled to reversal,as sergeant ford statement did not materially alter the verdict because sufficient evidence otherwise supported the verdict.
e.the district court denial of the city motion for a new trial 
this court reviews a district court denial of a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.tompkin philip morris usa,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.romstadt allstate ins,cir.
a motion for a new trial will not be granted unless the moving party suffered prejudice.philip morris,at citing erskine consol.rail,cir holding that a new trial will not be granted on the ground that surprise evidence was admitted unless the moving party was prejudiced.even if a mistake has been made regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence,a new trial will not be granted unless the evidence would have caused a different outcome at trial.morales american honda motor,cir.
the district court did not err in denying the city motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence.
a district court decision to deny a new trial on the basis of the weight of the evidence shall be reversed only upon finding an abuse of discretion.united states alpine industries,cir.in ruling on a motion for a new trial based on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence,the trial court must compare the opposing proofs,weigh the evidence,and set aside the verdict if it is of the opinion that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence.wyckoff,standard fire ins,cir.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the city motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence.while the city offers a plausible explanation of what the evidence showed at trial,we do not think that the jury verdict was unreasonable.the jury was free to draw inferences and interpret the evidence in favor of or against the city.the fact that the city interpretation of the evidence is itself reasonable does not entitle it to a new trial.the district court compared the evidence presented by both sides in its order denying the city a new trial and concluded that the jury determination was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.therefore,we reject this argument.
the district court did not err by allowing barnes to produce evidence and argue about the meaning of article xii of the city charter.
the city argues the district court erred when it refused to grant the city a new trial because the district court allowed barnes to present evidence at trial and argue in his closing argument that article xii of the city charter supported barnes case.the city argues on appeal that it was unfairly surprised and prejudiced when the district court allowed barnes to question witnesses and argue to the jury about the effect of article xii.
in its order denying the city motion for judgment or for a new trial,the district court addressed the relevancy of article xii and any alleged unfair prejudice that the city may have suffered as a result of its admission.as used in rule,unfair prejudice does not mean the damage to the city case that results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence rather,it refers to
