shortly after midnight on january,giuseppe cracchiolo fell and drowned after slipping from an obviously hazardous place on a pier at a new bedford fishery while attempting to return to the commercial fishing boat on which he was working.his wife carla cracchiolo,acting individually and as administratrix of the estate,sued defendants rcp realty and eastern fisheries,for damages for wrongful death based on a negligence theory.these defendants are,respectively,the owner and the leaseholder of the facility where the ship was docked.they were alleged to have failed to use due care in the inspection,maintenance,and repair of the premises and to have failed to provide cracchiolo with a safe and reasonable egress from and ingress to the boat,particularly with respect to the ice and snow conditions on the pier that night.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the basis that the defendants owed no duty of care to remedy the hazard under the circumstances of this case.we reverse and remand.we do not decide the duty of care issue.we write narrowly and conclude the issue can not be decided on the undisputed facts in this summary judgment record.
plaintiff filed suit against corporation,which owned the boat,under the jones act,and general maritime law.she also brought tort claims under massachusetts wrongful death statute.laws ch,against eastern fisheries,which operated the property where the boat was docked,and rcp realty,which owned the property.
all three defendants moved for summary judgment on july.plaintiff opposed the motions,and the court held a hearing on the motions on august.trial was scheduled for september.on september,at the final pretrial conference,the district court,in an oral order,denied summary judgment motion but granted eastern fisheries and rcp.on september,plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied plaintiff appeals.
for purposes of summary judgment,we describe the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.see,barclays bank plc poynter,cir.
layout of the defendants property 
giuseppe cracchiolo worked as a commercial fisherman and engineer on the sunlight,a herring boat.during the winter,the sunlight operated out of the defendants fish processing facility in new bedford,massachusetts,and docked at the facility pier.the sunlight paid a fee for use of that facility the facility was used both for processing fish and for berthing vessels.at least thirteen vessels used the facility in and.
the roughly rectangular waterfront property is enclosed by a chain link fence on its north,west,and south sides the east side abuts the water.the property contains a fish processing plant,the front door of which faces the western side of the property,where there is a parking lot.at the back of the plant is a pier on the east side,where fishing vessels dock and in some instances offload their catches.the pier runs from north to south and a wooden cap board,about a foot wide,runs its length.there are bollards,for the boats to tie off their lines,located at various points along the pier,including near the south end.in the ordinary course,the entire length of the pier is used,including to tie the lines to the southern bollard.scallop boats also unloaded near the southern end and occasionally stored nets in the area.
there are several feet of space between the plant and the fence on the north side,and a smaller space of just a few feet between the plant and the fence on the south side.between the fence on the western side,which has a large gate with a padlock,and the western door of the plant is a parking lot.
the fence along the south side did not go all the way to the water edge rather,it stopped two to three feet short of the water edge.importantly,the end of the fence had been folded back deliberately,leaving an obvious gap in the fence.access to the south side of the property,from the adjacent property,was easily obtained through the use of this gap.this was the most direct way for crew members to get to the boats if the gate to the property was locked and they did not have keys.
the grass on the building south side extends about ten feet north of the fence in the southeast corner.immediately to the north of the grassy area,an asphalt surface begins.it goes across the pier from the south to the northeast corner of the property.along the eastern edge of the property,where the pier runs along the water,is a retaining wall.the easternmost edge of the pier was covered by a wooden cap log.
fishing vessels,including the sunlight,tied off next to the plant at its pier and unloaded their fish catch into the building.sometimes another fishing vessel would be tied to the vessel tied to the dock.this was true of the sunlight and its companion vessel.the sunlight had used the pier since.the sunlight always tied off with its bow to the south and its stern to the north.the boat would tie off using a bollard at the southern end of the pier near the bow.the stern sat lower on the water than the bow and was roughly level with the pier.as a result,crew members leaving the boat would ordinarily step off the sunlight stern onto the pier.by contrast,at the south end of the boat,the bow rose an additional several feet above the pier.crew members tying off the boat with the bow lines would walk to the southern end of the pier to do so.scallop boats also unloaded their catches at the southern end of the pier.after leaving from the stern,crew members wanting to leave the property typically walked along a wide path on the north side of the property,between the processing plant and the fence,until reaching the parking lot on the western half of the property.they left through the gate.the reverse route,from the parking lot,along the north side of the property,and to the stern,would allow the crew to reboard the boat.
apart from the gate at the front entrance,the other way into the property was through the obvious gap in the fence at the southeast corner.as the sunlight captain,joseph martin,testified,e verybody knows you can go that way.another crew member,craig lazaro,explained that the gap was easy to see.captain martin stated that although they knew the gap in the southeast corner existed,crew members would,most of the time,enter the property through the main gate on the west side of the property.
upon entering through the gap in the southeast corner of the fence,crew members could turn left and walk in the area between the fence and the fish processing building,back to the parking lot,past the building front door,then take the path along the north side of the building to the stern of the boat.this was the longer of the two possible routes from the southeast corner.
alternatively,a few crew members chose a shorter but more hazardous route.instead of turning left,they walked straight ahead to the asphalt and continued along the waterfront retaining wall,to walk along the pier from the bow to the stern of the boat.of necessity,those taking this route would have to walk for part of the way on the wooden cap log on the retaining wall alongside a raised platform attached to the rear of the building known as a takeout platform used for scallop vessels.one of the defendants security cameras covered the area.
in that particular area,the takeout platform extended out toward the water,leaving only a narrow space along the pier.that space was estimated to be about a foot in width.an individual taking this path would,on reaching the platform,turn sideways,try to hold on to the wall of the takeout platform,and step or shimmy alongside it on the retaining wall of the pier until past the platform and near the boat stern.this route was significantly shorter than the option of turning left and walking around the building to reach the boat stern.it was defendants policy and practice to remove snow from the parking lot,but the snow and ice removal ended there.snow and ice were not removed from the pier,most of the adjacent northern walkway,or the grounds around the building.
although it is clear that it was more dangerous to cross the retaining wall than to walk around the building,a jury could assess the degree of risk involved in doing so,as part of its assessment of the foreseeability that a seaman would use the route.it could consider the testimony of captain martin,who found the increased danger of use of the retaining wall so that he did not even consider walking along it.it could also consider the contrasting testimony of crew member craig lazaro,who testified that he twice crossed the retaining wall and never even thought about taking the alternate route around the building.in doing so,it could also consider the relative risks posed by ice and snow along the two routes.
crew members past patterns of accessing the property 
cracchiolo died after he took the route through the gap in the southeastern corner of the fence when he found the western gate locked and he did not have a key.there are a great number of facts in dispute as to how often such situations,which caused crew members to use the gap to enter the property,arose.it is unclear what eastern fisheries policy was with respect to who would lock the gate and when,as well as whether different policies applied when crew members were sleeping aboard boats docked at the facility.the evidence shows that the gate was locked sporadically at best,and may even have been unlocked the vast majority of the time.it further shows that crew members lost or broke their keys with some frequency,as eastern fisheries had to provide about replacement keys per year to crew members of boats using its facility.it is also disputed how many spare keys,if any,were kept aboard the sunlight,and whether cracchiolo personally had one.we think it foreseeable that some crew members would not have keys with them and would enter the property through the gap in the fence when the gate was locked.
more important is the connection between foreseeable use of the gap in the fence to enter the property and the foreseeability,under the conditions that night,that seamen would choose not to turn left and go around the building,but to try to access the boat by walking straight from the southeast corner to the asphalt and along the pier retaining wall to get to the stern of the boat on the pier north side despite the obvious hazards.the record contains evidence of at least five instances in which crew members chose to use the southeast gap in the fence to enter the property.captain martin did so once.significantly,when he did,he elected to turn left,walk along the south side of the processing plant to the parking lot,and then take the customary route around the north side of the plant to the boat stern.on the other hand,the record shows that on two of the five occasions when crew members used the gap in the fence,they accessed the boat via the retaining wall.besides the night of cracchiolo death,in early january,lazaro and dale moore,a crew member of the companion ship to the sunlight,had used the southeast gap,continued straight,and walked directly along the pier retaining wall past the takeout platform to board the boat.finally,later that month,lazaro and cracchiolo used that same route along the retaining wall on the night cracchiolo died.we think it fair to infer the security cameras probably captured the uses of the hazardous route before the night cracchiolo died.
particulars regarding cracchiolo death 
the sunlight docked at the new bedford facility on january,after a fishing trip.a pipe on the boat had broken,and the crew decided to keep the boat docked at the plant for at least a few days while it was being repaired.lazaro and cracchiolo,the engineer,stayed on board to oversee the repairs.defendants were aware that the boat would remain docked with crew members aboard during that period,and that the crew members would come and go from the property.
the defendants property was covered in snow and ice on january.photographs show that the parking lot had been plowed,and that the entire pier and the grassy areas were covered in ice and snow.the retaining wall on the pier was likewise covered in ice and snow.in addition,there is some evidence that eastern fisheries workers also hosed down the takeout platform and parts of the pier that night,adding to the ice.the area between the processing plant and the fence along the entire southern side of the building was also covered in snow.
on the night of january,cracchiolo and lazaro left the facility together for dinner and drinks around.the main gate was open when they left but was locked when they separately returned,and neither brought with him a key to the gate.at some point in the night,the two men separated,and lazaro took a cab back to the sunlight.lazaro wanted to return to the boat to get money to pay the cab driver.he found the gate locked and decided to walk in through the gap in the southeast corner of the fence.once through the gap,lazaro continued straight and walked along the waterfront retaining wall rather than turning left and walking around the fish processing building.the security footage shows lazaro reaching the takeout platform,holding onto it,and alongside it on the retaining wall to get to the boat stern.after getting past the takeout platform,lazaro boarded the sunlight,retrieved his money,walked back to the main gate along the northern route,and paid the cab driver through the fence.he returned to the boat along the northern route he had just taken to the gate that route was icy.
some time later that night,lazaro called cracchiolo,who had not yet returned.he told cracchiolo that the gate was locked.cracchiolo asked how,then,to return to the boat.a jury could infer he did not have a key.lazaro responded that cracchiolo should come up into the property from the southeastern corner and he should continue walking along the retaining wall,the same way lazaro had,to get to the boat.he also warned cracchiolo that the path was icy.cracchiolo told lazaro that he was staying at a bar to watch the end of a basketball game and that lazaro should not wait for him.
cracchiolo eventually returned to the property just after midnight.the security footage shows that cracchiolo entered from the southeastern side through the gap in the fence.once inside,he continued straight ahead and began to walk along the pier to the retaining wall and takeout platform,as lazaro had done.security footage shows that as cracchiolo was holding on to the takeout platform and trying to step sidewise along the retaining wall between the takeout platform and the sunlight,he slipped and fell from the pier into the water.he drowned.lazaro found cracchiolo body in the water the next morning and called the police.a later forensic examination measured cracchiolo blood alcohol level at in one sample and in another.

wrongful death and negligence 
the massachusetts wrongful death statute imposes liability against a person who by his negligence causes the death of a person.laws ch.plaintiff negligence theory in this case is that eastern fisheries and rcp violated their duty to remedy the hazard of snow and ice on the pier,particularly on the retaining wall at the takeout platform,from which cracchiolo fell.
to prevail on a negligence claim,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care,that the defendant breached this duty,that damage resulted,and that there was a causal relation between the breach of the duty and the damage.jupin kask.the questions of breach,damages,and causation are the special province of the jury.id.at.however,the question of whether the defendant owed a duty of care in the first instance is an issue of law,and may be settled on summary judgment if on the undisputed facts the risks posed by the defendant actions were not foreseeable.id.massachusetts courts may also make this determination after trial,in light of all of the evidence.see dos santos coleta,finding evidence sufficient to allow jury to impose duty of care based o n the facts established at trial.

the massachusetts courts have established fairly clearly the obligations of landowners to remove snow and ice accumulations
