this appeal stems from a police investigation of a that culminated in the arrests of father and son robert and mario robinson and the seizure of robert car.after the resulting criminal charges against the robinsons were dismissed,they filed state and federal claims against the city of attleboro,massachusetts and several attleboro police officers.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,and the robinsons now appeal.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
on july,two boys,christopher redlund and nathan chou,were riding their bicycles along wilmarth street in attleboro when a car pulled up alongside them.the car passenger unknown to the boys engaged redlund in a verbal exchange,which may have involved shouting and swearing,an inquiry about whether the boys were involved in a recent incident in which a classmate had been beaten up,or both.redlund descriptions of this altercation have varied somewhat.after redlund told the passenger to leave him and chou alone,the car drove at redlund and struck him,flipping him over his handlebars and onto the road,scraping his back,arms,and legs.the car then drove away.
redlund called his father,attleboro detective alex aponte who is not a defendant here,to report the incident.aponte and two other police officers arrived at the scene.the boys described the car,which redlund believed he had seen in the area before,as a silver or tan compact in poor shape with a rubber strip hanging from the passenger side.redlund suggested that the car might be japanese in origin,and chou apparently mentioned that it could be a nissan,although he later said that he thought it was a honda.the boys said that the car occupants were three or four young men.
the officers soon located a honda accord coupe that apparently matched the boys description in the robinsons driveway,about a mile from the location.the exterior of the car was in poor condition,and a strip of rubber molding was hanging from the side.the passenger door was ajar,and the seatbelt was hanging out the door opening.the engine was warm.
when robert emerged from the house,the officers told him they were investigating a and inquired as to the whereabouts of robert son mario whom they knew from his previous encounters with police.robert explained that mario was getting a haircut.the parties dispute what robert told the officers about the car robert claims that he told the officers that the car had been sitting in the driveway for ten or twenty minutes,whereas the officers claim that robert initially denied that anyone had used the car for months,and then said that he and mario had used the car to drive home from work earlier.the officers then asked robert for the car keys,which he provided,and had the car towed to the police station.they asked robert to come to the station with mario for interviews.
redlund and chou were also summoned to the police station,where redlund provided a written statement about the incident and described it to attleboro detective timothy cook.aponte took redlund and chou separately to see a row of cars in the station parking lot,and asked each boy if he could identify the car that had struck redlund.both boys identified robert honda.chou was then shown a picture of robert,but could not identify him.
when the robinsons arrived at the station whether this was before or after the boys arrived is unclear,they agreed to be interviewed.mario was taken to an interrogation room,read his miranda rights,and interviewed by detective cook.redlund watched on video with his father and other officers.redlund was initially unable to identify mario,but recognized him as the car passenger once he removed the hat he was wearing.mario denied that he or his father had been involved in the,and said that his father had been the only person to drive the car that day.detective cook nevertheless arrested him for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
robert was then taken to the interrogation room and read his miranda rights.redlund,watching on the monitor,could not identify robert.like mario,robert denied that he or mario had been involved and said that only he had driven the car that day to and from work in boston.detective cook arrested robert for leaving the scene of an accident,negligent operation of a motor vehicle,and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
what happened next is sharply disputed.the robinsons contend that detective cook and patrolman timothy cook,detective cook son assaulted mario during the booking process,whereas the defendants contend that mario refused to obey their orders and made as if to strike detective cook.the details of this altercation are not relevant to this appeal by either account,mario was not injured during the struggle.prosecutors later added charges against mario stemming from this incident,but all of the charges against both mario and robert were eventually dismissed by the state trial court.
the robinsons subsequently filed suit against the city of attleboro,detective cook,patrolman cook,and six other police officers who were present for or involved in various phases of the investigation,arrest,and detention they raised state and federal constitutional claims under and the massachusetts civil rights act mcra.laws ch,based on allegations of unlawful arrest,the use of excessive force,and the unreasonable seizure of the car.they also asserted state law claims for false imprisonment,assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,aiding and abetting,and civil conspiracy.
after discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on most of the robinsons claims.robinson cook,d.the district court found that the arrests were supported by probable cause and thus that the claim for false imprisonment must fail,id.at,and that the warrantless seizure of the car was lawful,id.at.the court also found no evidence that could establish municipal liability,id.at,or support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,id.at.the court did,however,find that the disputed facts regarding the scuffle in the police station between mario and the cooks precluded summary judgment on the claims of excessive force,assault and battery,aiding and abetting,and civil conspiracy.see id.at.and the court further concluded that qualified immunity could not shield the defendants from liability on the excessive force claim because the unwarranted use of excessive force against an individual who was posing no threat and making no attempt to evade or resist arrest would be clearly unlawful to a reasonable police officer.id.at.
in a subsequent order clarifying its decision,the district court also granted summary judgment for three of the police officer defendants malhotra,macdonald,and fuoco as to the civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims,leaving those claims alive only as to detective cook and patrolman cook.the parties then agreed that the court should enter judgment dismissing the remaining claims,with the robinsons right to appeal that dismissal waived,but with the understanding that the plaintiffs are preserving all rights of appeal from the summary judgment.
as framed by the parties,the net result of this procedural muddle is that four issues remain whether the seizure of the car was constitutional whether the arrests were constitutional whether these actions can give rise to municipal liability under monell new york city department of social services,d and whether there is evidence to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress

a.the seizure of robert car 
we begin with the robinsons contention that the defendants seizure of robert honda,from his own driveway and without a warrant,violated the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures,amend iv,and the massachusetts constitution parallel guarantee,pt,art.xiv this argument calls for us to apply the automobile exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement,under which police may conduct a warrantless search or seizure of a car if they have probable cause to do so.see maryland dyson,d per curiam pennsylvania labron,d per curiam.
the robinsons argue that the police lacked probable cause to seize the car.they also contend that an additional requirement applies here because robert car was parked not on a public road,where probable cause alone would suffice,united states mccoy,cir,but rather in his own driveway,the robinsons say that the police also needed exigent circumstances to justify the seizure.the district court said the same thing,d at citing united states swanson,cir,and the defendants neither disputed the point below nor do so now.given that the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that the automobile exception does not have a separate exigency requirement,dyson,at see labron,at,we are less certain nevertheless,because the issue is neither disputed nor dispositive here,we will assume for the sake of argument that both probable cause and exigent circumstances were necessary.
probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances as to which the police have reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that evidence of a crime will be found.safford unified sch.dist.redding,d see also united states grubbs,d probable cause is present when there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.the robinsons argue that this standard was not met here because the boys description of the car that hit redlund was too commonplace to create a sufficient likelihood that robert honda was that car.we disagree.
redlund and chou described the car that hit redlund as a silver or tan japanese compact in poor shape with a rubber strip hanging from the side.this description,which closely matches robert honda,is fairly precise,especially insofar as it encompasses the car condition and includes a peculiar physical feature the rubber strip.further,the car was found within a mile of the site,which,together with redlund memory of having seen the car in the area before,bolstered the officers conclusion that it was the car they were looking for.and the warmth of the engine showed that the honda had been driven recently,further distinguishing it from similar cars parked in the vicinity.the totality of these circumstances was sufficient to create a fair probability that robert honda contained or was evidence related to the.see chambers maroney,d finding probable cause for stop and arrest where witnesses described a light blue compact station wagon,which was spotted two miles from crime scene,less than an hour after the crime occurred capraro bunt,cir finding probable cause to seize a truck from the owner driveway because it matched a kidnapping victim description of the vehicle used in the kidnapping united states breedlove,cir an accurate,albeit general,description of a car and its occupants created probable cause,where the car was spotted at a time and distance from the crime scene consistent with its being the get away car.thus,the police had probable cause to seize the car 
exigent circumstances if actually necessary were also present.as the district court noted,neither robert nor mario was under arrest when the officers left their house thus,they would have had an opportunity to abscond with the vehicle if it had not been towed.d at see also swanson,at exigent circumstances justified seizure of a car where,because officers did not arrest the owner,he would have been free to drive the car away,and perhaps destroy or dispose of evidence,or even the car itself wayne lafave,search seizure b,at nn.ed collecting cases emphasizing the ability of defendants or third parties to move or tamper with cars not yet searched or seized.the robinsons protest that upholding the seizure on this basis would allow the police to create exigent circumstances by failing to arrest someone,thereby creating the risk that evidence will be destroyed.but even if the officers had probable cause to arrest robert at this point which the robinsons do not accept,and had actually done so,mario would have remained at large he was not at home when the police were there,and could have returned to move or meddle with the car thus,assuming that exigent circumstances were required here,see supra note,they were present.consequently,the seizure did not offend either the fourth amendment or article xiv.
b.the arrests 
we turn next to the robinsons arrests.a warrantless arrest is permissible under the fourth amendment where there is probable cause,where reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances would enable a reasonably prudent person to believe that the arrestee has committed a crime even if it differs from the one named by police during the arrest or booking.devenpeck alford,d united states jones,cir.the same standard governs warrantless arrests under article xiv.see massachusetts hernandez,massachusetts santaliz.here,the robinsons argue that the police lacked probable cause to arrest robert or mario for any crime.
mario arrest 
detective cook arrested mario for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon under.laws ch,b.that offense requires an intentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another with a dangerous weapon which can include a car.see massachusetts appleby.no specific intent to injure is required the intent element is satisfied if the defendant had a general intent to do the act causing injury.id.at.the robinsons challenge mario arrest on three grounds.
a.the boys identification of the honda 
the robinsons first contend that the process by which redlund and chou identified the honda at the police station was so suggestive that it could not contribute to a finding of probable cause.both parties frame their arguments on this issue and on the reliability of redlund identification of mario,discussed below using the standard developed by the supreme court to govern the admissibility of witness identifications at criminal trials.see perry new hampshire,d describing the line of cases leading from stovall denno,d,to manson brathwaite,d.under this test,courts first ask whether the police have use d an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.id.at.if so,and if the totality of the circumstances considered in light of various factors reveals a substantial likelihood of misidentification,the identification will be excluded.id.at see united states,cir.
without questioning its application in the criminal context,we think it unwise to expand the brathwaite framework from a rule of evidence to a rule of damages by applying it in an arrestee civil suit alleging that probable cause was undermined by an unreliable identification.see phillips allen,cir declining to apply brathwaite in a case alleging unlawful arrest see good curtis,cir similar mundy georgia,cir similar abreu guzman ford,cir discussing whether photographic identification supported probable cause,for purposes of arrestee bivens claim,without reference to the brathwaite framework lallemand of,cir similar,in case rather,we think the best course is to continue to weigh probable cause in these civil cases by asking whether a given piece of information including an allegedly unreliable identification is trustworthy enough that a reasonably prudent person would rely on it in forming a belief about the suspect conduct.jones,at see roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir f or the purpose of determining probable cause,courts must ask whether a reasonable person would rely on a particular piece of information,not whether that information was unquestionably accurate.of course,when courts apply that standard to a particular eyewitness identification that a plaintiff alleges is unreliable whether as a result of suggestive police procedures or otherwise,the factors identified in the stovall brathwaite cases will be relevant considerations in the analysis that traditionally has guided probable cause determinations.illinois gates,d 
applying this test to the facts at hand,we find that a reasonable person would rely on the boys identification of robert honda.redlund testified at his deposition that his father,detective aponte,took him into the police station parking lot,where there was a row of cars,and asked him to point out the car that had hit him.redlund recognized the car,noting specifically the dangling rubber trim piece and a red warning sticker he had noticed on the center console during the incident.similarly,chou testified that the officers took him to the parking lot to identify the car he recognized the color,noted the hanging weather strip,and saw that the car was a honda 
the robinsons challenge to this process is essentially that,as impressionable youths,the boys would have been so inclined to believe that the police including redlund father had identified the correct car and driver that their identification of the car was valueless.but the robinsons offer no support for the proposition that an identification is unreliable simply because an eyewitness is young or inclined to trust the police.indeed,as the district court observed,d at,the fact that redlund and chou declined to identify robert himself in more suggestive circumstances cuts sharply against the robinsons argument that the boys were simply overawed by the police officers.further,the honda was apparently situated in a row of cars the record does not reflect how similar the other cars were to the honda,but there is no indication that the officers directed the boys to the honda.rather,redlund recounted that aponte asked him can you tell me which car hit you and that redlund then found the honda.and,of course,the honda closely matched the boys prior description of the car that hit redlund.on this record,the boys identification of the car was reliable enough to help establish probable cause.see roche,at.
redlund identification of mario 
the robinsons next challenge redlund identification of mario himself,on much the same grounds they also point out that show up identifications like this one are generally disfavored.see stovall,at describing the use of identifications instead of as widely condemned.we take no issue with that point.nevertheless,we conclude that this identification was sufficiently reliable to contribute to a finding of probable cause.
redlund was asked to identify mario via television during mario interview with detective cook.redlund was initially unable to identify mario,but recognized him once he removed his hat,revealing a distinctive hairstyle.the fact that redlund could not identify mario until he removed his hat and that neither boy could identify robert at all belies the robinsons assertion that the boys were blindly following the assurances of trusted authority figures.further,this identification took place mere hours after the,and there is no suggestion that redlund did not get a decent look at the passenger during the incident.garcía,at discussing factors probative of identification reliability.finally,as the district court found,redlund identification of mario was consistent with other that have been held to support a finding of probable cause,right down to the young age of the witness.see brodnicki city of omaha,cir applying the brathwaite framework to find it reasonable for police officers to rely on a to support probable cause,where the witness provided a detailed description of the suspect and his car and was confident in her identification of the suspect,which took place on the same day as the alleged crime.
evidence of culpability 
the robinsons final challenge to mario arrest takes a different tack.they contend that,even if mario was the passenger in the car that hit redlund,there is no evidence that he actually did anything other than shout and swear at the boys thus,he can not have had the requisite general intent to do the act causing injury.appleby,at.the district court agreed in part,seeing no probable cause to believe that mario had committed the offense himself,but finding probable cause to arrest him for aiding and abetting or conspiring to commit that offense,because there was evidence the shouting and that mario role in the alleged incident was not merely that of a passive observer.d at see also massachusetts zanetti,a defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting if he knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged with the intent required for that offense 
whether probable cause justified mario arrest is a close question.mere proximity to a criminal act does not establish probable cause the police must show some additional circumstances from which it is reasonable to infer participation in criminal activity.united states martínez molina,cir.and,as the robinsons point out,another circuit has declined to find probable cause as a matter of law on similar facts.in torres city of los angeles,cir,a case,the police had arrested the plaintiff and charged him with murder and attempted murder,based on evidence that,while riding in a car,he had flashed gang signs and shouted challenges shortly before another passenger shot two people one fatally.id.at.the ninth circuit reversed a judgment as a matter of law for the defendants,explaining that a reasonable juror could find that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the plaintiff because their evidence of the passenger conduct did not establish that he had acted in concert with the shooter and with the requisite mental state.id.
the robinsons argue that the same reasoning applies here,but we think torres is distinguishable.the ninth circuit conclusion that the police lacked evidence of culpable conduct by the passenger was only part of its probable cause holding,which also turned on the fact that the police lacked sufficient evidence to believe that torres actually was the passenger in the first place.see id.at.there is also a material difference in the underlying facts in torres,the passenger conduct apparently precipitated a car chase that culminated in the shooting,whereas here,the came immediately after the passenger confrontation with the boys.thus,the inference that the car occupants were acting in concert is more plausible here than it was in torres,where the shooter was apparently responding to the intervening event of the car chase.see id.at.
in sum,we think the district court did not err by finding probable cause here.the facts known to the police in particular,the immediacy with which the followed the passenger verbal abuse were sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude that the passenger intended the driver to hit redlund.see appleby,at section requires only general intent.coupled with the adequately reliable identifications of the honda and of mario himself,this information was sufficient to create probable cause for mario arrest under an theory.as we said,the question is close,but t he threshold for probable cause in a criminal case is low,suboh dist.attorney office of suffolk,cir,and the evidence here just clears that bar.
robert arrest 
we reach the same conclusion as to robert arrest,which was also based on assault and battery,as well as negligence and leaving the scene of an accident.the robinsons challenge robert arrest on two bases.the first that the identification of the car was unreliable we have already rejected.the second is that the police concluded that robert was driving the car during the incident by selectively and unreasonably crediting only some of his statements.we find this argument,too,unavailing.
robert told the police,both at his house and at the station,that he had driven the car earlier in the day,but had merely driven it home from work and was not involved in the incident.the robinsons argue that it was contradictory for the police to credit robert acknowledgment that he and no one else had driven the car that day,but not also his statement that he had been at work and did not hit redlund.but a reasonable police officer need not credit a suspect statements.cox hainey,cir.and we are aware of no authority standing for the dubious proposition that if a person tells the truth about one thing,he can not be lying about so
