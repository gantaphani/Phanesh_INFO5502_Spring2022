this appeal stems from an international parental kidnapping perpetrated by defendant mirvat el nady.in this case,colin bower,is el nady former husband.in august,el nady acted in violation of a court order when she drove the former couple two minor children to new york city,where they boarded an egyptair airlines company egyptair flight to cairo,egypt.this prompted bower,on his own behalf and on behalf of his two minor children,to initiate this lawsuit against el nady and egyptair.bower claims that the airline interfered with his custodial relations and was negligent in allowing el nady to board the flight despite the alleged presence of red flags suggesting that she was abducting the two children.the district court granted egyptair motion for summary judgment and dismissed bower claims,finding that egyptair did not know of el nady plan to abduct the children and did not owe either bower or the children a duty to investigate the red flags.bower now appeals from that determination,arguing,among other things,that the district court erred in determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction.we find that the district court had jurisdiction over the claims and affirm their dismissal,albeit on the grounds that the claims are preempted under the airline deregulation act,ada.
background 
factual background 
mirvat el nady,an egyptian citizen,and colin bower,a united states citizen,met in cairo,egypt and married in.subsequently,they moved to london where they had two children,whom the parties refer to as n and in,the family moved to massachusetts,but the relationship between bower and el nady eventually soured,and they divorced in massachusetts on december.pursuant to the divorce decree,bower was given sole legal custody of the children,but he shared physical custody with el nady.the decree also prohibited el nady from taking the children out of massachusetts.
on or about august,bower dropped off the children at el nady home in massachusetts for a visit.on august,el nady drove the two children to john kennedy international airport jfk in new york.once there,she purchased three tickets to cairo,egypt,for which she paid almost in cash.el nady and her children presented egyptian passports for travel.egyptair did not recognize that the children passports had no entry visas reflecting the children arrival in the united states.moreover,egyptair did not comment on the fact that el nady and her children had different last names nor did it check for their i forms 
following their flight,el nady and the children remained in cairo,egypt with no intention of returning to the united states.el nady had previously worked in egypt and currently has family there.in december,approximately four months after moving to egypt,el nady obtained an order from a court in cairo granting her custody of the two children.shortly thereafter,bower retained counsel in cairo and appealed the custody order the cairo court granted bower motion seeking visitation rights,and he was able to visit the children at least four times in cairo,under the supervision of el nady and members of her family.
procedural history 
on february,bower filed this action in massachusetts superior court on his behalf and on behalf of his children in his capacity as guardian of n and as defendants,he listed both el and egyptair.his complaint asserted that egyptair intentionally interfered with his custodial relations and was negligent in allowing el nady and the children passage to egypt despite the presence of numerous red flags that suggested a child abduction was in progress.he also alleged that he has incurred significant economic damages in attempting to locate and recover his children since they were abducted by his former spouse,and that he has suffered trauma and emotional distress with physical manifestations,as well as loss of filial consortium,due to the absence of his children.
on march,egyptair removed the case to federal district court on diversity grounds or,alternatively,on the grounds that the claims were preempted by an international treaty known as the montreal convention following removal,bower filed a motion seeking a ruling to resolve the issue of whether the court possessed subject matter jurisdiction.the district court determined that there was diversity jurisdiction,finding that both el nady and egyptair were citizens of egypt at the time the litigation commenced.
on march,the district court granted egyptair motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of bower claims against egyptair.as a threshold matter,the district court rejected egyptair argument that the claims against it were preempted by the ada and the montreal convention.as to the merits,the district court found that egyptair had no actual knowledge that el nady in fact planned to kidnap the children,thus dooming bower interference with custodial relations claim.as to the negligence claims,the court concluded that egyptair owed no duty of care,either to bower or the children,to investigate whether el nady was traveling with them in violation of a court order.
following the district court ruling on the motion for summary judgment,bower filed this timely appeal 
ii.discussion 
we begin our discussion by explaining why the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over this case.we then proceed to the matter of preemption under the ada.
subject matter jurisdiction 
bower first argument on appeal is that the district court erred when it found that the parties had complete diversity of citizenship.specifically,bower claims that el nady is a fugitive from justice under,since she fled the united states to avoid prosecution for kidnapping his children.because she is a fugitive,he argues,the district court should have found that her domicile was her last known residence in massachusetts.such a finding would,bower argues,properly divest the court of subject matter jurisdiction.
we review the district court conclusion that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint de novo.fernández vargas pfizer,cir.for the following reasons,we disagree with bower jurisdiction argument and find that the district court correctly concluded that el nady domicile for diversity purposes is egypt.
the law is well established that an adult person acquires a legal domicile when he or she is physically present in a location and has the intent to remain there for the indefinite future.hall curran,cir see garcía pérez santaella,cir rodríguez díaz sierra martínez,cir ascertaining an individual domicile requires two showings physical presence in a state and the intent to make such a state the individual home.el nady,by virtue of her presence in egypt and her demonstrated intent to remain there,acquired a legal domicile in egypt.her status as a fugitive does not prevent such a finding where the presence plus intent rule is satisfied.see stifel hopkins,cir refugees or fugitives,who leave their homes because of apprehension of prosecution can establish domiciles within the jurisdictions in which they seek asylum.popal slovis,civ,wl,finding that alleged murderer fleeing to california to evade a police investigation could establish a domicile in california.
it is only when these presence and intent requirements can not be met,such as when a fugitive current whereabouts are unknown,that the fugitive last domicile before fleeing should be his domicile for diversity purposes.see lloyd loeffler,cir.as judge posner explained 
it seems absurd to hold that since a fugitive might be domiciled anywhere or maybe even nowhere the act of becoming a fugitive puts a person beyond the jurisdiction of the federal courts.probably the last domicile of the fugitive before he fled should be his domicile for diversity purposes this is a simple rule,and avoids rewarding the fugitive for his elusiveness.
id.at internal citation omitted.where an alleged fugitive has established both physical presence and intent to remain indefinitely at a known location,however,the logic of lloyd does not sound with equal force.ríos civiletti,considering an army deserter,the court stated,the total circumstances of his desertion must be examined to know if his stay,however long,in mexico worked to effect a change of his domicile.under such circumstances,the fugitive has,through compliance with the presence plus intent rule,established a new domicile in the state where she or he is hiding.see united states otherson,a fugitive from justice can establish a legal domicile where he is hiding.
it is undisputed that el nady,in august of,fled the united states and took her children to cairo,egypt,where she had previously worked and currently has family.while there,el nady initiated a custody battle in egyptian courts for her children.indeed,as asserted in bower complaint,el nady intends to remain in egypt with the children permanently el nady relocation and her intent to remain in egypt satisfy the requirements of the presence plus intent rule.see padilla mangual pavía,cir sullivan town of ashfield,a domicile once acquired is presumed to continue until a new one is acquired by actual change of residence with the intention of remaining permanently at the place of removal.as such,at the time the suit was brought,el nady was domiciled in egypt,and lloyd domicile rule is wholly inapplicable.
bower disagrees with this assessment and instead argues that lloyd is directly applicable to the facts of this case.in lloyd,he claims,the whereabouts of the fugitive defendants were also known,given that the fugitives had sent several pieces of correspondence postmarked from milwaukee,wisconsin to their family members.we disagree.the mere existence of postmarked correspondence,on its own,fails to show that the fugitive defendants intended to remain in wisconsin indefinitely.see.band of choctaw indians holyfield,d stating that domicile is not necessarily synonymous with residence.in fact,the seventh circuit noted that the plaintiff had spent thousands of dollars on private detectives to locate the fugitive defendants and his kidnapped daughter,to no avail.lloyd,at.in contrast,the undisputed evidence here shows that el nady fled to egypt with the intent to remain there indefinitely and that bower had no trouble finding her,as evinced by his appeal of the egyptian court custody order and his multiple visits with his children under el nady supervision.therefore,the holding in lloyd is inapposite to the facts of this case.
next,bower claims that if el nady qualifies as an egyptian domiciliary,so do the children n and r,who were living with her at the time this suit was filed.because the children are plaintiffs in this case,he claims,there is not complete diversity given that the defendants,egyptair and el nady,are also egyptian domiciliaries.although the district court did not make a finding as to this issue,we conclude that the children remain domiciled in massachusetts.
we rely on federal common law when determining a litigant domicile for diversity purposes.rodríguez díaz,at.typically,relevant rules of state law provide the basis for the applicable federal common law.id.at.in massachusetts,the domicile of a child is the same as the domicile of the parent who has lawful custody of the child.durfee durfee,emphasis added see also gil servizio,the domicile of the children is the same as the domicile of their parent who has lawful custody of them.accordingly,a parent without lawful custody has no power to change the domicile of his child while subject to a valid decree giving custody to the other parent.conley conley,holding that the domicile of the child follows that of the parent with lawful custody.bower was awarded sole legal custody of his children since a child domicile follows that of the parent with lawful custody,and el nady has no power to change the domicile of her children while they are subject to a valid custody order,the domicile of the children is massachusetts.see conley,at.
thus,there exists complete diversity of citizenship between the parties such that the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case.
preemption under the ada 
bower second claim of error on appeal is that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to egyptair.specifically,bower takes issue with the court findings that the airline had no actual knowledge that el nady was traveling with the children in violation of a court order and was under no duty to investigate that fact.for the reasons that follow,however,we conclude that bower common law tort claims against egyptair are preempted by the ada.
we review the district court granting of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.rockwood skf usa,cir.we may affirm on any independently sufficient grounds made manifest by the record id.federal preemption issues are questions of statutory construction that we review de novo.difiore american airlines,cir.
to determine whether plaintiff common law tort claims are preempted by the ada,b,we begin by noting that the supremacy clause nullifies state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to federal laws enacted by congress.gibbons ogden,wheat.federal preemption may be either express or implied,and where express,the starting point for our analysis is the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.fmc holliday,d internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the ada expressly states that except as otherwise provided,a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least two states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation b.as we recently explained,ada preemption analysis breaks down into two whether the claim is based on a state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law,the mechanism question,and whether the claim is sufficiently related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier the linkage question.brown united airlines,cir.
in the case at hand,plaintiffs asserted common law claims of interference with custodial relations,negligence,negligent infliction of emotional distress,and loss of filial consortium.turning to our recent decision in brown,we find that the question of whether these claims fall within the ada preemption provision has already been answered.in brown,we explained that state common law claims are covered by the language other provision having the force and effect of law.id.at see united airlines,mesa airlines,cir state common law counts as an other provision having the force and effect of law for purposes of this statute.but see ginsberg northwest,cir,cert.granted,d ruling common law contract claims related to an airline frequent flyer program were not preempted by the ada.
this is not to say that congress intended all common law tort and contract claims to be preempted by the ada.to the contrary,the supreme court has clearly stated that there are numerous claims that survive preemption.morales trans world airlines,d explaining that state actions that affect airlines in too tenuous,remote or peripheral a manner may survive preemption.for example,the court has drawn a distinction between consumer protection standards and claims that an airline breached its own contract terms.am.airlines,wolens,d preempting plaintiffs claims under the former,while allowing the latter.numerous courts have also recognized that the federal aviation authority savings clause,c,as well as its mandated insurance coverage provision,a,would not make sense unless congress intended certain tort claims to survive preemption.id.at,taj mahal travel delta airlines,cir charas trans world airlines,cir.
thus,while our decision in brown answers the mechanism question,we must now turn to the linkage question portion of the preemption analysis and ask whether plaintiff common law claims are sufficiently relat ed to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.brown,at.
boiled down to their essence,plaintiff claims assert that egyptair failed to respond appropriately to numerous red flags when it allowed el nady to board a flight to egypt with the two abducted children.specifically,plaintiffs maintain that egyptair should have been alerted by the differing surnames of the mother and children the emergency nature of the tickets,purchased in cash on the day of the flight the fact that egypt is not a signatory to the hague convention,enhancing the risk of international abduction and the fact that the children egyptian passports did not contain entry visas.plaintiffs argue that due to the presence of these red flags,egyptair should have been alerted to the possibility of an international child abduction and either investigated further,required a signed parental consent form,or had some procedure in place to deal with these types of circumstances.
in determining whether these claims are preempted by the ada,we first turn to the text of the statute.it is plain that the claims are neither related to a price or route in anything more than the most tangential of ways.the sticking point,then,is service.
we have previously recognized a circuit split on the interpretation of the word service.difiore,at.most notably,the ninth circuit in charas narrowly interpreted service to track closely to price and route.in their opinion,service referred to the frequency and scheduling of transportation,and to the selection of markets to and from which transportation is provided as in an airline providing service from tucson to new york twice a day.charas,at.
we decline to follow this approach.as we noted in difiore,the supreme court opinion in rowe motor transport ass n,d,has treated service more expansively in rowe,the court held that maine attempt to regulate tobacco shipping in the state by requiring numerous delivery verification procedures substantially impacted the delivery services offered by air and motor vehicle carriers.id.at.in our view,rowe forecloses the charas interpretation of service as a term closely related to prices and routes.see air transport ass of am.cuomo,cir agreeing that rowe necessarily defined service to extend beyond prices,schedules,origins and destinations.we also believe that the charas interpretation skirts the canon of avoiding superfluousness.corley united states,d.by narrowly interpreting service to relate to scheduling and service to certain destinations,the charas opinion does little to distinguish service from route.
the broader view of service,which rowe in our sister circuits,includes items such as the handling of luggage,food and beverage provisions,ticketing,and boarding procedures.see,cuomo,at travel all over the world,kingdom of saudi arabia,cir hodges delta airlines,cir.we implicitly adopted this approach shortly after it was initially advanced by the fifth circuit in hodges.see chukwu bd.of dirs.british airways,aff mem.sub nom.azubuko bd.of dirs.british airways,cir unpublished table decision.our most recent decisions on the linkage question,difiore and brown,held that claims brought by luggage handlers against an airline were preempted by the ada,noting that they could fairly relate to either a price or service of the airline.difiore,at see brown,at.
although this case presents a set of facts not squarely addressed in the cases cited above,we believe these claims are similarly covered by the term service.plaintiff complaint is essentially that egyptair allowed el nady to board the aircraft without adequately investigating her documentation and status.numerous circuits have held that where an airline denied boarding,the claims were preempted.see,onoh nw.airlines,cir smith comair,cir see also chukwu.at.whether the airline is allowing a passenger onto the plane or preventing a passenger from boarding,that determination takes place during the company ticketing,and boarding procedures.see chukwu.at the gist of plaintiff complaint is that the airline wrongfully prevented his brother from boarding a flight,a process uniquely within the service provided and controlled by air carriers.we thus conclude that the ticketing,and boarding procedures at issue here constitute a service for the purposes of the ada in accordance with our broader view of the term service.
plaintiffs protest that the decision to allow boarding is nonetheless too tenuous,remote,or peripheral,morales,at,in its relationship to the provision of a service.we disagree.the supreme court has noted the breadth of the relating to language and the broad interpretation it has afforded the phrase in cases interpreting the employee retirement income security act.id.at see shaw delta air lines,d.ultimately,congress intent in enacting the ada and its preemption provision was ensuring maximum reliance on competitive market forces and that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.morales,at.as such,state law may be preempted even if it is indirectly or generally applicable,and preemption is favored where the law would have a significant impact on congress deregulatory goals.rowe,at.
in this case,the district court assumed that the claims in question implicated services,but it felt that the claims did not relate to the services strongly enough.bower el nady,d.it viewed the negligence claims as being similar to personal injury tort claims,which nearly all courts agree are not preempted by the ada.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied heavily on gill jetblue airways,d,which held that a personal injury lawsuit was not preempted despite its implicating the service of boarding because it did not sufficiently relate to congress deregulatory goals.the district court felt that in this case,although plaintiff success might have an incidental impact on the airline ticketing procedures,it would be a generalized one that would not put any one airline at a competitive disadvantage.bower,d at.
we disagree.although the district court correctly noted that personal injury claims are generally not preempted by the ada,there are numerous distinctions between personal injury claims and the claims present in this case.first,the fact that the ada insurance provision mandates that airlines carry sufficient insurance to pay for bodily injury to,or death of its passengers suggests that congress never intended to preempt personal injury claims.see a.plaintiffs do not allege bodily injury here,however.
second,neither a tort claim like the one at issue in gill,nor the type of minor breach of contract claim at issue in gives rise to the type of patchwork state regulations that the ada was intended to dissolve.much like the laws against gambling and prostitution referenced as tenuous in morales,standard common law duties of care have little effect on an airlines operations.see morales,at.accordingly,the ada offers little reason to treat a passenger who slips and falls while deplaning differently than one who slips and falls in a restaurant were we to hold that egyptair violated its common law tort duty in this case,however,we would be imposing a fundamentally new set of obligations on airlines under the rubric of duty of care.these would include heightened and qualitatively different procedures for the booking and boarding of certain passengers on certain flights.to defeat congressional intent to preempt,a mere reference to a duty of care will not suffice.it is the nature and extent of that duty which alters the analysis.we believe the third circuit stated the issue well when it said the proper inquiry is whether a common law tort remedy frustrates deregulation by interfering with competition through public regulation.when state law does not have a regulatory effect,it is too tenuous,remote or peripheral to be preempted.taj mahal travel,at quoting morales,at.
plaintiffs,however,suggest that the proper analysis relates to the economic impact that the laws would have on the airlines.the district court seemed to agree,stating that it is difficult to imagine why any one airline would be put at a competitive disadvantage with others subject to the same rules.we do not see this as the correct analysis as we have recently recognized,the ada preempts laws regulating the operations of airlines whether at high cost or low.difiore,at explaining that skycaps attempts to change the airlines signage and messaging,at little cost to the airline,are just what congress did not want the states regulating.i
