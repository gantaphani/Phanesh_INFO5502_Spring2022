on february,moisés moisés,a minor,and his parents,héctor muñiz and sonia crespo collectively plaintiffs,brought this diversity action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,alleging medical malpractice against defendant salvador plaintiffs requested damages caused by rovira failure to provide moisés with adequate care and for his mishandling of the infant delivery.
on may,a jury found that moisés suffered a lesion in his brachial plexus due to traction during his delivery,which permanently impaired the use of his left arm and hand.the jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of two million dollars.on june,the district court reduced the award to.rovira appealed the judgment and we affirmed.muñiz rovira,cir.on may,rovira filed a motion to set aside judgment,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.on september,the district court denied the motion,and rovira now appeals,requesting that we grant the motion,or in the alternative,remand for an evidentiary hearing.after careful consideration,we affirm.
sonia crespo came into rovira care when she was thirty weeks pregnant.she was years old,diabetic,and pregnant with her sixth child.the combination of these factors made sonia a patient,and the jury heard evidence from which it concluded that rovira breached the applicable standard of care with respect to her pregnancy and moisés delivery.at trial,the jury heard evidence that rovira failed to monitor and control sonia blood sugar levels during the later stages of her pregnancy,and did not monitor adequately through ultrasound examinations and oxytocin challenge tests moisés status during gestation.these omissions increased the risk that moisés would be macrosomic,a large infant.large infants must be delivered using specific methods ideally by caesarean section to avoid injury,and plaintiffs expert testified that rovira failed to take the necessary precautions to determine whether moisés was macrosomic.
moisés was in fact a macrosomic infant,and he experienced a traumatic delivery on april,during which he sustained an injury to his brachial plexus.the brachial plexus injury led moisés to develop erb palsy,a paralysis of the cervical spinal nerves corresponding to the brachial plexus.as a result of the injury,moisés left shoulder,arm,and hand suffered atrophy and did not develop normally.
the jury heard expert testimony to the effect that moisés has little range of motion and diminished reflexes on his left side,even after extensive treatment and two surgeries.sonia testified that moisés can not play,bathe,use the restroom,or attend school without extensive supervision and assistance.plaintiffs expert testified that even if he continues with physical therapy,moisés condition will affect him for the rest of his life.rovira,in turn,presented contrary testimony from an expert who predicted that moisés would fully recover.
one year and five months after judgment was entered for plaintiffs,rovira submitted to the district court video surveillance footage of moisés in support of his motion to set aside judgment on the basis that plaintiffs had misrepresented the extent of moisés injuries at trial.
the district court reviewed the surveillance footage and made the following observations on november,moisés appears to be picking something up from the floor with his right hand while protecting his left arm.the left arm appears stiff and shows no signs of ordinary mobility on the same date,moisés appears to be trying to lower the hood of his jacket without using his left arm on january,moisés appears,holding and protecting his left arm on january,moisés appears,carrying a bag of indeterminate weight on his shoulders,but not using his left arm on march,moisés was observed walking and showing a distinct and clear ly stiff left arm and on april,moisés appears to have had full movement of his right arm,but his left arm was stiff as he waited for the bus to go to school.
we review denial of a motion to set aside judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for abuse of discretion.karak bursaw oil,cir.under b,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party.b.a successful rule b motion has two elements first,the movant must demonstrate as fraud or clear and convincing evidence.second,the movant must show that the misconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of his case.karak,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
rovira argues that he has satisfied both prongs under karak,and that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to set aside judgment.as to the first prong,he claims that plaintiffs misrepresented moisés injury and the extent of his impairment.because we find that rovira has not met his burden under the first prong,we do not consider the merits of his argument under the second.
in support of his allegation of misrepresentation,rovira presents an alternative interpretation of the events depicted in the surveillance video.he disagrees with the court analysis of the video,essentially arguing that moisés failure to use his left arm or hand in the activities depicted in no way evinces the child having trouble using his left arm because he could be.based solely upon this flimsy argument,rovira concludes that the video actually depicts moisés with a functional arm,and argues therefore that he has satisfied the first karak prong.we find rovira video evidence to be neither clear nor convincing.
under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,f indings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.we are bound by this deferential standard of review,clarified by the supreme court in anderson city of bessemer city,d.in that case the court held that,
i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.this is so even when the district court findings do not rest on credibility determinations,but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.
id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the court could scarcely have been more clear on this point we may not exercise de novo review over the district court account of the video evidence in this case.under the clear error standard,rovira must convince us that there was only one permissible interpretation of the surveillance footage,and that the district court interpretation was clearly incorrect.rovira has not met this burden.because we find that rovira has not satisfied the first prong of karak,we need not continue to consider the second.
rovira requests,in the alternative,that we remand for an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the gravity of moisés injuries.rovira does not develop any argument in support of this request and we consider it waived.am.cyanamid capuano,cir.
we award standard costs to the appellees.the appellees request for attorneys fees,made in the closing sentence of appellees brief,must be made by separate motion,cir.loc.b,and we note that absent statute such motions are granted only in egregious circumstances.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm.
plaintiffs also filed suit against hospital san antonio,and the puerto rico insurance guaranty association,but the parties settled on december,and april,respectively,and those claims are not relevant to this appeal.
the brachial plexus is formed from a group of combining nerve roots that eventually divide again to form both motor and sensory peripheral nerves.these peripheral nerves are responsible for the entire sensory and motor supply to the upper extremities shoulders,arms,forearms,and hands and some muscles of the b
