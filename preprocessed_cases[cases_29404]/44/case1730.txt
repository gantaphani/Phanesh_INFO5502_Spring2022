enrique villafranca appeals the district court judgment,following a bench trial,that he take nothing on his assault and negligence claims against the united states under the federal tort claims act.the district court determined that the federal agents did not commit an assault against villafranca because they used reasonable force to effect a lawful arrest.the district court also found that the agents alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of villafranca injuries,and thus he did not have a viable claim for negligence.because we hold that the agents actions were privileged under texas law,those actions did not constitute an assault for which the united states would be liable under the federal tort claims act.further,the district court finding that the agents alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of villafranca injuries is not clearly erroneous.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on may,villafranca was talking on his cell phone while waiting to see his regular barber for a haircut in the lobby of melissa salon in dallas,texas the salon.shortly thereafter,united states drug enforcement administration dea agents entered the salon to execute a search warrant of the premises.the search of the salon was one of four simultaneous searches being conducted that day as part of a drug investigation.the dea agents,upon entering the salon,identified themselves as police officers and secured the premises by,among other things,asking all patrons to remain seated.the agents did not have a plan for releasing the patrons after securing the premises.
the agents also ordered villafranca to end his cell phone conversation and remain seated,but villafranca did not comply with these orders.an agent then ordered villafranca to place his hands behind his back with the intent to search him.villafranca initially complied,but as the dea agent grabbed his hands,villafranca jerked his arm and quickly moved away.upon witnessing this resistance,two other agents grabbed villafranca and forced him to the ground.on the ground,villafranca continued to resist by curling up in the fetal position and clenching his fists to his chest.the agents then forcibly handcuffed villafranca hands behind his back and sat him in a chair.everyone in the salon,including villafranca,was permitted to leave thirty minutes to an hour later when the search concluded.
on may,villafranca filed suit against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca alleging that the dea agents committed the torts of assault and negligence under texas law.villafranca claimed that he suffered severe shoulder injuries as a result of the agents actions.the government filed an answer denying villafranca claims for assault and negligence while asserting,inter alia,the affirmative defenses that its agents conduct was privileged under texas law,and villafranca own conduct was the proximate cause of his injuries.
on april,the district court held a one day bench trial,following which it entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.villafranca united states,slip op.at.on villafranca assault claim,the district court held that,because the agents used reasonable force to effect a lawful arrest,they did not commit an assault.the district court also found that the government search plan was negligent because dea agents of ordinary prudence would have included a plan for releasing the patrons after securing the premises.however,the district court went on to find that the agents negligence was not the proximate cause of villafranca injuries.because proximate cause was lacking,the district court held that villafranca negligence claim failed.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing a bench trial,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.water craft mgmt.llc mercury marine,cir.the district court proximate cause and negligence findings are findings of fact that we review for clear error.gutierrez excel,cir causation is a question of fact in texas.see also lakomy united states,cir theriot united states,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in the light of the record read as a whole.united states cluck,cir citing united states krenning,cir.
the ftca is a waiver of sovereign immunity that allows a plaintiff to bring a civil action for damages against the government.b,see also truman united states,cir.the ftca states that t he united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.the ftca also permits claims based on intentional torts when they are committed by law enforcement officers.h see also bodin vagshenian,cir.liability under the ftca is determined in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b see also solis united states,cir citing hatahley united states.therefore,texas law governs the united states liability here.
a.did the federal agents assault villafranca 
the texas assault tort and statutory privilege 
in texas,the intentional tort of assault is identical to criminal assault.see hall sonic of angleton,dist,pet.denied the elements of assault are the same in both the criminal and civil context s.texas penal code a provides,in relevant part,that a person commits criminal assault if he 
intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly causes bodily injury to another 
intentionally or knowingly threatens another with imminent bodily injury or 
intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative.
penal code ann.a vernon.
the texas penal code also provides a civil privilege defense to an assault claim.specifically,a provides 
a a peace officer is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to make or assist in making an arrest or search if 
the actor reasonably believes the arrest or search is lawful or,if the arrest or search is made under a warrant,he reasonably believes the warrant is valid and 
before using force,the actor manifests his purpose to arrest or search and identifies himself as a peace officer,unless he reasonably believes his purpose and identity are already known by or can not reasonably be made known to the person to be arrested.

was the dea agents conduct privileged 
the issue then is whether the government agents conduct is privileged under villafranca claims that the united states should be treated as a private person for purposes of the ftca analysis.see.villafranca then argues that because the dea agents conduct would constitute an assault under texas law for which a private person would incur liability,the government is liable for assault here as support for this argument,villafranca points to united states olson,d 
in olson,the supreme court held that immunity or waiver of immunity can not be applied to determine whether the government has waived immunity for a particular ftca claim.at.instead,the supreme court held that even where a plaintiff brings a claim based on performance of a unique government function,the lower courts must look to like circumstances for analogies of when private citizens would be liable in order to determine the government liability.id.at.specifically,the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit on the ground that it was inappropriate to make the united states liable for the negligent mine inspections solely because state law would make a state or municipal entity liable for similar negligence.instead,the court held that the lower courts should look to similar private person analogies rather than exact state or municipal entity analogies to determine the government liability.id.at.
the district court below acknowledged villafranca private person argument but did not expressly resolve the issue of whether the government was to be treated as a private person for purposes of.instead,the district court found that the government is not liable for assault where,as here,its law enforcement agents cause injury while using reasonable force to make a lawful arrest for a crime actually committed,and did not complete the next step of the analysis.today,we hold that the agents can invoke the texas statutory privilege.
we have previously held that the united states was entitled to claim section as a defense to civil liability under the ftca in the context of a suit.salda√±a,wl,at affirming the district court judgment that the government can invoke a privilege under c concerning use of deadly force by an officer.however,in sutton united states,we declined to determine whether incorporation of state law implies the adoption of limitations such as a privilege defense applicable to law enforcement officers in ftca actions,cir 
while we have not directly addressed this issue,district courts in this circuit have held that federal law enforcement agents can invoke state law enforcement privileges.in garza united states,the district court concluded that the government could invoke the texas law enforcement privilege as a defense to the plaintiff assault claim in an ftca case,kazen.the district court in garza reasoned that while immunity defenses were unavailable following the reasoning of indian towing united states,the government may invoke law enforcement privileges 
the distinction turns on the qualitative difference between an immunity and a privilege.unlike an immunity,which affects liability but does not diminish the tort,a privilege protects the actor from a finding of tortious conduct.
put another way,an immunity insulates an individual from liability for public policy reasons,even when that individual has engaged in conduct that would otherwise be actionable.by contrast,a privilege recognizes that,because of the nature of their duties,some public officers may perform certain acts that might otherwise be tortious if committed by someone not having those duties.

we find the garza court distinction between immunities and privileges persuasive.olson,to the extent it is applicable in the law enforcement context,does not limit the government ability to invoke the texas statutory privilege here.section a does not immunize state or municipal entities from liability,but rather it privileges the conduct of all peace officers who use reasonable force to effect an arrest.see petta,at.since olson holding concerns only whether state or municipal entity liability is an appropriate analogy for the government liability,we determine that it does not preclude the government invocation of a here.
because texas law provides a statutory civil privilege defense under a for all peace officers,we hold that the government can invoke this privilege for its law enforcement officers as well.to hold otherwise would lead to the absurd result that all federal arrests would subject the government to tort liability under the ftca absent a finding that the government actions conformed with the state specific law regarding private person arrests.instead,the appropriate private person analogy here is whether an individual,acting under color of state law,would be personally liable for assault in similar circumstances.because that individual could invoke the privilege to avoid personal liability under texas law,the government can also invoke that privilege to avoid liability here.see petta,at see also salda√±a,wl,at.
were the requirements of a satisfied 
given that the government can invoke the a privilege,we must then ask whether the agents conduct conformed to the requirements of a.the district court findings,which are not clearly erroneous,indicate that the agents were peace officers who identified themselves as officers when they entered the salon reasonably believed the arrest of villafranca was lawful based on his resistance made clear their purpose to arrest villafranca and used force reasonably believed to be immediately necessary to make the arrest see also fraire city of arlington,cir holding that a police officer was not liable for use of excessive force since requirements were satisfied hinojosa,at concluding that a state police officer is allowed to use force in necessary situations under petta,at a police officer is privileged to use force to the degree he reasonably believes is necessary to make an arrest,taking care that the force used is commensurate with the necessity.accordingly,we find that the dea agents actions were privileged under a,and thus the agents did not commit a tortious assault under texas law.therefore,the government is not liable on villafranca assault claim.
b.the proximate cause of villafranca injuries 
the district court below found that the dea agents negligence,in failing to devise a plan to release the patrons,was not the proximate cause of villafranca injury.specifically,the district court found 
any injuries to villafranca occurred after his resistance.
villafranca resistance was a new and independent cause,an act of separate and independent agency,not reasonably foreseeable,that destroyed the causal connection between the dea agents unreasonable search plan and villafranca injuries.
villafranca resistance was the sole proximate cause of villafranca injuries.
the dea agents unreasonable search plan did not cause villafranca injury.
villafranca,slip op.at.because we hold that the district court finding that the agents alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of villafranca injuries is not clearly erroneous,we need not the district court determination that the search plan was unreasonable.
villafranca now argues that a new and independent cause must arise from the conduct of an outside force and not from his actions in the incident.thus,villafranca urges that the district court findings on proximate cause were incorrect since the agents misconstrued his resistance.see omega contracting,torres,worth,no pet.holding that new and independent cause contemplates that an independent force,rather than the alleged negligent acts of the parties,was responsible for the plaintiff injuries.
the government does not challenge this specific argument.instead,it counters that the district court findings that the negligent planning did not proximately cause villafranca harm and that villafranca resistance was the sole proximate cause of his harm are sufficient to sustain the district court judgment.we agree.
in texas,proximate cause is composed of two elements foreseeability and cause in fact.ihs cedars treatment ctr.of desoto,mason.foreseeability means the actor,as a person of ordinary intelligence,should have anticipated the dangers his negligent act created for others.boggs bottomless pit cooking team,dist,no pet.cause in fact is established when the act or omission was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries,and without it,the harm would not have occurred.ihs,at.
in view of the record as a whole,the district court did not commit clear error in finding both that villafranca resistance was the proximate cause of his injuries and that the agents alleged negligence did not proximately cause his injuries.while better planning may have reduced the amount of time that villafranca had to wait in the salon,better planning would not have made villafranca obey agents orders to end his cell phone conversation,remain seated,and submit to a search.as the government correctly points out,because villafranca defiance occurred so soon after the agents entered,even a plan would not have allowed patrons to leave before villafranca disobeyed the agents commands and resisted arrest.
villafranca also attempts to frame all of the district court causation findings as relying upon the allegedly erroneous new and independent cause determination.as such,villafranca contends that the district court findings on other proximate
