sonia bocanegra appeals a jury take nothing verdict in her wrongful death and survival action against appellees boake sandoz sandoz maintenance services,clarendon insurance company and russell sargent collectively appellees.on appeal,bocanegra challenges the trial court exclusion of evidence relating to the effect of russell sargent use of marijuana on his driving abilities at the time of the accident.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
background 
ranulfo bocanegra,ranulfo was fatally injured in the early morning hours of december,when he was struck by an industrial sweeper truck as he stood on a grassy median following another accident on near scott,lafayette parish,louisiana.ranulfo and three others had been traveling as passengers in a van driven by javier galvan galvan.as the van was traveling eastbound on,it collided with an eastbound driven by moises perez and owned by vicmar services.as a result of this collision,the disabled van came to rest primarily in the lane,while the stopped in the right hand shoulder further down the highway.ranulfo and others exited the disabled van seeking safety on the grassy median on the side of the highway.shortly thereafter an industrial sweeper truck driven by russell sargent sargent and owned by boake sandoz sandoz maintanence service approached the accident scene traveling eastbound in the left hand lane.sargent swerved to the left onto the grassy median to avoid hitting the van,but ran over and fatally injured ranulfo.when investigating police officer danny lieux officer lieux or lieux arrived on the scene,he observed sargent swaying back and forth prompting lieux to ask sargent whether he had been drinking.
ranulfo wife,sonia bocanegra bocanegra filed this wrongful death and survival action on december,against appellees in the western district of louisiana prior to the case going to trial,appellees filed motions in limine seeking to exclude any evidence relating to sargent use of marijuana approximately eight hours before the accident,including the testimony of two of bocanegra experts,michael evans evans,a toxicologist,and steve irwin irwin,an accident reconstructionist.sargent had admitted during his deposition that he had taken five or six hits of marijuana around or on the evening of december,before reporting to work.the fatal accident occurred approximately eight hours later at on december.sargent further acknowledged during testimony that when he smoked marijuana on december,he got high.evans report stated that based upon reasonable scientific probability sargent marijuana use less than twelve hours before the accident impaired his perception and reaction time at the time of the accident.irwin report stated that any amount of reaction time sargent lost due to impairment from marijuana use is time that could have been used in evaluating his avoidance options and that t he loss of that time increased the likelihood and severity of the crash.
appellees motions in limine sought to exclude sargent testimony concerning his marijuana use,evans testimony regarding the effect of the marijuana on sargent driving ability,and irwin testimony concerning the cause of the accident.appellees argued that evans opinions concerning the effect of marijuana on sargent driving ability failed to satisfy the criteria for the admissibility of expert testimony set forth in daubert merrell dow,d.they also argued that the probative value of evidence of marijuana use was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under federal rule of evidence.
on august,the trial court conducted an extensive daubert hearing at which the trial judge exhaustively questioned evans and appellees toxicologist,joseph manno manno.irwin never testified because the trial court concluded that his testimony would rise or fall on that of evans.the hearing began in and did not end until.at the close of the hearing,the trial judge concluded that evans testimony failed to satisfy the daubert criteria,and that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.the trial court excluded sargent testimony of his marijuana use prior to the accident,evans testimony of the effect of sargent marijuana use on his driving ability,and irwin testimony concerning the cause of the accident.the case proceeded to trial with the jury returning a take nothing verdict upon which the trial court entered a final take nothing judgment in favor of appellees.on appeal,bocanegra argues that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of sargent marijuana use and its effect on his driving ability on the night of the accident.
standard of review 
the admissibility of expert testimony is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.moore ashland,cir.a trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.resolution trust bright,cir.if we find an abuse of discretion in admitting or excluding evidence,we next review the error under the harmless error doctrine,affirming the judgment,unless the ruling affected substantial rights of the complaining party.great plains,koch gathering,cir.
admissibility of expert testimony 
federal rule of evidence provides if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.this imposes a special obligation upon a trial judge to ensure that any and all scientific testimony is not only relevant,but reliable.kumho tire,carmichael,d quoting daubert,at,d.the expert testimony must be relevant,not simply in the sense that all testimony must be relevant,but also in the sense that the expert proposed opinion would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.daubert,at,d.put differently,rule requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.id.at,d.
as to reliability,the supreme court has provided five,factors to consider when assessing whether a methodology is scientifically reliable.these factors are whether the expert theory can be or has been tested,whether the theory has been subject to peer review and publication,the known or potential rate of error of a technique or theory when applied,the existence and maintenance of standards and controls,and the degree to which the technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific community.daubert,at,d.the test for determining reliability is flexible and can adapt to the particular circumstances underlying the testimony at issue.kumho tire,at,d.the party seeking to have the district court admit expert testimony must demonstrate that the expert findings and conclusions are reliable,but need not show that the expert findings and conclusions are correct.moore,at.thus,the question before the trial court was whether or not evans testimony regarding the effect of sargent marijuana use on his driving ability on the night of the accident was reliable and relevant under these standards to allow the testimony to go before the jury.
reliability of methodologies 
in her first issue,bocanegra argues that the trial court erred in excluding evans testimony because the scientific findings underlying evans conclusions,that residual impairment from marijuana use lasts for at least twelve hours after ingestion,have been and are widely accepted in the field of toxicology.
at the daubert hearing,evans cited extensive scientific literature showing that impairment of mental and cognitive functions from marijuana use continues to occur for at least twelve hours after the acute high has worn off.jerome yesavage et,effects of marijuana intoxication on aircraft pilot performance a preliminary report,american journal of psychiatry stephen heishman,et,acute and residual effects of marijuana profiles of plasma thc levels,physiological,subjective and performance measures,pharmacology,biochemistry and behavior.based on these studies and sargent admission that he smoked marijuana within twelve hours of the accident,evans concluded that sargent driving ability,and more specifically his perception and reaction time,was impaired at the time of the accident.
the yesavage study published in the american journal of psychiatry has been repeatedly relied upon by courts confronted with issues related to the residual effects of drug use.see,holloman greater cleveland regional transit authority,citing yesavage study conclusion that hours after marijuana use,pilots mean performance trends toward impairment on all variables tested,with significant impairment shown in the performance of certain tasks fowler new york city of sanitation,citing the yesavage study for the proposition that s erious skill impairment has been measured hours after smoking a single marijuana cigarette.amalgamated transit union cambria county transit authority,we find more persuasive the conclusion expressed in defendant deposition exhibit that exhibit reports that citing the yesavage study conclusion that hours after smoking marijuana pilots showed serious impairment on flight simulation tests.indeed,even appellees toxicologist,manno,testified that he considered the yesavage study to be a valid,study.manno also stated that,in his own clinical studies,he has recorded impairment from marijuana hours after it was smoked.
accordingly,the only possible basis for the trial court rationale in excluding the evidence of marijuana is the application of the methodologies utilized in the cited studies to the facts of this case.in other words,the trial judge must have concluded that evans extrapolation of the methodologies in the studies to this case lacked a valid scientific connection to the case before him.the trial court appears to have concluded that evans testimony did not pass muster under daubert for essentially two reasons.first,he noted that evans was unable to point to any causal connection between sargent marijuana use and the accident.second,the trial judge stated that since evans did not know the quantity or quality of the marijuana sargent ingested on december,evans could not opine that sargent was impaired.we now consider each of the trial court two stated reasons for excluding the evidence at issue.
causal connection between the marijuana and the accident 
the trial court concluded that before any evidence of sargent marijuana use could be presented to the jury there had to be some evidence of a causal connection between the marijuana use and the accident.it is noteworthy that evans never held himself out to be an expert on accident reconstruction,but only on toxicology,and more specifically the effects of marijuana use on perception and reaction time and driving ability.irwin,the accident reconstruction expert,who was not questioned by the court,had opined in his report that any impairment in perception reaction time increased the likelihood of the crash.nevertheless,the trial court relied upon two cases,gustavson gaynor,and donald triple s well service,so d to support its conclusion,both of which are distinguishable from the case at hand.neither gustavson or donald involved a challenge to expert testimony under daubert.rather,both cases concerned challenges to the admissibility of evidence when the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
in both gustavson and donald,the issue was whether evidence of prior consumption of alcohol may be admitted without evidence that the individual conduct was affected by the alcoholic beverage.gustavson,at donald,so d at.both courts held that without evidence of conduct such as driving at an excessive speed,recklessness or erratic driving,or drunken behavior at the accident scene,evidence of alcohol consumption is unduly prejudicial in view of its capacity to inflame the jury.gustavson,at donald,so d at.in neither gustavson nor donald,however,did an expert testify that the alcohol consumption in question had any effect on the individual cognitive functions.further,even if we were to apply the criteria espoused in gustavson and donald for the admission of evidence of drug use,bocanegara proffered the testimony of officer lieux that when he came upon the scene after the accident,his first impression of sargent was that sargent was swaying back and forth and that he was possibly intoxicated.when lieux asked sargent whether he had been drinking,sargent stated he had not.lieux did not detect the odor of alcohol on sargent.lieux did not ask sargent whether he had smoked marijuana.thus,lieux testimony and sargent admission that he got high on december provided compelling evidence that sargent behavior at the scene of the accident scene was consistent with his admitted marijuana use earlier that evening.in contrast,the gustavson court found that there was a complete absence of any supplementary evidence of the driver unfitness to drive id.at.
here,evans testified extensively that studies have demonstrated that marijuana use impairs cognitive functions,including those related to the operation of a motor vehicle,for at least twelve hours after the acute high wears off.based on his own testimony,sargent was within that twelve hour window when the accident occurred.because of evans knowledge and training in the field of toxicology,his testimony would have been helpful to the,not because it would have explained the connection between the marijuana and the accident,but because it explained the effect of recent ingestion of marijuana on an individual cognitive functions,including perception and reaction time,both critical factors in any accident we do not consider the fact that evans was unable to point to erratic driving or excessive speed as determinative of whether his testimony was helpful to the jury.nothing in the record shows that a driver must be driving erratically or at an excessive rate of speed to be impaired by marijuana.the critical issue in this case was whether sargent reaction time was affected by his ingestion of marijuana.evans testimony tends to show that it was.even defendants expert,manno,expressed reservations about an individual driving ability after ingesting marijuana.when asked whether he would get in a car as a passenger with a driver who told him that he had taken five or six hits off a joint eight hours before,manno replied,probably not.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the trial court erred in finding that evans failure to point to a causal connection between sargent marijuana use and the accident rendered his testimony unhelpful to the jury.we now turn to the trial court second reason for excluding evans testimony,that evans did not know the quantity or quality of the marijuana ingested by sargent,and could not therefore opine that he was impaired at the time of the accident.
the quality and quantity of marijuana ingested by sargent 
we start from the notion that in few,if any,cases involving driver use of marijuana will there ever be specific evidence of the quantity or quality of the marijuana ingested however,the trial court apparently relied upon some of the literature discussed at the daubert hearing which states that the effects of thc,the major psychoactive chemical in marijuana,on an individual may vary due to differing concentrations of thc in marijuana plants,the physiology of the individual and the quantity of the thc ingested.evans testified that these variables are mitigated because individuals who smoke marijuana,that is they smoke to get high and then they stop.evans further testified that he has gleaned this principle from his expertise in working with people who use marijuana.he also testified that the idea that marijuana users is a commonly held belief in the scientific community and that he was not aware of an instance where a person has smoked marijuana for a reason other than to get high.the record reflects that the trial judge considered evans reliance on to be an invalid assumption,a conclusion that does not permit evans to extrapolate the general findings of the cited studies to sargent experience on the night of the accident.
although the trial court concluded that evans improperly assumed that mar
