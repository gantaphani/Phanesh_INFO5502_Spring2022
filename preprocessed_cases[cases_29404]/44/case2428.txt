shannon balmer appeals the grant of summary judgment and the award of attorneys fees to health care indemnity,in this employment discrimination action under title vii,the equal pay act,and the tennessee human rights act.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and reverse the attorneys fees award.
health care indemnity,hci is an indirect,subsidiary of hca.hci provides insurance coverage and claims handling for hospitals affiliated or previously affiliated with hca.hci provides limited general liability and employment practices insurance coverage to beneficiary hospitals,but approximately percent of claims handled by hci relate to allegations of medical malpractice.
shannon balmer was hired by hci in april as a claims supervisor earning an annual salary of.balmer responsibilities included processing and monitoring claims from hospitals in various states not including tennessee.at the time balmer was hired,she had two and years of limited experience in the insurance industry as a medicare fraud investigator for cigna.her experience did not meet the requirement of three to seven years of claims experience stated in the advertisement for the position.frank halliburton,a male,was hired as a claims supervisor on the same day as balmer with an annual salary of.balmer was not aware of halliburton starting salary but did inquire into whether hca was willing to pay her more after a human resources representative informed her that was at the low end of the salary range for claims supervisors.she was told that her starting salary was not open for negotiation.balmer often complained about her salary.
in february,chris gentile,balmer supervisor,and larraine gerelick,gentile supervisor,positively reviewed balmer job performance,resulting in her salary being increased by six percent.balmer raise,as a percentage of salary,was higher than the raises given to other claims supervisors.in july or august,at gerelick suggestion,balmer received a star award,which was accompanied by gift certificates valued at.despite the raise and star award,balmer continued to complain about her pay.
soon after the february review,balmer learned the amount of halliburton salary.when balmer raised the difference between her salary and halliburton,she was told that halliburton was allowed to negotiate his salary because he had more insurance industry experience.halliburton had worked as a claims specialist for the tennessee school board association for eight months immediately preceding his employment with hci,and,prior to that,he worked for allstate for eleven years.according to gerelick,halliburton had substantial experience relevant to his duties as a claims supervisor at hci warranting his higher starting salary.halliburton responsibilities at allstate included reengineering investigation procedures,working with legal counsel,acting as company spokesperson at trials,depositions,and settlement conferences,and responsibility for managing and administering budgets.halliburton starting salary at hci,was a decrease from his salary at his previous job.balmer starting salary of was an increase from her salary at cigna.
in july,hci announced that six claims supervisors,four females and two males,were being promoted to the position of senior claims supervisor.balmer pursued one of the positions and alleges that but for her sex she would have gotten the promotion.later that month,balmer met with gerelick to discuss the pay disparity between balmer and halliburton.gerelick acknowledged the disparity but told balmer that halliburton had more years of experience in the insurance industry.gerelick also told balmer that,though balmer was doing a much better job than halliburton,budgetary constraints meant that the disparity could not be rectified until.
balmer told gentile that she planned to file a gender discrimination suit against hci in september.balmer claims,but the appellees deny,that gentile told balmer that he was aware that she had health problems and wondered if she could handle a battle at that time.he also allegedly told her that hci would come down hard on her or something similar and that it would be difficult for her to find another job in the same field because gerelick knew so many people in the industry.balmer claims that,following the encounter,gentile did not return her phone calls,failed to give her authority needed to settle cases,did not respond to her emails,and began keeping track of her time away from the office.
in october,while balmer was out of town and away from the office for three days,gentile viewed the contents of balmer mail.one of the items in the was an invoice from thompson miller,a louisville law firm that hci often hires to represent its insureds in medical malpractice actions in kentucky.the invoice reflected legal work about employment issues.gentile suspected that the legal work was related to balmer personal dispute with hci rather than to hci hospital claims she was supervising consequently,gentile contacted thompson miller to request information about balmer research request.in response to his request,gentile received legal memoranda addressing the precise issues presented by balmer in her lawsuit.
gentile also found an earlier thompson miller invoice dated september,related to employment law issues.balmer had approved the invoice and submitted it to hci to be paid as company business.gentile inquired into the thompson miller invoices upon balmer return to work.balmer claims that she had potential claims with equal pay act exposure and had been advised that an unasserted claim for equal pay act exposure existed in a pending case and that gentile had authorized the thompson miller research gentile discussed the situation with gerelick,who concluded that balmer had misused company funds.gerelick decided that balmer employment should be terminated but stated that she would not have terminated balmer if the legal research had been authorized by gentile.gerelick met with balmer on november,and offered her the choice between being terminated or resigning.balmer chose to resign.after resigning,balmer filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission.

balmer also appeals the award of attorneys fees to appellees.appellees filed a motion for attorneys fees as prevailing parties under title vii.hci moved initially for fees in excess of the trial court held that the claims of retaliation and wage discrimination were not frivolous,but that the class action allegations,the sexual harassment allegations and the failure to promote claims were frivolous,entitling the appellees to an award of fees.hci resubmitted its claim in accordance with the district court july,order.in the amended claim,hci asserted that it was entitled to in fees where the invoices referenced one or more of the allegations.all of these fees were incurred prior to the filing of balmer amended complaint.the appellees also sought,or five percent of the remaining fees,as attributable to the defense of frivolous claims,but which could not be specifically identified as related to such claims.balmer opposed the amount requested by the appellees.the district court awarded the full amount requested in the amended claim.

balmer asserted wage discrimination claims under the equal pay act,title vii,and the thra.the equal pay act prohibits wage discrimination by covered employers between employees on the basis of sex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort,and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.d.balmer has met the burden of establishing a prima facie case under the equal pay act because the employer paid different wages to an employee of the opposite sex for substantially equal work.timmer.dep t of commerce,cir citing corning glass works brennan,d.however,not all differences in pay for equal work constitute violations of the epa.id.

appellees rely on the fourth affirmative defense,a factor other than sex,to argue that the wage differential between balmer and halliburton was based on the two individuals relevant work experience,prior salary history,and requested salary.the equal pay act provision does not include literally any other factor,but a factor that,at a minimum,was adopted for a legitimate business reason.eeoc penney,cir citation omitted.a wage differential based on education or experience is a factor other than sex for purposes of the equal pay act.hutchins int l of teamsters,cir see also irby bittick,cir stating that e xperience is an acceptable factor other than sex if not used as a pretext for differentiation because of gender pouncy prudential ins,cir different job levels,different skill levels,previous training,and experience all may account for unequal salaries in an environment free of discrimination.harker utica,holding that nine years experience differential between women and men basketball coaches justified pay differential.consideration of a new employee prior salary is allowed as long as the employer does not rely solely on prior salary to justify a pay disparity.see irby,at if prior salary alone were a justification,the exception would swallow up the rule and inequality in pay among genders would be perpetuated.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
balmer asserts that the district court,while acknowledging that the burden of proof was on the appellees,impermissibly shifted the burden of production back to balmer to show that the asserted justification for the wage differential was pretextual.balmer also argues that hci did not establish experience as a factor other than sex because the related experience is absent and,even if halliburton had more experience,the defense should not be successful because hci uses experience as a factor on an ad hoc and inconsistent basis.according to balmer,hci must show not only that halliburton had more experience than balmer,but also the manner in which halliburton additional experience affected his performance.citing shultz wheaton glass,cir.balmer stretches this argument further,stating that t he best indication of the importance of halliburton experience is clearly shown in how poorly he performed following a year of performance.
we agree with the district court analysis 
defendants have presented substantial evidence that the difference in the starting salaries of plaintiff and halliburton was based upon a factor other than sex.defendants evidence shows that halliburton asked for a higher salary than plaintiff,had a higher salary history than plaintiff,and most importantly,the ultimate decision maker at hci determined that halliburton had greater relevant industry experience than plaintiff.the court finds that defendants have demonstrated that no genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the difference in pay of plaintiff and halliburton is due to a factor other than sex.see romeo cmty,at.defendants have therefore met their burden of proving an affirmative defense under the equal pay act by a preponderance of the evidence.
after finding that hci had met its burden of proving an affirmative defense,the district court correctly stated that u nder sixth circuit precedent,plaintiff now bears the burden of producing evidence creating a triable issue of fact that the reasons proffered by defendants are pretextual.citing buntin,at in an equal pay act case,the defendant always bears the burden of proving that its proffered reason is the true basis for the pay differential.the equal pay act plaintiff bears the burden of producing evidence of pretext solely where a reasonable jury viewing the defendant evidence could find only for the defendant.
we also agree with the district court assessment of balmer evidence of alleged differences in the pay of other male and female hci employees.
defendants,however,have shown that plaintiff contentions regarding other employees are flawed for a number of reasons she relies on an extremely small sample size she attempts to compare long time female employees to much more recently hired male employees and she fails to take into account the employees overall qualifications.in the end,plaintiff evidence simply shows that hci pays some men more than women and some women more than men depending on a variety of factors.from this evidence no reasonable jury could conclude that the difference between plaintiff and halliburton starting salaries was due to sex.
to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected activity that defendant knew of this exercise of her protected rights that defendant consequently took an employment action adverse to plaintiff and that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and adverse employment action.fenton hisan,cir citing eeoc avery dennison,cir.if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,the defendant may rebut the presumption of retaliation by asserting a legitimate,reason for its actions.morris oldham county fiscal court,cir.the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer proffered reason for the employment action is pretextual.id.the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence from which the
