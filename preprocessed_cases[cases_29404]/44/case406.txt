background 
ruiz,an employee of the municipality of humacao,puerto rico and a member of the popular democratic party pdp,has served as administrative director of the federal programs division of humacao since.although her appointment as administrative director was initially transitory,the position was made permanent by virtue of a ordinance 
in january,marcelo became the mayor of humacao and,as such,took responsibility for establishing the municipality public policy,organization,and personnel regulation.trujillo appointed luis as director of the municipality federal programs division that same year.like ruiz,both trujillo and camacho are members of the pdp.
ruiz alleges that after defendants assumption of power,they harassed and discriminated against her by,inter alia,stripping her of the job functions and duties,denying her access to a phone line,telling other employees not to speak with her,and acting aggressively towards her.these actions were allegedly spurred by ruiz political beliefs,specifically,her support for the previous mayor and administration,who were affiliated with the rival new progressive party npp.
on november,ruiz filed a complaint in the federal district court for the district of puerto rico,which she amended on february,to add first and fourteenth amendment claims under.defendants moved for summary judgment on september,arguing,inter alia,that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations defense,that ruiz had failed to establish a prima facie case,and that they had qualified immunity.
on april,the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion and dismissed ruiz claims,april.the court reviewed the record properly before it to find that the nature of ruiz tasks and her position close involvement with policymakers indicated that she was a policymaking trust employee,for whom party affiliation was an appropriate employment requirement.id.at.the court also found that ruiz fourteenth amendment claim faltered because as a trust employee,she had no cognizable property interest in her trust employment for a due process claim,id.at,and her equal protection claim merely restated her failed first amendment claim,id.at.having dismissed all causes of action,the court declined to address the qualified immunity defense.id.this appeal follows.
ii.analysis 
first amendment 
ruiz first argues that the district court erred in finding that she had occupied a political position,and thus lacked a colorable first amendment claim for political discrimination on the basis of party affiliation.we are not convinced.
summary judgment entries are reviewed de novo,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and granting all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see,torres dupont de nemours,cir.such judgments are upheld if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.summary judgments will also be upheld if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation,reynolds tobacco,cir.finally,our inquiry as to whether a government position is political,though fact intensive,presents a question of law requiring a de novo assessment of all relevant evidence,cir.
in political discrimination cases,plaintiffs must first establish that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the adverse employment action.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.defendants then carry the burden to establish either a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action,see id.at,or that plaintiff held a political position,for which party affiliation constitutes an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved,branti finkel,d.see,at.unlike career positions,political positions are terminable without cause when political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position.see,elrod burns,d galloza foy,cir.this rule ensures that representative government will not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration,policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.elrod,at.
in determining whether a position is political,we engage in a inquiry whether the governmental unit decides issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation,and whether the position responsibilities resemble those of a policymaker,a privy to confidential information,a communicator,or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.jiménez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir en banc see also galloza,at,cir.
in determining the second prong,we examine the position inherent attributes,for which the job description is the most useful starting point.galloza,at.job descriptions that are broad or open the employee latitude to exercise discretionary indicate a policymaking position,while job descriptions that are narrowly circumscribed inhibit freedom of action and generally indicate a position.id.the job title,however,is not necessarily dispositive in the inquiry,at.instead,we examine other indicia including relative pay,technical competence,power to control others,authority to speak in the name of policymakers,public perception,influence on programs,contact with elected officials,responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders and responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope.jiménez fuentes,at internal quotation marks omitted.
before delving into our inquiry,we note that appellant has submitted voluminous documents to this court that were never introduced,or were never properly introduced before the district court.our inquiry,therefore,is limited to the record properly before the court.see fed.a.
the resolution of the instant case revolves around the second prong described above,as the ofp office of federal programs unmistakably is a municipal department or agency whose overall functions involve decision making on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation,at internal quotation marks omitted.
our examination of the second which the job is the most useful starting that appellant responsibilities resemble those of a policymaker.her duties are broad and a ny matter for the mayor referred to her regarding the federal programs.docket document.moreover,ruiz remained in continuous contact with the mayor and the director regarding the progress of projects,attended meetings,seminars,housing and development hud orientation,and accomplished various tasks which demonstrate technical competence,power to control others,authority to speak in the name of policymakers,influence on programs,and contact with elected officials.jiménez fuentes,at.furthermore,ruiz relative pay,another factor we consider,see,is only less than the monthly salary of director camacho,whose position is indisputably a political trust position.we also note that when camacho left the director office on october,ruiz assumed the de facto position of director,assuming duties including the supervision of employees given ruiz responsibilities as well as her relationships with policymakers,we find that she occupied a political trust position,for which party affiliation is a requirement,see jiménez fuentes,at.
appellant nonetheless attempts to salvage her claim by arguing that the administrative director position was labeled as a career position by a m
