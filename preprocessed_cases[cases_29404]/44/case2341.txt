this police pursuit case deals with the shocks the conscience standard set forth in county of sacramento lewis,d,and its application to the police pursuit in this case.
appellant bridgette king officer king is employed as a police officer by appellant city of memphis,tennessee the city.appellee aundrey meals,individually and as wife and next friend of james harvey meals,deceased,and as natural parent,guardian and next friend of william meals,a minor child,filed a complaint against officer king and the city under alleging,inter alia,deprivation of the fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights of her family in causing their death or personal injuries as the result of a police pursuit for a traffic violation.the district court denied the city motion for summary judgment as to appellee claim for violation of the fourteenth amendment and her state law claim for negligence.the district court subsequently denied officer king motion for summary judgment both as to appellee claim for violation of the fourteenth amendment and also her claim of qualified immunity.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court denial of qualified immunity to officer king and denial of summary judgment to the city on the claim for violation of the fourteenth amendment.
procedural and factual background 
on january,james albert meals was driving his mercury grand marquis southbound on covington pike in the city of memphis with james harvey meals and william meals riding as passengers.
at approximately in the evening,officer king was running radar on road in memphis when she saw a oldsmobile cutlass,driven by john harris,pass her going in the opposite direction at a high rate of speed.officer king turned her blue lights on and turned her police vehicle around by executing a,then turned the blue lights off and began following harris audible siren or visual blue lights the intent of stopping him for speeding harris did not stop and increased his speed.officer king pursued him 
witnesses charlie mcwharter and tammy rarer were stopped at a gas station on the corner of and covington pike when they witnessed an older model oldsmobile cutlass traveling at high speed down.both witnesses saw a marked city of memphis police vehicle,driven by officer king,chasing the oldsmobile just prior to the cars reaching the intersection.
harris then turned from road north onto covington pike,a busy commercial street.neither officer king nor harris stopped at the intersection.instead,they both traveled through it at high speed.harris was traveling east in the westbound lanes of when he initially entered the opposing southbound lanes of traffic on covington pike before crossing the grass median into the correct lanes for northbound traffic.harris continued at high speed up covington pike.
james bradley ii was at the intersection of stage road and covington pike.he saw the police vehicle,driven by officer king,pass through the same green light cycle as the oldsmobile cutlass,driven by harris,and within seconds behind it.harris left the northbound lane,grazing another vehicle,and crossed into the southbound lanes striking nearly the vehicle in which james harvey meals and william meals were passengers.james harvey meals,james albert meals,and harris were killed in the collision.william meals suffered a fractured spine resulting in permanent paraplegia as a result of the incident.
the city had a restrictive written policy that specifically addressed police vehicle operation and pursuit policy.ja that policy prohibited vehicle pursuits when the officer knows that the suspect is wanted only for a traffic violation,a misdemeanor,or a felony the officer has failed to obtain supervisory approval within one minute of pursuit origination the pursuit has reached an unacceptable level,as defined in the policy and the officer fails to activate audible siren and visual blue lights signals upon initiation of a pursuit.ja 
regarding discontinuing the pursuit,the policy provided that officers involved in a pursuit must continually question whether the seriousness of the violation reasonably warrants continuation of the pursuit,and that a pursuit must be discontinued when there is a clear danger to the pursuing officers or the public.ja as an example,the policy called for discontinuance w hen the speeds dangerously exceed normal traffic flow or when pedestrians or vehicular traffic necessitates unsafe maneuvering of the vehicle.id.
appellee filed a complaint against the city,officer king,walter crews director of the city of memphis police department,and ford motor company in the circuit court of tennessee for the thirtieth judicial district at memphis,and the defendants then removed the case to the district court for the western district of tennessee at memphis based on federal question jurisdiction.
the district court dismissed all of the claims against officer king ja and subsequently held a hearing that included testimony by dennis appellee expert on police policy,practice,and procedure.ja the district court later granted in part the city motion to exclude waller testimony,finding 
that the expert may not testify as to the perceptions of harris himself or the effect of the alleged pursuit on harris state of mind.in particular,the court finds that the following opinion from waller must be excluded from testimony at trial 
the pursuit was conducted in a reckless manner that exacerbated the reckless behavior of harris.the continued pursuit of the harris vehicle by officer king was a significant causal factor in the increasingly reckless driving behavior of harris.
ja the order granting officer king motion to dismiss was subsequently withdrawn by the district court,the appellee claims against officer king were reinstated in light of new evidence proffered by appellee,and the case was reset for jury trial.
appellee filed an amended complaint,alleging that the police pursuit of harris and the subsequent motor vehicle collision violated the fourth and fourteenth amendment rights of james harvey meals and william meals.she alleged that officer king violated the fourteenth amendment guarantee of substantive due process by causing death or injury through deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a automobile chase.appellee also contended that the city is liable under tennessee law because officer king implementation or failure to adhere to the city police pursuit policy was negligent.according to the appellee,the city failure to properly train,supervise,and enforce the implementation of the policy was also negligent.
the city filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted in part as to the appellee claims regarding director crews in his official capacity and those claims under alleging violation of the fourth amendment the trial court denied the city motion as to appellee claim for violation of the fourteenth amendment.ja the district court stated 
plaintiffs assert that defendant city of memphis failed to appropriately train its officers with respect to high speed pursuits and that defendant city of memphis committed a constitutional violation through the execution of its pursuit policy.plaintiffs point to evidence in the record in support of this contention,including the expert report and testimony of plaintiffs expert dennis wall er.defendant city of memphis has introduced countervailing evidence,including the expert report of ken katsaris.as a result,there are disputed issues of material fact regarding plaintiffs constitutional claim against defendant city of memphis.
the district court also denied the city motion as to appellee claim for negligence under tennessee law.the trial court found the facts were controverted regarding whether it was reasonable for officer king to initiate and continue the pursuit of harris and whether her conduct was the proximate cause of the injuries.ja it also found that the city was not entitled to immunity from suit under the tennessee governmental tort liability act,ann.ja finally,the district court found that the city was not entitled to immunity for discretionary functions within the meaning of the tennessee governmental tort liability act,ann.as to the claims regarding the police pursuit policy.ja 
officer king subsequently filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.ja four unsworn statements ja,an accident report ja,and a set of police policies and procedures ja were attached to the memorandum in opposition.the district court granted officer king motion as to the appellee claims under for violation of the fourth amendment and the tennessee constitution,and for loss of consortium.the trial court also granted officer king motion as to the claim for negligence pursuant to tennessee law because the appellee had elected to pursue this claim against the city.ja the district court,however,denied officer king motion as to the appellee claim for violation of the fourteenth amendment and on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court found that 
plaintiff has pointed to sufficient evidence in the record which,if proven true at trial,would prove that defendant king violated memphis police department policies and procedures by initiating and continuing the chase in a way that shocked the conscience.
ja furthermore,the trial court stated 
the court finds that defendant king is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity for the same reasons that the court has denied defendant king motion for summary judgment as to the fourt eent h amendment claim.a showing that defendant king violated memphis police department policies and procedures by initiating and continuing the chase in a way that shocked the conscience,as alleged by plaintiffs,would evidence a violation of plaintiffs rights under the fourt eent h amendment.furthermore,the court finds that the right to be free from a police pursuit that shocks the conscience is clearly established and that a reasonable police officer would know that such action violates that right.
ja these interlocutory appeals followed.
interlocutory appellate jurisdiction 
we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the issues raised on this interlocutory appeal by officer king and the city.see frantz village of bradford,cir.appellee agrees with officer king and the city that this court has jurisdiction to decide officer king qualified immunity appeal.appellee submits,however,that this court does not have jurisdiction over the issue of the city liability for its failure to train.br.however,the city is not seeking review of the appellee failure to train claim.instead,the city is seeking review of whether officer king committed a constitutional violation.city reply br.at.
typically,bars our review of interlocutory appeals,but there is an exception where the district court has denied a claim of qualified immunity to government officials on summary judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.this exception,however,is a narrow one.in hearing a qualified immunity appeal,an appellate court must be careful to limit its consideration to only those issues over which it has jurisdiction.see berryman rieger,cir.a denial of a claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable only if the appeal is premised not on a factual dispute,but rather on neat abstract issues of law.johnson jones,d citations and quotation marks omitted see livermore lubelan,cir clarifying standard.accordingly,a defendant is required to limit her argument to questions of law premised on facts taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.in order for this court to exercise jurisdiction,the defendants appeals must be premised on evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and they must contend that,viewing the evidence in that light,it fails to demonstrate violation of a constitutional right.
where qualified immunity is denied due to a lingering question of whether the evidence supports a finding that particular offensive conduct occurred,we would lack appellate jurisdiction because the qualified immunity determination of whether a constitutional violation took place is inextricably linked to the merits of the underlying action.see behrens pelletier,d.therefore,on interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity,an appellate court may not consider factual disputes and is limited to addressing only legal issues that are completely separable from all other issues in the litigation.
a city is not entitled to claim qualified immunity,owen city of independence,d,and thus may not normally appeal the district court denial of summary judgment as to it.the supreme court has cautioned that there is no general appellate jurisdiction to consider issues related to claims that are capable of interlocutory appeal.see swint chambers county comm n,d.we may consider only such issues as are inextricably intertwined with the qualified immunity analysis.mattox city of forest park,cir.to the extent the issues raised in the city appeal are inextricably intertwined with the question of qualified immunity of officer king,and review of those issues is necessary for meaningful review of her claim of qualified immunity,we have pendent jurisdiction over them.should the appellee establish that officer king committed a constitutional violation,then she may also be able to establish liability as to the city.more importantly,if we conclude that officer king committed no constitutional violation,then the city is not liable under on appellee theory.therefore,we will exercise jurisdiction over the city appeal.
discussion 
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must present facts sufficient to show that the defendants,acting under color of state law,deprived him of a specific right or interest secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.see parratt taylor,d,overruled on other grounds by daniels williams,d.in the present case,there is no question but that the death of james harvey meals and the personal injuries suffered by william meals constitute an invasion of a constitutionally protected interest.tennessee garner,d fundamental interest in own life need not be elaborated on.there is also no dispute that officer king was acting under color of state law.rather,the question is whether,during the pursuit of harris,officer king violated any constitutional rights enjoyed by james harvey meals and william meals.
section is not itself a source of any substantive rights,but instead provides the means by which rights conferred elsewhere may be enforced.baker mccollan,d.our first task,therefore,is to identify the specific constitutional or statutory rights allegedly infringed.graham connor,d.in this case,the appellee has alleged a deprivation of the substantive due process rights of james harvey meals and william meals under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.we analyze the claim to determine whether,viewing the evidence most favorable to her,she has presented evidence of an actual violation.
officer king argues that it was error for the district court to consider the unauthenticated documents and unsworn statements attached to the appellee memorandum in opposition to her motion for summary judgment because they do not meet the requirements of.e.furthermore,officer king contends that the record evidences that there was no constitutional violation,and even if there were,there was no clear law upon which she could determine that the actions that she took were unlawful.as such,she contends that she was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.
appellee makes two arguments first,that the city pursuit policy and all witness statements were properly authenticated in the record for consideration by the district court,and,second,that the district court properly denied summary judgment to officer king on the issue of qualified immunity because she was not performing a discretionary function and violated substantive due process rights by her intentional misuse of a police vehicle in a pursuit for reasons other than legitimate purposes of law enforcement in violation of police regulations and state law.according to the appellee,here as in checki webb,cir,the trier of fact will have to determine whether officer king crossed the constitutional line that would make her pursuit actionable under.
