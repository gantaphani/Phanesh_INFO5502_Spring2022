the croix renaissance group,scrg sought leave under the class action fairness act cafa,c,to appeal an order of the district court of the virgin islands remanding a civil action to the superior court of the virgin islands.we granted scrg request.because we conclude that the civil action here is not a removable mass action under cafa,we will affirm the order of the district court.
in early,m ore than individual plaintiffs sued scrg in the superior court of the virgin islands.on february,scrg removed the civil action to the district court of the virgin islands.scrg,which was the only named defendant in the action,asserted that the civil action was a mass action under cafa,making it removable under d a and b thereafter,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint referred to for simplicity sake as the complaint most of the plaintiffs were citizens of the united states virgin islands.several plaintiffs,however,were citizens of various states.
scrg purchased a former alumina refinery on the south shore of croix in.the plaintiffs alleged that f or about thirty years,an alumina refinery located near thousands of homes on the south shore of the island of croix was owned operated by a number of entities.according to the complaint,the facility refined a red ore called bauxite into alumina,creating enormous mounds of the,bauxite residue,red mud,or red dust.
from the beginning of the alumina refinery operations,hazardous materials,including chlorine,fluoride,tds,aluminum,arsenic,molybdenum,selenium,as well as coal dust and other particulates were buried in the red mud,and the red mud was stored outdoors in open piles that at times were as high as approximately feet and covered up to acres of land.
in addition to these hazardous materials,friable asbestos was present.all of the substances described were dispersed by wind and disseminated as a result of erosion.
according to the plaintiffs,scrg purchased the refinery site knowing that the loose bauxite and piles of red mud had the propensity for particulate dispersion when exposed to wind that would be inhaled by p laintiffs,deposited onto p laintiffs persons,and real and personal properties,and deposited into the cisterns that are the primary source of potable water for many p laintiffs.yet scrg did nothing to abate it,and instead,allowed the series of the continuous transactions to occur like an ongoing chemical spill.scrg failed to take proper measures to control those emissions.with regard to the friable asbestos,the plaintiffs alleged that scrg discovered its presence,concealed its existence,and did nothing to remove it from the premises.the plaintiffs averred that the improper maintenance of the facility,inadequate storage and containment of the various hazardous substances,as well as failure to remediate the premises,caused them to sustain physical injuries,mental anguish,pain and suffering,medical expenses,damage to their property and possessions,loss of income and the capacity to earn income,and loss of the enjoyment of life.
the plaintiffs asserted six causes of action against scrg 
count i abnormally 
dangerous condition 
count ii public nuisance 
count iii private nuisance 
count iv intentional 
infliction of emotional distress 
count v negligent 
infliction of emotional distress 
count vi negligence 
in addition to money damages,the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to end the ongoing release of hazardous substances and to remediate the property.
in october of,the plaintiffs moved to remand their civil action to the superior court,claiming that the district court lacked federal jurisdiction.the plaintiffs asserted that the removal had been improper because d b ii i excluded their action from the definition of mass action.this section of cafa excludes from mass action s 
any civil action in which i all of the claims in the action arise from an event or occurrence in the state in which the action was filed,and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state or in states contiguous to that state 
d b ii i.from the plaintiffs perspective,their civil action satisfied the criteria for this exclusion because every operative incident occurred in croix and caused injury and damages to the p laintiffs persons and property in croix.each plaintiff claim arose from an event or occurrence in croix that happened at a single location,the alumina refinery.in addition,the plaintiffs argued that their civil action had been improvidently removed because it qualified as a uniquely local controversy excepted from removal under d a or b.
scrg opposed the motion to remand.it argued that the plaintiffs had interpreted the statute to exclude from mass actions claims that arise in one location instead of as a result of an event or occurrence as set forth in the statute.d b ii i.scrg asserted that the exclusion for an event or occurrence did not apply because it requires a single incident and the plaintiffs complaint alleged that there were multiple events and occurrences over many years.it emphasized that the exclusion requires that to avoid removal there had to have been just an event or occurrence a single event or occurrence.
on december,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion to remand this action to the superior court of the virgin islands.abraham croix renaissance,wl.the district court considered several district court decisions that addressed whether an action qualified as a mass action.it noted that the plaintiffs complaint alleged continuing environmental damage,and cited a statement from a senate report that the purpose of the event or occurrence exclusion was to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court.id.at quoting,at,reprinted in.the court reasoned that 
t he word event is not always confined to a discrete happening that occurs over a short time span such as a fire,explosion,hurricane or chemical spill.for example,one can speak of the civil war as a defining event in american history,even though it took place over a four year period and involved many battles.
id.the court then declared that 
an event,as used in cafa,encompasses a continuing tort which results in a regular or continuous release of toxic or hazardous chemicals,as allegedly is occurring here,and where there is no superseding occurrence or significant interruption that breaks the chain of causation.a very narrow interpretation of the word event as advocated by scrg would undermine the intent of congress to allow the state or territorial courts to adjudicate claims involving truly localized environmental torts with localized injuries.we see no reason to distinguish between a discrete happening,such as a chemical spill causing immediate environmental damage,and one of a continuing nature,such as is at issue here.the allegations in the amended complaint clearly fit within the meaning of an event as found in cafa.
the plaintiffs amended complaint does not qualify as a mass action under d b ii i because all the claims arise from an event or occurrence,that is,the continuous release of toxic substances from a single facility located in the virgin islands,where the resulting injuries are confined to the virgin islands.
under c,a party aggrieved by a district court ruling on a motion to remand may seek permission to appeal if the application is made not more than days after entry of the order.scrg filed a timely petition.we granted the petition on march.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under d a and b.we granted leave to appeal under.d a and c.
under cafa,b provides for the removal to federal district courts of class actions as defined in d.b.consistent with federal practice,once an action has been removed under cafa,the plaintiff may move to remand.id.c applying,which governs procedures after removal,to removal of class actions.under traditional federal practice,an order remanding a case to state court is not reviewable.d.cafa,however,diverges from traditional federal practice by providing for discretionary appellate review of an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed.c emphasis added.
plaintiffs contend that we lack appellate jurisdiction under.they assert that the provision in cafa which permits an appeal of a remand order applies to only class actions not mass actions.they point out that refers to class actions alone and does not use the term mass actions.see a specifying that for purposes of,the term class action shall have the meaning given such term under section d.according to plaintiffs,because their civil action does not meet the definition of a removable class action under d,we lack appellate jurisdiction.
plaintiffs argument fails to acknowledge a critical deemer provision in cafa.while makes only certain class actions removable and does not use the term mass action,d a states that f or purposes of this subsection d and section,a mass action shall be deemed to be a class action removable under paragraphs through if it otherwise meets the provisions of those paragraphs.d a.the plain text of this provision makes treatment of class actions equally applicable to mass actions.d a.see lowery.power,cir noting that the plain language of d a makes it clear that any mass action is also considered a class action for the purposes of cafa removal provisions.and nothing limits that deeming provision to subsection b,which permits removal.rather,applicability to mass actions includes subsection c,which establishes our discretionary appellate jurisdiction over remand orders.accordingly,we have appellate jurisdiction under c.
the issue in this case is one of statutory interpretation we must determine the meaning of the phrase an event or occurrence as it appears in the exclusion.the exclusion provides 
ii the term mass action shall not include any civil action in which i all of the claims in the action arise from an event or occurrence in the state in which the action was filed,and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state or in states contiguous to that state.
d b ii i emphasis added.as in all statutory construction cases,we begin with the language of the statute.the first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.barnhart sigmon coal,quoting robinson shell oil.when the meaning of statutory text is plain,our inquiry is at an end.roth norfalco,cir.
if the text is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations,it may be ambiguous.edwards cornell and son,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the supreme court instructed in at t mobility,concepcion,when a statute appears to be ambiguous,we must 
look to other portions of the act because s tatutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.of timbers of inwood forest.

scrg relies heavily on the article an,which precedes event or occurrence,and the singular nature of that article.in scrg view,this an before event or occurrence means that the exclusion is not applicable if the complaint alleges injuries that are not the result of a single,discrete incident.in scrg view,this means that the exclusion does not apply to the plaintiffs claims,which are based on a series of incidents resulting in their continued exposure to the hazardous substances.these incidents include the erosion of the red mud containing the various hazardous substances,the dispersion by wind of the same,and the improper storage of and the failure to remove all of these substances from the premises.
scrg argument is not completely devoid of merit.its contention that this statutory language refers to a single incident is semantically consistent with congress decision to use the singular form of the words event or occurrence in the exclusion.see dunn endoscopy ctr.of,cv,wl,at,noting that the statute did not state events and occurrences,and that the use of the singular in the statutory language is important and sufficient.
but scrg reliance on the article an does not end the inquiry.we must determine what the phrase event or occurrence means.in the absence of a statutory definition in the cafa,we are bound to give the words used their ordinary meaning.united states diallo,cir quoting moskal united states,omitting internal quotation marks and citation see also asgrow seed winterboer,when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.fdic meyer,in the absence of such a definition,we construe the statutory term in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.in common parlance,neither the term event nor occurrence is used solely to refer to a specific incident that can be definitively limited to an ascertainable period of minutes,hours,or days 
as the district court explained,the word event in our view is not always confined to a discrete happening that occurs over a short time span such as a fire,explosion,hurricane,or chemical spill.for example,one can speak of the civil war as a defining event in american history,even though it took place over a period and involved many battles.abraham,wl,at.the court construction of the word is consistent with the word common usage.important events in history are not always limited to discrete incidents that happened at a specific and precise moment in time.
as further support for this construction,we note that the plain text of the exclusion and the statutory scheme do not delimit the words event or occurrence to a specific incident with a fixed duration of time.because the words event and occurrence do not commonly or necessarily refer in every instance to what transpired at an isolated moment in time,there is no reason for us to conclude that congress intended to limit the phrase event or occurrence in d b ii i in this fashion.accordingly,where the record demonstrates circumstances that share some commonality and persist over a period of time,these can constitute an event or occurrence for purposes of the exclusion in d b ii i.
in short,treating a continuing set of circumstances collectively as an event or occurrence for purposes of the exclusion is consistent with the ordinary usage of these words,which do not necessarily have a temporal limitation.giving the words event or occurrence their ordinary meaning is not at odds with the purpose of the statutory scheme of cafa.congress clearly contemplated that some mass actions are better suited to adjudication by the state courts in which they originated.this intent is evident in both the event or occurrence exclusion for mass actions,as well as the and exceptions in d a and b for class actions.see kaufman allstate ins,cir referring to d a as the local controversy exception and subsection b as the exception.these provisions assure that aggregate actions with substantial ties to a particular state remain in the courts of that state.
the and exceptions for class actions in d and the event or occurrence exclusion for mass actions,however,are different creatures entirely.indeed,in light of the statutory structure of cafa,the exceptions and the exclusion have to be different because a mass action,to be removable,must meet the provisions of d through.d a.this means that to be removable a mass action must present something other than a uniquely local controversy that may not be removed under either the or exception in d a and b,respectively.if the mass action complaint pleads neither a nor a cause of action under subsection d,it may be removed unless the event or occurrence exclusion in subsection d b ii i applies.
it is notable that the exception contains broad language instructing a district court to declin
