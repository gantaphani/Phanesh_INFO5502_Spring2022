opinion of the court 
neurotron,neurotron is a maryland corporation which manufactures an electrodiagnostic medical testing device known as the neurometer cpt neurometer.highmark,highmark is a pennsylvania corporation engaged in the operation of nonprofit health care plans.neurotron alleges that a passage in highmark newsletter,policy review and news prn,commercially disparaged the neurometer.highmark successfully moved for summary judgment.neurotron appeals.we will affirm.
the neurometer tests a patient ability to perceive small electrical currents through a procedure known as current perception threshold testing cpt.cpt involves connecting electrodes to the surface of the patient skin and then delivering a series of electrical shocks and recording whether the shocks were perceived.through a series of shocks at decreasing voltages,the neurometer establishes the lowest level of current that the patient is able to feel.it then compares these readings to a database of normal readings and delivers a printout that states whether the patient sensory perception of electrical current is either elevated hyperesthesia,normal,or depressed hypoesthesia.hyperesthesia and hypoesthesia can be symptoms of numerous medical problems.neurotron contends that the neurometer is a useful diagnostic tool because it can detect these symptoms at a very early stage.
highmark provides nonprofit health insurance programs which cover the medical expenses of highmark members.among the services that highmark excludes from payment are services that are experimental or investigational.its agreement with its members and health care providers stipulates that highmark does not cover services which it determines are experimental or investigative in nature because those services are not accepted by the broad medical community as effective treatments.app.iii at.that agreement defines experimental or investigative as follows 
the use of any procedure which highmark,relying on the advice of the general medical community which includes but is not limited to medical consultants,medical journals governmental regulations,does not accept as standard medical treatment of the condition being treated,or any such items requiring federal or other governmental agency approval for which approval has not been granted at the time the services were rendered.
app.iii at.
highmark medical policy department mpd reviews developments in health care practice and procedure and makes determinations as to when a new product or procedure has advanced beyond the experimental or investigational stage and becomes an accepted part of standard medical practice.highmark benefits utilization management department bumd conducts audits of health care providers to assure that their billings to highmark have been in accordance with the applicable policies and regulations,that services are reported and paid accurately,and that unnecessary services are not being prescribed.
in october of,ralph cohen,neurotron president,wrote to highmark requesting that the neurometer be reviewed and evaluated for coverage.highmark referred the request to the mpd which,pursuant to highmark policy,initiated a consultant review.three independent neurologists,brennan,jeffries,and lossing,evaluated the neurometer and cpt.based upon the consultant review,highmark concluded that cpt was investigational in nature and was,therefore,an uncovered service.
in october of,jefferson katims,neurotron director of research,wrote to highmark to request again that the neurometer be reviewed and evaluated for coverage.joseph ricci,highmark vice president for medical affairs,responded in november of that highmark opinion remained unchanged and that,consequently,cpt would remain noncovered.
in,katims again wrote to ricci to request reevaluation of cpt.ricci referred the request to the mpd for review by douglas worley.worley solicited advice from lossing,samuels,and silverman.based upon the advice of these independent consultants,highmark concluded that cpt continued to be investigational.highmark added cpt to medical policy bulletin which listed numerous products and procedures which were not covered because they had been determined to be investigational.
in,emelie sconing,manager of the bumd,conducted a claims review of certain chiropractors who appeared to be inappropriately billing noncovered cpt as covered nerve conduction velocity tests.she sent the claims files of the providers under investigation to consultants for review.the consultants,tarola and samuels,concluded that the providers under investigation had actually performed cpt and not nerve conduction velocity tests.tarola opined that cpt is a nonspecific electrodiagnostic procedure that lacks proof of validity and reliability,and has limited clinical utility.app.iii at.he concluded that the cpt performed on the above referenced patients were medically unnecessary because of apparent indiscriminate use of the procedure and its lack of validity,reliability,and clinical utility.id.at.samuels opined that a cpt test is experimental and of no proven clinical value.it is not a nerve conduction test.all of these claims should be denied.id.at.
having concluded that health care providers were submitting claims for covered nerve conduction velocity tests when in fact they were performing noncovered cpt,sconing asked the mpd to prepare a notice for publication in highmark newsletter,prn,that cpt tests were not permissibly billed as nerve conduction velocity tests.highmark uses the prn to communicate medical policies and other information to its participating health care providers.
worley drafted the requested notice by adopting the language of samuels comments assessing cpt testing.the notice appeared in the february,edition of the prn and read,in its entirety,as follows 
current perception threshold test 
the current perception threshold test is performed to provide an objective measure of subjective sensation.it requires the patient conscious perception of the stimulation applied.the current perception threshold test has no proven clinical utility and is not eligible for payment,since it is considered to be investigational.
use procedure code to report this service.
the district court found that although the passage did not refer specifically to neurotron or the neurometer,there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to find that the passage could be understood as referring to the neurometer.the district court also found that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the prn article was false.summary judgment was granted,however,for three reasons,each of which precluded a recovery for neurotron the prn statement that cpt had no proven clinical utility was not disparaging highmark was conditionally privileged to publish the prn,and highmark had not abused its privilege and the record would not support a finding that defendants either knew their statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its falsity 
we agree with the district court that while the summary judgment record may perhaps reflect a material dispute of fact as to whether the challenged statement was the result of negligence on the part of highmark,it will not support a finding that this statement was believed by highmark to be false or made by it with reckless indifference as to its truth or falsity.we also agree with the district court that neurotron,as a matter of law,can not recover in the absence of such a finding.
a.the challenged statement 
we begin our analysis by focusing on the challenged statement.its purpose was to communicate to participating health care providers that payments for cpt would not be reimbursed by highmark.understandably,the statement also communicated highmark explanation for its no coverage position in highmark opinion,cpt was investigational in the sense that its clinical value had not been proven.while this explanation does not directly state to whom the clinical value of cpt has not been proven,the only reasonable inference to be drawn is the medical community.as highmark stresses,its explanation can not reasonably be understood as an affirmative assertion that cpt had been established to be without value in the practice of medicine.
b.the governing law 
we agree with the parties that pennsylvania law governs the liability issues in this diversity action.accordingly,we are required to predict the law that would be applied by the supreme court of pennsylvania to the facts of this case.see gruber,cir.
the supreme court of pennsylvania has not decided a trade libel or injurious falsehood case in over years.so far as we have been able to determine,it has never expressed a view on the dispositive issue the absence of a reasonable basis for a disparaging statement will alone support a recovery in a case of this kind.
when we find ourselves without guidance from the highest court of the state whose law applies,we look to the decisional law of the state intermediate appellate courts,to the decisions of other federal courts interpreting that state law,and to decisions from other jurisdictions discussing the relevant issue.boyanowski capital area intermediate unit,cir.in particular,a n intermediate appellate state court decision is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.id.quoting from west american.
the superior court,an intermediate appellate court of pennsylvania,recently discussed the pennsylvania law governing trade libel or injurious falsehood claims in pro golf manufacturing,tribune review newspaper company.the specific issue involved there was whether the claim alleged was a defamation claim governed by a statute of limitations or a libel claim governed by a statute.after noting that the latter tort was variously referred to as trade libel,commercial disparagement,and injurious falsehood,the court looked to of the restatement second of torts and described the tort as follows 
regardless of the label,the publication of a disparaging statement concerning the business of another is actionable where the statement is false the publisher either intends the publication to cause pecuniary loss or reasonably should recognize that publication will result in pecuniary loss pecuniary loss does in fact result and the publisher either knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.restatement second of torts a.
pro golf,at.
like the superior court in pro golf,federal district courts sitting in pennsylvania have predicted that the supreme court of pennsylvania would look to the restatement second of torts to determine the parameters of the tort of injurious falsehood.see swift swift sons,eagle eye,ambler fashion shop,zerpol dmp.
we have been referred to nothing which suggests to us that the pennsylvania supreme court would take any other approach to defining the tort of injurious falsehood than that followed by pro golf.moreover,even if we did not have the benefit of pro golf,we would reach the same conclusion based on the respect the pennsylvania supreme court has consistently accorded the restatement second of torts even in situations in which pennsylvania common law precedents varied from the restatement rule.see gilbert korvette,in recent years,this court has not hesitated to adopt sections of the restatement second of torts when our precedents varied from the restatement or when the pennsylvania common law provided no answer.walker grand central sanitation,we are convinced,and therefore hold,that section of the restatement second of torts accurately states the law of pennsylvania with regard to damages in cases of slander per se this is consistent with our supreme court tendency to adopt the second restatement of torts in defamation matters.agriss roadway express,noting pennsylvania general tendency to follow the restatement rule in defamation law.medico time,cir pennsylvania follows the restatement second of torts on most matters we believe it appropriate to accept as the law of pennsylvania the version of the fair report privilege embodied in the current restatement.
based on the foregoing,we predict that the supreme court of pennsylvania would apply sections and of the restatement second of torts,to this case.those sections provide 
liability for publication of injurious principle 
one who publishes a false statement harmful to the interests of another is subject to liability for pecuniary loss resulting to the other if 
a he intends for publication of the statement to result in harm to interests of the other having a pecuniary value,or either recognizes or should recognize that it is likely to do so,and 
b he knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.
disparagement of libel 
the rules on liability for the publication of an injurious falsehood stated in apply to the publication of matter disparaging the quality of another land,chattels or intangible things,that the publisher should recognize as likely to result in pecuniary loss to the other through the conduct of a third person in respect to the other interests in the property.
before turning to the task of applying these principles to the record in this case,we note that the general principle set forth in s of the restatement second of torts is subject to the following two caveats 
the institute takes no position on the questions of 
whether,instead of showing the publisher knowledge or reckless disregard of the falsity of the statement,as indicated in clause b,the other may recover by showing that the publisher had either 
a a motive of ill will toward him,or 
b an intent to interfere in an unprivileged manner with his interests or 
whether either of these alternate bases,if not alone sufficient,would be made sufficient by being combined with a showing of negligence regarding the truth or falsity of the statement.
the commentary to explains that these caveats are necessary because of recent jurisprudence of the united states supreme court tailoring the common law of defamation to the demands of the first amendment and because of uncertainty concerning the extent to which this jurisprudence may also apply to injurious falsehood.in this context,comment d to describes the state of the preexisting common law as follows 
in addition to the basis for liability set out in clause b,the common law recognized two others as alternatives.at common law,the publisher of an injurious falsehood was also held subject to liability,if he was motivated by ill will toward the other malice,in the factual sense,or if he intended to interfere with the interests of the other in an unprivileged manner intent to harm.knowledge or reckless disregard as to falsity has not been a requirement for these other two bases of liability at common law.
these caveats are not applicable here.nothing in the record suggests that highmark was motivated by ill will towards neurotron or that its purpose was to harm neurotron business in an unprivileged manner.there is no evidence that would support an inference that highmark purpose was anything other than to communicate its position on cpt to its participating health care providers,a purpose that is clearly a privileged one.
the discussion of these caveats in the restatement commentary is helpful here,however,because it goes on to document that in the absence of actual ill will towards the plaintiff or an intent to injure for an unprivileged purpose,negligence regarding the falsity of the disparaging statement was not a sufficient basis for imposing liability at common law.see restatement second of torts cmt.d in an action for injurious falsehood,negligence regarding falsity has not been a sufficient basis at common law to impose liability.
in concluding that the supreme court of pennsylvania would look to the restatement second of torts for the law governing this case,we have not been unmindful of that court decision in menefee columbia broadcasting system.menefee,the plaintiff,alleged that he had been a successful radio personality.his employer terminated his employment and allegedly told the press that he was incompetent in the performance of his assigned broadcast duties.menefee died after filing suit.under pennsyl
