background 
in his deposition john gave the following account of the incident.in may,he and judy were driving through the village of johnsville on their way to the home of judy son.judy was driving john was in the passenger seat.at an intersection,john saw a local police officer,defendant insogna,in a police car using a radar device,of which john became aware because he had a radar detector.john expressed his displeasure at what the officer was doing by reaching his right arm outside the passenger side window and extending his middle finger over the car roof.the plaintiffs,who were not speeding or committing any other traffic violation,continued to the home of judy son.upon reaching their destination on monroe street,the plaintiffs got out of the car and saw a police car with its lights flashing approaching from the corner of the street they were on,ultimately stopping behind judy car.when john walked to the trunk of the car,insogna ordered him and judy to get back in the car.john initially refused,telling insogna that he had not been driving the car.insogna again told john to get back in the car,stating that this was a traffic stop.judy then urged john to reenter the car,and they both did so.
insogna then asked to see judy license and registration.john then told her not to show the officer anything,prompting insogna to say,shut your mouth,your ass is in enough trouble.insogna then collected judy license and registration,returned to his police car to check the documents,and called for backup.three other officers soon appeared.
insogna returned to judy car,gave her back the documents,and told the plaintiffs they could go.john then got out of the car and asked if he could speak to insogna,saying i like to speak to you man to man.as he started walking toward insogna,who was more than feet away,three other officers stepped in front of him.john stopped,walked away from the officers,and said to himself in a voice apparently too low for his words to be understood,i feel like an ass.one of the other officers asked john what he had said,and john repeated his remark loud enough to be heard.at that point defendant collins said,that does it,you under arrest,but did not say for what.
john was then handcuffed,placed in a police car,and driven to the police station,where he was given an appearance ticket and released.at the station,he was told he had been arrested for disorderly conduct.insogna subsequently swore out a complaint,which he filed in the local criminal court,charging swartz with violation of new york disorderly conduct statute.under new york law,such a complaint s erves as a basis for the commencement of a criminal action.proc.law.after he returned home,john retained an attorney.the charge remained pending for several years,during which john made three court appearances.the charge was ultimately dismissed on speedy trial grounds.
the officers gave a different account.in his deposition,insogna said that after he saw john give him the finger,he decided to follow the car to initiate a stop on it.as reasons he stated john gesture appeared to me he was trying to get my attention for some reason,i thought that maybe there could be a problem in the car.i just wanted to assure the safety of the passengers,and i was concerned for the female driver,if there was a domestic dispute.
insogna said he followed the car and attempted to have it stop,but it continued to monroe street and did not stop until he drove up behind it.at that point john got out of the car,ran at insogna,and called him various vulgar names.after john and judy got back into their car,insogna obtained and checked judy license and registration,and then called for backup for my safety.other officers arrived.one of them,officer cuddy,approached john in the car and identified himself after john asked who he was.john started yelling and described insogna to cuddy with some of the vulgar terms he had previously used.after insogna told john and judy they were free to go,john got out of the car and told insogna he wanted to talk to him man to man.insogna told him that would not be a good idea,at which point john walked away shouting that he,john,felt like an asshole.at that point,insogna arrested john.
collins in his deposition essentially confirmed insogna account of the episode preceding the arrest.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs suit.the district court,accepting insogna third reason for the automobile stop,ruled that the stop was legal because swartz odd and aggressive behavior directed at a police officer created a reasonable suspicion that swartz was either engaged in or about to be engaged in criminal activity,such as violence against the driver of the vehicle.the court next ruled that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claim because an objectively reasonable officer could have believed that there was probable cause for a disorderly conduct arrest.finally,the court ruled that the fact that john had to make three court appearances did not amount to a seizure,a necessary component of a malicious prosecution claim.

ii.substantive analysis 
the motor vehicle stop.initially we note that there is a question whether a motor vehicle stop occurred.on a view of the facts favorable to the plaintiffs,appropriate for assessing the defendants motion for summary judgment,judy stopped the car voluntarily upon arriving at her son home.moments later a police car pulled up behind her car.on the plaintiffs view of the evidence,the police did not stop the car.they contend they got out of the car after the car had stopped and were then told by insogna to get back into the car,which they did.the instruction to reenter the car might be considered a component of a motor vehicle stop because in a typical automobile stop occupants would be told to remain in their car.but even if an automobile stop did not occur although we note that insogna insists that he did cause judy car to stop,the instruction to reenter the car was a sufficient interference with liberty to constitute a fourth amendment seizure.see terry ohio,d w henever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away,he has seized that person.whren united states,d temporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police,even if only for a bri
