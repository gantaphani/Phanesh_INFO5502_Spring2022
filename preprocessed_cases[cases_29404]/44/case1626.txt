carl edward kirby appeals a district court order granting summary judgment against him in his action against the city of elizabeth city,north carolina city city police chief trevor hampton and city police lieutenant frank koch collectively,appellees in which kirby asserts that he was retaliated against based on the content of his truthful testimony at a public hearing and based on his subsequent challenges to that alleged retaliation.we affirm the district court order,although partly on grounds different from those relied on by the district court.
kirby is employed by the city as a police officer.on july,kirby testified at a hearing before a city personnel appeals committee concerning a grievance filed by fellow city police officer james henning.the grievance challenged discipline imposed against henning for damaging a patrol vehicle car by driving it with too little transmission fluid.at the hearing,kirby recounted the maintenance history and transmission fluid capacity of car,provided his opinion of henning maintenance and driving habits,and explained how transmission leaks are diagnosed.kirby maintains that hampton and koch were angered by his testimony,which they perceived to undercut hampton position and support henning.
following his testimony,kirby left the police station at about to begin a previously scheduled vacation.when kirby returned to work,he learned that he had received an oral reprimand for f ailure to support the department administration.kirby claims that he was reprimanded because his hearing testimony conflicted with hampton.however,appellees insist that the reprimand was based not on the substance of kirby testimony but on kirby failure to follow proper procedures before testifying.specifically,appellees assert that an employee scheduled to be on duty when he will be testifying is required to provide advance notice to the city human resources department so that another officer may be assigned to cover the employee duties.kirby denies that he had any duty to notify human resources.on this basis,he filed a grievance challenging the punishment he also initiated the present action on august,alleging that the reprimand was in retaliation for his testimony.
on september,kirby received notice that hampton had demoted him from sergeant to police officer iii.appellees claim that the demotion was because of kirby poor job performance and that an audit of cases assigned to kirby investigative bureau over the first six months of showed that in of the cases,the investigation did not comply with applicable policies and procedures.in particular,several case files did not contain supplements updating progress in the investigations even though such supplements were required to be completed weekly.kirby contends that the supplement policy had not previously been enforced and that supplements in some of the identified cases were not required by the policy or could not be completed.kirby thus amended his complaint in the present action on september,to add claims related to his demotion.
as amended,kirby complaint alleges that appellees retaliation based on his testimony violated his constitutional rights to free expression and association,as well as his right to freedom from the imposition of unconstitutional conditions on his public employment the complaint further asserts that the retaliation violated his fourteenth amendment liberty interest in testifying truthfully and denied him equal protection under the law.it also alleges that the reprimand violated kirby equal protection rights because it constituted disparate treatment with no rational basis.finally,the complaint alleges that kirby demotion in retaliation for his filing the grievance and initial complaint violated his freedom to petition for redress of grievances.
after hearing kirby grievance of his demotion,the city personnel appeals committee pac concluded that kirby had indeed violated department policy,but it recommended that kirby sanction be reduced.specifically,the pac recommended that kirby retain his rank of sergeant for a probationary term and that his hourly salary be set at per rate lower than his pay prior to the demotion but higher than he had received since.following his review of the pac findings and recommendations,the city manager accepted the finding that kirby had violated departmental policy but decided that kirby would remain at the lower rank of police officer iii for a probationary period at the rate of pay that the pac recommended kirby was reinstated to his former sergeant position at the expiration of the probationary period.he nevertheless maintains that appellees have continued their retaliation against him by assigning him to perform secretarial duties such as handling telephone inquiries.
appellees moved for summary judgment,and kirby filed a for partial summary judgment.the district court granted appellees motion and denied kirby.regarding kirby freedom of expression claim,the court ruled that testimony in a public hearing is not constitutionally protected unless the testimony relates to a matter of public concern.the court ruled that the speech at issue here was not protected because it concerned only one particular employee in a matter that was not of general concern to the public.the court ruled that kirby claims alleging violation of his freedom to associate and asserting the imposition of unconstitutional conditions on his public employment also failed because the claims alleged retaliation for matters not of public concern.the district court also rejected kirby fourteenth amendment liberty claim on the ground that it was simply a rewording of his freedom of expression claim and that any residual liberty protection given to free speech under the fourteenth amendment could not exceed the protection that the first amendment affords.
the district court divided kirby equal protection claims into two claims alleging that he was treated differently in retaliation for his testimony and his claim that there was no rational basis for the treatment he received.the court disposed of the first group on the basis that generic retaliation does not constitute an equal protection violation.and,the rational basis claim was disposed of on the ground that kirby failed to forecast evidence negating the existence of any facts from which a conceivable rational basis justifying the treatment he received could be derived.
finally,the district court ruled that kirby petition claim failed because his grievance and lawsuit did not involve matters of public concern and thus were not constitutionally protected.
kirby first contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his freedom of expression claim.specifically,he maintains that his testimony was on a matter of public concern because it was given in a public hearing,and it concerned matters of the type that would interest the general public.we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment against kirby on this claim.
it is well settled that citizens do not relinquish all of their first amendment rights by virtue of accepting public employment.see united states treasury employees union,d connick myers,d pickering bd.of,d.nevertheless,the government,as an employer,clearly possesses greater authority to restrict the speech of its employees than it has as sovereign to restrict the speech of the citizenry.see urofsky gilmore,cir en banc.a determination of whether a restriction imposed on a public employee speech violates the first amendment requires a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.connick,at.alteration in original quoting pickering,at.this balancing begins with an inquiry into whether the speech at issue was that of a private citizen speaking on a matter of public concern.see mansoor trank,cir.if so,the court must next consider whether the employee interest in his first amendment expression outweighs the employer interest in what it has determined to be the appropriate operation of the workplace.see urofsky,at.
to determine whether speech involves a matter of public concern,we examine the content,form,and context of the speech at issue in light of the entire record.see connick,at.speech involves a matter of public concern when it involves an issue of social,political,or other interest to a community.see id.at.the inquiry centers on whether the public or the community is likely to be truly concerned with or interested in the particular expression.arvinger mayor of baltimore,cir internal quotation marks omitted.whether speech addresses a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court,and thus we review the matter de novo.see urofsky,at.
we now turn to kirby arguments.kirby first the fact that his testimony was given in a public hearing makes it a matter of public at odds with our opinion in arvinger.there we determined that a police officer did not address a matter of public concern when he stated during a coworker employment hearing that he did not know whether marijuana found in his van belonged to the coworker.see arvinger,at.in so doing,we held that it was irrelevant for first amendment purposes that the statement was made in the course of an official hearing because the statement was made not to further any public debate,but only to further the interests of the two officers involved.id.at.
kirby argues that arvinger is distinguishable from the present case because in arvinger the testimony was not truthful.however,nothing in our decision indicates that the outcome depended on the alleged falsity of the testimony.kirby also argues that even if his position is at odds with arvinger,that decision is not controlling because it conflicts with judge ervin separate opinion in whalen roanoke county bd.of supervisors,cir,which this court subsequently adopted,see whalen roanoke county bd.of supervisors,cir en banc per curiam.in fact,arvinger and the en banc whalen decision are completely consistent because nothing in judge ervin opinion states that testimony in a public hearing necessarily relates to a matter of public concern.in whalen,the panel concluded that the plaintiff testimony at a public hearing concerned a matter of public interest,see whalen,at,and judge ervin accepted this conclusion in his dissent,see id.at ervin,concurring in part dissenting in part.however,nothing in judge ervin opinion or the panel majority opinion indicates that the existence of the hearing,rather than the subject matter of the statement,was what made the statement there a matter of public concern.
kirby second his speech involved a matter of public concern because it was on a topic of interest to the as well.kirby speech concerned the narrow question of whether officer henning negligently failed to monitor the transmission fluid in car,thereby damaging the vehicle.kirby did testify that a faulty transmission in car had once prevented an officer from responding to a call and that car had experienced other mechanical problems,but the relative unreliability of a single police vehicle simply is not of sufficient significance to attract the public interest.arvinger,at holding that police officer did not address a matter of public concern when he stated that he did not know whether marijuana found in his van belonged to a coworker.and kirby clearly was not interested in furthering any public debate about the reliability of car.we therefore agree with the district court that kirby statements did not address a matter of public concern 
kirby next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on his equal protection claims.we disagree.
the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause provides that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.the claims based on the allegation that kirby was treated differently in retaliation for his speech are,at their core,retaliation claims that do not implicate the equal protection clause.edwards,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as for the claims based not on appellees actual motivation for their alleged disparate treatment of kirby,but rather on the allegation that there was no rational basis for any difference in treatment,they fail as well.to establish such a claim,it is not sufficient for a plaintiff simply to show that the defendants actual motive for their disparate treatment was irrational rather he must negate any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.bd.of trustees garrett,d internal quotation marks omitted village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam noting that claim of no rational basis is distinct from claim based on defendant subjective motivation.kirby does not challenge the determination of the district court that he can not meet that standard.instead,he argues that the no conceivable rational basis standard does not apply and that it is appellees actual for kirby matters.but we have already explained that kirby equal protection claims fail to the extent that they are based on the allegation that he was retaliated against because of his testimony 
kirby finally maintains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on his freedom to petition claim,which is based on his allegation that his demotion constituted retaliation for his formal challenges to the reprimand.kirby contends that the district court erred in ruling that a public employee petition must address a matter of public concern in order to be constitutionally protected.he alternatively maintains that his petitions did involve a matter of public concern.we reject the first argument but agree with the second.
the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.const.amend.i.the supreme court has recognized that this right is cut from the same cloth as the other guarantees of that amendment,and is an assurance of a particular freedom of expression.mcdonald smith,d.in rejecting the assertion that the petition clause provides absolute immunity for allegedly libelous statements included in letters to the president,the court stated 
the petition clause was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak,publish,and assemble.these first amendment rights are inseparable,and there is no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made in a petition than other first amendment expressions.
id.at.citations omitted.we confirmed this principle in thorne bailey,cir,recognizing that the petition clause does not enjoy a preferred place among first amendment freedoms.thorne,at internal quotation marks omitted.
it would violate the principles articulated in mcdonald and thorne to extend constitutional protection of public employees petitions for redress beyond the protections afforded to public employee speech.in fact,it would allow the anomalous result that a private employment dispute could be constitutionalized merely by filing a legal action.altman hurst,cir per curiam.we therefore join the majority of circuits to have addressed the question in holding that a public employee petition,like his speech,is constitutionally protected only when it addresses a matter of public concern.see jones union county,cir martin city of del city,cir grigley city of atlanta,cir rendish city of tacoma,cir white plains towing patterson,cir hoffmann mayor of liberty,cir belk town of minocqua,cir day park indep.sch,cir.but see san filippo bongiovanni,cir holding that a grievance or lawsuit by a public employee that constitutes a petition is constitutionally protected even if it does not raise a matter of public concern.
in light of our holding,we turn to the question of whether kirby grievance and his original complaint alleging that he was orally reprimanded because of his truthful a matter of public concern.we note initially that this case presents the uncommon allegation of is,retaliation for challenging an earlier alleged retaliatory act.in light of the close and somewhat confusing relationship between the retaliation claims of different levels,it is important
