amended opinion 
this case arises out of a seizure and confiscation of foreign property allegedly in violation of new york state and international law.the plaintiffs,raphael bigio,bahia bigio,ferial salma bigio and bigio collectively,the bigios seek damages from the defendants,the company and the export corporation collectively,for their conduct in connection with the nationalization of the bigios property by the egyptian government in the early.the plaintiffs complaint invokes jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act,and diversity of citizenship under.the defendants moved for an order dismissing the complaint on several grounds,including lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the united states district court for the southern district of new york john martin,judge granted the defendants motion,concluding that the plaintiffs had not satisfied the prerequisites for jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act,and that the act of state doctrine barred the court exercise of jurisdiction despite the parties diversity of citizenship.see bigio,civ.jsm,wl,dist.lexis june.
addressing jurisdictional questions first,we hold that the district court does have jurisdiction over this action.we agree with the district court that jurisdiction does not lie under the alien tort claims act,but hold that the court has jurisdiction by reason of the diversity of citizenship of the parties under.we assume that the local action doctrine is jurisdictional,but conclude that it does not prevent the district court from exercising jurisdiction in this case.
two types of abstention,the act of state doctrine and principles of international comity,could be applicable to this case nonetheless and,if so,may counsel against the district court exercise of jurisdiction.we hold,contrary to the conclusion of the district court,that the act of state doctrine does not apply.because the district court relied in part on the act of state doctrine in dismissing this action,it did not decide whether principles of international comity permit the case to be heard.we remand for the court to make that determination.
finally,we decline to address in the first instance the remaining issues argued by the parties on appeal,including whether this case should have been dismissed for failure of the plaintiff to join two indispensable parties,failure timely to file,failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,or failure to produce adequate evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.we leave it to the district court to decide those issues if necessary.
background 
plaintiffs raphael bigio and ferial salma bigio are brother and sister,and plaintiff bahia bigio is their mother.all three are citizens and residents of canada.plaintiff bigio is owned by the bigio family and organized under the laws of egypt.defendants the company and the export company are incorporated in the state of delaware.the export company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
the property that is the subject of this action consists of land and factories located in heliopolis,egypt.the first factory on the heliopolis land,which was then owned by the bigio family,was built by the bigios in.between and the egyptian government confiscation of the bigios property in the,did business with the bigios,buying various goods from their factory.during the and,was a tenant on the bigios land.in,only a few years before the bigios property was seized,entered into a written licensing agreement with the bigios permitting them to manufacture bottle caps for sale to and its authorized bottlers.
according to the complaint in this action,the bigios property was seized by the egyptian government in.the bigios contend that the egyptian government,then led by president gamal,sequestered and nationalized their property because they were jewish.the defendants have not disputed this contention on appeal.deprived of their property,the bigio family left egypt in 
the complaint alleges that in or after,either purchased or leased the plaintiffs property with full knowledge of the unlawful manner in which it had been seized from the plaintiffs.this assertion forms the sole basis for the plaintiffs claims against.
material submitted by the plaintiffs to the district court provides additional background for an understanding of the plaintiffs claims.according to this material,once the plaintiffs property was seized by the egyptian government,ownership of the property was transferred to the misr insurance company misr,a company wholly owned by the egyptian government.misr in turn leased the property to the bottling company enbc,another company wholly owned by the egyptian government,which operated the manufacturing plants.
in,while enbc was leasing the bigios former property from misr,president nasser died.in,the egyptian government apparently issued an edict revoking the contracts of sale that had effected the transfer of the bigios property to misr in,purportedly pursuant to this edict,the egyptian ministry of finance issued decision number,which ordered misr to return the bigios property,along with any rental burden and active occupants,or to forward to the bigios the proceeds of any sale of the property that might have occurred.on february,the ministry of finance sent a letter to misr urging it to follow the instructions contained in decision number.that letter states 
t he real estate properties owned by the bigios and which were sold through sequestration must now be physically returned to the bigios unless the company has already disposed of the assets through sale to a third party in the private sector.in such a case,the amount representing the price of sale must be reimbursed to the bigios 
misr did not honor these instructions.
in,the egyptian government offered enbc for sale.as of,enbc consisted of thirteen bottling plants and a number of distribution and warehousing facilities throughout egypt.one of the bottling plants was located on the bigios former property.
submitted a bid to purchase the shares of enbc through its wholly owned subsidiary atlantic industries.a rival bid was submitted by mac investments mac,an egyptian company unrelated to.mac previously had been in the business of bottling products in competition with in the middle east.the egyptian government accepted mac bid.
though mac won the bidding,it and atlantic industries thereafter reached an agreement to purchase the shares of enbc jointly.made with the knowledge and consent of the egyptian government,the agreement was memorialized in a share sale and purchase agreement effective april.pursuant to that agreement,mac,together with a company named mac beverages,purchased of enbc shares.atlantic industries,together with another subsidiary,the soft drink services company,purchased the remaining of enbc shares.the share sale and purchase agreement provided that following the acquisition,of enbc total shares would be resold to the egyptian public and of enbc total shares would be resold to enbc employee shareholders association.these transfers were made entirely from the shares owned by atlantic industries and soft drink services company,leaving the latter without any ownership interest in enbc and atlantic industries with what is now just of the shares of enbc.
although the bigios have brought legal action against misr in egypt for,inter alia,its alleged failure to heed the egyptian government instruction to return to them the property or its price of sale,they have not yet obtained resolution of their claims and misr has not honored the instructions of the ministry of finance.the bigios were also unsuccessful in their legal attempts to halt the privatization of enbc.
neither the defendants nor any of their subsidiaries have been named as parties in any of the egyptian actions,but raphael bigio did contact prior to the privatization in order to inform it of the bigios claims regarding the heliopolis property.he advised by letter dated february,the purpose of having started the litigation in egypt is not in fact to prevent the sale of enbc but to insure that the ultimate owners of these assets and factories,the bigios receive a just and fair compensation share in this acquisition.investigation prior to the acquisition led it to conclude that enbc had no liability to the bigios,and accordingly it executed the agreement to purchase stock in enbc as planned.
the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on april,seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the defendants allegedly improper conduct in converting plaintiffs assets and joining in a violation of universally accepted norms of human rights.their complaint alleged that engaged in wrongdoing by acquiring the assets of enbc,knowing that plaintiffs had been deprived of their rights to the property solely because of their religious faith.the complaint asserted that the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over their claims pursuant to the alien tort claims act,and the diversity of citizenship statute.
on august,the defendants moved for an order dismissing the complaint under.b,b and b,or awarding the defendants summary judgment pursuant to.the defendants argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act,that diversity jurisdiction was barred by the local action doctrine,and that the district court should in any event abstain from hearing the case pursuant to principles of international comity as well as the act of state,local action and forum non conveniens doctrines.they also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,failed to join two indispensable parties,the arab republic of egypt and misr,and failed to file suit within the time required by the statute of limitations.the defendants filed with their motion a sworn declaration by an egyptian lawyer,ahmed abou ali,contradicting the allegations contained in the complaint.the defendants suggested in their brief in support of the motion that the district court should treat the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as a motion for summary judgment to the extent that the court relied on the ali declaration.
the plaintiffs responded by filing a for partial summary judgment pursuant to.a and d on the issue of liability.the plaintiffs also opposed the defendants motion and supported their own with an affidavit by plaintiff raphael bigio and fifteen supporting exhibits.
the district court john martin,judge granted the defendants motion and denied the plaintiffs on the grounds that subject matter jurisdiction is not provided for by the alien tort claims act,and is otherwise barred by the act of state doctrine.see bigio,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.with respect to the alien tort claims act,the district court held that the wrong allegedly committed by was an ordinary tort and not a violation of international law and the complaint did not allege that the defendants acted under color of law or in concert with the egyptian government when that government committed its violation of international law,if any,in the,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
as for the act of state doctrine,the district court concluded that the doctrine applied in this case because i n order to decide the case for plaintiffs,the court would have to hold invalid the domestic acts of the egyptian and nationalization of plaintiffs property pursuant to the decrees of,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court acknowledged the plaintiffs argument that the act of state doctrine should not apply because the egyptian government had repudiated its confiscation of the plaintiffs property by way of the letter from the ministry of finance to misr dated february.the district court concluded,however i t is not clear what kind of legal effects this letter has under egyptian law and plaintiffs have not provided any evidence regarding the legal effect of the letter.clearly,this is a matter that should be decided by the courts of egypt,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court did not address any of the defendants other arguments in favor of dismissal or summary judgment.it dismissed the complaint solely because it lacked jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act and the act of state doctrine.
this appeal followed.the defendants have renewed each of the arguments they presented to the district court except for that based on forum non conveniens principles.
discussion 
jurisdictional issues 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see,shipping fin.servs.drakos,cir.although we agree with the district court that subject matter jurisdiction does not lie under the alien tort claims act,we reject the defendants contention that under the local action doctrine,the district court does not have diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.
alien tort claims act 
the alien tort claims act,provides the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the plaintiffs argue that i f the egyptian government seized the plaintiffs property as part of a national program of religious persecution,the seizure violated the law of nations and therefore conferred federal jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act.the argument is misdirected.it does not matter for purposes of determining whether there is jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act whether the egyptian government violated international law because there is no allegation that was involved in the taking of the bigios property or complicit in the government alleged violation of international law.
the complaint alleges that sometime after,purchased or leased the plaintiffs property from enbc with full knowledge that enbc had acquired the property through unlawful confiscation on the basis of religion.the complaint contains no other allegation of wrongful conduct by.we confine our discussion to the allegations in the complaint because if the complaint did not plead a violation of the law of nations by,the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act,and neither it nor we may consider the matter further under the act.see kadic karadzic,cir,cert.denied,d t he alien tort act requires that plaintiffs plead a violation of the law of nations at the jurisdictional threshold quoting filartiga,cir distinguishing alien tort claims act,with its jurisdictional pleading requirement,from general federal question jurisdiction,which is not defeated by the possibility that the averments in the complaint may fail to state a cause of action citing bell hood.
the first issue we must address is whether can have violated the law of nations if it acted solely as a entity.
this court held in kadic that certain forms of conduct by private individuals may violate the law of nations even where the individual in question does not act under color of law.see kadic,at.we took note of the restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states,which identifies those violations that are actionable when committed by a state and a more limited category of violations of universal concern id.at.and there are a handful of crimes to which the law of nations attributes individual responsibility.id.quoting libyan arab republic,edwards,concurring,cert.denied,d.the relevant portion of the restatement provides 
a state has jurisdiction to define and prescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by the community of nations as of universal concern,such as piracy,slave trade,attacks on or hijacking of aircraft,genocide,war crimes,and perhaps certain acts of terrorism,even where no other basis of jurisdiction is present.
restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states.we held in kadic that war crimes and acts of genocide are actionable under the alien tort claims act without regard to state action,but that torture and summary not perpetrated in the course of genocide or war proscribed by international law only when committed by state officials or under color of law.at.
the complaint sole allegation against is that it acquired or leased property that previously had been expropriated on the basis of the owners religion.however reprehensible,neither racial or religious discrimination in general nor the discriminatory expropriation of property in particular is listed as an act of universal concern in or is sufficiently similar to the listed acts for us to treat them as though they were incorporated into by analogy.instead,these forms of conduct are included only in and of the restatement,which describe conduct that violates international law when undertaken by a state actor,which as explained below was not.see restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states cmts.j m racial and religious discrimination,discriminatory taking of property.
if a plaintiff does not allege conduct that supports private liability under international law,he or she must plead that the conduct was committed by state officials or under color of law in order for the court to exercise jurisdiction under the alien tort claims act.kadic,at.the question therefore is whether was a state actor for these purposes.in kadic we observed 
the color of law jurisprudence of is a relevant guide to whether a defendant has engaged in official action for purposes of jurisdiction under the alien tort act.a private individual acts under color of law within the meaning of section when he acts together with state officials or with significant state aid.
id.at citation omitted.the complaint does not allege that acted together with state officials.neither was charged with committing a violation of the law of nations with significant state aid.there is no allegation in the complaint that ability to purchase the property in question was enhanced by the transfer of the property from the bigios to other words,that its ability to purchase the property,or the price it paid,depended on the fact that the egyptian government had expropriated the bigios property.a private party does not act under color of law simply by purchasing property from the government.
on appeal,the plaintiffs have attempted to expand their allegations against by articulating claims not included in the complaint.
the plaintiffs allege,first,that may have been a participant or in the egyptian government actions in the.the plaintiffs argue that precise role in the seizure by the egyptian government can not be known prior to discovery.there is no allegation in the complaint,let alone any hint of evidence,however,that had any role as a participant or in the confiscation of the bigios property.
the plaintiffs allege,second,that may be held liable for any economic benefit it derived before from the seizure of the plaintiffs property.the plaintiffs submit 
if the plaintiffs are permitted to engage in discovery of records and to depose its officers and employees,they may establish that benefitted from the sequestration and nationalization of its landlord property.how did business and profits compare before the bigio property was seized and after the seizure did the expropriation of the bigios property provide any economic benefit to 
the causal chain between the egyptian government seizure and benefit is not articulated.an indirect economic benefit from unlawful state action is not sufficient to support jurisdiction over a private party under the alien tort claims act.ginsburg healey car truck leasing,cir section which,we have noted,is analogous to the alien tort claims act for these purposes does not impose civil liability on persons who merely stand to benefit from an assertion of authority under color of law,but only on those who act under color of law.thus,even if this allegation were included in the complaint,the alien tort claims act would not provide for jurisdiction over this claim.
the plaintiffs allege,third,that failed to prevent the egyptian government from seizing the bigios property in the.yet the plaintiffs do not explain why was under a legal obligation to intervene or how it possibly could have done so,and they point to no legal authority for the proposition that a private party may be liable under the alien tort claims act or,which is comparable for these purposes,for its failure to stop unlawful state action.again,even if included in the complaint,this claim would not fall within the scope of the alien tort claims act.
we conclude that the plaintiffs complaint failed to plead a violation of the law of nations by.the district court therefore did not have subject matter jurisdiction over their claim under.
diversity jurisdiction 
although the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for torts covered by the alien tort claims act,it did possess subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs other claims pursuant to.section grants the federal district courts original jurisdiction over all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,between citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.a.because the plaintiffs in this action are citizens of canada and the defendants are delaware corporations,see c,jurisdiction over this action is proper pursuant to the plain terms of a 
local action doctrine 
the defendants urged the district court to dismiss this case under the local action doctrine for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,irrespective of the parties diversity of citizenship and any of the other issues pertaining to this lawsuit.under the local action doctrine,courts may not exercise jurisdiction over any local action involving real property unless the property at issue is found within the territorial boundaries of the state where the court is sitting.see ellenwood marietta chair.hayes gulf oil,cir.the district court did not rule on the defendants request to dismiss on the basis of this principle.the defendants,describing the local action doctrine as ancient but still vibrant,urge us to conclude that the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction because of it.appellees brief at quoting ramirez de arellano weinberger,scalia,dissenting,vacated,d.
the local action doctrine is a relic of english common law imported into this country by justice marshall while riding circuit in livingston jefferson,fed.cas,and was last discussed by this court in,see pasos pan american airways,cir applying the doctrine with much doubt.it has been taken to require that a suit,with federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship,to recover damages for a defendant alleged trespass upon,and unlawful use and occupation of,land in a foreign country not be maintained in any jurisdiction except that in which the land was located,at.
the only two grounds for suit explicitly identified in the complaint were conversion and a violation of the law of nations cognizable in federal court pursuant to the alien tort claims act.
conversion is not an action for damages to real property.see garelick carmel,dep t boll town of kinderhook,jur d conversion.it is therefore not subject to the local action doctrine.the taking of property without just compensation because of the plaintiffs religious faith that is alleged by the bigios is no more limited by the local action doctrine than is any other action which,though touching upon land,is brought on the basis of a legal theory other than trespass.such actions may be heard in a jurisdiction other than that in which the property is located.see massie watts,cranch.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.thus,the only two causes of action explicitly identified in the complaint need not be brought in egypt pursuant to the local action doctrine.
and the bigios did not so much as mention the word trespass in their complaint.a claim for money damages based on trespass emerges from the complaint only upon application of the liberal rules governing notice pleading under the federal rules of civil procedure.see generally simonton runyon,cir g enerally a complaint that gives full notice of the circumstances giving rise to the plaintiff claim for relief need not also correctly plead the legal theory or theories supporting the claim.quoting marbury,kohn,cir.
not only is the claim of trespass against not explicit in the complaint,but any such claim would logically follow from and depend on the claim at the heart of the bigios complaint,the allegedly unlawful taking and refusal to return their property and refusal to compensate them for the taking of the property,all because of their religion.we decline to declare the plaintiffs entire suit local in character,and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the district court,where the plaintiffs non local claims are predominant and the local claim is at most only implicit in the complaint.see raphael musicus,safeway stores,cir refusing to dismiss entire action as local where request for damages for trespass was joined with requests for damages based on breach of contract and fraud,and decision on trespass issue depended entirely on resolution of parties respective contractual rights.
we therefore hold that the district court has jurisdiction over this case under.
ii.abstention issues 
even when a district court has jurisdiction over a case,it may choose not to exercise that jurisdiction if principles of abstention are applicable.in this case,the district court diversity jurisdiction may be subject to the application of the act of state doctrine and principles of comity.we conclude that contrary to the view of the district court,the act of state doctrine does not apply,and remand for the district court application of the principles of international comity.
act of state doctrine 
notwithstanding the diverse citizenship of the parties,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this litigation because of the dictates of the act of state doctrine.see bigio,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the united states supreme court classic statement of this principle is more than years old.
every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state,and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory.redress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves.
underhill hernandez.see also banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d the act of state doctrine in its traditional formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory.
in reviewing the district court treatment of this issue,we note first that contrary to the conclusion of the court,the act of state doctrine is not jurisdictional.allied bank int l banco credito agricola de cartago,cir jurisdictional or not,however,the district court held that in this case its application was required and that as a result the district court could not exercise its diversity jurisdiction.
although the standard of review of a district court decision to abstain is often described as an standard,we have noted that in the abstention area that standard of review is somewhat more rigorous.because we are considering an exception to a court normal duty to adjudicate a controversy properly before it,the district court discretion must be exercised within the narrow and specific limits prescribed by the particular abstention doctrine involved thus,there is little or no discretion to abstain in a case which does not meet traditional abstention requirements.
hachamovitch debuono,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted ellipses in original.applying this standard of review,we reverse the district court on this point 
the act of state doctrine,much the concern of scholars,see,sabbatino,at,has not been explored extensively by the modern supreme court.there is,however,a substantial gloss on the doctrine that has been developed by our court in light of the supreme court teaching that i its proper application requires a balancing of interests,see kirkpatrick environmental tectonics,d sabbatino,at.see also braka bancomer,cir,and ii the act of state doctrine should not be invoked if the policies underlying the doctrine do not justify its application,see kirkpatrick,at.sabbatino,at.braka,at.
we begin with the proposition that the function of the court in applying the act of state doctrine is to weigh in balance the foreign policy interests that favor or disfavor its application.republic of the philippines marcos,cir.we have noted that 
the policy concerns underlying the doctrine require that the political branches be preeminent in the realm of foreign relations.accordingly,the supreme court has directed that each case be analyzed individually to determine the need for a separation of powers the less important the implications of an issue are for our foreign relations,the weaker the justification for exclusivity in the political branches.
braka,at quoting sabbatino,at.other citations omitted.additionally we have said that t he doctrine demands a analysis of the extent to which in the context of a particular dispute separation of powers concerns are implicated,always tempered by common sense.allied bank int l,at.
t he applicability of the doctrine depends on the likely impact on international relations that would result from judicial consideration of the foreign sovereign act.if adjudication would embarrass or hinder the executive in the realm of foreign relations,the court should refrain from inquiring into the validity of the foreign state act.
id.at citing,inter alia,sabbatino,at.footnote omitted.
we conclude that the resolution of this case by united states courts will not likely impact on international relations or embarrass or hinder the executive in the realm of foreign relations.
in sabbatino,the court remarked that t he balance of relevant considerations may be shifted if the government which perpetrated the challenged act of state is no longer in existence.at.accord kirkpatrick,at.dictum.plaintiffs assert that t he nasser government,which effected the expropriation,is no longer in existence.appellants br.at.defendants respond that t he heads of state may have changed,but the government has remained the same.appellees br.at.
we can not resolve the question thus posed,at least not on the record before us.but there is little doubt that the egyptian government that is now in power is far removed in time and circumstance from that which seized the bigios property.the expropriation took place or more years ago president nasser has been dead for thirty years.
the rationale for considering a change in government is that the danger of interference with the executive conduct of foreign policy is surely much less than the typical case where the act of state is that of the current foreign government.marcos,at.applying that rationale to this case,whether the present government is characterized as the same as or different from the one responsible for the expropriation,the danger of interference with the executive branch conduct of foreign policy by a court adjudication here is dim indeed.
moreover,the current government,as we have noted,has apparently repudiated the acts in question and has sought to have the property or its proceeds returned to the bigios.any finding of impropriety with respect to egyptian expropriation of property in the early would more likely be consonant,than at odds,with the present position of the egyptian government.see dominicus americana bohio gulf western,a n act that would otherwise be immune from judicial inquiry may lose its privileged status if the government repudiates it.there are no seeds for embarrass ment or hind rance of the executive in the realm of foreign relations that we can perceive.allied bank int l,at.
the district court did not consider the fact that the nasser regime is long gone,and it discounted the letter of the egyptian ministry of finance directing misr to return the heliopolis property to the bigios because it found that plaintiffs have not provided any evidence regarding the legal effect of the letter.there is little ambiguity on the face of the ministry of finance letter it appears to reflect a determination that the property in question rightfully belongs to the bigios and not misr.as pointed out in the affidavit of ahmed abou ali,an egyptian lawyer,which the defendants submitted to the district court,the ministry of finance letter states in clear terms,
