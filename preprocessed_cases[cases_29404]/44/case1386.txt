opinion announcing the judgment of the court 
this appeal presents the uncommon scenario of a civil suit in a state court by a federal employee against five of his fellow employees,all of whom were employed by the united states department of justice,bureau of prisons bop.the plaintiff,brian brumfield,filed his complaint in state court alleging that he and all five individual defendants were employed by bop at the allenwood federal correctional facility fci allenwood.the complaint alleged state tort law claims of conspiracy,prima facie or intentional tort,abuse of process and defamation against all five defendants.brumfield claims are predicated on written affidavits and oral statements given by the defendants in a investigation by the bop office of internal affairs oia with respect to brumfield unprofessional conduct.
as a result of the investigation,the warden disciplined brumfield,who appealed the warden action to the merit systems protection board mspb.the appeal was resolved by agreement.brumfield then sued the individual defendants in the court of common pleas,union county,pennsylvania.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania pursuant to a,which allows officers of united states agencies to remove civil actions against them to a federal district court.thereafter,the united states moved under the westfall act to substitute itself for the individual defendants,asserting that the individual defendants were,at all relevant times,acting within the scope of their employment.the district court dismissed the complaint on the recommendation and report of the magistrate judge.brumfield timely appealed.we affirm,although on the primary issue on appeal we do so on grounds different than those of the district court 
on appeal,the appellant makes three arguments.first,he argues that the district court erred in denying brumfield request for discovery on the scope of employment issue.second,he contends that the district court wrongly determined that the individual defendants challenged actions occurred within the scope of their employment.finally,he maintains that the district court erred in predicting that the pennsylvania supreme court would not recognize a cause of action for prima facie or intentional tort.
the threshold question in this appeal pertains to whether the plaintiff claim of tortious conduct occurred within the scope of the individual defendants employment.brumfield acknowledges that a federal employee is absolutely immune from common law claims of tortious conduct occurring within the scope of his or her employment.the westfall act,also known as the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act,provides federal employees acting within the scope of their employment absolute immunity from damage liability on state law tort claims.see melo hafer,cir.under the westfall act,the attorney general of the united states may certify,as was done in this case,that the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment,and request that the united states be substituted as the only defendant see d.however,the plaintiff correctly argues that certification by the attorney general is only prima facie evidence that the alleged injurious conduct occurred within the scope of the federal employee duties.see schrob catterson,cir d.brumfield,therefore,requested of the district court that he be permitted reasonable discovery from the individual defendants.the district court,however,denied this request and decided without discovery and without a hearing on the question that the defendants were acting within the scope of their employment.
in denying discovery,the district court noted that brumfield had already engaged in extensive discovery relating to the scope of employment of the individual defendants in the mspb proceeding and that he should not be permitted to duplicate those efforts in the present proceeding.in permitting the government to substitute the united states as sole defendant,the district court found that this argument had considerable merit in light of the absence of any response by the plaintiff.we believe that the district court rationale in the earlier stage of the proceedings logically applies with equal force to the plaintiff efforts to secure discovery at this stage.
moreover,the attorney general certification appears to have been based on the plaintiff complaint.the certification states,in relevant part 
i have read the complaint and upon the basis of the information now available to me with respect to the incidents referred to therein,i am of the opinion that the individual defendants were acting within the scope of their employment pursuant to an official government investigation at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.
brumfield sanders,d.in a later affidavit,the attorney general reiterated that her conclusion that the individual defendants were acting within the scope of their employment was based on the allegations in brumfield complaint the district court opined 
permitting additional discovery when the attorney general certification is not based on a different understanding of the facts than is reflected in brumfield complaint would undermine the intent of the westfall act to protect federal employees from responding to state law tort claims.
brumfield nowhere contends that the attorney general misunderstood the allegations in the complaint.our standard of review of questions concerning the scope or opportunity for discovery is for abuse of discretion.see country floors gepner ford,cir.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to permit additional discovery.
the district court discovery ruling does not end the matter,however,because brumfield argues that the district court erred as a matter of law when it held that the individual defendants acted within the scope of their employment during the oia investigation.it is undisputed that whether they did or not is a matter of pennsylvania state law.pennsylvania has accepted the restatement second of agency definition of conduct within the scope of employment.see butler vending,aliota graham,cir.according to the restatement,conduct is within the scope of employment if,but only if a it is the kind the employee is employed to perform b it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits and c it is actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master restatement second agency.
brumfield does not dispute that factors a and b are met in this case,but he contends that,because the defendants accusations were motivated by personal animosity toward him,they were not intended to serve the master.this argument,however,does not comport with pennsylvania agency law.this court has previously held that under pennsylvania law,the mere existence of a personal motivation is insufficient to relieve the employer from liability where the conduct also benefitted him and was within the scope of employment generally.eisenberg gagnon,cir citing yaindl,not followed on other grounds restatement second of agency.here,the statements and affidavits of the individual defendants were given at the behest of oia officials to assist them in their official investigation.personal animosity,if any existed,was subsumed by the benefit that inured to employees generally at the allenwood institution.if the oia investigation revealed unprofessional conduct by brumfield,the district court noted that appropriate discipline could be meted out and unprofessional conduct by a supervisor halted.brumfield,d at.
brumfield also contends that the course of employment does not include commission of unlawful acts or acts contrary to orders,policies,procedures and standards of the bop brumfield maintains that the individual defendants lied during the course of an official investigation and lied on false affidavits.thus,he argues that their actions were outside the scope of employment and therefore not protected by the westfall act.this argument too was properly rejected by the district court.the pennsylvania superior court has specifically held that the liability of the employer may extend even t
