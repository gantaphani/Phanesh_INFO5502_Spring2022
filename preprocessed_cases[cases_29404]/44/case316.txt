routine police assistance to a disabled motorist whose car posed a traffic hazard on a busy road was transmogrified into a civil rights action under.the plaintiff alleged,inter alia,that the officer violated her fourth amendment rights when he instructed her to move her car or it would be towed,she did so,and she was injured.she also alleged a violation of her fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights on a danger theory.a jury found an undefined violation of the plaintiff civil rights.it attempted to award damages of,however,and when told by the judge that such an award was inconsistent with a finding of liability,awarded only.because the jury awarded,the court awarded plaintiff attorneys fees.on the basis that plaintiff had prevailed on only one of her five claims,the court reduced the requested amount by approximately,to.
each side has appealed various rulings.we cut to the chase.it is clear on this record that plaintiff,even on her best evidence,does not state a viable claim on either a fourth amendment or a substantive due process theory.no properly instructed jury could have found a violation of constitutional rights on the evidence.the trial court thus erred in not granting defendant daniel sauro rule b motion.we vacate the judgment against sauro and the award of attorney fees to plaintiff,and direct entry of judgment for defendant.
because our resolution of the case turns on our review of the district court denial of sauro rule b motion,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to.webber int l paper,cir.
the facts are these.before on february,left her home in framingham to go to waltham.snow was on the ground,although the roads themselves were clear,and the day was cold.was driving a cadillac relatively large car.traveling eastbound along route,noticed that her car had lost power,so she coasted along until she found a place to stop at the side of the road.there was an upward incline in the road at the place where stopped.testified that t o the best of her recollection,she was generally successful in getting all of her car out of the eastbound travel lane 
the place where stopped was in natick,mere feet past the border with the neighboring town of wayland.a curve in route as it approaches this location from the west limits visibility.
after bringing her car to a stop,concluded that it was not safe for her to remain in her car because she could be hit by an eastbound car.using a passing driver telephone,called aaa for assistance.aaa said that they would arrive shortly,and that her call had priority because of the location where she had broken down.shortly thereafter,another passing motorist observed car and thought that was slumped over the steering wheel of her car the motorist called the police to report as much.
sauro,a wayland police officer,responded within five or ten minutes.told sauro that she had called aaa for a tow,and that they had put a priority on her request.
testified that sauro then walked around the car and told her to move the car or it would be towed.she responded that she was unable to move the car because it had no power.according to,sauro response was no,it does have any power,but just put it in neutral and push it back,steering with the steering wheel.
got into the car to shift it into neutral,then got back out of the car and turned the steering wheel as much as she could.facing the rear of the vehicle,she then pushed the car,with the driver door open,by the frame between the front and rear doors.while doing so,she kept one hand on the steering wheel to try to direct the car.the car rolled slowly back and partway into a driveway with a downward slope.it then came to rest on its own.
testified that sauro,who was then using the radio in his car some distance down the road,yelled at her,that not where i told you to put it.asked sauro where she should put the car,and he responded only with a vague gesture while he continued to talk on the radio.understood the gesture to mean that she should move her car closer to sauro,so she once again began pushing the car.testified that she was inside the car while she pushed it,although she also stated that she was walking with the car when it started to roll.sauro testified that she was pushing the car from the front bumper area.in any event,this time,the car picked up speed as it rolled backwards down the incline of the driveway.the car dragged,and,down the hill with it until it collided with some trees and stopped.
was taken by medevac helicopter to the hospital.she was later told that she had broken several bones,including at least one rib and her shoulder blade.was kept in the hospital overnight for observation because of a risk of head trauma.she was discharged the next morning.
in december,filed suit against the wayland police department,its chief,robert irving,and officer sauro in massachusetts superior court.the suit alleged a claim,various state law theories of tort liability,and a violation of.laws ch,the state civil rights statute.the claim was based on multiple theories,including a theory that sauro had unconstitutionally seized in violation of her fourth amendment rights,and a danger theory that sauro had violated her fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights.the defendants removed the case to federal district court.see.the defendants eventually moved for summary judgment.
in opposing summary judgment on her claim,affirmatively disclaimed any argument that officer sauro had violated her fourth amendment rights.she claimed only that there was a triable issue on her danger due process claim.nonetheless,the fourth amendment theory somehow was submitted to the jury.
the district court denied summary judgment on the negligence,state civil rights act,and claims the court further denied qualified immunity to sauro on the claim.
the case was tried before a jury.as to fourth amendment theory,the court instructed the jurors 
the fourth amendment of the united states constitution provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.to prove her section claim,the plaintiff must prove that sauro violated her right to be secure in her person by ordering her to push her car in the circumstances that existed on february.
as to fourteenth amendment due process theory,the court instructions offered the jurors what appeared to be two separate theories of liability 
t he fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution protects the right to be free from and to obtain judicial relief for unjustified intrusions on personal security.if you find that the defendant sauro ordered the plaintiff to push her car farther off the road and that he did so in violation of her right to be secure in her person,then you may find that the defendant deprived the plaintiff of her fourteenth amendment right to due process of law.
additionally,the plaintiff claims that sauro action constituted a danger which caused harm to her a citizen has a constitutional right to be protected from such harm.a danger occurs when an officer,through an affirmative action,increases the threat of harm to an individual.if you find that sauro,while acting in his capacity as a wayland police officer,took an affirmative action that placed the plaintiff in a worse position of danger than if he had not acted at all,then you may find that sauro actions constituted a danger.
following the charge,sauro attorney objected to the instructions that if the jury found that sauro had ordered to move her car,they could find a violation.the court overruled the objection.
the verdict form did not distinguish between plaintiff fourth amendment and due process theories on her claim.it merely asked whether the plaintiff civil rights had been violated the jury answered yes to that question,although it also concluded that plaintiff had not made out her state law civil rights claim the jury rejected state law negligence claim.
as an initial matter,the jury awarded zero dollars in damages.the district court informed the jury that a zero damages award was not consistent with a finding of liability on the claim.f
