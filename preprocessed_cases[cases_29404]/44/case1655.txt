the question in this appeal is whether two connecticut newspapers and certain of their staff sometimes,the newspaper defendants subjected themselves to personal jurisdiction in virginia by posting on the internet news articles that,in the context of discussing the state of connecticut policy of housing its prisoners in virginia institutions,allegedly defamed the warden of a virginia prison.our recent decision in als scan,digital service consultants,cir,supplies the standard for determining a court authority to exercise personal jurisdiction over an person who places information on the internet.applying that standard,we hold that a court in virginia can not constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over the newspaper defendants because they did not manifest an intent to aim their websites or the posted articles at a virginia audience.accordingly,we reverse the district court order denying the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
sometime in the late the state of connecticut was faced with substantial overcrowding in its maximum security prisons.to alleviate the problem,connecticut contracted with the commonwealth of virginia to house connecticut prisoners in virginia correctional facilities.beginning in late connecticut transferred about prisoners,mostly and hispanic,to the wallens ridge state prison,a supermax facility in big stone gap,virginia.the plaintiff,stanley young,is the warden at wallens ridge.connecticut arrangement to incarcerate a sizeable number of its offenders in virginia prisons provoked considerable public debate in connecticut.several connecticut legislators openly criticized the policy,and there were demonstrations against it at the state capitol in hartford.
connecticut newspapers,including defendants the new haven advocate the advocate and the hartford courant the courant,began reporting on the controversy.on march,the advocate published a news article,written by one of its reporters,defendant camille jackson,about the transfer of connecticut inmates to wallens ridge.the article discussed the allegedly harsh conditions at the virginia prison and pointed out that the long trip to southwestern virginia made visits by prisoners families difficult or impossible.in the middle of her lengthy article,jackson mentioned a class action that inmates transferred from connecticut had filed against warden young and the connecticut commissioner of corrections.the inmates alleged a lack of proper hygiene and medical care and the denial of religious privileges at wallens ridge.finally,a paragraph at the end of the article reported that a connecticut state senator had expressed concern about the presence of confederate civil war memorabilia in warden young office.at about the same time the courant published three columns,written by amy pagnozzi,questioning the practice of relocating connecticut inmates to virginia prisons.the columns reported on letters written home by inmates who alleged cruelty by prison guards.in one column pagnozzi called wallens ridge a gulag.warden young was not mentioned in any of the pagnozzi columns.
on may,warden young sued the two newspapers,their editors gail thompson and brian toolan,and the two reporters for libel in a diversity action filed in the western district of virginia.he claimed that the newspapers articles imply that he is a racist who advocates racism and that he encourages abuse of inmates by the guards at wallens ridge.young alleged that the newspapers circulated the allegedly defamatory articles throughout the world by posting them on their internet websites.
the newspaper defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.in support of the motions the editor and reporter from each newspaper provided declarations establishing the following undisputed facts.the advocate is a free newspaper published once a week in new haven,connecticut.it is distributed in new haven and the surrounding area,and some of its content is published on the internet.the advocate has a small number of subscribers,and none of them are in virginia.the courant is published daily in hartford,connecticut.the newspaper is distributed in and around hartford,and some of its content is published on the internet.when the articles in question were published,the courant had eight mail subscribers in virginia.neither newspaper solicits subscriptions from virginia residents.no one from either newspaper,not even the reporters,traveled to virginia to work on the articles about connecticut prisoner transfer policy.the two reporters,jackson of the advocate and pagnozzi of the courant,made a few telephone calls into virginia to gather some information for the articles.both interviewed by telephone a spokesman for the virginia department of corrections.all other interviews were done with people located in connecticut.the two reporters wrote their articles in connecticut.the individual defendants the reporters and editors do not have any traditional contacts with the commonwealth of virginia.they do not live in virginia,solicit any business there,or have any assets or business relationships there.the newspapers do not have offices or employees in virginia,and they do not regularly solicit or do business in virginia.finally,the newspapers do not derive any substantial revenue from goods used or services rendered in virginia.
in responding to the declarations of the editors and reporters,warden young pointed out that the newspapers posted the allegedly defamatory articles on internet websites that were accessible to virginia residents.in addition,young provided copies of assorted from the newspapers websites.for the advocate,young submitted eleven pages from and for january.the two pages from are the advocate homepage,which includes links to articles about the best of new haven and new haven park police.the nine pages from,a website maintained by the publishers of the advocate,consist of classified advertising from that week newspapers and instructions on how to submit a classified ad.the listings include advertisements for real estate rentals in new haven and guilford,connecticut,for roommates wanted and tattoo services offered in hamden,connecticut,and for a bassist needed by a band in west haven,connecticut.for the courant,young provided nine pages from and for january.the homepage characterizes the website as a source of news and entertainment in and about connecticut.a page soliciting advertising in the courant refers to exposure for your message in this market in the best medium in the state to deliver your advertising message.the pages from,a website produced by the courant,provide news stories from that day edition of the courant,weather reports for hartford and new haven,connecticut,and links to sites for the university of connecticut and connecticut state government.the website promotes its online advertising as a source for jobs in connecticut.the website printouts provided for january,do not have any content with a connection to readers in virginia.
the district court denied the newspaper defendants motions to dismiss,concluding that it could exercise personal jurisdiction over them under virginia statute,ann.a,because the defendants internet activities constituted an act leading to an injury to the plaintiff in virginia.the district court also held that the defendants internet activities were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of constitutional due process.with our permission the newspaper defendants are taking this interlocutory appeal.the facts relating to jurisdiction are undisputed,and the district court decision that it has personal jurisdiction over these defendants presents a legal question that we review de novo.see christian sci.bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist nolan,cir.
a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the manner provided by state law.see esab group,centricut,cir.k a.because virginia statute extends personal jurisdiction to the extent permitted by the due process clause,see english smith metzger,cir,the statutory inqu
