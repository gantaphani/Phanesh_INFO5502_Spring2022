this interlocutory appeal from a partial refusal to compel arbitration concerns the arbitrability vel non of tort claims by an employee who,while working at an overseas location,was allegedly by her in her bedroom in housing.halliburton brown root,and various affiliates,contest the denial,in part,of their motion to compel arbitration of jamie leigh jones claims concerning her alleged rape by employees,while she was stationed at a company facility in baghdad,iraq.all of her claims were deemed arbitrable except for assault and battery intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of the alleged assault negligent hiring,retention,and supervision of employees involved in the alleged assault and false imprisonment.
at issue is whether those four claims found are,for purposes of jones employment contract,related to her employment or constitute personal injury arising in the workplace.that contract incorporated dispute resolution program drp,which required her to arbitrate all claims brought against the company falling within the scope of or workplace language.in the alternative,should the alleged rape be deemed covered by the arbitration clause,at issue is whether the doctrine of unclean hands precludes granting equitable relief of specific enforcement of that clause.affirmed and remanded.
jones began working for in as an administrative assistant in houston,texas.she alleges while so employed,she was sexually harassed by her supervisor and,because of this,she demanded to be moved to another department.
on july,jones signed a contract with defendant overseas administrative services oas,a foreign,subsidiary of,to be employed as clerical worker for the company in baghdad.paragraph of this contract provided,in pertinent part 
you agree that you will be bound by and accept as a condition of your employment the terms of the halliburton dispute resolution program which are herein incorporated by reference.you understand that the dispute resolution program requires,as its last step,that any and all claims that you might have against employer related to your employment,including your termination,and any and all personal injury claim s arising in the workplace,you have against other parent or affiliate of employer,must be submitted to binding arbitration instead of to the court system.
emphasis added.jones initials appear at the bottom of this paragraph.the incorporated drp,in turn,provides 
dispute means all legal and equitable claims,demands,and controversies,of whatever nature or kind,whether in contract,tort,under statute or regulation,or some other law,between persons bound by the plan or by an agreement to resolve disputes under the plan including,but not limited to,any matters with respect to any personal injury allegedly incurred in or about a company workplace.
emphasis added.as discussed infra,although the employment contract uses arising in the workplace,the incorporated drp uses incurred in or about a company workplace.emphasis added.
jones job assignment placed her in the united states army central command area of operations,located in the green zone,a area of baghdad.the green zone is a area that was initially the center of the coalition provisional authority after the iraqi invasion,and continues to remain the center of the international presence in the city.
four days after signing her employment contract,jones arrived in the green zone on july and began working at camp hope,which she alleges was under the direct control and authority,collectively,of the united states departments of state and defense,and.housing was provided for her as a term of her employment contract.although she had initially requested,and claims she was promised,a private billeting area to be shared only with women,she was instead housed in a barracks,some distance from her workplace,occupied predominantly by male employees.
jones alleges she was subjected to unwanted sexual harassment almost immediately.on july,two days after arriving in iraq,jones complained to several managers about her living environment,and requested that she be housed in a safer location.she contends no action was taken and she was,instead,advised to go to the spa.
the next evening,on july,jones alleges that,following a social gathering outside her barracks,at which alcohol had been consumed,she was drugged,beaten,and by several employees in her barracks bedroom.allegedly,when she awoke the next morning,naked and severely bruised,she discovered one of the alleged perpetrators lying in the lower bunk in her bedroom.at that time,he allegedly admitted to having unprotected sex with her.jones received several serious injuries as a result of the alleged incident,including torn pectoral muscles,which would later require reconstructive surgery.
jones reported the rape to another employee and was taken to see medical personnel.a rape kit was administered at a united states hospital.jones alleges subsequently mishandled the rape kit.she further alleges after her procedure was performed,she was placed under armed guard in a container and not permitted to leave and,despite repeated requests to be allowed to do so,she was denied access to a telephone to contact her family,until she convinced one of her guards to allow her to telephone her father.
additionally,jones alleges she met with halliburton human resources personnel and her direct supervisor following her physical examination,where she was interrogated for several hours.she contends her kbr supervisors gave her two options to stay and get over it or to return home without the guarantee of a job on return.jones father was eventually able to enlist congressional assistance to secure her return to the united states.
initially,jones filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission.it conducted an investigation and determined she had been sexually assaulted by one or more employees physical trauma was apparent and investigation had been inadequate.
in february,jones filed a demand for arbitration against,claiming negligence,negligent undertaking,and gross negligence in relation to the claimed sexual harassment and assault.she later amended the demand to include claims under title vii and the texas labor code.additionally,she filed for,and received,workers compensation benefits under the defense base act,discussed infra.
upon retaining new counsel,jones filed the instant action,based on the same claims,in district court in may against and its various affiliates the united states and individual defendants,including her first supervisor in houston,the alleged perpetrator she found lying in her bedroom,and several john doe rapists.jones husband was named as a plaintiff amended complaints have removed him as a party.the action was transferred to another district in texas in july jones the united states that september and the individual defendants have not made an appearance.
jones fourth amended complaint asserted claims for negligence which encompassed the claim,that the district court deemed,for the negligent hiring,retention,and supervision of the employees involved in the alleged assault negligent undertaking sexual harassment and hostile work environment under title vii retaliation breach of contract fraud in the inducement to enter the employment contract fraud in the inducement to agree to arbitration assault and battery intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.although jones complaint only asserted actions amounted to false imprisonment,and did not specifically present it as a claim,the district court confirmed at a hearing that jones did intend to assert a claim accordingly,it considered the arbitrability of that claim as well.she contended was vicariously liable for the torts committed by its employees.
in november,moved to compel arbitration of jones claims and stay the proceedings.in march,the district court heard oral argument on that motion.
that may,in a thorough and opinion and order,the district court granted in part and denied in part motion.for the reasons that follow,it compelled arbitration for all claims,except assault and battery intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of the alleged assault negligent hiring,retention,and supervision of employees involved in the alleged assault and false imprisonment.
in so holding,the district court concluded there was a valid agreement to arbitrate,rejecting jones contentions that there was no meeting of the minds the arbitration clause was fraudulently induced the provision was contrary to public policy and enforcing the agreement would be unconscionable.it also rejected jones alternative contention that,pursuant to the equitable doctrine of unclean hands,the arbitration agreement should not be enforced.
having decided the arbitration agreement is valid,the district court turned to whether jones claims fell outside the agreement scope.after determining the public policy expressed in the texas arbitration act did not govern the question of scope as jones had urged,the district court found that certain claims fell outside the scope of the provision.recognizing that the arbitration provision at issue is broad,it held the four claims related to the alleged rape assault and battery intentional infliction of emotional distress negligent hiring,retention,and supervision of the employees involved and false imprisonment fall beyond the outer limits of even a broad arbitration provision and were not related to jones employment.jones halliburton,d.
while noting that overseas,remote employment,such as jones,has led to a liberal interpretation in the case law of the scope of employment for purposes of workers compensation specifically,the defense base act,the district court concluded liberal construction could not be incorporated wholesale into the interpretation of an arbitration provision and,as such,the alleged rape could not be considered related to her employment for purposes of arbitration simply because it might be considered within the scope of employment for workers compensation purposes.id.at.
finally,the district court held although the arbitration provision extended to claims arising in the workplace,the court d id not believe jones bedroom should be considered the workplace,even though her housing was provided by her employer.id.at.
the district court ordered litigation of the four claims stayed until arbitration is completed on the other claims.those other claims were ordered to be arbitrated.this interlocutory appeal was filed in june.

a analysis is employed to determine whether a party may be compelled to arbitrate.id.first,whether the party has agreed to arbitrate the dispute is examined.this question itself is further subdivided to determine whether the party has agreed to arbitrate a dispute,our court must ask is there a valid agreement to arbitrate the claims and does the dispute in question fall within the scope of that arbitration agreement.id.citing jp morgan chase conegie ex rel.lee,cir.if both questions are answered in the affirmative,our court then asks whether any federal statute or policy renders the claims nonarbitrable.id.quoting jp morgan chase,at.
neither party contends that a federal statute or policy would bar arbitration accordingly,our analysis is restricted to the first step.further,the district court held,and neither party disputes on the exception of jones alternative there was a valid and enforceable agreement to arbitrate.as such,our inquiry focuses on the question of scope whether the dispute in alleged within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
paragraph of jones employment contract states 
this agreement is formed in the state of texas and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of texas except that with respect to all matters or disputes related to the validity or enforceability of provision below the arbitration clause,all issues shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the federal arbitration act.
jones contends the faa applies only when determining whether the agreement to arbitrate is valid or enforceable as a whole and the scope of an arbitration agreement is a distinct question that,under the terms of her employment contract,is governed by texas law.
to the extent jones is maintaining,as she did in district court,that the public policy in the texas arbitration act taa.civ.prac.rem.code ann.et,dictates her personal injury claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration agreement,we reject her contention.essentially,jones contended in district court that the arbitration agreement was not enforceable for her claims because,under texas law,the taa mandates that agreements to arbitrate such claims,inter alia,be signed by each party lawyer.see.civ.prac.rem.code ann.instructing the taa does not apply to a claim for personal injury unless each party to the claim,on the advice of counsel,agrees in writing to arbitrate and the agreement is signed by each party and each party attorney.
we agree with the district court conclusion that,to the extent of the taa affects the enforceability of the agreement,it would be preempted by the faa.jones,d at emphasis in original.accordingly,and essentially for the reasons stated by the district court,we also conclude that whether jones claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration provision is not based on the public policy stated in the taa.
although the public policy of the taa does not govern the scope of the arbitration provision,our court must decide whether jones claims deemed by the district court otherwise fall outside of the scope of the arbitration clause of the employment contract.as discussed,in this regard,the related to and workplace language comes into play.it goes without saying that there is a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration.
when determining whether a dispute is covered by the scope of an arbitration agreement,the supreme court has held that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.safer nelson fin.group,cir quoting moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr,d.accordingly,our court has held a valid agreement to arbitrate applies unless it can be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation which would cover the dispute at issue.personal sec.safety.motorola,cir quoting neal hardee food,cir.
first contends the dispute is covered by the arbitration agreement because the alleged incident is related to her employment for purposes of the employment contract arbitration clause.this clause provides,in pertinent part you understand that the dispute resolution program requires,as its last step,that any and all claims that you might have against employer related to your employment must be submitted to binding arbitration instead of to the court system.emphasis added.
our court has characterized similar arbitration clauses as broad and capable of expansive reach.see pennzoil exploration prod.ramco energy,cir noting courts distinguish narrow arbitration clauses that only require arbitration of disputes arising out of the contract from broad arbitration clauses governing disputes that relate to or are connected with the contract.of course,although this reach is broad,it is not unbounded.pennzoil recognized that a dispute need only touch matters covered by the arbitration agreement to be arbitrable,id.at quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d in the same discussion,however,it defined an arbitrable dispute under a broad clause as one having a significant relationship to the contract here,jones employment contract regardless of the label attached to the dispute.pennzoil,at.it further noted e ven broad clauses have their limits.id.at.
the case law is divided on the arbitrability,under similar arbitration clauses,of employees claims premised on sexual assault.as noted by the district court,the mississippi supreme court held in smith ex rel.smith captain d,llc,so d,that plaintiff claim against her employer for negligent hiring,supervision,and retention of her manager,who allegedly sexually assaulted plaintiff,was unquestionably beyond the scope of the arbitration clause at issue.id.at.in that action,the arbitration clause provided that all claims,disputes,or controversies arising out of or relating to her employment would be resolved through arbitration.id.at.
plaintiff,a restaurant employee,alleged that her manager assaulted and raped her at the restaurant during working hours.id.at.in addressing the question of scope,the mississippi supreme court held a claim of sexual assault neither pertains to nor has a connection with plaintiff employment.id.at see also niolet rice,so d,wl,at citing captain d in noting that plaintiff claims of assault and battery against her supervisor in an alleged sexual assault were not directly or indirectly related to her employment for purposes of the company arbitration agreement because the provision is limited to claims and a claim for assault and battery in no way touches upon matters covered by the agreement.
other courts have reached similar conclusions when determining whether an employee claims concerning sexual assault fall within the scope of an arbitration agreement.in hill hilliard,plaintiff sued her employer and her supervisor claiming,inter alia,assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and false imprisonment,after her supervisor allegedly raped her while they were attending a convention.defendants moved to dismiss and compel arbitration,contending the claims were within the scope of the arbitration provision in plaintiff employment contract,which mandated arbitration for any controversy arising out of employment.id.at.
the trial court agreed with defendants the appellate court,however,concluded that the claims of assault and battery and false imprisonment were dismissed erroneously.it held the only connection those torts and crimes have with plaintiff employment is that they were committed by a and occurred while on a business trip.id.at.the mere fact that these tort claims might not have arisen but for the fact that the two individuals were together as a result of an trip can not be determinative.what the supervisor is accused of doing is independent of the employment relationship.id.
the scope of that arbitration provision was,of course,more narrow than the one at issue,yet the result is no less valid for arbitration claims in most circumstances,a sexual assault is independent of an employment relationship.see miles,no,wl,at cal.dist.june unpublished noting that claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress,assault,and battery do not normally arise out of the employment context,in that they would be actionable even if plaintiff did not work with defendant and that sexual assault is not normally within the course and scope of employment tolliver kroger,determining,in an action involving whether an assault and battery claim fell within the scope of the company collective bargaining agreement for purposes of resolving the conflict through grievance procedures,that a ssault and battery conduct is not a part of,nor a condition of employment.
on the other hand,some courts have held claims do fall within the scope of arbitration agreements similar to the one at hand.for example,the southern district of new york held recently that,for purposes of arbitration,a claim was related to plaintiff employment when the assault was committed by a member of her company upper management,occurred at a work conference attended by plaintiff as part of her responsibilities for the company,and contributed to an alleged pattern of sexual harassment that had occurred at work.forbes edwards sons,wl,at.in the instant action,however,the alleged sexual assault occurred after hours,when jones was off duty and in her bedroom.
likewise,in barker halliburton,d,discussed and disagreed with by the district court in the instant action but relied upon as primary authority by the dissent,the court examined the same arbitration language as in this action and concluded falling within the scope of the arbitration provision were plaintiff claims of negligence,negligent undertaking,sexual harassment and hostile work environment,retaliation,fraud,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,arising from,inter alia,an alleged sexual assault by a state department employee while in plaintiff living quarters in iraq.it grounded this conclusion on plaintiff theories being predicated on the failure of the halliburton defendants employees to follow company policies regarding,among other things,sexual harassment,id.at,and on her claims alleging that halliburton negligently undertook to provide proper training,adequate and sufficient safety precautions,and adequate and sufficient policies and procedures in the recruitment,training and placement of personnel in iraq,id.
in so holding,the district court in barker commented on the unique nature of plaintiff work environment,noting that,for overseas employees,there is no bright line between work and leisure time.id.citing pan american world airways,cir,a case involving the reach of workers compensation under the defense base act,it ruled that,for overseas employees stationed in remote locations,the scope of the employment agreement and its arbitration clause encompasses incidents that occur outside the work environment.barker,at.
the district court disagreement in this action with the decision in barker is sound just because an assailant actions happen to be in violation of his employer policies,and those policies also govern plaintiff behavior,does not necessarily render the assault related to plaintiff employment for purposes of arbitration.jones,d at.it may be and,as the dissent also recognizes at note,jones will have to so prove,of course,to prevail on her claim that the alleged perpetrators were acting in ways that related to their employment because,in assaulting jones,they were violating company policies.but the perpetrators conduct concerning company policies does not explain how jones was acting in any way related to her employment by being the alleged victim of a sexual assault.
further,in the instant action,unlike in barker,jones has claimed is vicariously liable for the assault.this distinction with the barker decision,coupled with our concluding that the district court in this action properly analyzed and deemed as claims that overlap with those analyzed in barker negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress,strengthens our holding that jones claims were beyond the scope of the arbitration clause regarding the related to portion.
the district court reference in barker to the scope of employment in the context of workers compensation merits further discussion.as noted by that court,as well as by in this action,supreme court and fifth circuit jurisprudence has established a liberal construction for the term course and scope of employment for purposes of workers compensation under the defense base act,provides workers compensation for many employees stationed outside of the united states.
contends that this broad construction in the workers compensation context provides support that,for purposes of the arbitration provision,jones claims are related to her employment.indeed,in order to receive workers compensation for her injuries,jones acknowledged that they had been sustained in the course and scope of her employment.
in pan american world airways,our court noted that,for employees working under the defense base act,p ersonal activities of a social or recreational nature must be considered as incident to the overseas employment relationship because these employees work far away from their families and friends,in remote places where there are severely limited recreational and social activities,and are in different circumstances from employees working at home.at.our court noted that congress had evinced a desire for the defense base act to be liberally construed in conformance with its purpose,and in a way that avoids harsh and incongruous results,and to establish the same finality for the compensation decisions of deputy commissioners as had been established with the longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act.id.
the case law supports a conclusion that the liberal construction of scope of employment for purposes of workers compensation is not necessarily the same standard to be applied when construing an arbitration provision with similar language.in,the court analyzed the language of the longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act into which the defense base act was incorporated,which authorizes payment of compensation for accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment.it noted workmen compensation is not confined by conceptions of scope of employment,at.in explaining how to decide whether an employee can recover under the act,the court stated the test of recovery is not a causal relationship between the nature of employment of the injured person and the accident all that is required is that the obligations or conditions of employment create the zone of special danger out of which the injury arose.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also hotard devon energy prod,cir unpublished citing in holding that an employee was entitled to workers compensation for a spider bite suffered while sleeping in a bunk on his employer offshore oil rig because the conditions requiring sleeping there created the zone of special danger out of which the injury arose.
indeed,as noted by the district court in the instant action,the dissent in was concerned that,under this standard,an employer liability for workers compensation would follow from the mere relationship of employer and employee,at.minton,dissenting.the arbitration standard at issue here,while broadly construed,still requires,inter alia,a dispute related to a plaintiff employment to have a significant relationship to the contract.pennzoil,at.the supreme court has noted,in the context of erisa preemption if relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,the phrase would not have much limiting power because r eally,universally,relations stop nowhere.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.
in interpreting the arbitration provision at issue,and in the light of the precedent,we conclude that the provision scope certainly stops at jones bedroom door,as further discussed infra.as such,it was not contradictory for jones to receive workers compensation under a standard that allows recovery solely because her employment created the zone of special danger which led to her injuries,yet claim,in the context of arbitration,that the allegations the district court deemed did not have a significant relationship to her employment contract.
also points to several workers compensation cases to maintain that,because jones lived in housing,the alleged incident occurring there was related to her employment.it contends decisions such as barbarise overlook hospital ass n,and doe michael medical center of newark,provide support for holding that an incident occurring in dormitories arose out of and in the course of employment.
in doe,plaintiff,a medical technologist employed by the defendant hospital and living in the hospital dormitory,was found to have received an injury arising out of and in the course of employment,entitling her to workers compensation,after she was attacked in her dormitory room.doe stated that the leading authority on workers compensation law had determined c ompensability uniformly obtains when the employee is required to live on the portion of the employer premises where the accident happens.doe,at citing arthur larson,larson workers compensation law,at emphasis added.
needless to say,an accident is not at issue here.in any event,as discussed,the scope of employment may be more broadly construed under a workers compensation provision than when interpreting an arbitration provision.even within the context of workers compensation,however,simply living in housing does not mean an injury occurring in that housing necessarily arises out of and in the course of employment.
obviously,changes in this area of the law have occurred in the years since the edition of the authority which doe paraphrases.a recent edition summarizes the current state of the law with regard to workers compensation for as follows 
injuries to employees required to live on the premises are generally compensable if one of the two following features is present either the claimant was continuously on call,or the source of injury was a risk distinctly associated with the conditions under which the claimant lived because of the requirement of remaining on the premises.
arthur larson lex.larson,larson workers compensation laww,emphasis added.
concerning the first of the two features,jones was not continuously on call.she was at the time of the incident.
as for the second feature risk distinctly associated,courts have held that,for workers compensation purposes,an injury was not causally related to employment if this aspect of the claim was not satisfied.for example,in littles osceola farms,so d,the court denied death benefits to an employee widow because it found the employee death,which occurred when he was fatally stabbed by the woman with whom he had developed an amorous relationship while recovering at a medical facility from injuries,resulted from an event that was purely personal to the employee,and was not a risk distinctly associated with his stay at the medical facility.id.at quoting mecca farms,espino,so d.
of course,does not contend that the source of jones alleged a risk distinctly associated with the conditions under which she lived.to make such a contention would arguably mean that foresaw the possibility of this occurring if it had considered the alleged incident a distinct risk,arguably would have immediately heeded jones request to be placed in a private sleeping facility,instead of a barracks where the ratio of men to women was to one.
jones was not on call at the time of the alleged incident,nor was the incident a risk distinctly associated with the conditions under which jones lived.as such,jones living in barracks is unavailing to contention that the incident was related to her employment for arbitration purposes.
the one consensus emerging from this analysis is that it is,and concerns an issue about which courts disagree.when deciding whether a claim falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement,courts focus on factual allegations in the complaint rather than the legal causes of action asserted.waste,residuos industriales multiquim,de,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.here,the allegations are as follows jones was sexually assaulted by several employees in her bedroom,while she was,following a social gathering outside of her barracks,which was some distance from where she worked,at which social gathering several had been drinking which,notably,at the time was only allowed in spaces.
of further note,the record is unclear regarding both how free jones was to travel in the green zone and whether employees were allowed in camp hope,where the alleged incident occurred.if jones was not restricted to camp hope,but was able to travel in the wider green zone area,halliburton contention that the nature of her employment was pervasive and,such that most aspects of her life were related to it,would be weakened.the green zone housed a multitude of civilian workers in a wide range of occupations,and was the situs of many potential recreational and other social outlets that arguably could not be said to relate to jones employment.
moreover,if employees were allowed in the area where the alleged assault occurred,and employees had assaulted such a,that person obviously would have an actionable claim.that jones was the victim in the alleged assault,and that she happened to be a of the alleged perpetrators,should not,and does not,change the calculus.
in so noting,we do not make a statement on jones freedom of movement,or that of of,within the green zone.this was both unclear from the record and disputed by counsel in the briefing and at oral argument.the facts that can be definitively gleaned from the record are sufficient to support our decision the above suppositions,however,provide further reason
