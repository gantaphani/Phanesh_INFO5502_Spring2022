opinion of the court 
andre petras appeals the district court dismissal of his reverse false claims act suit against his former employer,simparel,david roth,simparel founder and chief technology officer and ron grilli,simparel chief executive officer collectively,the simparel defendants 
petras initially alleged a reverse fca claim and retaliation claim under the false claims act against the simparel defendants,as well as a conspiracy claim against all of the defendants.the district court dismissed the reverse fca claim without prejudice,but the remaining conspiracy and retaliation claims were dismissed with prejudice.petras reasserted the reverse fca claim against the simparel defendants in a second amended complaint,which the district court again dismissed.
on appeal,petras challenges the district court dismissal of both complaints.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
simparel sells proprietary software to apparel manufacturing companies.simparel original investor was l capital,a venture capital firm licensed by the small business administration,a federal agency.the sba provided over million to l capital through the purchase of certain securities,over million of which was invested in simparel.in return,l capital received preferred shares of simparel representing of that entity.that amount was later reduced to after the firm sold some shares.
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation the certificate specified two conditions that would require simparel to pay preferred shareholders,such as l capital,accrued dividends.the certificate provided for such payments if simparel board exercised its discretion to pay the dividends or if simparel underwent an involuntary or voluntary liquidation,dissolution,or windup.
from to,petras was simparel chief financial officer,david roth was cto,and ron grilli was its ceo.the sba was appointed as receiver of l capital in after simparel failed to comply with its sba funding agreement.petras contends that this failure resulted in the sba becoming a preferred shareholder in simparel,thus triggering the certificate provisions and entitling the sba to accrued dividends as a direct shareholder.
petras does not allege that the simparel board ever declared that dividends would be paid,or that simparel underwent liquidation,dissolution,or windup.he instead claims that the simparel defendants engaged in certain fraudulent conduct to which he objected in order to avoid paying the sba these contingent dividends.for example,he contends that the simparel defendants engaged in tactics such as hiding simparel deteriorating financial condition from the sba,failing to hold board meetings to review quarterly results,and neglecting to send simparel financial statements to the sba,as well as other tactics.according to petras,the simparel defendants did this to prevent the sba from placing simparel into involuntary liquidation,which would have triggered the accrued dividends payment.petras also alleged that the simparel defendants avoided dividend payments by diverting customers and technology from simparel to log logistics,which is a company roth had formed,and monterp,a canadian consulting company formed to provide computer programming services to aid simparel software development.
after petras was terminated from employment with simparel,he filed this suit under the fca in district court.
b.the district court dismissal orders 
generally,an fca action under a targets fraudulent efforts to obtain money from the united states government a reverse fca suit under a g,however,arises from fraudulent efforts to reduce or avoid an obligation to pay the government more specifically,a g imposes liability on anyone who knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay money to the government.
the district court first dismissed with prejudice all of the claims against the simparel defendants and former defendants log logistics and monterp except for the reverse fca claim,which the district court dismissed without prejudice.the court held that petras had not adequately pled that the simparel defendants had an obligation to pay money to the government because the obligations petras identified in his first amended complaint were outside the scope of the fca definition of an obligation.the dismissal of those substantive claims resulted in dismissal of petras conspiracy claim.the district court also dismissed the retaliation claim,concluding that petras could not establish the required causal nexus between the alleged retaliatory conduct and his fca claim because he had not pled that the defendants knew of his claim or the related conduct 
petras responded by filing a second amended complaint in which he reasserted a reverse fca claim against the simparel defendants and attempted to support it with additional allegations the attempt was unsuccessful,as the district court again dismissed the fca claim against the simparel defendants.the district court concluded that the alleged obligation to pay the government that was the basis of the fca claim was too speculative to give rise to an obligation under the fca 
petras now appeals the district court dismissal of both his first amended complaint and his second amended complaint 
legal standards 
our review of the district court dismissal is plenary we have previously explained that a private individual,known as a relator,may bring a civil action in the name of the united states to enforce the fca nevertheless,a relator action survives a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure only if the factual allegations raise a right to relief above the speculative level.thus,the complaint must state a plausible claim for relief.
beyond this general standard,we have also explained that fca claims in particular must be pled with particularity under rule b under rule b,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity,and a party must plead his claim with enough particularity to place defendants on notice of the precise misconduct with which they are charged.
with these standards in mind,we will proceed to evaluate the district court dismissal of each of petras claims 
petras reverse fca claim 
petras reverse fca claim alleges that the simparel defendants knowingly and improperly avoided a contingent obligation to pay the accrued dividends to l capital after l capital had been placed into receivership and was being operated by the sba.on appeal,petras argues that the district court ignored the plain meaning of the fca definition of obligation and that the court ruling contravenes congress intent to broadly construe that term,as evidenced by recent amendments to the fca petras also challenges the district court finding that the obligation he alleged was too speculative.on that specific issue,according to petras,the standard is not whether it is possible that the triggering events for payment of accrued dividends may never occur,but rather simply whether it is plausible under his second amended complaint facts that the contingencies could reasonably occur.
we begin our analysis with the relevant statutory text.for petras to assert a viable reverse fca claim,he must show that the simparel defendants knowingly and improperly avoid ed or decrease d an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.the simparel defendants reiterate their argument on appeal that petras reverse fca claim fails because the sba was not the government when it was acting as the receiver for l capital,a private entity.the district court did not address this issue.however,since it is an issue of first impression before this court,we will take this opportunity to address it.
we conclude that the sba,when acting as a receiver under the circumstances here,was not acting as the government.in the absence of controlling precedent,we find the decisions of our sister circuit courts of appeal helpful.in united states beszborn,for example,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit held that the resolution trust corporation,an entity the federal government created to handle failed financial institutions affairs,was not a government actor when operating as receiver of a failed bank as receiver,the rtc sued the former officers and directors of the failed bank and obtained a judgment that included punitive penalties when the government later criminally charged the officers and directors for the same conduct,the fifth circuit rejected the defendants double jeopardy defense the fifth circuit concluded that the rtc,as receiver,was not a government entity because it had merely stood in the failed bank shoes 
more recently in united states ex rel.adams aurora loan,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit applied a similar principle under the fca there,relators brought a traditional fca suit against lenders and loan servicers,alleging that they had submitted false certifications to the mortgage entities,the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac,by selling loans to those companies the relators argued that the false certifications to fannie mae and freddie mac constituted claims under the fca because they were requests for payment presented to an officer,employee,or agent of the united states.the court rejected the relators argument,concluding that the mere fact of the federal housing finance agency conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac did not mean those companies had become federal instrumentalities.the ninth circuit explained that the federal housing finance agency,as conservator,assumed all of fannie mae and freddie mac rights,titles,powers,and privileges,plac ing the fhfa in the shoes of fannie mae and freddie mac,and giv ing the fhfa their rights and duties,not the other way around.
the same logic applies here.as a general matter,when a federally chartered but private entity is placed into receivership,the relevant federal agency,acting as receiver,takes over the operations and assumes the powers of shareholders,board of directors,and management.in other words,the agency usually steps into the private status of the entity and does not retain any federal authority.
a governmental entity acting in its capacity as receiver thus does not necessarily qualify as the government for purposes of the fca.here,the sba,as the receiver of l capital,an indisputably private entity,assumed all powers,authorities,rights and privileges heretofore possessed by the general partner,managers,officers,directors,investment advisors and other agents of l capital.the sba did so for the purpose of marshalling and liquidating in an orderly manner all of l capital assets and satisfying the claims of creditors thereof in the order of priority as determined by the court.the sba thus temporarily stepped into l capital private shoes for the sole purpose of winding up the firm.the authority for doing so was purely contractual in nature.accordingly,the sba did not qualify as the government for purposes of the fca.
we realize,of course,that the ninth circuit decision in adams concerned the fdic and a traditional fca claim.however,that is a distinction without a difference.we see no reasoned basis for reaching a different result for the reverse fca action before us.indeed,the sba own internal operating procedures support the conclusion that the sba was not acting as a governmental actor for purposes of petras reverse fca claim 
after sba is appointed as receiver,sba is a fiduciary,responsible to the court and to all creditors,including,and parties in the interest of the proper operation liquidation of the debtor.the receiver is a separate legal entity and,as such,its funds,records,claims,assets,and liabilities are not the funds,records,claims,assets,and liabilities of sba or the government.decisions must be made for the benefit of the entire receivership estate 
accordingly,petras reverse fca claim must fail at the outset 
moreover,even if the sba could qualify as the government,petras reverse fca claim would nevertheless fail for the reasons set forth by the district court.
the fca defines obligation as an established duty,whether or not fixed,arising from an express or implied contractual,or relationship,from a or similar relationship,from statute or regulation,or from the retention of any overpayment.petras argues that the simparel defendants obligation to pay accrued dividends,while contingent on either the board declaration of dividends or the company liquidation,nonetheless satisfies the fca definition of an obligation.to support his argument that this fca definition includes contingent obligations,petras asks us to focus on an established duty,whether or not fixed.according to petras,such qualifying language demonstrates that the term,obligation,includes instances in which a legal duty did not exist at the time of the conduct.
the fca provision does not define established duty nor does it explain the meaning of the phrase,whether or not fixed.given the statute ambiguity,we will address the parties arguments regarding legislative history 
that legislative history confirms the district court conclusion that the contingent nature of the obligations at issue here precludes a finding that they are sufficiently definite to be included within the provisions of the fca.the current definition of obligation for reverse fca claims resulted from the amendments to the fca that were part of the fraud enforcement and recovery act of fera the fera senate report states that the new definition of obligation was intended to address confusion among courts that have developed conflicting definitions.the legislative history,as discussed below,reveals that an established duty more likely refers to one owed at the time that the alleged improper conduct under the fca occurred.contrary to petras argument,the term does not include a duty that is dependent on a future discretionary act.
as originally proposed by united states senators leahy and grassley,the fca provision defined obligation as a fixed duty,or a contingent duty arising from an express or implied contractual or similar relationship.senator kyl suggested revising the definitional language,a fixed duty,or a contingent duty,to instead state an established duty,whether or not fixed.senator kyl was concerned that under the original language senators leahy and grassley had proposed,relators would feel emboldened to sue to enforce fines before the government had formally established the duty to pay them for example,if a corporation had falsely claimed compliance with a regulation,a relator could then bring a reverse fca suit based on this conduct and assert that the corporation was improperly avoiding an obligation to pay discretionary fines that the government might levy for this conduct.senator kyl proposed his revision to prevent relators from bringing such speculative fca claims,and his proposal for the alternative language was ultimately adopted.
again,although the factual circumstances here are different,the difference is without a distinction.the same basic principle animating senator kyl concern applies.petras should not be able bring a reverse fca claim alleging that the simparel defendants improperly avoided an obligation to pay the government because the obligation did not exist when the defendants alleged misconduct occurred.even if we assume petras allegations that the simparel defendants withheld financial information from the sba and diverted resources to other entities are true,the allegations do not make out an fca claim under the circumstances here.the two events that would trigger an actual obligation to pay dividends either the board declaration of the dividends or simparel liquidation had not yet materialized,and petras does not allege that they had or that he even knew when they would have materialized.indeed,the obligation technically would never materialize if the board never exercised its discretion to declare the dividends or if simparel never liquidated.
moreover,the legislative history of the statute other relevant language whether or not fixed suggests a reference to whether or not the amount owed was fixed at the time of the violation,not whether an obligation to pay was fixed.in discussing the meaning of obligation,the senate jud
