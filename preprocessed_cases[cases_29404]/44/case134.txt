the question on appeal is whether the district court erred in enforcing an arbitration clause in an engagement letter as to malpractice and unfair practice claims brought by a former client under maine law.
the client is douglas bezio,who sued his former law firm of bernstein,shur,sawyer nelson bssn and individual defendants,alleging malpractice and violations of maine unfair trade practices act.tit,as well as a fee dispute.defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the action,which the district court allowed under the federal arbitration act faa.bezio draeger,cv nt,wl.july.we affirm.
it is clear that maine professional responsibility law for attorneys permits arbitration of legal malpractice claims so long as there is no prospective limitation of the firm liability.it is also clear that maine law,like the faa,evidences no hostility to the use of the arbitral forum,and maine would enforce this arbitration of malpractice claims clause.
the basic facts are not disputed.bezio was employed as a licensed agent and investment advisor representative of investors capital corporation.on march,the maine office of securities issued bezio a notice of intent to revoke his license and seek other penalties,alleging he had violated maine law,as well as financial industry regulatory authority finra and national association of securities dealers nasd rules as to his investment clients in maine.bezio then sought to retain bssn to represent him in the enforcement action.
before undertaking that representation,on march,attorney draeger of bssn sent bezio an engagement letter the agreement setting forth the terms of bssn legal representation.the agreement stated,as to the scope of bssn representation,that the firm would represent you with respect to securities regulatory matters before the maine office of securities and related matters.
the agreement also included an arbitration provision as to disputes that provided 
arbitration 
if you disagree with the amount of our fee,please take up the question with your principal attorney contact or with the firm managing partner.typically,such disagreements are resolved to the satisfaction of both sides with little inconvenience or formality.in the event of a fee dispute that is not readily resolved,you shall have the right to submit the fee dispute to arbitration under the maine code of professional responsibility.any fee dispute that you do not submit to arbitration under the maine code of professional responsibility,and any other dispute that arises out of or relates to this agreement or the services provided by the law firm shall also,at the election of either party,be subject to binding arbitration.either party may request such arbitration by sending a written demand for arbitration to the other 
emphasis added.this clause appeared on pages six and seven of the agreement and was not highlighted in the document.
bezio received the draft agreement,revised the advanced fee payments portion by hand,initialed that revision,and initialed each page.he signed and dated the agreement on march,and returned it to draeger.
the events which led to the end of the representation are not material,but other facts are material.first,no one at the firm communicated with bezio to discuss further with him the consequences of submitting malpractice and other claims to arbitration,including that this involved giving up jury trial claims.at no point was there a discussion between bezio and bssn of arbitration of malpractice claims,and the firm did not suggest to bezio that he have the arbitration agreement reviewed independently.
second,bezio previous experience with arbitration is also material for our purposes.bezio was no stranger to arbitration proceedings when he signed the agreement.in august,for example,bezio former clients initiated a finra arbitration against him and his former employer,lpl financial corporation lpl,asserting thirteen claims,including breach of fiduciary duty.in addition,in september he commenced a finra arbitration proceeding against lpl after it terminated him based on the conduct at issue in the august finra arbitration.
bezio does not dispute that the clause is enforceable as to fee disputes.he argues,though,that the clause is not enforceable as to malpractice claims for a variety of reasons.on appeal,bezio has made different claims in his briefs and at oral argument.
he asserts that the maine rules of professional conduct do not permit arbitration of malpractice disputes unless the attorneys have specifically pointed out and discussed fully the risks and possible consequences of such a clause and the client has given informed consent.we refer to these as informed consent preconditions.for this reading of maine law,he relies on the supreme court of louisiana opinion in hodges reasonover,so d.more specifically,the louisiana supreme court held in hodges 
at a minimum,the attorney must disclose the following legal effects of binding arbitration,assuming they are applicable 
waiver of the right to a jury trial 
waiver of the right to an appeal 
waiver of the right to broad discovery under federal rules of civil procedure 
arbitration may involve substantial upfront costs compared to litigation 
explicit disclosure of the nature of claims covered by the arbitration clause,such as fee disputes or malpractice claims 
the arbitration clause does not impinge upon the client right to make a disciplinary complaint to the appropriate authorities 
the client has the opportunity to speak with independent counsel before signing the contract.
bezio then argues that under maine law attorneys are fiduciaries in their relationships with their clients.these preconditions to ensure informed consent as to arbitration are no different than the rules in maine governing fiduciaries generally,he says,but cites no authority from maine.he argues that adoption of the hodges preconditions approach would mean there is no special rule being carved out for arbitrations by fiduciaries who are attorneys,and so no issue of preemption can arise under the faa.
we clear away two of his arguments.he argues that arbitration clauses must spell out that they apply to malpractice claims by referring explicitly to malpractice.the argument that malpractice claims do not fall within the broad coverage language of the contract is frivolous.he also argues that referring malpractice disputes to arbitration is,in his view,slanted toward law firms.we immediately reject this as the type of hostility to arbitration that is forbidden by both maine law and the supreme court under the faa.see at t mobility llc concepcion,o ur cases place it beyond dispute that the faa was designed to promote arbitration.roosa tillotson,me maine has a broad presumption favoring substantive arbitrability.
bezio finally argues that the arbitration clause is inherently unconscionable and against public policy under maine law because of the lack of the informed consent preconditions.as a result,a court should decline to enforce an arbitration clause where neither the clause nor any other communication adequately disclose d the full scope of the arbitration clause and the potential consequences of agreeing to binding arbitration.hodges,so d at.
our review of a decision to send a case to arbitration based on the language of the arbitration agreement is de novo.kristian comcast,cir.in deciding whether an agreement to arbitrate is to be enforced,we normally apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts,including validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts awuah coverall,cir.
still,state laws may not,under section of the faa,impose limitations which are special to arbitral clauses.see doctor,casarotto,by enacting of the faa,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.quoting scherk alberto culver.the district court relied on this principle in holding that if it were true that maine law had adopted the hodges view of informed consent preconditions,then maine law would be displaced by the faa.bezio,wl,at.we choose a
