this case concerns a negligence action arising out of a collision between teresa jones husband vehicle and a train owned by illinois central railroad company illinois central.after a jury returned a verdict of equal fault between jones and the railroad,jones filed motions to vacate the judgment,for a new trial,for discovery or an evidentiary hearing,and for sanctions.in support of those motions,she alleged that defense counsel had unreasonably resisted discovery requests and misled the court as to the truthfulness of a witness statements.jones further alleged that illinois central withheld information helpful to her case and bribed the aforementioned witness.the district court agreed with the first set of charges but rejected the latter.it therefore granted the motion for sanctions but denied the other motions.jones now appeals the denial of her motions under federal rule of civil procedure.the defendant the sanctions order.as discussed below,we affirm.
background 
on november,keith jones was driving a fertilizer spreader eastward on locust grove road in dyer county,tennessee,across a set of train tracks when he was struck by a northbound train.jones was thrown from his vehicle.though he survived,jones sustained head injuries so severe that he lost all memory of the accident.
his wife,teresa jones,filed a negligence action in federal district individually and on behalf of her disabled husband,alleging that the train owner,illinois central,had failed to identify the locust grove road crossing as dangerous,to adequately warn motorists of the danger,and to manage vegetation in the area such that an approaching motorist view of oncoming trains would not be obstructed.jones also raised a number of related statutory claims concerning the upkeep of the crossing area.illinois central denied negligence and argued that jones had been contributorily negligent in driving too fast and failing to stop for the train.after a trial,a jury returned a verdict finding each party at fault,resulting in no recovery.
jones then filed a series of motions concerning alleged wrongdoing by illinois central and defense counsel with respect to two issues disclosure of the recorded observations of two railroad crew members who witnessed the collision,and false testimony by one thomas grace,who drove past jones just before the collision.
train crew interview notes and statements.jerry mckissick,a train conductor,and harris wood,an engineer,were waiting in a southbound train parked on the side of the main tracks,just north of the crossing,when the accident occurred.thomas martin,illinois central claims agent,interviewed both mckissick and wood about the collision and took notes on their observations.later,wood stated in a deposition,i gave a statement to one of the risk managers,wood dep.at dist.dkt.document doc,raising the possibility in jones mind that illinois central possessed at least one written or recorded statement,not merely notes,from the train crew.
jones filed a request for any and all statements,and notes related thereto,by mckissick and wood.illinois central responded that the mckissick and wood interview notes were prepared in anticipation of litigation were protected by applicable privilege,including and work product.doc.illinois central thereafter switched law firms,retaining camille reifers as lead counsel.on february,jones moved to compel the production of the interview notes.on april,reifers filed a response reasserting the and privileges.
on june,a magistrate judge held a hearing on the motion to compel and reviewed the documents in camera.they consisted of a note with the phrase tom martin to conductor of train in siding,and a single page of handwritten notes listing the names and phone numbers of mckissick,wood,and a third person a website address the name of a highway and the words huddson scrapes.doc.the magistrate judge found no evidence that privilege attached to the single page of notes or the note and ordered illinois central to produce them.
reifers produced the documents on june.plaintiff counsel asked about the written or recorded statements that mckissick and wood had given the claims agent,and reifers responded that she possessed no additional documents.on sunday,june,the day before trial began,reifers sent plaintiff counsel an email stating the following ten minutes ago i found tom martin notes regarding the parked train crew.they were in an unmarked folder and appeared to be attorney notes.doc.this was a document of handwritten notes recording wood and mckissick observations and noting that they did not actually see the collision.that same day,plaintiff counsel filed a motion for sanctions based in part on defense counsel failure to turn over the actual statements that jones believed mckissick and wood had provided to the railroad.
thomas grace.grace was driving a farm truck westbound on locust grove road when the accident occurred.after he crossed over the railroad tracks,he had a with jones fertilizer spreader.after jones passed him,grace heard the train whistle blow,looked into his rearview mirror,and saw the crash.at his deposition,grace testified that his with jones occurred maybe ten feet west of the railroad crossing right at the tracks.grace dep.at doc.this testimony supported jones argument against contributory negligence a reduced awareness of his surroundings would be expected of jones if he had almost been in an accident immediately prior to reaching the tracks.
on may and may,plaintiff counsel spoke to grace and confirmed that he would testify at trial consistent with his deposition.grace also indicated that he was in dire financial straits.on may,reifers met with grace at his home for about minutes and showed him an aerial photograph of the crossing.at that point,grace indicated that the occurred close to a bridge on locust grove road,some feet west of the crossing.on june,plaintiff counsel again confirmed that grace would testify consistent with his deposition.
on the first day of trial,june,defense counsel asked plaintiff counsel when the plaintiff planned to call grace to the stand.plaintiff counsel answered june.that night,plaintiff counsel called grace to tell him he would not have to be in court until june.grace father answered the phone and said that illinois central had put grace up in a hotel in memphis that very night.the next morning,june,grace appeared at the courthouse.outside the courtroom,plaintiff counsel again confirmed that grace would testify consistent with his deposition.defense counsel also may have met with grace that morning.
plaintiff counsel pamela decided to call grace to the stand on june,since he had come to the courthouse.on direct examination,grace testified that he passed jones somewhere between the railroad tracks and the bridge,at a point roughly feet west of the tracks.see trial tr.at.was surprised by this testimony because she had been expecting grace to put the at ten feet from the crossing.tried to refer to grace deposition testimony,in which he had estimated a distance of ten feet,but reifers objected to the plaintiff impeachment of her own witness.id.at.at sidebar,plaintiff counsel john chandler accused the defense of paying for grace hotel room the previous night and influencing his testimony.the following discussion ensued 
the court are you stating as an officer of the court that the railroad did not put this person out of the reach of the plaintiffs by putting him up in a hotel 
reifers absolutely not,your honor.in fact,this witness told us this morning that he stayed with a friend last night.we had debated yesterday if it was proper under the rules if we could get him a hotel because he had to drive a specific distance and thought about asking the attorneys to split the cost so there would be nothing improper.
chandler that is what we were told by his father.
reifers we do know where he stayed.we do have any control over this person.
id.at.reifers also denied telling grace to appear for court that day.id.at.the district judge then allowed plaintiff counsel to use grace deposition to refresh his recollection.grace acknowledged that he had estimated a distance ten feet from the crossing at his deposition but explained that upon seeing a photograph,he believed the happened farther west.id.at.on redirect,grace explained that reifers in fact had asked him to appear that day.id.at.then brought out that reifers had been to grace home a month earlier and shown him the photographs of the area.id.at.also referred to the deposition testimony again and reminded grace that he had been under oath at that time.id.at.asked grace directly,did you tell your father that the defendants were putting you in a hotel he answered,no.id.at.then,outside of the presence of the jury but while still on the stand,grace again testified that illinois central had not put him up in a hotel and that he had stayed with a friend the previous night.id.at.
that afternoon,reifers told the court that she learned over the lunch break that an attorney on her team had instructed a paralegal to make the reservation on the understanding we would ask the plaintiff s lawyer to split the room cost.id.at.the district judge postponed discussion of the issue until the next day,when reifers clarified that she herself had been involved in a discussion about possibly paying for a hotel room but that she had not believed a reservation had been made.id.at.she stated that once she found out her associate had in fact made the reservation,she wanted to bring it to the court attention.she also stated that the defense had not actually contacted the plaintiff about splitting the cost,and that although she was charged for the room,she did not know whether grace actually stayed at the hotel.id.at.reifers denied talking to grace any time other than at his home in may and again denied telling him to be in court on june.id.at.
plaintiff counsel raised the issue again on june,alleging that grace was prepared,he was practiced to testify in the way reifers wanted him to testify and not testify consistent with his deposition because he has either been paid money or promised a job by the railroad.id.at.plaintiff counsel asked for a jury instruction indicating that grace had lied.id.at.reifers denied the charge and represented that she had tried to be as truthful as possible with the court.id.at.at this point,the district judge remained unconvinced that grace had lied or that reifers had done anything unethical.id.at.the court ordered defense counsel to give plaintiff counsel the name of the hotel so that plaintiff counsel could investigate the issue.id.at.
the next morning,june,plaintiff counsel revealed that they had learned from the hotel that grace had in fact stayed there.id.at.reifers indicated that the hotel had incorrectly charged her for extra nights for other witnesses,suggesting that grace may not actually have stayed at the hotel.id.at.plaintiff counsel also provided the court with a proposed jury instruction on grace perjury.id.at.
the district judge recalled grace on june.outside of the jury presence,grace admitted that he had lied about staying at the hotel and explained that he had done so because someone representing the railroad told him not to say anything about it.id.at.he stated,however,that he did not communicate with anyone from the defense while he was staying at the hotel and that he was not promised money or a job in connection with his testimony.id.at.grace told the judge that no one had suggested to him what he should or should not say during the course of his testimony.id.at.when the judge asked him to explain the discrepancy between his deposition and trial testimony about the location of the,he explained that he changed his testimony after seeing photographs of the crossing area.id.at.when asked by plaintiff counsel why he had reassured her that he would testify consistent with his deposition,he answered,i do recall saying that i would testify exactly.id.at.
on june,the final day of trial,the district judge announced that she would instruct the jury as to grace false testimony.id.at.illinois central moved for a mistrial based on the adverse nature of the grace instruction,but the motion was denied.id.at.when the jury entered,the district judge permitted plaintiff counsel to read grace deposition testimony,including his statement that the occurred ten feet from the crossing,to the jury.id.at.the judge then gave the jury its charge,including the following instruction 
now you will recall that on tuesday june,you heard live testimony from thomas grace,a witness to the collision at issue in this case.after the jury was excused from the courtroom,i asked grace to stay and answer a few questions.i then asked grace whether or not he had stayed the previous night in a hotel room paid for by the defendant.grace denied under oath that he had stayed in a hotel room paid for by the defendant but instead stated that he stayed at a friend house.
information later came to the court attention that grace testimony regarding where he had stayed the previous night was not truthful.in fact,the court has determined that grace did stay in a hotel room paid for b y the defendant the night before he testified in this case.therefore,you may consider the fact that grace testified falsely under oath about this matter,testified falsely about the matter of the hotel room,and you may consider his credibility in deciding any of the matters that are relevant to your determination of the issues in this case.
id.at.in her closing argument,reifers told the jury,w hen i realized that grace had made a misstatement to this court,i informed the court of that.i did.because that my duty as an officer of the court.id.at.
motions.after the jury returned a verdict denying any recovery,jones filed motions to vacate the judgment,for a new trial,for sanctions,and for discovery or an evidentiary hearing based on illinois central and defense counsel alleged misconduct.that alleged misconduct involved the following with respect to the evidence of the train crew observations,jones claimed that defense counsel had no basis initially to refuse disclosure of the notes later ordered disclosed by the magistrate judge,and that defense counsel ultimately withheld written or recorded statements made by the train crew.with respect to thomas grace,jones claimed that defense counsel falsely represented that they had not put grace up in a hotel,falsely represented that they had not asked him to be in court on june,instructed grace to conceal the fact of the paid hotel stay,and bribed grace to change his testimony about the location of his with jones on the day of the accident.
the court held a hearing on november,and issued its ruling on march.the district judge agreed that illinois central and defense counsel had unreasonably litigated the discoverability of the claims agent notes from his interview of the train crew,but found no fault with the delayed disclosure of notes that reifers found the day before trial.importantly,the judge did not find that the train crew had made written or recorded statements,as opposed to oral statements memorialized in the claims agent notes,or that defense counsel ultimately withheld any such statements.the district judge also agreed that illinois central and defense counsel had acted in bad faith and recklessly in telling grace not to reveal that they had paid for his hotel room,in denying that they had asked grace to be in court on june,and in failing to be forthcoming with respect to grace hotel stay and his perjury about that stay.critically,however,the district judge rejected the notion that defense counsel bribed grace to move the location of his farther west of the train crossing on locust grove road.the district judge described this allegation as an attempt to create some broader issues of misconduct that stems primarily from disappointment and disagreement with the jury unfavorable verdict.dist.order at doc.she therefore denied the motions to vacate and for a new trial because the misconduct that had occurred had been adequately remedied by the court and did not prejudice jones in the end.the district judge also denied the motion for discovery or an evidentiary hearing due to jones insufficient showing that defense counsel had engaged in the more egregious acts of withholding evidence and bribing a witness.
at the same time,the district judge granted the motion for sanctions.finding that reifers conduct with regard to the disclosures constitute d bad faith and an unethical attempt to distract opposing counsel from the real issues of the case,the court sanctioned her under federal rules of civil procedure and and.id.at.with respect to the grace matter,the district court found that reifers actions and those of her legal team were unreasonable and vexatious and inconsistent with their obligations as officers of the court,and sanctioned illinois central and defense counsel under and its inherent power.id.at.the district court limited its sanctions award to the attorney fees that jones had incurred in pursuing the documents,investigating grace testimony,and preparing the sanctions motion.
jones now appeals the denial of relief under federal rule of civil procedure.illinois central challenges the sanctions order on.

jones appeal denial of relief 
jones seeks relief based on misconduct that falls into two distinct categories the defense misconduct,found by the district court,in fighting the disclosure of the claims agent notes,in telling grace not to reveal that he had stayed at the hotel,and in failing to be fully forthcoming about the grace matter and the defense alleged misconduct,rejected by the district court,in concealing actual statements made by the train crew and in underhandedly securing a change of testimony from grace.we address each class of conduct separately.
denial of relief based on misconduct found by the district court 
jones argues that the district court abused its discretion in declining to vacate the judgment and grant a new trial under federal rules of civil procedure b and d based on illinois central and defense counsel a resistance to disclosing the railroad claims agent notes on the parked train crew observations,b representation that they did not arrange for grace to appear in court on june,and c concealment and lack of diligence in bringing to light the truth of grace stay at the hotel.under rule b,a district court may order relief from a final judgment for fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party.under rule d,a district court may set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.the district judge found,in the course of discussing the motion for sanctions,that defense counsel had committed the aforementioned misconduct.contrary to jones representations in her briefs on appeal,however,nowhere did the district judge conclude that that misconduct amounted to fraud on the court.ultimately,the district court did not vacate the judgment and grant a new trial on either basis.
jones advances two grounds on which the district court erred in denying relief first,that the court mistakenly put the burden on her to prove that the misconduct rendered the trial unfair and second,that even if she bore the burden of proving unfairness,she met that burden.illinois central asks that we not address these arguments because jones waived rule relief by failing to move for a mistrial before the jury returned its verdict.we agree.
we have previously observed that rule was not intended to relieve counsel of the consequences of decisions deliberately made,although subsequent events reveal that such decisions were unwise.cacevic city of hazel park,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also ackermann united states,f ree,calculated,deliberate choices are not to be relieved from.we have applied the waiver doctrine in circumstances similar to those in this case.in morton butler timber united states,cir,landowners claiming that the government had taken their property without just compensation sought a new trial based on the allegedly improper and prejudicial conduct of the government attorneys.id.at.we rejected the argument in part because the landowners waived it by failing to move for a mistrial.id.at.in carter tennessee,cir,we held that a criminal defendant waived his argument for a new trial based on the prosecutor prejudicial comments during closing argument because the defendant failed to call for a mistrial prior to judgment.id.at see also united states carter,app x,cir unpublished opinion same,but defendant dissuaded court from declaring mistrial and instead requested curative instruction.likewise,jones did not request a mistrial.the option was obvious because illinois central did move for a mistrial on the grace matter,jones instead requested and received a curative instruction and the opportunity to read grace deposition testimony to the jury.having bet on the jury and lost,she is not permitted now to seek a new trial on the basis of potential prejudice that was apparent during trial.
city of cleveland peter kiewit sons,cir,cited by jones,does not hold otherwise.there,the city of cleveland sued a contractor for damage done to a city dock,and the jury returned a verdict for the city.during trial,counsel for the city made pervasive improper references to the size of the defendant business operations and its insurance coverage.defense counsel had objected repeatedly,and the judge had admonished and reprimanded the city counsel and given curative jury instructions,but defense counsel apparently never moved for a mistrial.nonetheless,we ordered a new trial.id.at.in that case,however,the city never challenged the propriety of granting rule relief despite the losing party failure to seek a mistrial.had we faced that argument in city of cleveland,we would have been bound to apply our clear precedent from morton butler timber and carter,as we are in this case.
jones makes one more argument against waiver.she contends that she did not know the full scope of illinois central misconduct until after the jury returned the case,and that the district judge had not become convinced of that misconduct until after trial.jones position is directly contradicted by the record.defense counsel obstinacy in refusing to turn over the notes predated the trial,as did the magistrate judge resolution of that controversy.thomas grace admitted that he had lied about the hotel stay,and that someone from the defense team told him to do so,on june,the penultimate day of trial.any by the defense in investigating the grace matter had already come to light by this time.so perturbed by these revelations was the district judge that she instructed the jury that in judging grace credibility,it could consider perjury that had occurred mostly outside of its presence.
thus,this case is readily distinguishable from abrahamsen express,cir,and okros angelo iafrate construction,app x,cir unpublished opinion,both cited by jones.in abrahamsen,we affirmed a grant of rule b relief when defense counsel revealed to plaintiff counsel a materially adverse statement,which should have been disclosed during discovery,only after the jury rendered its verdict.abrahamsen,at.in okros,we reversed the district court denial of a motion for relief from a jury verdict for the plaintiff due to fraud on the court when it emerged only after trial that the plaintiff committed perjury and that his attorney may have known about it or acted in reckless disregard for the truth.okros,app x at.here,jones had ample reason and opportunity to seek corrective action in the form of a mistrial before the jury returned its verdict.she chose not to.she can not now demand a new trial.
denial of relief and discovery or an evidentiary hearing based on the allegations of misconduct rejected by th
