opinion of the court 
we apply pennsylvania rules to determine which state substantive law new york,michigan or pennsylvania governs the extent of vicarious liability of budget system,budget,the owner of a vehicle involved in an accident that rendered nicole chappell chappell,a new york resident,permanently paralyzed.the accident occurred in pennsylvania as chappell and her boyfriend,joseph powell,iii powell,a michigan resident,were driving from new york to michigan in a car powell had rented from budget in michigan and previously driven to new york.
because the state of new york has the greatest interest in the application of its law to this dispute,we conclude that its law should apply.the contrary judgment of the district court is reversed.
pertinent facts and procedural history 
on the morning of february,powell rented a nissan xterra from budget in michigan.later that day,he drove eight hours to new york to visit chappell.powell stayed with chappell in new york for the rest of that week.on the evening of february,after chappell completed her work week,she and powell left new york in the xterra,planning to drive to michigan to spend the weekend together there.
while driving through pennsylvania early the next morning,powell fell asleep at the wheel.the car drifted from the left lane of interstate across the right lane and into the right guardrail,causing it to flip over.powell escaped the crash without substantial physical injury.however,the force of the impact ejected chappell from the xterra,causing severe injuries.shortly after the accident,a helicopter transported her to mercy hospital in pittsburgh,where doctors diagnosed,among other injuries,spinal trauma that has rendered chappell permanently paraplegic.
budget initiated this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,seeking a declaratory judgment against powell and chappell and asking the court to determine which state substantive law governed its vicarious liability as the owner of the vehicle budget argued that michigan law should apply,capping its liability at.chappell brought two counterclaims against budget vicarious liability and negligent entrustment and a against powell.she argued that budget faced unlimited vicarious liability under new york law.
the parties for summary judgment on the issue,and the district court granted summary judgment to budget,holding that pennsylvania law applied.chappell moved for a certification of the issue and entry of a final judgment under.b.after the district court granted that motion and entered a final judgment,chappell timely appealed.we exercise appellate jurisdiction to review the district court final judgment under.
ii.legal framework 
pennsylvania 
to determine which state substantive law governs,we must refer to the rules of the jurisdiction in which the district court sits,here pennsylvania.klaxon stentor electric.melville american home assur,cir.under pennsylvania law,we begin with an interest analysis of the policies of all interested states and on the result of that the case as a true conflict,false conflict,or case.lejeune,cir lacey cessna aircraft,cir.
a true conflict exists when the governmental interests of multiple jurisdictions would be impaired if their law were not applied.lacey,at.if a case presents a true conflict,pennsylvania rules call for the application of the law of the state having the most significant contacts or relationships with the particular issue.in re estate of agostini.as explained in the second restatement of conflict of laws,
the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include a the needs of the interstate and international systems,b the relevant policies of the forum,c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,d the protection of justified expectations,e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,f certainty,predictability and uniformity of result,and g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.
restatement second of conflict of laws.
a false conflict exists if only one jurisdiction governmental interests would be impaired by the application of the other jurisdiction law.lacey,at.if there is a false conflict,we must apply the law of the only interested jurisdiction.see,kuchinic mccrory,griffith united air lines.
finally,an case arises when no jurisdiction interests would be impaired if its laws were not applied.lex loci delicti the law of the place of the pennsylvania continues to govern cases.see,miller gay.
with this background,we turn to the competing state laws we consider applying.
relevant state law provisions on vicarious liability 
new york law imposes unlimited vicarious liability on the owners of vehicles.it provides that e very owner of a vehicle used or operated in that state shall be liable and responsible for injuries to person s resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle veh.traf.law mckinney.by passing,the new york l egislature intended that the injured party be afforded a financially responsible insured person against whom to recover for injuries.plath justus.
it is beyond dispute that has extraterritorial scope,that is,it can apply to accidents occurring beyond new york borders.farber smolack,holding that t o the extent earlier decisions declined to give extraterritorial effect to,they are overruled.this dispute requires us to assess the extent of the extraterritorial scope of.the new york court of appeals has held that vicarious liability imposed by section does not extend to owners of vehicles that have never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within new york.fried seippel,emphasis added.we later address whether under new york law the xterra in our case falls within that exclusion.
michigan also imposes vicarious liability on the owners of vehicles.its law provides that t he owner of a motor vehicle is liable for an injury caused by the negligent operation of the motor vehicle if the motor vehicle is being driven with his or her express or implied consent or knowledge.comp.laws subsection.liability is capped,however,in certain circumstances the liability of a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles who is the lessor of a motor vehicle under a lease providing for the use of the motor vehicle by the lessee for a period of days or less is limited to because of bodily injury to or death of person in any accident.comp.laws subsection.in effect,vicarious liability is imposed on an owner when the driver negligence causes an accident in another state so long as the relationship was entered into in michigan.sexton ryder truck rental.
at the time of chappell accident,michigan law provided that it was a misdemeanor for an owner knowingly to permit to be operated,upon any highway,a vehicle required to be registered unless there is attached to and displayed on the vehicle a valid registration plate issued for the vehicle.comp.laws,

iii.analysis 
district court opinion 
the district court opinion is a.the case starts simply enough the parties sought a declaratory judgment whether the law of new york or michigan governs the extent of budget vicarious liability to chappell budget system,chappell,d,emphases added.m indful of what it described as a delicious irony in how the parties briefed this case,id.at,the district court concluded that pennsylvania law controls the resolution of the issues,id.at emphasis added.
this conclusion unfolds as follows.the court assessed new york and michigan respective vicarious liability provisions,reaching the following two intermediate determinations.first,it predict ed that the new york court of appeals would avoid the serious federal constitutional questions it perceived in by concluding that the statute reference to vehicle s used or operated in new york does not cover vehicles that are registered outside of new york and that were not being used or operated in new york at the time of an accident,id.at.second,it decided that budget could not invoke michigan limitation of liability for lessors of cars in subsection because the lease between budget systems and powell was founded on a systems grant of permission to operate the xterra without a valid license plate and is therefore a nullity under michigan law,id.at.
having determined that neither new york nor michigan substantive legal provisions would apply in this case,the district court reasoned that neither state had an interest in applying its law.id.at.that is,the court characterized this dispute as an case.id.at.as a result,it held that the rule of lex loci delicti governed,pennsylvania substantive law applied,and thus budget did not face vicarious liability.id.
in sum,the district court ruling rested on its limiting interpretations of new york and michigan substantive law.before turning to the inquiry,we address the propriety of those legal interpretations.
does new york apply to this dispute 
the district court predicted that the state of new york would not construe to apply to this case.our review of this prediction is plenary.nationwide mut.ins.buffetta,cir.we disagree with the district court analysis and conclude that this case falls within the scope of as that statute has been construed by new york courts.
our core query is what does the phrase used or operated in new york in mean fortunately,new york court of appeals has addressed this question on several occasions.
in farber smolack,the court of appeals implied that has as broad a scope of substantive application as would be consistent with new york principles when new york is the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship with the issue presented,applies.farber,at citations omitted.while this formulation is unfortunate inasmuch as it at least substantive law question the scope of the statute with the issue the extent of new york interest in applying the statute this early precedent nonetheless sets the principle that new york will broadly apply,perhaps as broadly as is permissible under constitutional principles.
eight years later,in sentry ins.amsel,the new york court of appeals again stressed the broad scope of the statute,explaining that t he legislative history of indicates that the legislature intended to enlarge the vehicle owner vicarious liability and not to draw the line at the border.id.at.
most recently,in fried seippel,the court of appeals directly addressed the scope of the statute and held that the vicarious liability imposed by section does not extend to owners of vehicles that have never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within new york,at emphasis added.in fried,avis which operated in new york owned a jamaican car rental company that rented a vehicle of jamaican registry to seippel,a new york resident.seippel and fried also a new york resident were in the car in jamaica when one of them negligently caused a collision.fried died in the accident.his representatives sued avis under,and the trial court denied avis motion for summary judgment based on the jamaican company ownership of the vehicle.putting aside the issue whether avis should be deemed the vehicle owner,the court of appeals held that did not apply because the car ha d never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within new york.fried,at.
scope of the statute 
noting that t he facts here fall in the middle ground between farber and fried because the xterra was not registered in new york but powell did drive it there,the district court interpreted these cases to mean that new york courts would conclude that the new york legislature did not intend to cover vehicles that are registered outside of new york and that were not being used or operated in new york at the time of an accident.budget,d at.we disagree with this creative legal interpretation.
the fried court stated that the holding in farber ha d little bearing on the statutory construction problem presented in fried,since,by virtue of its prior use or operat ion in new york,the accident vehicle in farber was indisputably within section substantive coverage fried,at emphasis added.this statement by new york highest court is irreconcilable with the district court view and is arguably sufficient of itself to settle the statutory construction issue before us.as in farber,by virtue of its prior use and operation in new york,the accident vehicle here is indisputably within substantive coverage.
yet we need not labor,as the district court did,to discern the scope of new york law from the disposition of its precedents,for the fried court explicitly drew a line for us vicarious liability imposed by section does not extend to owners of vehicles that have never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within this state.fried,at emphasis added.the vehicle in this case was used,operated and intended for use within new york.
lest we be left with doubt as to the meaning of the seemingly clear rule announced in fried,we refer to new york intermediate courts for further guidance.where an intermediate appellate state court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it announces,that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.west am.in vasquez christian herald ass n,only five months after fried,the first department of the appellate division of new york supreme court cited fried as authority for the applicability of to facts similar to this case leave to appeal the intermediate appellate court decision in vasquez was denied by the court of appeals 
in short,the district court conclusion that does not cover vehicles that are registered outside of new york and that were not being used or operated in new york at the time of an accident,budget,d at,runs afoul of new york precedent.to the contrary,the provision applies unless the accident vehicle ha s never been registered,used,operated or intended for use within new york.fried,at emphasis added.thus,the provision applies to our case.
constitutional concerns 
the district court construction of was premised on its perception that applying the statute in this case would implicate federal constitutional problems.it predicted that the new york courts would adopt its specific limiting construction of the statute in order t o avoid the serious constitutional questions that interpreting section to cover the facts of this case would raise budget,d at.that is,the district court interpreted new york law to require that a court invoke the doctrine of constitutional avoidance in order to sidestep potential constitutional problems raised by the application of the statute in this case.it further predicted that the new york courts would adopt a limiting construction imposing its registration requirement.we have already disagreed with the district court construction of the statute.we now address the constitutional concerns it perceived.
to be technical,the court did not actually hold that application of would be unconstitutional.it simply predicted that the courts of new york would recognize that the united states supreme court has held that due process forbids states from regulating extraterritorial activities with which they have slight or casual connection and avoid the issue altogether by narrowing the statutory scope.id.at citing hartford accident indem.delta pine land.home ins.dick.having parted from the district court statutory interpretation,we ask simply whether application of the statute in this case under the fried rule would violate the constitution as opposed to asking whether new york courts would perceive the application of the statute in this case as a potential constitutional problem they should avoid by adopting the district court construction.
the supreme court has spoken on this issue since,when the most recent case cited by the district court was decided.in fact,the precedent that gave rise to the district court constitutional apprehensions is widely recogn
