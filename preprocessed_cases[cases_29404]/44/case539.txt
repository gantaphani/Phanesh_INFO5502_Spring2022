this consolidated case,in which multiple frauds are alleged against a partner to a biotechnology venture,emerges from over ten years of complex,litigation.the case appears before us on appeal for the second time we originally considered it nearly five years ago.see credit francais international,cir cfi.the original appeal arose out of two separate summary judgment orders issued by the district court,one in july and the other in december of the same year.the july judgment awarded credit francais international a constructive trust over certain contractual rights william trainor had acquired from biopure using funds he had fraudulently obtained from cfi.the december judgment effectively denied peter fisher,allegedly trainor innocent partner,any similar stake in those contractual rights the judgment also dismissed certain direct claims fisher had brought against biopure.
in cfi,we found we lacked jurisdiction to review the december judgment because at the time it had been prematurely certified as final.we remanded the case,and the district court undertook further proceedings in accordance with our instructions.subsequently,the district court again ruled against fisher,recertifying the december judgment as final.we now affirm the judgment 
the facts of the case are laid out in detail in cfi.see at.we briefly review,and occasionally supplement,those facts.
in november,trainor and fisher entered into a joint venture to invest in and manage the testing of a human blood substitute being developed by biopure by oral agreement,they were to split the proceeds from the venture.trainor was supposed to negotiate a contract with biopure on behalf of the joint venture,using company affiliated with the vehicle for the transaction.what appears to be a draft agreement,labeled a term sheet,was drawn up accordingly,with balfour as the named party to the contract.the agreement called for giving balfour an equity share in biopure and licensing rights to biopure products.however,by the time the agreement was finalized in a set of three instruments in late january,trainor secretly substituted his own company,as the named party to the contract,effectively shouldering fisher out of the deal 
pursuant to these finalized instruments referred to collectively as the biopure contract,trainor transferred million to biopure as partial consideration for the equity share granted under the contract.in addition,he transferred million to a personal trust account,out of which he paid various expenses incurred in performance of the contract.it was later discovered that trainor had obtained all of these funds by way of a fraud on cfi,a french bank,in the late the formation of the biopure venture.
meanwhile,fisher,purportedly unaware of any of his mischief and still believing himself to be a party to the biopure contract,traveled to guatemala in early to oversee clinical testing of biopure product.although the extent of fisher labors in guatemala are much disputed,fisher claims to have spent substantial time and effort there acquiring governmental approval for the clinical trials and overseeing their administration.
in june,biopure was alerted to various facts about trainor and fisher backgrounds.among other things,biopure learned that trainor and fisher both had considerable histories of being sued for fraud and financial misdealing further,trainor had several convictions for fraud and other crimes.believing that trainor and fisher had misrepresented themselves by not earlier revealing these facts,and worrying about the integrity of their dealings with biopure,biopure rescinded the biopure contract in august.
from these events,a tangle of claims emerged,sprawling across two eventually consolidated lawsuits.for the purposes of this appeal,only the following need be mentioned 
trainor sued biopure for breach of the biopure contract.
fisher sued trainor under various theories for defrauding him of his share of the biopure contract rights.among other forms of relief,fisher sought a constructive trust over the rights.fisher also sued biopure for breach of contract and related counts.
biopure sued both trainor and fisher for fraud,racketeering,and related counts among other forms of relief,it sought a declaration that the biopure contract was void for fraud and that its recission was effective.
cfi brought claims against trainor,fisher,and biopure for a constructive trust over the biopure contract rights,on the ground that those rights had been acquired using funds fraudulently obtained from cfi.
much of the early proceedings in the case concerned fisher claim that trainor had violated their oral joint venture agreement by substituting as the named party to the biopure contract.that claim was tried before a jury in.the jury issued a special verdict,but trainor and fisher were unable to agree on its meaning,and a mistrial was declared.
the later proceedings in the case give rise to the current appeal.in july,the district court granted summary judgment to cfi against trainor,awarding cfi a constructive trust over the biopure contract rights the choses in action in trainor suit against biopure and allowing cfi to step into trainor shoes to litigate those rights.the court noted that its decision did not address fisher claims and their possible effect on cfi constructive trust.
in december,the district court granted summary judgment to both biopure and cfi against fisher.as to biopure motion for summary judgment,the court found that fisher could only assert claims against biopure in his capacity as a partner to the joint venture.but because any rights that the joint venture might have had against biopure were transferred to cfi by way of the july judgment,fisher was now precluded from suing on these rights directly.as to cfi motion for summary judgment,the court held that any claim fisher had to a constructive trust over the biopure contract rights was trumped by cfi claim to such trust.the court reasoned that a s between victims of a fraud who are unrelated to the person responsible for the fraud and a partner of the defrauder,even one who may have himself been victimized,it is clearly fair to impute the fraud to the latter.
in cfi,we heard appeals from the july and december summary judgment orders.trainor originally appealed the july judgment,but voluntarily dismissed his appeal early in the appellate process.fisher also appealed the july judgment,but belatedly and in a manner that prevented proper briefing.we declined to relieve fisher of his errors and thus let the july judgment stand.cfi,at.
our disposition of the appeal of the december judgment was more complex.we found that we lacked jurisdiction to review the judgment because it had been prematurely certified as final the claims it concerned so overlapped with claims still pending below as to make final certification inappropriate under.b.id.we found such overlap was traceable,inter alia,to a claim fisher had not presented until appellate oral argument fisher claimed that his labors in guatemala constituted a contribution to the value of the biopure contract rights untainted by trainor fraud on cfi.such sweat equity,we noted,possibly entitled him to a proportionate share of cfi constructive trust over those rights,if he could overcome his waiver of the claim.however,we declined to determine whether fisher should be relieved from his waiver.instead,we instructed the district court to make such determination on remand after further development of the factual record.that determination,we advised,would turn on whether fisher sweat equity argument was so compelling as virtually to ensure his success,and whether failure to address it would result in a gross miscarriage of particular by leaving cfi with a gross windfall,insofar as the value of the biopure contract rights which it held greatly exceeded its losses resulting from trainor fraud.id.at.on remand,the district court developed the factual record as we instructed,reopening discovery to allow fisher to adduce evidence of his sweat equity and the value of the biopure contract rights.
meanwhile,in december,cfi settled its claims against biopure,effectively liquidating its constructive trust over the biopure contract rights.the settlement agreement calls for biopure to pay cfi approximately million plus reimbursing cfi for the approximately million trainor stole from it and used in the biopure venture.
in february,the district court denied fisher request to be relieved from his waiver,finding that fisher sweat equity contributions to the biopure venture were minimal and that in any event cfi had reaped no windfall from the constructive trust.it also observed that,since this court ruling in cfi,many of the claims that were pending at that time had by now been either settled or dismissed.the only claims still pending before the district court were fisher claims against trainor and related counterclaims trainor has made against fisher and as to these pending claims,the district court found no overlap with the claims adjudicated in the december judgment.accordingly,the court recertified the december judgment as final.
we begin by addressing the propriety of the district court recertification of the december judgment,on which our jurisdiction to review the judgment depends.in cfi,our finding of an impermissible overlap between claims on appeal from the december judgment and claims still pending before the district court rested on the following factors.first,all parties on appeal still had claims pending below,and final certification is particularly suspect in such circumstances.second,biopure pending fraud and racketeering claims against fisher and cfi pending claims against biopure overlapped with claims on appeal from the december judgment,in that they all touched on trainor fraud on cfi and fisher culpability for it.third,fisher pending claims against trainor potentially overlapped with the claims on appeal from the december judgment in that both concerned fisher sweat equity contribution to the biopure venture that overlap depended,however,on whether fisher should be allowed to raise the sweat equity argument despite his earlier failure to do so.
since our remand,each of these barriers to final certification has been eliminated.biopure and cfi,having settled or dismissed all of their claims that were pending at the time of our earlier decision,are no longer parties to any claims presently pending before the district court.thus there are no longer any overlaps traceable to their claims.fisher still has claims pending against trainor in which fisher sweat equity may be an issue but given that the district court declined to relieve fisher from his waiver of the sweat equity argument,the potential overlap we feared in cfi has not been realized hence we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in recertifying the december judgment,and that the judgment is properly before us on appeal.
the appeal presents two questions first,whether fisher has any claims remaining against biopure second,whether fisher is entitled to any portion of the constructive trust awarded cfi over the biopure contract rights.our review of the district court summary judgment on these questions is de novo.see thomas eastman kodak,cir,cert.denied,d.the law of massachusetts governs 
claims against biopure 
fisher leading claim against biopure on appeal is for breach of contract.fisher claims that the term sheet between balfour and biopure was not a draft agreement later superceded by the biopure contract,but rather is a binding agreement by itself,and that biopure is in breach by refusing to recognize fisher rights under it 
the problem with fisher claim is that,as the district court held,at this point in the litigation any contract rights arising out of fisher joint venture with trainor belong to cfi.regardless of whether those rights derive from the term sheet or the biopure contract,the point of the district court july judgment was to grant cfi a constructive trust over those rights,because they had been acquired with funds defrauded from cfi.the july judgment did leave fisher room to claim a stake to cfi constructive trust,and we consider his claims on that point below but unless and until he succeeds on those claims,only cfi has the right to recover under any rights against biopure arising from the joint venture.
apparently recognizing this obstacle to suit,fisher obscurely claims in the alternative that he never entered into any contract with biopure as part of a joint venture with trainor.rather,he says,he entered into his own contract with biopure in the form of the term sheet,while trainor contracted with biopure separately.thus,he concludes,his is an independent claim he claims rights against biopure wholly independent from any rights acquired by trainor with tainted funds,and hence wholly independent from the rights granted cfi in the july judgment.
this rank revisionism can be quickly dismissed.throughout the course of the litigation,fisher has maintained that the term sheet was negotiated not on his personal behalf,but on behalf of his joint venture with trainor.not only did fisher state in his complaint that fisher and trainor agreed that they would use balfour as a vehicle for their transaction with biopure,and that the term sheet was negotiated with balfour being used on behalf of the joint venture,but fisher later swore to the same in a affidavit,and again in the trial proceedings 
thus fisher can not claim to have entered any independent contract with biopure.if the term sheet was a binding contract,it was entered into jointly by fisher and trainor,and the fact remains that whatever rights the joint venture acquired it acquired with funds trainor defrauded from cfi.consequently,fisher can not escape the reach of the july judgment,which granted to cfi any rights so acquired.the district court grant of summary judgment on fisher claims against biopure was thus not in error.
claims to cfi constructive trust 
we turn next to fisher claim to a portion of cfi constructive trust.fisher claim is.first,he argues that as an equal partner in the biopure venture,he is entitled to share in the fruits of the venture,namely,the biopure contract rights.this is so,fisher maintains,even to the extent that the rights were acquired with funds trainor defrauded from cfi,because fisher was at all relevant times innocent of the fraud.second,fisher raises the argument he earlier waived even assuming he has no claim to the fruits of the joint venture insofar as they are tainted by trainor fraud,he still has a claim to any untainted portion,he still has a claim to the extent that they were acquired through his own sweat equity.
as to fisher first argument,the applicable legal principles are clear when each is taken in isolation what is difficult to see at first blush is how those principles intersect.first,it is clear that if trainor had never defrauded cfi,but rather had only defrauded fisher by cutting him out of the biopure contract,then fisher would be entitled to impose a constructive trust on the contract rights on behalf of the joint venture,securing his share in the rights.for where a partner usurps a benefit properly belonging to the partnership,he holds it in trust for the partnership,so that any innocent partner is put as nearly as possible in the same position which he would have occupied if there had been no wrongdoing.meehan shaughnessy,quoting shulkin shulkin.
second,it is clear that if trainor had never been fisher,but rather had only defrauded cfi and later entered the biopure venture wholly on his own,then cfi would be entitled to impose a constructive trust on the biopure contract rights in their entirety.for where one person wrongfully takes the property of another and exchanges it for other property,the wronged party is generally entitled to assert a constructive trust over the property received in exchange.see austin scott william fratcher,scott on trusts,at ed.moreover,it is undisputed that all of trainor contributions to the biopure venture consisted of funds tainted by his fraud on cfi so trainor could have no claim to any untainted portion of the biopure contract rights.id,at explaining that where wrongdoer acquires property with both tainted and untainted funds,wronged party is entitled only to a share of the proper
