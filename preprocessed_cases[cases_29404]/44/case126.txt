factual background 
atlantech was a dealer of aircraft lcd displays and apc was its primary product supplier.pursuant to an august agreement,atlantech was the exclusive vendor to ulyanovsk instrument manufacturing design bureau uimdb,which integrated the displays into its own product for use in aircraft instrument panels.on december,apc,operating at the time as a division of universal,entered into a memorandum of agreement with atlantech for the sale of amlcd displays moa.at the same time,apc and atlantech reached a non circumvention agreement nca preventing apc from conducting direct business with uimdb for two years after the last completed transaction between apc and atlantech.
the moa required apc to support the product through december,support agreement the parties dispute the meaning of the word support in the context of this provision.the support agreement further required apc to maintain data warehouse documents recording the intellectual property necessary for the production and repair of the displays.in the event that apc discontinued the product,the support agreement obligated apc to provide those documents to atlantech.the moa also exempted defendants from liability for consequential,incidental,indirect,special or punitive damages,including lost profits and cost of replacement goods.
apc stopped producing displays in.to obtain form,fit,and function replacements for the discontinued model,atlantech purchased two hundred displays in february purchase order.apc did not deliver any displays under the purchase order.under a separate purchase agreement,apc eventually did deliver fifteen displays.according to subsequent communications between atlantech and apc,these displays did not function properly.
in april,atlantech,invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,filed an action in the district court of massachusetts against apc for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.later that year,it voluntarily dismissed the complaint.in january,apc sold its assets to apc acquisition.at the same time,apc,apc acquisition,and universal agreed among themselves not to sell any further product to atlantech without obtaining either a release from atlantech of all liability or the written consent of the three parties to the agreement.over the course of and,apc acquisition,in violation of the moa,sold sixteen display units to a thirdparty vendor,knowing that it intended to develop business with uimdb.
ii.procedural history 
this case has followed a convoluted course,and in order to place the parties arguments in context it is necessary to trace its procedural path in some detail.on february,atlantech filed a complaint against defendants alleging breach of warranty,breach of the moa,breach of the purchase order,and negligent misrepresentation.after two amendments to the complaint,the parties filed for summary judgment.judge tauro,in an order dated march,march order,granted partial summary judgment in favor of atlantech.while that order decided a number of issues,it left others unresolved.among the issues it addressed,judge tauro held that apc was in breach of its obligations under the data warehouse documents provision and granted injunctive relief to atlantech requiring that apc provide it with the data warehouse documents.
despite the presence of unresolved issues,judge tauro entered judgment in favor of atlantech,effectively closing the case.a series of motions to reopen and appeals followed,culminating in this court order dated may,may order,which left in place the injunctive relief related to the data warehouse documents and otherwise vacated the march order.
on remand,the case was reassigned to judge woodlock.two further amendments to the complaint followed.atlantech filed the final version,the fourth amended complaint,on june,alleging seven counts breach of contract warranty moa,moa,and moa count i breach of contract support and product availability moa,moa,moa,and purchase order count ii breach of contract data warehouse documents moa,moa,and moa count iii breach of contract purchase order count iv negligent misrepresentation count v intentional interference with contractual relations count vi and breach of contract nca count vii.thereafter,the district court resolved pending for summary judgment and ruled in favor of defendants on counts iii,v,and vi.
an jury trial began june.on the seventh trial day,the court determined that it would be expeditious for the jury to resolve a set of preliminary questions while the court heard arguments regarding directed verdict motions.the judge conferred extensively with trial counsel at that point to fashion three questions for an interim verdict slip.on the morning of the eighth day the court instructed the jury on those preliminary questions and sent them to deliberate while the court dealt with the directed verdict motions.
eventually,the judge indicated that he would grant a directed verdict in favor of defendants on counts i,v,and vi,and portions of count ii involving a purchase order that is not at issue on this appeal.he also explained that he was keeping alive the count iii to resolve on the papers and the evidence that is presented here.the judge also engaged trial counsel in an extensive discussion of what additional questions remained for the jury to decide.
thereafter the jury was given a second verdict slip with questions regarding damages under count iv,breach of the purchase order,and count vii,breach of the nca.on these counts,the jury awarded atlantech in damages.
after dismissing the jury,the court instructed the parties to file a joint status report delineating the issues that remained to be resolved.the parties filed their report on july,and atlantech subsequently filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on defendants alleged breach of the moa support agreement an unresolved issue remaining under count ii.the court denied that motion and ordered the parties to frame this case for final resolution by means of summary judgment motions in the wake of trial and the record as it existed as of trial.
on may,atlantech filed a motion for summary judgment seeking damages for breach of the support agreement,prejudgment interest on all claims,and attorney fees.defendants filed motions for a directed verdict or,in the alternative,for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,asking the court to construe the support agreement in their favor and seeking a reduction in the jury award of damages for breach of the purchase agreement.on march,the court found that defendants were not liable for breach of the support agreement,denied prejudgment interest,awarded atlantech in fees and expenses,and upheld the jury award of damages for breach of the purchase agreement march order.the parties appeal from the district court march order.
iii.analysis 
before us on appeal are three broad issues whether defendants are liable to atlantech for damages under the terms of the moa support agreement whether atlantech is entitled to prejudgment interest and whether the district court erred in upholding the jury award of damages for breach of the purchase agreement 
moa support agreement 
in section of the support agreement,entitled length of product availability,apc agreed to support original product through december.at that point the product may be discontinued.the district court held that this provision was an enforceable agreement obligating defendants to hold open the opportunity for atlantech to buy form,fit,and function replacements for the displays for a period of ten years.
nevertheless,the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants on this claim.proceeding under a theory of anticipatory repudiation,atlantech argued that defendants breached the support agreement by agreeing in january to discontinue sales to atlantech,unless atlantech provided them with a release from liability or they all consented.a claim for anticipatory repudiation requires an absolute and unqualified refusal to perform a contract.textile rubber chem,thermo flex,the district court found that there was nothing absolute or unqualified about the defendants refusal to perform under the contract,because they could have all consented to continue sales.accordingly,it found no breach of the agreement as a matter of law.the district court also found that atlantech could not prove the damages it sought,which were based on lost profits as a measure of direct damages.the court held that t here is nothing inherent in the bargain sufficient to provide reliable numbers,and this precludes atlantech from recovering lost profits.
on appeal,the parties dispute numerous issues with respect to the alleged breach of the support agreement whether the mandate rule requires judgment in favor of atlantech,whether the support agreement is an enforceable contract,the nature and scope of defendants obligations under the support agreement,whether defendants repudiated or otherwise breached the support agreement,and whether atlantech can prove direct damages related to the alleged repudiation.we can quickly dispense with atlantech argument for the application of the mandate rule.of the remaining arguments,only one requires our attention at this stage.we agree with the district court that atlantech did not prove direct damages resulting from the alleged repudiation,and that the plain terms of the contract preclude recovery for other types of damages.therefore the claim fails as a matter of law.because this issue is dispositive,we need not resolve the other disputes related to the support agreement.
mandate rule 
a n appellate court mandate controls all issues that were actually considered and decided by the appellate court,or as were necessarily inferred from the disposition on appeal.kashner davidson sec.mscisz,cir quoting nlrb goodless,cir internal quotation marks omitted.i ssues that were not decided by the appellate court are not affected by the mandate.id.quoting de jesús mangual rodríguez,cir alteration in original.
atlantech argues that judge tauro march order held that apc breached the support agreement,and that this court subsequently affirmed that holding.but this court may order expressly vacated the march order in part,leaving in place only the injunction related to the data warehouse documents.all that can be necessarily inferred from the may order is that defendants breached the provision of the support agreement requiring them to turn over the data warehouse documents.the may order did not decide the question currently before us whether defendants breached section of the support agreement.therefore,the mandate rule does not apply.
in a breach of contract case,the burden is on the plaintiff to show both the breach and the damage.adamson owens.dev.atlantech does not dispute that it contractually waived the right to seek consequential damages,including lost profits.it argues,however,that lost profits can serve as a measure of direct damages.it also offers two alternate measures of damages.
at trial,atlantech attempted to prove lost profits by showing past sales to uimdb as well as evidence of uimdb intent to buy certain quantities in the future.it relied on the prices at which it bought and sold the displays at the time the parties entered into the moa.but as the district court observed,the support agreement itself does not prescribe any particular price or quantity for future sales,other than providing that prices must be in line with those from past sales.under these circumstances the district court found the evidence offered by atlantech too speculative,because t here is nothing inherent in the bargain when the parties entered into the moa in sufficient to provide reliable numbers.we agree with the district court.
under georgia law,the term lost profits refers to two distinct concepts 
consequential damages,which may include profits which might accrue collaterally as a result of the contract performance,are a separate concept from direct damages,which may include profits necessarily inherent in the contract.thus there are two types of lost profits lost profits which are direct damages and represent the benefit of the bargain such as a general contractor suing for the remainder of the contract price less his saved expenses,and lost profits which are indirect or consequential damages such as what the user of the mri would lose if the machine were not working and he was unable to perform diagnostic services for several patients.
imaging.int l,magnetic resonance plus,internal citation omitted.another court observed that profits necessarily inherent in the contract are always provable.franklin demico.
the question here is whether the damages atlantech seeks to prove are necessarily inherent in the contract.we find that they are not,because they depend on contingencies beyond the terms of the contract itself.the brief examples offered by the court in imaging systems are instructive.when a general contractor sues for its remaining contract price less saved expenses,the damages do not depend on the future action of any third party they are determined by the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the breach.thus,they are always provable in the sense that they do not require evidence of what some other party might have done.the damages suffered by the doctor with a malfunctioning mri machine depend on how many patients one might have seen if the machine were working.the doctor very well might be able to recover such damages by showing evidence of how many patients were normally seen in the past,but they would remain consequential damages.
other circuits have reached a similar understanding of the distinction between the two types of lost profits 
direct damages refer to those which the party lost from the contract itself in other words,the benefit of the bargain while consequential damages refer to economic harm beyond the immediate scope of the contract.lost profits,under appropriate circumstances,can be recoverable as a component of either and both direct and consequential damages.thus,for example,if a services contract is breached and the plaintiff anticipated a profit under the contract,those profits would be recoverable as a component of direct,benefit of the bargain damages.if that same breach had the effect of causing the plaintiff to close its doors,precluding it from performing other work for which it had contracted and from which it expected to make a profit,those lost profits might be recovered as consequential to the breach.
atl.city,llc,carter burgess consultants,app x,cir quoting penncro,sprint spectrum,cir.
the evidence that atlantech offered at trial is relevant to lost profits as consequential,not direct,damages.atlantech is seeking to show how much it would have earned selling displays to uimdb if apc had performed its obligations under the support agreement.because those damages rely on future deals with a business that is not a party to the support agreement,and are contingent on anticipated prices and demand that are not determined by the contract itself,the damages are not necessarily inherent in the contract.thus,they are consequential damages,for which defendants are not liable under the terms of the moa.
atlantech fares no better with its other theories of damages.it argues that under georgia law,atlantech may recover direct damages in an amount equal to the difference between the market price at the time the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price,less expenses saved at as a result of the breach.the obvious problem with the use of this method of measuring damages here is that there is no contract price in section of the support agreement.presumably,if apc had continued to sell displays to atlantech under the terms of the support agreement,the parties would have negotiated a price for each sal
