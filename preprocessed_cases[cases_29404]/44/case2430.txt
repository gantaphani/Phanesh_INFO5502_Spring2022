a jury in the eastern district of michigan found defendants detroit entertainment,which owns and operates the motorcity casino we refer to both as the casino,and marlene brown,one of the casino security personnel and a private security police officer with the power to arrest,liable under and under michigan law for unlawfully arresting stella romanski.defendants contend the judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted because the district court instructed the jury as a matter of law that defendants acted under color of state law at all times relevant to this case.defendants also raise other claims.in the alternative,defendants ask us to remit some of the punitive damages award or order a new trial on the issue of damages.
we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects except that we vacate the portion of the judgment comprised by the punitive damages award and remand for a remittitur of the punitive damages award,in accordance with the instructions of this opinion,or a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.the remarkable facts of this case make it indisputable that a substantial punitive damages award is warranted.defendants conduct was particularly egregious and a higher award to deter the casino from sanctioning such conduct in the future was appropriate.but an award of will just as adequately serve the interests of punishment and deterrence and fits more comfortably in the ballpark of punitive awards that have been upheld in similar cases.we therefore order a remittitur to that amount or,if romanski so chooses,a new trial on damages.
background 
on august,romanski,then years old,and her friends dorothy dombrowski and linda holman,went to defendant detroit entertainment motorcity casino in detroit,michigan,to gamble and enjoy lunch at the buffet.after a spate of unsuccessful tries at the slot machines,romanski took a walk around the gaming floor.during her walk,romanski noticed a five cent token lying in a slot machine tray.seeing no chair at the machine,she picked up the token and returned to the machine at which she had earlier played,intending to use the token there.soon a uniformed male casino employee approached and asked that she accompany him to the office.she asked why but he did not answer.romanski then noticed there were also three female casino employees,these not in uniform,surrounding her she felt she could not move.
one of these security officers was defendant marlene brown,who had been assigned to patrol the casino floor at that time.brown testified that she approached romanski,displayed her casino security badge,and began to explain it was the casino policy not to permit patrons to pick up tokens,which appeared to be abandoned,found at other slot machines,a practice known as.romanski could not have known this at the time because the casino does not post the policy anywhere.it is undisputed,therefore,that romanski did not could not have of the casino purported policy on.
according to brown,romanski became loud and belligerent,so,at the advice of brown supervisor,joetta stevenson a defendant below,brown escorted romanski to an room where brown intended to explain the policy in detail.for her part,romanski testified that brown did not detain her because of her attitude but rather because brown suspected her of theft.
it is undisputed that brown and her colleagues escorted romanski to what defendants alternately call the security office and the interview room.whatever its name,the room is small and windowless,located off the casino floor.according to romanski,once they had taken their seats,brown accused romanski of stealing the token,whereupon brown counted romanski money and removed one nickel from romanski winnings.stevenson asked romanski to turn over her social security card and driver license romanski complied and these items were photocopied.romanski was then photographed.romanski testified that she acquiesced to these requests because brown said she was a police officer,had a badge,and appeared to have handcuffs.brown admitted having presented her badge and possessing handcuffs but testified that she identified herself only as a security police officer,not as a bona fide police officer.there is no dispute that a uniformed casino security officer stood just outside the room for the duration of the questioning.
romanski was ejected from the casino for a period of months stevenson made the final decision to eject,or,romanski.the precise ground for ejecting romanski is unclear from the record.although unknown to romanski at the time,it is now undisputed that brown and some of her colleagues on the casino security staff were licensed under state law as private security police officer s.comp.laws.by virtue of being so licensed,a private security police officer has the authority to arrest a person without a warrant as set forth for public peace officers when that private security police officer is on the employer premises.the statute additionally requires that private security police officers make arrests only when they are on duty and in the full uniform of the ir employer.id.it is undisputed that brown was on duty during the events of this case.it is also undisputed that brown was not wearing the uniform worn by some of the other security guards,but defendants have never contended that this rendered brown out of uniform for purposes of indeed,defendants have conceded from the beginning that the statute applies in this case.their argument is simply that the power admittedly conferred on brown by the statute did not make her actions under color of state law.see.
brown was in charge of escorting romanski to the valet parking area of the casino,where romanski was to wait for her bus home.brown and her colleagues denied romanski request to meet her friends for lunch at the,they did not permit romanski to eat lunch at all.in addition,they did not permit romanski to enter the restroom by herself brown accompanied romanski into the restroom and waited outside the stall.at,romanski exited the valet area to board what she thought was her bus it turned out not to be but instead of returning to the valet area she ran into her friends and stayed outside.it was extremely hot and humid and dombrowski and holman persuaded romanski to return to the casino.upon entering,the three were confronted by casino employees,who directed them to return to the valet area,which is they waited there until the bus arrived.
it is undisputed that brown prepared an incident report following romanski ejection in which brown referred to romanski as a suspect.romanski introduced the casino security manual into evidence it instructs security employees to refer to patrons as suspects only if the employee arrested the patron and otherwise to refer to the patron as a subject.stevenson confirmed that this policy was in effect when romanski was ejected.finally,it is undisputed that as a matter of course,the casino notifies the michigan state police when it ejects someone the casino notified the michigan state police of romanski ejection.
as these facts reflect,defendants treatment of romanski was inexplicable and egregious.the district court aptly expressed the egregiousness of defendants conduct in its opinion denying defendants motion for summary judgment there is sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that after romanski picked up an abandoned token that using the authority vested in them by the state of her,arrested her,led her to the security office,prevented her from leaving the security office,and stole the five cents that she found from her.afterwards,they surrounded her as they threw her out of the casino,and refused to let her use the restroom by herself.defendants also prevented her from having lunch with her friends and falsely told her friends that she had stolen from them a jury could certainly exclaim outrageous.romanski detroit entertainment,d,citations omitted.indeed,a jury did make such an exclamation it found in romanski favor and made a substantial punitive damages award.
in november,romanski sued defendants motorcity casino and two employees of the casino in the circuit court of wayne county,michigan,alleging false arrest,false imprisonment,defamation,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.in an amended complaint,romanski named as defendants detroit entertainment,motorcity casino,marlene brown,gloria brown,robert edwards,and joetta stevenson,the individual defendants being the employees involved in romanski detention,questioning,and ejection from the casino.the amended complaint also included a new cause of action,namely,a claim under that defendants had violated romanski fourth amendment rights.specifically,romanski alleged that defendants,acting under color of state law,had arrested her without probable cause because the token she picked up was abandoned,not the casino property.
defendants removed the action to federal district court in the eastern district of michigan.the district court issued an order to show cause as to whether defendants conduct was under color of law for purposes of and considered the parties briefs on the issue.the court concluded that brown was acting under color of state law because she possessed the same authority to make arrests that the police enjoy.having determined that there was a proper basis for federal jurisdiction,the district court exercised its supplemental jurisdiction over romanski state law claims.
the parties conducted discovery from september through february.on march,defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.on the claim,defendants argued that they were not acting under color of state law in this case and in any event had probable cause to detain romanski.in a published decision,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment.d.the court held as a matter of law that defendants had acted under color of state law during the events of this case because brown,the defendant who initiated romanski detention,did so while on duty in her capacity as a licensed private security police officer empowered with the same arrest authority as a public police officer.id.at.the court further held that genuine factual disputes precluded summary judgment on the fourth amendment claim and romanski state law claims.id.at.
the trial began on july.at the close of romanski,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on all claims and asked the district court to reconsider its conclusion on the state action question.the district court declined to rule on the motion,reserving it for a later ruling.at the charge conference and during the parties exchange of proposed jury instructions,defendants again raised the state action question,arguing that the jury should be instructed to find as a matter of fact whether defendants were acting under color of state law.the district court disagreed and instructed the jury as follows acting under color of law in this case simply means acting in one capacity as a licensed security officer with powers to make an arrest on the casino premises.i instruct you as a matter of law that the defendants were acting under color of law at the time of this incident and you may find that this element has been established.the other issues in the case were submitted to the jury,which found the casino and brown liable on the fourth amendment wrongful arrest claim and the casino alone liable on the state law false arrest and false imprisonment claims.the jury did not find any of the defendants liable for defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress but,based on its verdict on romanski other claims,the jury awarded in compensatory damages.based exclusively on the verdict in favor of romanski on her claim,the jury awarded in punitive damages against brown,and in punitive damages against the casino.
defendants moved for a judgment not withstanding the verdict or,in the alternative,for a new trial.see.the district court denied the motion,resting largely on the reasoning expressed in its summary judgment ruling.the casino and brown the only defendants found liable by the jury brought this timely appeal.they argue that it was improper for the district court to hold they were state actors as a matter of law and accordingly seek either a new trial or judgment in their favor on the claim in connection with romanksi claim that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest her,the district court gave an erroneous jury instruction on the issue of whether the token was abandoned apparently in connection only with defendants own desire for a jury instruction on a purported common law right of private businesses to detain patrons suspected of theft,the district court erroneously declined to accept defendants proposed instruction and the punitive damages award,imposed exclusively on the basis of the jury finding of liability under,is so excessive that it does not comport with due process.we consider each claim in turn.
ii.discussion 
state action 
section makes liable only those who,while acting under color of state law,deprive another of a right secured by the constitution or federal law.flagg,brooks,d chapman higbee,cir en banc wolotsky huhn,cir.a private actor acts under color of state law when its conduct is fairly attributable to the state.lugar edmondson oil,d.the supreme court has developed three tests for determining the existence of state action in a particular case the public function test,the state compulsion test,and the symbiotic relationship or nexus test.chapman,at citing wolotsky,at.see west atkins,d public function flagg,at.same adickes kress,d state compulsion test burton wilmington parking,d symbiotic relationship or nexus test.
the district court concluded that brown and any of her colleagues similarly licensed as private security police officers pursuant to were state actors under the public function test.d at.consistent with this holding,the district court took the state action issue out of the case,granting in effect judgment as a matter of law to romanski on that issue.consequently,we review the state action aspect of the district court decision de novo and view all facts in the light most favorable to defendants.united states alpine,cir vance spencer county pub.sch,cir.
under the public function test,a private entity is said to be performing a public function if it is exercising powers traditionally reserved to the state,such as holding elections,taking private property under the eminent domain power,or operating a town.see flagg,at.holding elections jackson metropolitan edison,d exercising eminent domain marsh alabama.operating a town.the supreme court has expressly left open the question whether and under what circumstances private police officers may be said to perform a public function for purposes of.flagg,at.nevertheless,as the district court observed,there is a growing body of case law to consult for guidance on this question.
for example,in a decision deemed by both parties and the district court to bear directly on the issue presented in this case,the seventh circuit held that private police officers licensed to make arrests could be state actors under the public function test.payton,cir.to be sure,payton was an appeal of a dismissal pursuant to.b,but we think this distinction is of little relevance since the crucial fact in that to be true there but indisputable that by virtue of their status as special police officers,licensed by the city of chicago,the defendants enjoyed virtually the same power as public police officers.id.at.indeed,the defendants in payton operated under an ordinance which provided that special police officers licensed under it shall possess the powers of the regular police patrol at the places for which they are respectively appointed or in the line of duty for which they are engaged.id.at quoting chicago city code.
this broad delegation of power,the seventh circuit reasoned,distinguished payton from an earlier case in which the court had held that a private security guard endowed with more limited powers was not a state actor.see wade byles,cir.the defendant in wade was permitted to carry a handgun and to use deadly force in but could arrest someone only for trespass pending the arrival of the police and could exercise these powers only in the lobbies of properties owned by the public housing authority for which he worked.id.at.the defendant was not a state actor because,as the court put it in payton,none of these powers had been exclusively reserved to the arrests and the rights to carry handguns and use them in are available to individuals outside of the law enforcement community.payton,at citing wade,at.
payton illustrates a line that has been drawn in the case law.the line divides cases in which a private actor exercises a power traditionally reserved to the state,but not exclusively reserved to it,the common law shopkeeper privilege,from cases in which a private actor exercises a power exclusively reserved to the state,the police power.where private security guards are endowed by law with plenary police powers such that they are de facto police officers,they may qualify as state actors under the public function test.see payton,at henderson fisher,cir per curiam university policemen with plenary police authority throughout the university campus rojas alexander store.new york city special patrolman with plenary police authority patrolling a department store.the rationale of these cases is that when the state delegates a power traditionally reserved to it police private actors in order that they may provide police services to institutions that need it,a plaintiff ability to claim relief under for abuses of that power should be unaffected.payton,at henderson,at.
on the other side of the line illustrated by payton are cases in which the private defendants have some powers but not plenary police authority.see wade,at johnson larabida children hospital,cir hospital security guards who had authority to patrol and eject people but not to carry guns and who had to call the police if someone became hostile and belligerent.a subset of these cases are cases in which a private institution security employees have been dispatched to protect the institution interests or enforce its policies.the canonical example here is when a store avails itself of the common law shopkeeper privilege,the privilege at issue in this court en banc decision in chapman higbee,and the fifth circuit case upon which chapman relied.see chapman,at discussing white scrivner,cir.
like the district court,we think this case falls on the payton side of the line.it is undisputed that brown and some of her colleagues were private security police officers licensed under.this means that brown qualifications for being so licensed were vetted by michigan department of state police,id,and that brown was subject to certain statutes administered by that department.id.see.more critical for present purposes are the undisputed facts that brown was on duty and on the casino premises at all times relevant to this case.these undisputed facts lead to an inescapable conclusion of,that at all times relevant to this case,brown ha d the authority to arrest a person without a warrant as set forth for public peace officers.one consequence of brown possession of this authority,the authority to make arrests at one discretion and for any offenses,is clear at all times relevant to this case,brown was a state actor as a matter of law 
unlike the common law privileges at issue in wade the use of deadly force in,the right to detain for trespass,and the right to carry a weapon and chapman the shopkeeper privilege,which may be invoked by any citizen under appropriate circumstances,the plenary arrest power enjoyed by private security police officers licensed pursuant to is a power traditionally reserved to the state alone see payton,at henderson,at rojas.at thompson mccoy.see also united states hoffman,cir holding that private railroad police possessing the same powers as public police officers were state actors.screws united states.observing that one has the power to arrest only when one is clothed with the authority of state law citation omitted rodriguez smithfield packing,cir observing that the police function is one of the most basic functions of government and an arrest is the function most commonly associated with the police quoting foley connelie,d.
defendants contend that wade ought to control here because,as in that case,private security police officers power to make arrests is subject to spatial or geographic limits.see.but the spatial or geographic limitation in wade was prohibited housing authority security guards from exercising their already minimal powers anywhere except in the lobbies of buildings operated by the housing authority.see wade,at.by contrast,invests private security police officers with full arrest authority on the entirety of their employer premises,which makes this case distinguishable from wade and similar to payton and henderson,each of which involved a statute or ordinance that imposed or contemplated some spatial or geographic limits on the private defendants police powers.see payton,at special police officers shall possess the powers of the regular police patrol at the places for which they are respectively appointed emphasis added citation omitted henderson,at authority of the university police was limited to the university campus in question.furthermore,as we have discussed,private security police officers in michigan are endowed with plenary arrest authority,see,while the defendant in wade was permitted to exercise only what were in effect citizens arrests.wade,at see also payton,at.
finally,we address defendants repeated representation that,although empowered to make arrests under,brown and the other casino employees licensed under the statute are,as a matter of casino policy,not permitted to exercise this statutory authority to effectuate arrests.for this argument defendants again rely on wade,in which the very document that was the source of the defendant powers,his contract with the public housing authority,at the same time imposed profound limits on those powers.see wade,at.here the source of brown power to make arrests is a statute that includes no qualitative limits on that power,so wade is inapplicable.defendants do not cite a case in which a private security officer licensed to make arrests as under was held not to be a state actor on the ground that the officer employer substantially circumscribed the arrest power conferred on the officer by having been licensed.the only arguable support we have found for defendants argument is the concurring opinion in payton,in which judge ripple opined that while for pleading purposes the plaintiff claim of state action was viable,it might ultimately fail because f urther development of the record might well establish that the guards responsibilities were significantly circumscribed by their employer and that they performed functions quite narrow in scope at ripple,concurring.
in this case,whatever development of the record occurred did not reveal circumscriptions of brown authority,let alone circumscriptions of the sort contemplated by judge ripple in payton.indeed,it is noteworthy that defendants did not even make this argument at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings,arguing instead that while brown and some of her colleagues do have the power to make arrests,brown did not use it in this case.it is not surprising then,that in their brief to this court,defendants do not offer a single citation to the record in support of the contention that brown arrest authority was substantially circumscribed.furthermore,the jury found that defendants had in fact arrested romanski and this aspect of the judgment is not on appeal defendants jury instruction claim goes to whether probable cause existed,not whether an arrest occurred.under these circumstances,we decline defendants invitation to look past express grant of plenary arrest authority to private security police officers.we similarly find unpersuasive the representation made on appeal that brown was not acting pursuant to her authority when she initiated the unlawful arrest of romanski,but rather was merely protecting the casino,defendants maintain,that was more in the nature exercising the shopkeeper privilege.see,chapman,at.quite apart from the question whether michigan version of the shopkeeper privilege even applies to casinos see and our discussion in the next section there is no evidence in the record that could support the narrative defendants urge us to adopt.indeed,all of the evidence was to the contrary brown was employed by the casino as a private security police officer and was on duty in that capacity when she initiated the detention of romanski.
consistent with the seventh circuit approach in wade and payton,we have focused on the specific powers that brown,in her capacity as an and duly licensed private security police officer,had at her disposal.see payton,at wade,at.because at least one of these powers,the plenary arrest power,is traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state,jackson metropolitan edison,at,and because it is undisputed that brown was in fact duly licensed under and was in fact on duty at all times relevant to this case,the district court correctly held that brown was a state actor as a matter of law 
jury instructions 
defendants also contend that two of the district court jury instructions were erroneous.we must review jury instructions as a whole to determine if they adequately inform the jury of the relevant considerations and provide a basis in law for aiding the jury in reaching its decision.argentine united steelworkers of america,cir quoting jones consolidated rail,cir.accordingly,we will reverse a jury verdict on account of instructional error only in situations where the instruction,viewed as a whole is confusing,misleading,and prejudicial.id.quoting barnes fiberglas,cir.applying these standards,we find no error with respect to the two instructions at issue in this appeal.
the first instruction to which defendants object related to whether they had probable cause to arrest romanski.defendants apparently argued that they had probable cause to believe romanski had stolen the five cent token from the casino,that the token was not abandoned when romanski took it into her possession.although the district court did conclude at the summary judgment stage that there was a bona fide jury question as to whether the token was abandoned,it nevertheless observed that there is no other likely explanation for the token being in the tray of the slot machine.d at.the district court statement is an apt reflection of the record,which contains not even a scintilla of evidence supporting defendants contention that the token was the casino property rather than abandoned by a prior player at the slot machine.nor did defendants come forward with a basis in michigan law for their assertion that the token became the casino property once the prior player departed.the general rule,as noted by the district court,is that playing a slot machine is the commencement of an aleatory contract between the player and the casino.in the event the player wins a round,the casino loses its legal right to the property,and the player gains that right.d at citing restatement second,contracts cmt.c.
against this backdrop,we can not say the district court erred when it instructed the jury that 
this case,as we all know,involves a token,a five cent token.the plaintiff as the finder of a lost or abandoned token,has superior title to that token than does the motor city casino.in determining whether the token was lost or abandoned,you are to use your common sense and consider whether there was any other rational circumstance for that token to be in that tray.the only person who has a superior right to that token other than the plaintiff,is the person who lost it or the person who abandoned it.
we must also note the patent insignificance of a five cent token.assuming for the moment that defendants genuinely suspected romanski of theft it appears from the record that the real motive for the poor treatment of romanski may have been her attitude,defendants decision to deal with the situation by dispatching a team of security least one of whom was in effect a police detain and interrogate romanski offends the venerable maxim de minimis non curat lex the law cares not for trifles.wisconsin of revenue william wrigley,d citing cases.under the circumstances of this case,the district court instruction on abandonment was not confusing,misleading,or prejudicial.see argentine,at.
defendants second jury instruction claim relates to two instructions it proposed but the district court rejected.defendants first requested the district court to instruct the jury that a private business owner has the right to protect its business interests and property and may detain a patron suspected of theft.the district court declined to adopt this proposed instruction on the ground that the authority cited by defendants in support of it related only to the common law shopkeeper privilege to detain a patron suspected of privilege,the district court reasoned,that michigan law does not extend to casinos.
this proposed instruction was not material to an issue in the case.the jury was instructed that romanski false arrest claim depended on proof that some legal justification usually probable cause for the detention was lacking,see lewis farmer jack,and,similarly,that her claim depended on proof that probable cause was lacking.the shopkeeper right to detain suspected thieves,assuming for the moment that it applies to casinos,is a cognizable defense only where there is probable cause that a theft occurred.the codification of michigan shopkeeper privilege.were it otherwise,shopkeepers who invoked the privilege would be insulated from liability for false arrest.in short,contrary to defendants requested instruction,neither shopkeepers nor casino proprietors enjoy an absolute privilege to detain patrons.it is clear,therefore,that the district court instructions on probable cause and false arrest properly explained the crux of any privilege the casino might enjoy.to the extent that defendants proposed the instruction in connection with the state action question,we have already held that in this case the casino employed brown in her capacity as an private security police officer,not as a security guard charged merely with protecting the casino property.
the second instruction sought by instruction to the effect that michigan permits a casino to eject a patron for any reason it deems likewise immaterial to the issues in the case we have no trouble,therefore,concluding that the district court properly rejected it.the gravamen of romanski claim for relief is not that she was ejected but rather that she was arrested without probable cause,which is why she sued for false arrest and unlawful arrest,the latter under.accordingly,romanski claim for relief goes principally to defendants treatment of her before she was ejected from the casino and,it must be remembered,it is that conduct alone for which the jury held defendants liable.we see no error in the district court decision to reject this proposed instruction.
amount of the punitive damages award 
the casino appeals the jury assessment of in punitive damages against it on the ground that the amount is unconstitutionally excessive.whether a punitive damages award is so excessive as to offend due process depends on our assessment of the three guideposts first enunciated in bmw of north america,gore,d the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,the punitive award ratio to the compensatory award,and sanctions for comparable misconduct.id.at.we conduct de novo review of a trial court application of these guideposts to the jury award.state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d citing cooper,leatherman tool group,d.as the supreme court recently said exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an application of law,rather than a decisionmaker caprice.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see gore,at.
reprehensibility 
the supreme court has said that t he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct.campbell,at.quoting gore,at.we must determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether 
the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.
id.citing gore,at.merely because one of these factors is satisfied in a given case does not mean the punitive damages award is constitutionally unassailable however,the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.id.in conducting our review of the punitive damages award,we must presume that a plaintiff compensatory award made her whole for her injuries.id.consistent with the purpose of punitive damages,see gore,at.citing cases,such damages should only be awarded if the defendant culpability,after having paid compensatory damages,is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.campbell,at.
in conducting its reprehensibility analysis,the district court concluded that the harm caused by the casino was primarily physical,rather than economic.the basis for this conclusion was the fact that romanski testified that she felt sick,embarrassed,humiliated,intimidated and scared.romanski economic losses totaled,the combined value of the lunch ticket revoked by the casino and the token the casino seized.the remaining of the compensatory award was to make romanski whole for the emotional distress she suffered as a result of defendants conduct.we think the district court was generally correct to describe romanski harm as primarily physical in character.although she did not suffer actual physical injury,the jury could reasonably infer from the peculiar circumstances of romanski detention and process initiated on the casino floor in front of patrons by a team of four security the threat of physical force was apparent.indeed,there was testimony that brown threatened romanski and it is undisputed that brown had handcuffs at her disposal in addition,it appears undisputed,so far as we can discern,that brown and perhaps another member of the security staff accused romanski of theft.in sum,we agree with the second circuit conclusion in a similar case that a defendant conduct can be highly reprehensible without being actually violent.see lee edwards,cir although the defendant police officer did not use force in maliciously prosecuting the plaintiff,the defendant invocation of state power to deprive the plaintiff of his rights presented an element of real and threatened force that could have aroused the jury.
more important than the harm romanski suffered,that harm being of such a type that the label physical rather than economic befits it,is the fundamental nature of defendants conduct in this case.as we indicated at the outset,defendants treated romanski in an inexplicable and egregious way.indeed,on this record a jury could reasonably infer that brown acted with intentional malice and not mere accident.campbell,at.this is not a case of mistaken identity,nor one in which a law enforcement officer reasonably misread the circumstances.defendants admit that romanski was targeted because she picked up a five cent token.whether brown subsequently detained romanski on suspicion of theft or because romanski attitude perturbed brown,the crucial point for reprehensibility purposes is that the detention itself and the manner in which it was carried,by a team of four security personnel surrounding so egregious in light of the circumstances that malice naturally comes to mind.what other motivation,a reasonable observer might ask,would cause brown and her colleagues to detain and interrogate a woman in a windowless room over five cents this is especially true in light of the jury conclusion that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest romanski.see stamathis flying j,cir a s to the reprehensibility of the act,we can not ignore that the jury found that the defendants did not have probable cause.williams kaufman county,cir observing that a strip search obviously conducted without probable cause evidenced reckless indifference toward the constitutional rights of plaintiffs and hence was strong evidence of reprehensibility.the fact that the defendants knew that the casino own patrons had not been provided with notice of the prohibition only makes the defendants conduct more reprehensible.
but defendants remarkable abuse of power did not end there.it is undisputed that the casino revoked romanski lunch ticket and,having been ejected,she was not permitted to eat anywhere in the casino.in other words,the rather inhospitable outside it was humid and over degrees was the romanski only choice for lunch.it is further undisputed that defendants refused to allow romanski to enter the restroom by herself instead,defendants callously forced her to endure the indignity of having brown stand guard outside the stall.this is without question evidence of malice and of a conscious disregard for romanski and hence is probative of reprehensibility.gore,at.campbell,at.finally,we must note one facet of the casino behavior that is particularly deserving of condemnation and further indicative of malice,namely,that it dispatched someone who was in effect a police officer,with all the authority that that implies.apparently,the casino was not content to have an ordinary security without the power to make inform romanski of the purported policy and leave it at that.there is,consequently,a troubling element of gratuitousness in defendants conduct.
in closing our discussion of reprehensibility,we find it appropriate to quote the district court again,this time from its opinion denying defendants motion for a new trial or a remittitur t his case was not about the loss of a token or a meal ticket it was about romanski right not to be unreasonably seized and unreasonably detained defendants acted with at least indifference to the health or safety of romanski,an elderly woman.after defendant brown observed romanski play the token,romanski was surrounded by four security guards,led up to the security office,informed she had committed a crime,photographed,and reported to the state police t he court finds the conduct of defendant motorcity employees to be particularly reprehensible.
in sum,while there is no evidence of similar misconduct in the past on the casino part,see gore,at.campbell,at,it is clear in this case that the reprehensibility guidepost weighs in favor of a substantial punitive damages award.
the second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff.gore,at.citations omitted.when considered against the broad spectrum of civil cases,the ratio in this case to is unusually high and the compensatory damages award is unusually low.compare gore,at.rejecting a ratio where the compensatory award was campbell,at.rejecting a ratio where the compensatory award was million.but this is a case in which the basis for the punitive damages award was the plaintiff unlawful arrest and the plaintiff economic injury was so minimal as to be essentially nominal.the supreme court cases on the ratio component of the excessiveness involved substantial compensatory damages awards for economic and measurable noneconomic harm are therefore of limited relevance.see lee,at.
this court and other courts have recognized that where injuries are without a ready monetary value,such as invasions of constitutional rights unaccompanied by physical injury or other compensable harm,higher ratios between the compensatory or nominal award and the punitive award are to be expected.argentine united steel workers of,clc,cir sustaining a to ratio,and thus a punitive award,where injury was a national union sustained campaign of retaliation against a local branch because some of its members expressed disagreement with a bargaining agreement see also dean olibas,cir sustaining a to ratio,and thus a punitive award,where the unlawful arrest of the plaintiff caused him primarily a kind of harm not measurable in monetary terms.indeed,the second circuit has reasoned,we think correctly,that in cases where the compensatory award is very low or nominal,any appreciable exemplary award would produce a ratio that would appear excessive by this measure.lee,at see also fabri united technologies,cir disorbo hoy,cir.the fifth circuit also adheres to this uncontroversial view.see williams,at.
these decisions in the circuits are based as much on intuition as on the only plausible interpretation of crucial dicta in gore and campbell to wit,as the court said in the first of those cases low awards of compensatory damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards,if,for example,a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.a higher ratio may also be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine.gore,at.read in conjunction with the court consistent rejection of a categorical approach to evaluating the constitutionality of punitive damages awards,campbell,at,these pronouncements about the effect,in appropriate cases,of a low or nominal compensatory award on the excessiveness inquiry are weighty indeed.see,argentine,at lee,at.
consistent with these principles,we think that to determine whether the punitive award in this case is within constitutional limits,the best approach is to compare it to punitive awards examined by courts in other civil rights cases to find limits and proportions.lee,at see also disorbo,at williams,at.this approach is necessarily unscientific but aids us in identifying a ballpark within which to evaluate the award at issue here.
we know of only one prior case in which we considered the constitutionality of a punitive damages award assessed pursuant to a finding of liability under.the case,gregory shelby county,is quite distinguishable,however,because the plaintiff suffered severe physical abuse,endured long hours of conscious pain and suffering,and ultimately died as a result of a police officer actions,cir.furthermore,the compensatory award in gregory was,so the million punitive award easily satisfied gore ratio guidepost.id.we turn,then,to other courts treatment of punitive awards in civil rights cases.
in lee edwards,the plaintiff was awarded nominal compensatory damages and the second circuit concluded that the malicious prosecution verdict against the defendant,a police officer,would support a punitive damages award of no more than the jury had awarded.at.the basis for the court conclusion was that it had closely scrutinized but ultimately approved awards of substantially less than in cases where the plaintiffs suffered numerous and severe physical and psychological harms.id.the defendant conduct in lee,not having caused the plaintiff such acute trauma,was not remotely as reprehensible.id.in the later case of disorbo hoy,the second circuit remitted a punitive damages award of million to the claims were excessive force and abuse of process.it was clear in disorbo that the plaintiff was severely beaten by the defendant police second circuit described the case as involving heinous acts of police aggression who arrested her and her sister because she resisted his advances.at.
in dean olibas,the eighth circuit sustained a punitive award against a bail bondsman after the jury found him liable for causing the police to wrongfully arrest and book the plaintiff.at.a key component of the dean court rationale was its concern that,as a bail bondsman,the defendant might have other opportunities to knowingly initiate the arrest of innocent people and cause them to suffer the indignity of detention in jail and prosecution.id.finally,in williams kaufman county,the fifth circuit sustained a punitive award against a police officer for having conducted illegal strip searches of the plaintiffs.at.the award satisfied gore scrutiny,the court concluded,because it was not unreasonable in light of the violations that took place and in light of awards in similar cases.id.
our decision in gregory and our review of these cases from other circuits leads us to two important conclusions first,substantial punitive awards in cases,not surprisingly,tend to accompany conduct that results in physical or psychological harm.second,in the typical case in which punitive damages are awarded,the defendant is an individual police officer,not the police department or municipality which,odds are,have deeper pockets than the officer,let alone a deeply pocketed company,which the casino indisputably is.we have not found a case in which punitive damages were awarded based exclusively on a finding that the defendant unlawfully arrested the plaintiff and the award was challenged as unconstitutionally excessive.in addition,while we have said that the unlawful arrest of romanski and the manner in which defendants treated her are sufficiently reprehensible to warrant a substantial punitive damages award,the harm that befell romanski is not as severe as the harm suffered by the plaintiffs in the cases just discussed,being severely beaten,or subjected to booking,jailhouse detention,and wrongful prosecution.
nevertheless,a wrinkle peculiar to this case may render appropriate an award that exceeds the average punitive award for civil rights cases involving verdicts of this type.the defendant here is a casino,which,at the time of the verdict,yielded a daily intake of nearly.since a fixed dollar award will punish a poor person more than a wealthy one,one can understand the relevance of the defendant financial position to the state interest in retribution gore,at.breyer,concurring see txo production alliance resources,d plurality opinion pacific mut.life ins.haslip,d.the defendant financial position is equally relevant to the state interest in deterrence,which is also a valid purpose of punitive damages.haslip,at.lee,at citation omitted.
at the same time,a defendant wealth could heighten the likelihood of juror caprice.thus the supreme court recently reiterated that t he wealth of a defendant can not justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.campbell,at.citation omitted.common sense gives us an additional reason to view skeptically the generic proposition that a high punitive award is necessary because of the wealth of the defendant.the supreme court said in gore that t he sanction imposed in this case can not be justified on the ground that it was necessary to deter future misconduct without considering whether less drastic remedies could be expected to achieve that goal.at.the upshot is we must take into account the casino wealth to ensure that the punitive damages award will further the interests it is designed to advance but we must also ensure that our exacting appellate review results in an award that is not significantly higher than is necessary to further those interests.
before proceeding to the third gore guidepost,we take a final stab at putting the punitive damages award in context.see lee,at.we have reviewed one roughly analogous case in which a state court examined a substantial punitive award levied against a corporate defendant for conduct roughly similar to what occurred here.in that case,the plaintiff,a pregnant woman shopping on christmas eve with her two children,brought a malicious prosecution claim against after she was wrongly accused of shoplifting a telephone,detained briefly at the store,arrested by the police,charged for theft,jailed,and tried,all at behest.stores,goodman,so d.a jury awarded the plaintiff in compensatory damages for mental anguish and million in punitive damages,the latter because it was clear that could have taken steps that would have quickly exonerated the plaintiff.id.at.the supreme court of alabama concluded that gore permitted a ratio of no greater than on the ground that conduct,although it was reprehensible,did not cause the plaintiff physical injury.id.at.accordingly,the punitive award was.the goodman case is not directly involved conduct of a different character than that which occurred here and a substantial compensatory it nevertheless assists us in completing the backdrop against which to evaluate the size of the punitive damages award assessed against the casino.
