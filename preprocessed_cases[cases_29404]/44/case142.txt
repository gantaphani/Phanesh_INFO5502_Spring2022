plaintiffs elizabeth manning,lisa rivers,rhonda williams,and reva mccarthy bring this action against defendants boston medical center corporation bmc,elaine ullian,and james canavan.current and former bmc employees,plaintiffs allege that defendants deprived them of their wages through the use of timekeeping policies and employment practices that required them to work through their meal and rest periods,put in extra work time before and after their regularly scheduled work shifts,and attend mandatory training sessions.the complaint asserts causes of action under the fair labor standards act flsa and massachusetts common law for recovery of their unpaid wages.plaintiffs also seek certification of a collective action pursuant to flsa b,b,and a class action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.
this case began as two separate actions,one in federal court raising flsa claims,and another in the massachusetts commonwealth court raising state law claims.defendants removed the latter action to federal court.after the two cases were joined via the filing of a single amended complaint,defendants moved to dismiss all of the claims,both federal and state,and sought to strike the class and collective action allegations.the district court granted defendants motion in its entirety,and plaintiffs now appeal.
we have seen this case before,albeit with different parties.as explained in our prior opinions,see pruell caritas christi,cir cavallaro umass memorial healthcare,cir,numerous lawsuits of this kind have been filed against hospitals across the country,all alleging similar forms of systematic undercompensation.these cases,which we have previously dubbed hospital compensation cases,assert that defendants require unpaid work through due to an automatic timekeeping deduction,unpaid preliminary and postliminary work,and unpaid training sessions.pruell,at.a number of these actions are being litigated by counsel for plaintiffs in this case.see id.at cavallaro,at.
after careful consideration of the numerous arguments raised on appeal,we vacate the district court dismissal of the flsa claims against bmc and ullian,as well as the massachusetts common law claims for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,money had and received,unjust enrichment,and conversion.we also vacate the striking of plaintiffs class and collective allegations.we affirm the district court directive that the plaintiffs in the two cases file a single consolidated complaint and,by extension,the district court assumption of jurisdiction over the state law claims.we also affirm the dismissal of the flsa claims against canavan,the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims,and the denial of further leave to amend the complaint.
factual background 
bmc refers to a group of related organizations that operate a set of healthcare facilities in the boston area.the two individual defendants are elaine ullian,bmc former president and chief executive officer,and james canavan,bmc former senior human resources director.plaintiffs are three registered nurses manning,rivers,and williams and one administrative assistant mccarthy who worked or currently work for bmc at several of its locations.they seek to represent a group of over people who were or are currently employed by bmc as hourly workers.this group includes individuals in a broad range of positions,from nurses,medical assistants,technicians,and physical therapists,to administrative staff,custodians,and home health aides.
the crux of plaintiffs claims is that defendants denied bmc workers full compensation for their work through a combination of unlawful pay practices and timekeeping policies.the complaint alleges that bmc employees are not properly compensated for time spent performing work during their regularly scheduled meal breaks,as well as time spent before and after their scheduled shifts.the work that employees perform during their meal breaks and before and after their shifts includes tending to patients,doing paperwork,preparing charts,and responding to phone calls.employees are often not relieved by other employees when the time comes for their meal breaks,forcing them to work during times when they are ostensibly not supposed to be working.
the complaint suggests that bmc consciously takes advantage of its employees dedication and commitment to their patients,knowing that they would not abandon their caregiving responsibilities simply because their work hours are over or because they are due to take a meal or rest break 
a key aspect of plaintiffs claims is the interaction of bmc alleged policies and practices with the company timekeeping system.bmc maintains time records using an automated system that is programmed to deduct time from the employees paychecks for meals,breaks,or other noncompensable time.despite the fact that plaintiffs spend much of this time performing regular work responsibilities,the deductions for their meal break time are automatic.plaintiffs also allege that they are not allowed to record all their work performed before and after their shifts,and,even when they are permitted to record that time,they are not compensated properly.
additionally,bmc employees are not paid for time spent during required training sessions.these trainings take place during regular work hours and cover subjects directly related to employees work responsibilities,including new areas of medical research and procedure as well as instruction on basic protocols such as administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr.
the complaint further states that bmc and the employees supervisors are well aware that employees are performing work without being paid.employees are often asked to take on responsibilities during their meal breaks and before and after their work shifts.the work is performed on bmc premises during operational hours,in full view of the defendants managers and supervisors.plaintiffs also allege that due to staffing shortages and other industry demands,bmc management knows that the tasks they assign require their employees to work through their meal breaks and before and after their regularly scheduled shifts.
procedural history 
as noted,this case began as two separate actions,one initiated in the district of massachusetts and the other in the commonwealth courts.we recount their respective paths to this court.
the initiation of the two actions 
three of the named plaintiffs,manning,rivers,and williams,filed an action in federal court in september manning i,alleging claims under the flsa and other federal statutes defendants moved to dismiss all of those claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.as to the flsa claim specifically,the motion challenged the sufficiency of the complaint factual allegations and also contended that because the plaintiffs were all union members,the claim was precluded by the operation of federal labor laws governing the relationship,including the national labor relations act nlra.
also in september,manning,rivers,and williams initiated a parallel action in the massachusetts commonwealth courts manning ii.this complaint pled a number of massachusetts statutory and common law claims,relying on the same facts as the federal case.defendants removed the case to federal court,contending that all of plaintiffs claims were completely preempted by of the labor management relations act lmra,a,because plaintiffs were union workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement cba and their causes of action were founded directly on or necessarily required the interpretation of the cba.defendants then requested consolidation of manning i and manning ii under federal rule of civil procedure,and also filed a motion to dismiss the manning ii complaint for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs,for their part,sought to remand manning ii as improperly removed.
on september,the district court held a hearing on all of the pending motions in manning i and manning ii.the court then took the motions under submission and stated that it would defer ruling on defendants motion to consolidate the two actions until it resolved the motions to dismiss,as the dismissal of the complaints would moot the consolidation request.
in february,the court granted the motion to dismiss the manning i complaint,ruling that the facts alleged were insufficient to state a plausible claim for relief under the flsa.the district court stated that the complaint runs to pages and paragraphs,yet it lacks even the most basic information about plaintiffs claims.the court observed that among other deficiencies,the complaint did not identify the defendants for whom the plaintiffs worked,the plaintiffs jobs and occupations,or the amounts of unpaid wages.the court dismissed the flsa claim without prejudice and gave plaintiffs leave to amend to correct the identified deficiencies.
in march,the district court ruled on the motions pending in manning ii.the court denied plaintiffs remand motion,holding that lmra complete preemption applied to plaintiffs massachusetts claims,thus converting them into federal causes of action and rendering the case properly removed.the court also granted defendants motion to dismiss the manning ii complaint,referring to its order dismissing the manning i complaint and similarly ruling that the common law claims were insufficiently pled.the court also observed that bmc status as a public charity rendered it statutorily exempt from plaintiffs massachusetts claims and dismissed them as well.plaintiffs were given leave to amend their complaint to plead a recharacterized count in manning ii.
subsequent proceedings and the order dismissing the amended complaint 
anticipating the filing of amended complaints,the court held a joint scheduling conference on april,for manning i and manning ii.although we have not been provided with a transcript of this hearing,the parties agree that the court directed plaintiffs to file a single complaint containing both their flsa and state law claims plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint in manning i only.this complaint alleged a cause of action under the flsa,brought on behalf of all plaintiffs against all defendants,as well as a number of contract,fraud,and tort claims pursuant to massachusetts law brought only on behalf of bmc employees not covered by a cba.the complaint added mccarthy,a nonunion employee,as a plaintiff in order to represent the nonunionized bmc workers in the putative class.plaintiffs also moved for conditional certification and expedited notice under the flsa collective action provisions.defendants,for their part,moved to dismiss the amended complaint and further urged the court to strike the complaint class and collective action allegations under federal rule of civil procedure f.see.f permitting court to strike redundant,immaterial,impertinent,or scandalous matter from pleading.
in april,the court dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety.the court concluded that while the pleading had significantly increased in length,it failed to remedy the problems the court had identified in the original manning i and manning ii complaints.the amended complaint,the court said,contained no factual matter indicating that defendants had a concrete policy in place that required bmc employees to work through their meal and rest breaks,before and after hours,or during their training periods.even assuming that such a policy existed,the complaint failed to demonstrate that any of bmc managers or supervisors had knowledge of plaintiffs unpaid work.similarly,the court ruled that the claims against the individual defendants were insufficient to make out a plausible claim for relief,and that the plaintiffs state common law claims were too conclusory to survive dismissal.
for related reasons,the court granted defendants motion to strike the class and collective action allegations.the court noted that plaintiffs sought to represent numerous bmc employees who worked in a multitude of different positions.t he existence of such policies,the court opined,across a group of putative plaintiffs whose job function,hours,and daily tasks share little to no common ground is simply not plausible.
finally,the court denied plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint,observing that plaintiffs counsel had brought at least five other hospital compensation cases in the district of massachusetts alone,and that similar cases against health care facilities were proliferating throughout the country.these cases used complaints that were substantially identical to the one at issue in this case,and the court observed that other district courts had routinely dismissed such complaints as insufficiently pled.accordingly,the plaintiffs have received the benefit of numerous rulings from federal judges on the requisites for proper pleadings,and their continuing inability to allege a cause of action attested to the futility of further opportunities to amend.
having dismissed all claims with prejudice,the court entered judgment for defendants in manning i and terminated manning ii on its docket.plaintiffs took appeals from both cases.we consolidated those appeals for the purposes of briefing and argument.
a.the sufficiency of the flsa allegations 
we exercise de novo review over a district court dismissal of a complaint under rule b.uphoff figueroa alejandro,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a requires that the complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.such a statement needs only enough detail to provide a defendant with fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir quoting bell atlantic twombly,internal quotation marks omitted.
we assess the sufficiency of the complaint factual allegations in two steps.first,conclusory allegations that merely parrot the relevant legal standard are disregarded,as they are not entitled to the presumption of truth.id.second,we accept the remaining factual allegations as true and decide if,drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor,they are sufficient to show an entitlement to relief.id.the allegations must be enough to render the claim plausible w here a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability,it stops short of the line between mere possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.ashcroft iqbal,quoting twombly,at quotation marks omitted.we appropriately draw on our judicial experience and common sense in evaluating a complaint,id.at,but we may not disregard factual allegations even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable.twombly,at.the relevant question in assessing plausibility is not whether the complaint makes any particular factual allegations but,rather,whether the complaint warrant s dismissal because it failed in toto to render plaintiffs entitlement to relief plausible.rodríguez reyes molina rodríguez,cir quoting twombly,at.
the sufficiency of the flsa allegations against bmc 
plaintiffs seek recovery under the flsa for unpaid overtime compensation.the basic elements of a flsa claim are that plaintiffs must be employed by the defendants the work involved interstate activity and,most importantly for present purposes,plaintiffs performed work for which they were.pruell,at.a claim for unpaid overtime wages must demonstrate that the plaintiffs were employed for a workweek longer than forty hours and that any hours worked in excess of forty per week were not compensated at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate.a see also román maietta,cir.
the parties arguments about the sufficiency of the allegations against bmc boil down to three issues whether the complaint sufficiently pleads bmc actual or constructive knowledge of plaintiffs undercompensation whether the facts alleged make out a claim that plaintiffs performed compensable work for longer than forty hours per week and whether each named plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that she worked compensable overtime.
the flsa defines the term employ as to suffer or permit to work.g.the parties agree that under this definition,an employer actual or imputed knowledge is a necessary condition to finding the employer suffers or permits that work.chao gotham registry,cir see also newton city of henderson,cir davis food lion,cir.actual knowledge is not required constructive knowledge will suffice.holzapfel town of newburgh,cir see also work not requested but suffered or permitted is work time the employer knows or has reason to believe that the employee is continuing to work and the time is working time.
here,the complaint relies on a mix of actual knowledge and constructive knowledge theories.the pleading alleges that the employees uncompensated work was performed on defendants premises during operational hours,and in full view of defendants managers and supervisors.the pleading further states that plaintiffs had conversations with their managers about their uncompensated work.on a number of occasions,employees directly questioned bmc managers about the practice of deducting time automatically from employees paychecks,and the managers responded that the employees were fully paid for their work time.additionally,bmc managers regularly set performance deadlines that required employees to work through their designated breaks.as for the training sessions,defendants scheduled them to take place during regular work hours and led the required sessions,demonstrating that they knew that the trainings were taking place.
defendants assail these allegations as too vague to support bmc knowledge of employees unpaid work.they argue that even though the allegations are factual in nature,some allegations,while not stating ultimate legal conclusions,are nevertheless so threadbare or speculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory and the factual.peñalbert rosa fortuño burset,cir citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.defendants note that the pleading is vague about a number of points,such as the identities and roles of the managers with whom plaintiffs spoke and the frequency and content of these purported interactions.
rule does not demand this degree of particularity.even where direct allegations of knowledge are pled in a conclusory fashion,defendants knowledge of unlawful conduct may be inferable from other allegations in the complaint.rodríguez reyes,f d at see also grajales ports,cir.boiled down to its essence,plaintiffs claim is that the intersection of several bmc employment practices frequently required them to work through their scheduled breaks,before and after work hours,and during training sessions.this work,often required by defendants,was performed in the open.although defendants suffered and permitted this work to take place,they also knew that their automatic timekeeping system would deduct certain categories of noncompensable time from the employees paychecks.yet defendants did nothing to account for the extra time worked.these facts,taken in toto,are sufficient to establish a plausible inference of defendants knowledge.to require that plaintiffs,seeking to represent a whole class of individuals,describe the specific managers they talked with,and document,by time,place,and date,the instances in which they had a relevant conversation with those managers,would exceed rule requirement of a short and plain statement making out a claim for relief.see grajales,at in connection with a threshold plausibility inquiry,a high degree of factual specificity is not required.here,the complaint sufficiently pleads that the employees were performing uncompensated work with defendants constructive or actual knowledge.
compensable work 
the supreme court has defined work under the flsa as physical or mental exertion whether burdensome or not controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.coal,iron muscoda local,see also ibp,alvarez.accordingly,not all activities an employee performs are necessarily compensable.see pruell,at discussing regulations excluding certain types of training or activities from flsa definition of work.the determination of whether an employee activities constitute work depends not on rigid per se definitions,but rather the circumstances of the whole activity.reich conagra,cir citation omitted quotation marks omitted see also gotham registry,at applying tennessee coal test to determine whether employees engaged in compensable activities.
in affirming the dismissal of a complaint raising similar allegations,our recent opinion in pruell observed that the amended complaint does not provide examples let alone estimates as to the amounts of such unpaid time for either plaintiff or describe the nature of the work performed during those times.at.defendants level a similar contention against this complaint,asserting that it fails to allege that plaintiffs engaged in compensable work with sufficient specificity.
while we agree that some of the complaint allegations straddle the line between the conclusory and the factual,the pleading contains enough substantive content to elevate the flsa claims above the mere possibility of defendants liability.as discussed above,the complaint gist is that because the employees assigned tasks often need to be completed by certain times,and because of understaffing and lack of relief during meal and work breaks,bmc employees must frequently complete their regular working activities during their meal breaks or before and after their scheduled shifts.for example,manning and williams,who worked as nurses,spent this time charting,performing administrative tasks,monitoring patients,and providing treatment.rivers,a registered nurse,similarly used this time to assist patients who had difficulty sleeping.mccarthy,an administrative assistant,spent her uncompensated time placing and answering phone calls,drafting correspondence,and filing paperwork.
this work was essentially indistinguishable from work performed during the employees regularly scheduled hours and s uch work from their standpoint was fungible.gotham registry,at.the fact that this assertion is not accompanied by a detailed list of each and every activity the plaintiffs and their fellows performed without compensation does not mandate the complaint dismissal.work is work,after all,and we see no reason to demand such exhaustive detail.
overtime worked 
the parties debate whether the complaint properly alleges that each of the individually named plaintiffs worked more than forty hours in a given workweek,as required to bring a flsa overtime claim.in support of dismissal,defendants rely heavily on the second circuit recent opinion in lundy catholic health of long island,cir,which is another hospital compensation case.there,the second circuit carefully examined each named plaintiff allegations and discussed the likelihood that he or she worked more than forty hours in a given week.the lundy court criticized the complaint repeated use of imprecise words such as occasionally and typically to describe the named plaintiffs work hours.id.at.this vagueness,combined with the fact that the amounts of purportedly uncompensated time were relatively small,provided but fuel for speculation that plaintiffs truly had worked enough hours to be entitled to overtime pay.id.at.
although defendants characterize the instant complaint as strikingly similar to the pleading at issue in lundy,a close reading reveals otherwise.as to two of the four named plaintiffs,rivers and mccarthy,the complaint alleges that they were regularly scheduled for shifts.any time that they worked during meal breaks,before or after their shifts,and in training periods,would thus entitle them to overtime compensation.a third plaintiff,manning,was usually scheduled for shifts,but approximately once a month her shift schedules resulted in a week.hence,approximately once a month,the alleged uncompensated time would put her over the numerical threshold.
the sufficiency of the allegations as to rhonda williams,who was employed by bmc as of the time of the complaint filing,presents a closer question.the pleading states that from january until,she typically was scheduled for workweeks.while this allegation would seem to bring her into the same category as rivers and mccarthy,the flsa imposes a statute of limitations,extending to three years for willful violations.a.this case was initiated in september,meaning that williams was not regularly scheduled to work weeks within either limitations period.from onward,williams typical schedule was reduced to,which is plainly insufficient to bring her even close to the threshold.
williams also alleges,however,that she was scheduled for a week shift at least once a year after her regular hours changed.during such a week,any hours she worked above the threshold would entitle her to overtime pay.as noted,the complaint basic thrust is that defendants pay practices continuously required bmc employees to work time for which they did not receive compensation.this fact supports the reasonable inference that during any week in which williams was scheduled to work forty hours,she also performed at least some uncompensated work.
consequently,we conclude that the named plaintiffs,williams included,have alleged enough to survive dismissal.
the individual defendants 
the flsa claims are also directed against two individual defendants elaine ullian,bmc president and ceo from until,and james canavan,bmc senior human resources director from until.flsa liability attaches to any employer,which is defined broadly to include any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.d.courts have generally agreed that a corporate officer with operational control of a corporation covered enterprise is an employer along with the corporation,jointly and severally liable for unpaid wages.donovan agnew,cir.
in agnew,our seminal case on flsa individual liability,we balanced the shield from personal liability that is one of the major purposes of doing business in a corporate form against congress clear refusal to incorporate the common law parameters of the relationship into the flsa.id.at.examining the supreme court precedents interpreting the flsa and other employment statutes,we noted that they charted a middle course,applying a economic reality test that looked to the totality of the individual level of involvement with the corporation operations,as well as their direct participation in creating or adopting the unlawful pay practices.id.at.while recognizing the nature of this test,we admonished that courts should not apply the analysis in a manner that would make any supervisory employee,even those without any control over the corporation payroll,personally liable for the unpaid or deficient wages of other employees.id.at.
we added substance to the economic reality test in baystate alternative staffing,herman,cir,explaining that 
the analysis focuse s on the role played by the corporate officers in causing the corporation to undercompensate employees and to prefer the payment of other obligations the retention of profits.in addition to direct evidence of such a role,other relevant indicia may exist as well for example,an individual operational control over significant aspects of the business and an individual ownership interest in the business.such indicia,while not dispositive,are important because they suggest that an individual controls a corporation financial affairs and can cause the corporation to compensate or not to compensate employees in accordance with the flsa.
id.at emphasis added internal citation omitted.we cautioned that these indicia must add up to something more than merely the exercise of control by a corporate officer or corporate employee over the work situation generally,as otherwise almost any supervisory or managerial employee of a corporation could be held personally liable for the unpaid wages of other employees.id.at see also chao hotel oasis,cir concluding that corporate officer was not just any employee with some supervisory control over other employees,but rather was instrumental in causing the corporation to violate the flsa internal quotation marks omitted.
our flsa individual liability cases typically address a corporate officer with operational control of a corporation covered enterprise,rather than a mere employee.agnew,f d at two individuals who together were president,treasurer,secretary and sole members of the board of directors see also hotel oasis,at president of the corporation.we have similarly identified an ownership stake as highly probative of an individual employer status,see baystate,at,as it suggests a high level of dominance over the company operations.see lambert ackerley,cir approving jury instruction that individuals were liable if they had a significant ownership interest with operational control of significant aspects of the corporation functions emphasis added herman rsr sec.servs,cir because the defendant controlled the company financially,it was no idle threat when he testified that he could have dissolved the company if the other defendants had not followed his directions.the company profits also inure directly to an individual with an ownership interest,meaning that the individual employs the worker in a very concrete and literal sense.see dole elliot travel tours,cir holding individual liable where the evidence clearly demonstrates that individual was the top man and the corporation functioned for his profit.
this is not to say that the flsa definition of employer excludes those without high executive positions or ownership interests,as the economic reality test speaks broadly of individuals who have operational control over significant aspects of the business.baystate,at see also lamonica safe hurricane shutters,cir observing that a supervisor title does not in itself establish or preclude his or her liability under the flsa.but the case law emphasis on ownership and financial control is sensible because these factors suggest a strong degree of authority over the corporation finances and,as a corollary,the ability to caus e the corporation to undercompensate employees and to prefer the payment of other obligations the retention of profits.baystate,at.
elaine ullian 
against this backdrop,we turn to the allegations against ullian,bmc former president and ceo.plaintiffs say that ullian had the authority to,and did,make decisions that concerned the policies defendants adopted and the implementation of those policies.they claim that she exercised her dominance over bmc operations by coordinating a major merger of several boston area hospitals,overseeing the corporation budget,and setting policy.she also was involved in a number of major decisions,including hiring employees from community organizations,reducing jobs and services due to budget cuts,negotiating with unions,and ensuring that minorities were represented in bmc workforce.
these allegations do not say that ullian possessed any ownership interest in bmc,which we have identified as a significant factor in the individual liability analysis.nevertheless,her role as bmc president and chief executive officer suggests that she was in a position to exert substantial authority over corporate policy relating to employee wages.see hotel oasis,at emphasizing that individual was the corporate officer principally in charge of directing employment practices,including requiring employees to attend meetings unpaid,and setting employees wages and schedules.while allegations reliant solely on ullian position within bmc would not be sufficient to hold her individually liable,the complaint contains allegations indicating that she controlled the company or made corporate policy about its compensation practices.baystate,at.
specifically,ullian was involved in an array of decisions related to managing bmc finances.for example,she was involved in the hospital budget and made decisions to allocate substantial resources to certain projects.moreover,she was involved in the reduction of jobs and services at bmc due to budgetary constraints,and was similarly involved in strategic decisions to cut staff positions and reduce the company spending.these assertions support the notion that ullian had the authority to,and did,make critical decisions regarding the allocation of bmc resources,thereby buttressing the inference that she had the type of operational control over the company that would give rise to individual flsa liability.
the dissent notes these same factual allegations,but concludes that they are merely consistent with an inference of liability,twombly,at,rather than sufficient to raise a plausible claim.although the dissent acknowledges that plaintiffs need not state particular facts showing that an individual defendant made a specific decision or took a particular action that directly caused the plaintiffs undercompensation,it criticizes the complaint for failing to show that the plaintiffs compensation was sufficiently within the defendant bailiwick to justify holding her personally liable.it also takes issue with the complaint lack of allegations connecting ullian to any component of the timekeeping practices and work and training requirements that caused the systematic undercompensation.
but t he relevant question in assessing plausibility is not whether the complaint makes any particular factual allegations.rodríguez reyes,at.instead,we look to whether,taken in their entirety,the facts alleged are enough to state a claim.id.with respect,we believe the dissent devalues the familiar process of drawing inferences from relevant indicia of employer status,such as an individual operational control over significant aspects of the business.baystate,at.
even after the complaint conclusory and generalized assertions are discarded,the pleading discusses ullian involvement in employment,training,and payroll operations,her participation in recruiting activities,and decisions she made to reduce staff due to budget cuts.these allegations describe an executive who not only possessed,but repeatedly exercised the authority to establish policy regarding matters and made significant decisions regarding the allocation of financial resources that directly affected bmc employees.these facts denominate concrete actions that had measurable and immediate impacts on bmc workforce.thus,the complaint raises a plausible inference not only that matters were well within ullian bailiwick,but also that she control led the corporation financial affairs and cause d the corporation to compensate or not to compensate employees in accordance with the flsa.id.at.
while specific allegations linking ullian to bmc automated timekeeping system or the practice of working through meal and rest periods would have further buttressed plaintiffs flsa claim,that kind of direct evidence is not essential to the assertion of a plausible claim.moreover,demanding that type of allegation is often unrealistic at this stage when some of the information needed may be in the control of defendants.pruell,at.
importantly,one of our prior opinions found individual flsa liability in a nearly identical factual context.in hotel oasis,we deemed the president of the corporation personally liable because he had ultimate control over the business operations.at.the individual in question was the corporate officer principally in charge of directing employment practices,such as hiring and firing employees,requiring employees to attend meetings unpaid,and setting employees wages and schedules.id.notably,these facts were sufficient to establish a claim against the individual regardless of whether he possessed an ownership interest in company.id.at.as enumerated above,the allegations against ullian hew closely to the facts we found sufficient to establish individual liability in hotel oasis.consequently,the dismissal of the flsa claims against her must be vacated.
thomas canavan 
the complaint also seeks to hold canavan,bmc former senior human resources director,personally liable for the alleged flsa violations.canavan lacks any ownership interest in bmc,does not serve as a corporate officer,and is not a member of the company board of directors.unlike ullian,he apparently occupied a position more akin to a senior employee than a corporate official.although flsa definition of employer does not necessarily exclude employees,our previous cases have not yet extended flsa liability to such an individual 
in view of the case law emphasis on individuals with corporate officer status an ownership stake in the company,and the lack of any such assertions relating to canavan,the allegations as to his involvement in setting and enforcing the unlawful pay practices at issue become all the more important.although there are such allegations against him,they are nothing more than unadorned assertions that are not supplemented by specific allegations supporting the inference that canavan controlled bmc or made decisions about the allocation of financial resources.see baystate,at compare donovan grim hotel,cir finding individual liable when he held their and guided their policies,companies were part of the family business,and functioned for the profit of his family.as we have detailed,there were such allegations against ullian.their absence with respect to canavan undermines any inference of individual liability.
similarly,to say,as the complaint does,that canavan had some involvement in maintaining records or payroll functions is not enough to support a reasonable inference of liability,given that plaintiffs nowhere assert that there was anything per se unlawful about taking automatic deductions from employees time.if anything,these allegations are merely consistent with the notion that canavan was performing his job functions,rather than engaging in conduct that led to the alleged violations.
for these reasons,the complaint does not state a claim against canavan.
b.the arbitrability of plaintiffs flsa claims 
defendants also mount a challenge to the viability of plaintiffs flsa claims based on federal laws governing unions,including the national labor relations act nlra and the lmra.although defendants argument is somewhat hazy,we understand it this way.lmra embodies a strong federal policy in favor of protect ing the use of arbitration and grievance procedures common to cbas.cavallaro,at.thus,the lmra exerts a strong preemptive effect over state law causes of action so long as relief can be provided within the cba process.id.at.the flsa,for its part,permits employers and employees to contract about certain terms and conditions of employment,including the parties definition of work,as long as those contractual provisions remain consistent with the flsa provisions and purposes.although the lmra broad protection of arbitration focuses on state law claims,defendants maintain that the flsa claims similarly should be subject to the federal policy in favor of arbitrating disputes between employers and union workers regarding the payment of wages.the best way to do so is to require the unionized plaintiffs manning,rivers,and williams to arbitrate their flsa claims before proceeding to federal court 
this exhaustion argument runs aground on case law governing the arbitrability of federal statutory claims in town of agawam,cir,we addressed the argument that the flsa claims of certain unionized workers were barred from federal court because they are essentially contract claims for unpaid overtime and therefore subject to the cba grievance and arbitration procedures id.at.we rejected this proposition,observing that r ights conferred by congress are conceptually distinct from those created by private agreement,and there is no authority for the proposition that rights under the flsa merge into contractual ones whenever the two overlap.id.at see also gilmer lane,distinguishing between contractual rights under a agreement and individual statutory rights.
as a consequence,flsa claims are not subject to a cba grievance and arbitration procedures simply because they address similar subject matter or because the cbas define compensable work.indeed,the state of the law is somewhat unsettled as to whether a flsa claim may ever be waived by a cba whatever the answer to that question may be,the law is plain on one point in order for a cba to subject a federal statutory claim to arbitration,any such waiver must be clear and unmistakable on its face.agawam,at see also cavallaro,at.the supreme court has repeatedly reaffirmed this rule.see pyett,at holding that union members age discrimination claims must be subject to cba arbitration provisions because cba clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate them wright universal.serv,holding that requirement contained in cba requiring parties to arbitrate employment discrimination claims must be clear and unmistakable,and that waiver was insufficient 
as to what kind of provision would work a clear and unmistakable waiver,we have observed that a arbitration clause such as one covering any dispute concerning or arising out of the terms conditions of the cba will not suffice rather,something closer to specific enumeration of the statutory claims to be arbitrated is required.cavallaro,at.for example,in wright,the court held that the cba in that case was not sufficiently lucid when it contained very general clauses requiring arbitration of m atters under dispute and matters affecting wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment,without the explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements.u.at.in agawam,we deemed insufficient arbitration language referring only to grievances,which in turn were defined as allegations that the town violated the cba without any reference to the arbitration of statutory claims,let alone a clear and unmistakable waiver of a judicial forum for such claims.at.
here,the defendants can not point to a single provision of the relevant cbas that works a clear and unmistakable waiver of their flsa claims.the cbas arbitration provisions do contain general grievance procedures,but define grievances as disputes or concerns arising out of the interpretation of the cbas themselves.these provisions do not mention the employees statutory claims,much less clearly or unmistakably agree to subject them to arbitration.accordingly,nothing in the cbas can even be remotely construed to require the plaintiffs to seek redress for their flsa claims through the cba grievance processes.
in sum,a body of precedent dictates that a cba waiver of federal statutory claims must be clear and unmistakable.no such waiver exists in the cbas at issue here.consequently,the cbas do not foreclose plaintiffs claims under the flsa 
mccarthy state common law claims 
plaintiffs also challenge the district court disposition of their state law claims,asserting that the trial court erroneously forced a nonunion plaintiff,mccarthy,to join her state law claims with the federal claims asserted by the other named plaintiffs,all of whom were union members covered by cbas.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing mccarthy state law claims under rule b.
the consolidation of mccarthy claims with the union plaintiffs claims 
the state law claims at issue in this case had their genesis in manning ii,which began in the commonwealth courts but was subsequently removed to federal court via lmra complete preemption.complete preemption applies where a purported state claim either is as a federal claim or is otherwise so related to federal law as to permit the removal.cavallaro,at.in the labor context,this doctrine reaches all state law claims founded directly on rights created by agreements or substantially dependent on analysis of a agreement.id.at quoting caterpillar williams.lmra complete preemption thus transforms a claim pled under state law into a claim arising under federal labor law,thereby establishing a basis for federal jurisdiction and changing the substantive law governing the claim itself id.at.
the three original plaintiffs in manning ii were all union members,and all asserted state law claims that the district court found to be substantially dependent on interpreting the cbas,rendering them completely preempted.plaintiffs raise no dispute with this legal conclusion on appeal instead,they object to the district court directive that the plaintiffs file a single amended complaint pleading the federal and state law claims that began as two separate cases in manning i and manning ii.plaintiffs observe that mccarthy,as a nonunion employee not covered by a cba,had the ability to raise state law claims that were not completely preempted by the lmra.see pruell caritas christi,cir so long as plaintiffs pursue their own claims or represent others who are also not covered by cbas,that is a state case under state law.but bringing mccarthy claims as a separate action in the commonwealth courts,plaintiffs say,would have violated the district court directive to file a single consolidated complaint that included the putative class members state law claims.
there is no evidence that the district court intended to preclude mccarthy from pursuing state law claims in state court.to recap,the three named plaintiffs who initiated both manning i and manning ii were all asserted to be union members.at the time the district court directed plaintiffs to file a single consolidated complaint,these were the only three plaintiffs in the case.thus,the district court understood the case to concern only plaintiffs who were union members,and plaintiffs cite nothing in the record showing that the district court was even aware of the existence of a named plaintiff who had the undisputed ability to assert nonpreempted state law claims.based on the circumstances before it,the district court acted on the reasonable assumption that if the plaintiffs wanted to bring any state law claims,they should be joined with their federal causes of action.see a.
even if the district court had been made aware of mccarthy as a plaintiff,exercising supplemental jurisdiction over her claims would have been more than appropriate,since they were undisputedly part of the same case or controversy.see cavallaro,at.to be sure,the exercise of this jurisdiction was within the court discretion,and mccarthy could have moved to dismiss her particular claims without prejudice.see c permitting district courts to decline supplemental jurisdiction in certain enumerated circumstances.but mccarthy never requested the chance to bring her claims outside federal court.while the amended complaint includes a footnote stating that the state law claims were joined to the federal causes of action per the district court directive,this vague notation says only that the plaintiffs reserve all rights.mccarthy can not now complain of the court failure to address this issue when she did not put such a request before the court below.
finally,to the extent that plaintiffs attack the district court directive to file a single consolidated complaint,that contention is meritless.see sutcliffe storage warehouse united states,cir stating that district court would be acting quite within its discretion in taking steps to consolidate or otherwise avoid the duplication of such closely similar cases,whatever the substantive rights of the parties.
for these reasons,all of the named plaintiffs claims,both federal and state,were properly before the district court.
the merits of mccarthy state law claims 
the district court grouped the state law claims into three categories contract and claims counts ii iv and ix fraud claims counts vii and viii and unjust enrichment,money had and received,and conversion claims counts v,vi and x.to clarify the scope of this appeal,the district court ruled that insofar as these common law claims sought to recover overtime pay,they were preempted because they conflicted with the flsa comprehensive remedial scheme.román,at addressing preemption of maine law and suggesting that the flsa is the exclusive remedy for enforcement of rights created under the flsa internal quotation marks omitted.the parties do not dispute this proposition.mccarthy state law claims are accordingly limited to the recovery of pay,unpaid wages for hours at her regular hourly rate.
plaintiffs challenge the district court conclusion that mccarthy state law claims were pled in too conclusory a fashion to withstand dismissal.defendants,for their part,urge us to adopt the district court reasoning.in the alternative,they assert that all the common law claims are precluded or preempted by massachusetts statutes.we begin with the question of whether the massachusetts law precludes mccarthy common law claims,and then turn to the sufficiency of the complaint.
a.the effect of the massachusetts wage and hour statutes on the common law claims 
defendants note that the district court dismissed the original manning ii complaint statutory massachusetts claims because those statutes exempt an employee of an incorporated hospital which is conducted as a public charity.laws ch,and any employee who is employed in a hospital,id.ch.defendants argue that mccarthy seeks to evade the force of these exemptions by clothing her statutory claims as contractual ones.they contend that all of mccarthy common law claims are premised on the violation of massachusetts statutes,and that those statutes should be construed to preempt any recovery of unpaid wages through common law causes of action 
we are not persuaded.when exercising diversity or supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims,we apply substantive state law.see barton clancy,cir.in doing so,our duty is to make an informed prophecy as to the state court likely stance.andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir.to begin,the massachusetts courts have noted that duties arising out of a contract may be distinguished from those imposed by statute,and the two do not merge simply because they cover similar subject matter.indeed,the massachusetts courts have been clear that an existing common law remedy is not to be taken away by statute unless by direct enactment or necessary implication.eyssi city of lawrence,citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also king viscoloid,same.
in salvas wal mart stores,the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc applied these principles to a claim on behalf of a group of workers who alleged that their employer had deprived them of their meal periods without payment.there,the plaintiffs pled a cause of action under massachusetts general laws chapter,for unpaid meal breaks,as well as a breach of contract claim based on the same deprivation.id.although the statutory claim failed because the relevant law did not provide for either an express or an implied private right of action,id.at,the court held that t he lack of a statutory private right of action presents no bar to the plaintiffs claim that defendant violated a contractual duty to provide meal periods to the plaintiff class.id.the sjc observed that t o an hourly employee,the opportunity to stop work and eat a meal in peace during a busy workday may constitute a benefit of significant value,which the parties could bargain for in the course of establishing an enforceable contract.id.at.as a consequence,plaintiffs inability to avail themselves of a remedy under the laws did not preclude a common law claim that sought to vindicate distinct legal rights.
salvas closely tracks this case.although mccarthy can not bring statutory claims against defendants directly due to bmc exempt status,that prohibition does not compel the erasure of her remedies at common law.see eyssi,at holding that amendments to workers compensation statutes did not bar common law loss of consortium action brought by spouse or child of police officer.
seeking to conjure a contrary argument,defendants rely on two sjc cases that they read for the proposition that w here a statute has been enacted seemingly to cover the whole subject to which it relates other provisions of the common law are thereby superseded.school comm.of city of lowell city of lowell.but these cases do not sweep so broadly.for one,lowell addressed a right that was wholly the creature of statute and that did not exist at common law.id.at.by contrast,the common law rights plaintiffs seek to vindicate here have long preceded the massachusetts laws.the other sjc case defendants cite,school committee of boston reilly,mass,actually undermines their contentions.there,the sjc considered the relationship between a criminal statute prohibiting municipal employees from engaging in strikes or work stoppages,and the terms of a cba between the boston school system and the teachers union that also prohibited strikes.id.at.when the teachers union engaged in a work stoppage,the school district sued under the cba and obtained an injunction.id.at.rejecting the teachers contention that the criminal statutes provided the exclusive remedy for the union conduct,the sjc saw nothing that would warrant the conclusion that the criminal statute enactment was intended to restrict previously existing common law remedies for breach of contract in the context.id.at 
in short,defendants have not identified any persuasive evidence that the massachusetts legislature sought to eliminate longstanding common law causes of action through the laws.we therefore conclude that these laws do not preclude mccarthy from asserting the common law claims pled in this case.
b.the sufficiency of the state law claims 
we now turn to the sufficiency of the state law claims under rule b,grouping them as the district court did into contract claims,fraud claims,and unjust enrichment claims.as stated above,the parties are in accord that these claims are for recovery of pay only.
i.the contract claims 
mccarthy contends that the district court misapprehended that an relationship is,at heart,a contractual one and that the court erred in ruling that the amended complaint failed to allege a contract.we agree.while the complaint may not be larded with detail,the basic claim is clear.the defendants,by hiring and employing the plaintiffs,entered into employment contract s with them.there is no requirement of greater formality to establish an employment contract.indeed,an informal contract of employment may arise by the simple act of handing a job applicant a shovel and providing a workplace.hishon king spalding.
per the complaint,the terms of this alleged contract were similarly straightforward mccarthy and her fellows would provide their labor and services in a specified role for defendants,in exchange for an agreed upon hourly pay rate for all hours worked by plaintiffs.at a very minimum,an employment relationship encompasses an agreement by the employee to perform specified work and an agreement by the employer to pay for the work performed.gasior.the heart of the state law claims is that,through the timekeeping and payroll policies detailed above,defendants breached the agreements promises to pay all of the wages due.the complaint also includes allegations stating that defendants breached the duty of good faith by failing to pay plaintiffs for their hours worked,and that the employees relied,to their detriment,on defendants promises to pay all the wages owed.while these factual allegations are relatively simple,so are the elements of a claim sounding in contract.we see no need to demand more specificity when the core assertion is obvious enough.spears miller,wl,at,observing that while complaint was silent as to employees precise employment arrangements,allegations that employer employed them and that employer agreed to pay them legally mandated overtime pay were sufficient to state breach of contract claim.
for these reasons,the dismissal of mccarthy claims sounding in contract must be vacated.
ii.the fraud and unjust enrichment claims 
the remaining common law claims may be disposed of more simply.as an initial matter,we note that mccarthy articulates no challenge to the district court conclusion that the fraud claims did not meet the heightened pleading threshold set by rule b.see.b requiring that fraud or mistake claims state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.although mccarthy contends that the dismissal of the common law claims should be vacated insofar as it is based on the complaint failure to plead knowledge,that pleading defect was not the basis of the district court dismissal of the fraud claims.due to the failure to provide any developed argumentation as to why the fraud claims should survive rule b,we affirm the dismissal of count vii,the fraud claim,and count viii,the negligent misrepresentation claim.see elena municipality of san juan,cir deeming claim waived on appeal when plaintiffs make no attempt at any analysis whatsoever,let alone developed argument.
by contrast,the district court dismissal of the unjust enrichment,money had and received,and conversion claims was based entirely on its erroneous conclusion that the complaint did not sufficiently plead that defendants required or had knowledge of the work allegedly performed by plaintiffs.see part.a,supra.neither the district court nor defendants on appeal have proffered another basis for affirming the district court order.consequently,the dismissal of the unjust enrichment,conversion,and money had and received claims should be vacated.
plaintiffs class action and collective action allegations 
in addition to dismissing plaintiffs substantive causes of action,the district court struck the class and collective action allegations.the amended complaint seeks both certification of a class action under federal rule of civil procedure for the nonunion members state law claims seeking pay,and a collective action under flsa section b,b,for the plaintiffs flsa overtime claims.although rule and the flsa impose different certification requirements,the district court used the same reasoning to strike both sets of allegations,and the parties by and large do not distinguish between the two regimes.we consequently assume that the same analysis applies to both for simplicity sake,we refer to the relevant allegations as class action allegations.
the dispositive question for purposes of this appeal is whether the complaint pleads the existence of a group of putative class members whose claims are susceptible of resolution on a classwide basis.see wal mart stores,dukes,holding that common issue of fact must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.the supreme court has recognized that s ometimes the issues are plain enough from the pleadings to determine whether the interests of the absent parties are fairly encompassed within the named plaintiff claim.of sw.falcon.if it is obvious from the pleadings that the proceeding can not possibly move forward on a classwide basis,district courts use their authority under federal rule of civil procedure f to delete the complaint class allegations see,pilgrim universal health card,llc,cir upholding striking of class allegations prior to close of discovery and motion to certify class.
nonetheless,courts should exercise caution when striking class action allegations based solely on the pleadings,for two reasons.first,while ruling on a motion to strike is committed to the district court sound judgment,such motions are narrow in scope,disfavored in practice,and not calculated readily to invoke the court discretion.boreri fiat,cir.this is so because striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and it is often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory or harassing tactic.charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure ed.second,courts have repeatedly emphasized that striking class allegations under rule f 
is even more disfavored because it requires a reviewing court to preemptively terminate the class aspects of litigation,solely on the basis of what is alleged in the complaint,and before plaintiffs are permitted to complete the discovery to which they would otherwise be entitled on questions relevant to class certification.
mazzola roomster,d,citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also cholakyan mercedes benz usa,llc,d,noting that it is in fact rare to strike class allegations in advance of a motion for class certification and collecting cases.accordingly,a court should typically await the development of a factual record before determining whether the case should move forward on a representative basis.
here,the district court analysis as to the class allegations was deeply intertwined with its dismissal of plaintiffs substantive claims.the court ruled that the facts as alleged did not suggest the existence of an official policy that applied to each of the more than discrete occupational classes plaintiffs claim make up the potential class.what is more,the district court believed that the existence of such a widespread policy across such a diverse group of employees was simply not plausible.
as we have explained,however,the core of plaintiffs allegations is in fact straightforward namely,that through a combination of timekeeping policies and other human resources practices,bmc employees were consistently required to work through their meal breaks and for periods of time before and after their regular work hours without compensation.this work took place openly at the hospital facilities,with the employer actual or constructive knowledge.accepting the complaint allegations as true,as we must,these facts support the plausible inference that this combination of policies affected bmc employees across the board,notwithstanding their different roles within the company.even if the court had concerns about plaintiffs ability to represent such a diverse group of employees,those concerns do not justify the drastic measure of striking the class allegations in their entirety.twombly,at w hen a complaint adequately states a claim,it may not be dismissed based on a district court assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.moreover,the district court has many tools at its disposal to address concerns regarding the appropriate contours of the putative class,including redefining the class during the certification process or creating subclasses.fengler crouse health,d,granting class certification in hospital compensation case,but excluding care workers,such as cafeteria workers and security staff,because plaintiffs failed to show that these employees worked without pay with hospital administrators knowledge.therefore,plaintiffs should have the chance to prove their assertions through discovery and a motion for class certification.
defendants suggest that plaintiffs invited the district court to resolve the class issues on the pleadings when they moved for conditional certification of a flsa collective action on behalf of bmc employees affected by the alleged meal break deduction policy.we fail to see how plaintiffs motion supports striking the class allegations at this early stage.the mere fact that plaintiffs raised the issue to the court did not warrant confining the inquiry to the pleadings alone,and the trial court would have been well within its discretion to defer ruling on the conditional certification request until a later stage of the case.see,perez prime steak house rest,d,wl,at.moreover,plaintiffs point out that the district court elected not to address the evidence plaintiffs proffered in support of their motion for conditional certification.this fact emphasizes the prematurity of the district court decision to strike the class and collective allegations on the pleadings.
consequently,we must vacate the court order striking the class and collective action allegations from the complaint.
leave to amend 
finally,plaintiffs request that they be given leave to correct any deficiencies in the pleading,to the extent that the district court dismissal is affirmed.federal rule of civil procedure a states that a court should freely give leave when justice so requires.this rule does not mean that a trial court must mindlessly grant every request for leave to amend.aponte torres of,cir.leave to amend is appropriately denied when,inter alia,the request is characterized by undue delay,bad faith,futility,or the absence of due diligence on the movant part.calderón serra wilmington trust,cir quoting palmer champion,cir.we review the district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.platten hg bermuda exempted ltd,cir.
here,we affirm the dismissal of the flsa claims against canavan,as well as the fraud claims.these claims were originally pled in the two separate complaints that initiated manning i and manning ii,respectively.the district court identified a number of deficiencies in both of these pleadings,and the amended complaint now before us represents plaintiffs attempt to cure those problems.while the trial judge could certainly have given plaintiffs yet another try,the court was by no means required to do so.this is especially true as to the fraud allegations,where plaintiffs fell far short of meeting the heightened pleading standard imposed by rule b.although the district court was incorrect to dismiss all of plaintiffs claims,it was within its discretion to conclude that the time had arrived to settle the pleadings.
we also observe that many of the hospital compensation lawsuits being brought throughout the country,including those litigated by plaintiffs counsel in this case,use complaints that assert the same basic factual allegations and claims raised here.a number of courts have expressed their frustration with the lack of detail in these complaints.see pruell,at collecting cases and noting district courts displeasure with their complaints.while these cases may involve complaints that differ in some respects from the pleading at issue in this case,the dismissal of many of these similar allegations,including those written by plaintiffs counsel here,should have put plaintiffs counsel on notice of the necessity of a thorough drafting job.this circumstance further supports the trial judge conclusion that giving them another chance would have served little purpose.
in sum,we must defer to the district court judgment so long as the record evinces an adequate reason for the denial.aponte torres,at.given the facts of this case we can not say that denial of further leave to amend was an abuse of discretion.
for the reasons stated,we vacate the district court order in part and affirm it in part.specifically,we vacate the dismissal of the flsa claim against bmc and ullian count i,the contract claims counts ii iv,and ix,and the money had and received,unjust enrichment,and conversion claims counts v,vi,and x.we also vacate the district court order striking the class and collective action allegations.
we affirm the dismissal of the flsa claims against canavan count i.we also affirm the district court exercise of jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims,and the court directive requiring plaintiffs to file a single consolidated complaint alleging all their causes of action.further,we affirm the dismissal of the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims counts vii and viii,and the denial of leave to amend.
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.the parties are to bear their own costs.
so ordered.
i join the court thorough opinion in all but one respect.i part ways with my colleagues as to whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim against elaine ullian,bmc erstwhile president and ceo.in my view,the plaintiffs vague,boilerplate allegations do not nudge their claim against ullian across the line from conceivable to plausible.see bell atl.twombly.thus,i respectfully dissent from the court decision on this point.
as the majority explains,our precedents use an economic reality test to gauge whether an individual defendant is the plaintiff employer for flsa purposes see chao hotel oasis,cir baystate alternative staffing,herman,cir donovan agnew,cir.this test focuse s on the role played by the corporate officer in causing the corporation to undercompensate employees.baystate,at.r elevant indicia of employer status include the defendant operational control over significant aspects of the business and ownership interest in the business,if any these factors matter because they suggest that an individual controls a corporation financial affairs and can cause the corporation to compensate or not to compensate employees in accordance with the flsa.see hotel oasis,at.this focus on actual operational control means that a supervisor title does not in itself establish or preclude his or her liability under the flsa.lamonica safe hurricane shutters,cir.
importantly,our cases warn against construing the flsa definition of employer too broadly when ruling on claims against individual defendants.see hotel oasis,at baystate,at agnew,at.in our first encounter with individual liability under the flsa,we concluded that it should not lightly be inferred that congress intended to disregard in this context the shield from personal liability which is one of the major purposes of doing business in a corporate form.agnew,at.we thus eschewed a literal reading of the flsa broadly inclusive definition of employer,which would impose personal liability on any supervisory employee,and adopted the economic reality test instead.see baystate,at reaffirming that such an expansive application of the definition of an employer to a personal liability determination pursuant to the flsa is untenable.we should apply that test with this concern about unbounded liability in mind.see hotel oasis,at describing agnew as narrowly deciding that the flsa did not preclude personal liability for officers with significant ownership interests and significant operational control,including over compensation of employees,who personally made decisions leading to undercompensation agnew,at.
one other factor impacts how we must analyze the plaintiffs claim against ullian this case,unlike agnew,baystate,or hotel oasis,was resolved on a motion to dismiss.thus,for the plaintiffs claim against ullian to proceed,their complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting twombly,at.put another way,the complaint factual content,gianfrancesco town of wrentham,cir,must allow us to draw the reasonable inference that ullian was the plaintiffs employer under the economic reality test.this inference can not rest solely on allegations that,while not stating ultimate legal conclusions,are nevertheless so threadbare or speculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory and the factual.pruell caritas christi,cir quoting peñalbert rosa fortuño burset,cir internal quotation mark omitted.here,the plaintiffs claim against ullian relies on just such borderline allegations.see id.
most of the allegations against ullian amount to this she was bmc ceo and had many of the responsibilities one would expect a ceo to have.the complaint says that ullian controlled significant functions of the business was involved in the budget for the hospital was involved in regular presentations and meetings in the community on behalf of bmc had the authority to,and did,make decisions that concerned the policies defendants adopted and the implementation of those policies had the authority to,and did,make decisions that concerned defendants operations,including functions related to employment,human resources,training,payroll,and benefits and was actively involved in recruiting,hiring,and reductions in force due to budget cuts.thus,we know that ullian had many of the if vaguely described responsibilities that a ceo normally has,but our cases make clear that merely holding a supervisory or executive position is not enough to trigger individual flsa liability.see agnew,at see also irizarry catsimatidis,wl,at cir.july,most circuits require that a company owner,president,or stockholder must have at least some degree of involvement in the way the company interacts with employees to be a flsa employer.and many of the allegations that seek to tie ullian to the plaintiffs employment situation are nominally cast in factual terms but are so general and conclusory as to amount merely to an assertion that unspecified facts exist to conform to the legal blueprint.menard csx,cir.for example as president and ceo,elaine ullian actively advised defendants agents on the enforcement of the illegal policies complained of in this case.it is hard to imagine what facts underlie this assertion.
some allegations are more specific we are told of ullian role in overseeing a merger,constructing a new hospital building,implementing an electronic records system,setting policy regarding pharmaceutical and medical device representatives,and taking part in a rally supporting services for the underprivileged.taken together,these allegations plausibly establish that ullian had the authority to manage certain aspects of the business operations on a basis.baystate,at.but,in baystate,that was not enough we also called for some indication of personal responsibility for making decisions about the conduct of the business that contributed to the violations of the act.id.as the second circuit recently put it 
evidence that an individual is an owner or officer of a company,or otherwise makes corporate decisions that have nothing to do with an employee function,is insufficient to demonstrate employer status.instead,to be an employer,an individual defendant must possess control over a company actual operations in a manner that relates to a plaintiff employment.
irizarry,wl,at patel.wargo,cir defendant who was both president and vice president of a corporation,as well as a director and principal stockholder,was not an employer because he did not have operational control of significant aspects of the company functions,including compensation of employees or other matters in relation to an employee citing agnew,at 
the closest the complaint comes to alleging that ullian had operational control over plaintiffs employment and compensation is in the allegations that she had the authority to hire and fire employees sought to ensure minority representation in the workforce was involved in layoffs and was involved in the negotiation with unions,including relating to the unfair labor practices of nurses.but these fairly broad allegations,even when read together with the rest of the complaint,see ocasio hernández fortuno burset,cir,do not create a plausible inference that ullian played a role in causing bmc to undercompensate the plaintiffs,baystate,at.to be sure,i do not think our cases require,at the pleading stage,particular facts showing that an individual defendant made a specific decision or took a particular action that directly caused the plaintiffs undercompensation.but something more than boilerplate assertions of authority is required a complaint must present facts plausibly showing that the plaintiffs compensation was sufficiently within the defendant bailiwick to justify holding her personally liable agnew,at.here,i see no such facts.the gist of the plaintiffs complaint is that bmc automated timekeeping system combined with its inflexible work and training requirements to cause systematic undercompensation.there are no allegations connecting ullian to any component of this regime,let alone establishing that she had operational control over it.see baystate,at.
finally,as the majority acknowledges,an individual flsa defendant ownership interest in the business is a major consideration under our precedents.see hotel oasis,at agnew,at.here,there is of course no allegation that ullian had any ownership interest in bmc,which is a organization.moreover,bmc is a large organization.all else being equal,bmc size makes it less plausible that the president and ceo had a hand in causing the employees undercompensation than it would be in,say,a smaller,closely held company.in sum,given the allegations in the complaint and our determination that an expansive definition of the term employer in this context is untenable,baystate,at,i can not conclude that the plaintiffs have stated a claim against ullian.
i am cognizant that,before discovery,a plaintiff can not know everything about a defendant potentially wrongful conduct,especially when it comes to the inner workings of a corporate or institutional defendant.thus,our cases have recognized that some latitude may be appropriate where a plausible claim may be indicated based on what is known,at least where some of the information needed may be in the control of the defendants.menard,at alteration in original quoting pruell,at.but a plausible claim is still required.and twombly and iqbal make clear that a claim is not plausible when the complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability.iqbal,at quoting twombly,at.that is what we have here.it is perhaps possible that ullian is the plaintiffs employer under the flsa.the allegations in the complaint are consistent with that possibility.but broad assertions that ullian had authority that might encompass the requisite degree of control over the plaintiffs employment do not raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of liability.twombly,at.for that reason,i respectfully dissent from the court decision that the plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim against ullian.i join the court opinion in all other respects.
attached to the complaint is an article from the new york times describing some of the hospital compensation cases.this article quotes a registered nurse who worked for a hospital in pennsylvania most nurses put the patient first we often gave up lunch breaks to see that a patient was taken care of properly if you brought your lunch from home or got food in the cafeteria and took it to the nursing unit,you would be interrupted by phone calls,by physicians and family members who wanted to talk to you.we really did not have an uninterrupted meal break.
of the federal claims,only the dismissal of the flsa claim is before us on appeal.
the district court order dismissing plaintiffs amended complaint suggests otherwise,given the observation that its order in manning ii directed plaintiffs to file a cause of action under the lmra in that case.the court formal orders on the motions in manning i and manning ii do not expressly direct the plaintiffs to file a single consolidated note,however,that the district court docket in manning i contains an entry dated,which includes the clerk note regarding the joint hearing.this entry states,with emphasis added amended pleadings due by complaint.the reference to complaint bears out the parties description of the court directive.
indeed,plaintiffs have not identified a case where a circuit court imposed flsa liability on a human resources manager who possessed no ownership stake in the company.but see carpenter refrigeration sales,d,ruling that head of human resources department was employer under family and medical leave act.
we note that defendants do not address mccarthy,a nonunion plaintiff whose flsa claims can not be covered by a cba.mccarthy flsa claims would thus appear to remain untouched even if we accepted defendants view of the law.
plaintiffs maintain that defendants should have raised this argument in a cross appeal,because adopting it would alter or amend the judgment in defendants favor.to the contrary,the district court order dismissed plaintiffs flsa claims with prejudice.accepting defendants exhaustion argument would cause the same result the dismissal of plaintiffs flsa claims with prejudice.affirming the dismissal using this reasoning would be an appropriate exercise of our ability to affirm on any basis present in the record,and no was necessary to put this issue before us.see,united fire cas.boulder plaza residential,llc,cir smith johnson johnson,cir rivero city cnty.of san francisco,cir.
in a notable omission,both defendants and plaintiffs have failed to discuss or even cite agawam in their briefs,despite its clear applicability to this case.
the supreme court opinion in barrentine arkansas best freight,contained broad language strongly suggesting that flsa claims were never appropriate for arbitration.id.at.but the court recent opinion in penn plaza llc pyett,held that a provision requiring the arbitration of statutory age discrimination claims was enforceable,and indicated that unless a statutory scheme specifically removed a particular class of grievances from the nlra broad sweep,a cba arbitration clause should be given full effect.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,pyett disapproved of barrentine and similar opinions addressing other employment statutes,insofar as they suggested that federal statutory claims could not be addressed properly through arbitration.id.at.pyett strongly indicates that flsa claims are indeed arbitrable.some courts,however,have suggested that the flsa structure and language may distinguish it from the adea and other employment discrimination statutes for these purposes.compare austin owens brockway glass container,cir observing that title vii and americans with disabilities act contain provisions encouraging arbitration,whereas flsa does not,with kuehner dickinson,cir stating that employee was u nable to identify
