appellants represent a class of mental health patients institutionalized in the norristown state hospital,a large congregate psychiatric hospital located in southeast pennsylvania,who are qualified for and wish to be placed in a setting they seek declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to remedy what they claim are violations of their federal statutory rights to a more accelerated program of deinstitutionalization.they appeal from the judgment for the commonwealth entered by the district court following a bench trial.appellants contend that the district court erroneously interpreted the applicable legal principles.the issue raised is significant as it implicates the extent to which the state may rely on general cost concerns to avoid its statutory responsibility to eliminate disabilities discrimination.
facts and procedural history 
appellants represent approximately class members with serious and persistent mental disabilities who are institutionalized at norristown state hospital nsh.approximately of the class members are classified as patients approximately months and of the class members are classified as patients approximately and a half years.appellee department of public welfare of the commonwealth of pennsylvania dpw is an agency of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the commonwealth that provides publicly funded mental health care in institutional and community settings.also named as a defendant is feather houston in her official capacity as pennsylvania secretary of public welfare.the office of mental health and substance abuse services omhsas is a department of dpw that has the responsibility to ens ure local access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.app.at.omhsas operates nine psychiatric facilities and one nursing facility throughout pennsylvania.nsh is one such facility.app.at.amici curiae represent fourteen former state mental health agency administrators and have submitted a brief in support of appellants.
appellants filed this class action lawsuit in september,claiming that,because the class members are qualified and prepared for services,their continued institutionalization violates the and integration mandates of the americans with disabilities act ada,and d,and section of the rehabilitation act ra,and d they claim that dpw has failed to provide services to them in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and has developed no plan to assure that this be done.they also claim that dpw has failed to require treatment teams to prepare appropriate individualized assessments of the service needs of the class members that are a prerequisite for community placement.in their answer,defendants admit some of the detailed allegations of the amended complaint and deny others.essentially,defendants assert as an affirmative defense the analysis in olmstead,d,where a plurality of the supreme court allowed the states to resist modifications that would effect a fundamental alteration of the states services and programs.although appellants acknowledge that the statutes would not require additional community placements if the increase would require a fundamental alteration of the commonwealth policy and budget,appellants argue that the cost of providing the additional placements would be defrayed by from bed closures in nsh.they further argue that cost concerns alone do not provide the commonwealth grounds for a defense to their claims.
on may,the parties filed extensive joint stipulations regarding the facts underlying this case.app.at.in pertinent part,they stated that between and,dpw closed thirteen psychiatric facilities,including two facilities in southeastern pennsylvania in and.app.at.
the joint stipulations explain that one way in which dpw closed hospitals is by moving qualified patients into community care programs.in order to determine when a patient is ready for community care,nsh county program officers hold monthly discharge planning meetings,at which staff and county representatives conduct independent,ongoing assessments of each consumer discharge readiness and aftercare needs,and address unresolved impediments to discharge.app.at.however,nsh does not maintain formal waiting lists for community services.app.at.
the parties also stipulated that dpw receives the bulk of its mental health funding from the commonwealth through a budgetary process set out in.app.at.under,county programs must annually develop and submit to dwp and omhsas an assessment of needs for mental health services and budget estimates.app.at.omhsas submits a proposed budget to dpw,which can modify it,and dpw submits the budget to the governor office of budget.the governor then formulates a comprehensive budget and submits it to the legislature,which ultimately enacts dpw budget.app.at.
dpw primary funding mechanism for new community care placements has been the community hospital integration projects program chipp and the southeastern integration projects program sipp.app.at.the number of community care placements has varied widely from year to year in in in in in and proposed in.app.at.
the stipulations describe instances in which dpw did not request the full amount of mental health monies requested by the counties and instances in which dpw initially requested additional community placements,but the governor informed dpw that no funding would be available or rejected the request.app.at.however,apart from the budget process,dpw has funded additional community care slots through savings in overtime.app.at.
following a bench trial in may,the district court issued a memorandum opinion on september,in favor of dpw.frederick dep t of pub.welfare,d.the district court held that appellants were not entitled to the requested relief because it would have required a fundamental alteration of the commonwealth programming and budgetary allocations.the district court also found that providing additional community placements would have negatively affected other state residents with mental disabilities who received services in an institutional setting.
appellants contend that the district court erred by stating that the immediate extra cost coupled with a lack of immediate associated with their requested relief,without more,provided dpw with a defense.appellants further argue that the district court erred in finding that dpw involvement in the legislative process was beyond judicial scrutiny.frederick,d at.
discussion 
we may set aside the district court conclusions of fact only for clear error,but we subject its conclusions of law to plenary review.see,goldstein johnson johnson,cir.
statutory framework 
this case arises under title ii of the ada and section of the ra.title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reasons of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefit of services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.the ada largely mirrors section of the ra,which states as follows 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any executive agency or by the united states postal service.
a.we have construed the provisions of the ra and the ada in light of their close similarity of language and purpose.see helen didario,cir,cert.denied,d.
the ada and ra principles culminate in their integration mandates,which direct states to administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.t he most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities is a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.pt,app.a.in short,where appropriate for the patient,both the ada and the ra favor integrated,treatment over institutionalization.significantly,none of the parties contests that proposition.
the parties agree that this case is governed by the supreme court decision in olmstead,d.in olmstead,two mental health patients alleged that the state of georgia violated the ada integration mandate by unnecessarily segregating them in mental health institutions and failing to place them in treatment programs.id.at.the court found that the ada reflects the congressional conclusion that unjustified institutionalization perpetuates prejudice against mental health patients and severely diminishes their quality of life.id.at.the olmstead plurality held that,under certain circumstances,unnecessary institutionalization and segregation may constitute discrimination.id.at.
justice ginsburg,writing for the plurality emphasized that the integration mandate is not boundless.id.at.it is qualified by the reasonable modifications and clauses,which provide that 
a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.
b.in light of these qualifications,the plurality held that unnecessary institutionalization only violates the ada when the following conditions are met 
the state treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate,the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual,and the placement can be reasonably accommodated,taking into account a the resources available to the state and b the needs of others with mental disabilities.
olmstead,at.the olmstead plurality thus made clear that a state may defend against disability discrimination claims by establishing that the requested community services would require a fundamental alteration of the state mental health system.id 
here,the parties do not dispute that appellants have satisfied the first two olmstead requirements.the district court found that of the appellants were qualified for mental health services and an even larger portion of the class expressed affirmative interest in being placed in care.the point of contention instead arises from the interpretation of olmstead s third prong regarding reasonable accommodation and the defense.
reasonable modifications and the defense 
the olmstead plurality explained the clause and defense as follows 
sensibly construed,the component of the regulation would allow the state to show that,in the allocation of available resources,immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable,given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities.
id.at.the plurality thus characterized the state available resources and responsibility to other institutionalized mental health patients as primary considerations in evaluating a defense.
although olmstead permits courts to consider a state financial burdens in evaluating the defense,the olmstead plurality expressly proscribed two methods of.first,courts may not simply compare the cost of providing the plaintiffs with immediate relief against the entirety of the state mental health budget because the state mental health budget will almost always dwarf the requested relief.id.at.second,courts may not merely compare the cost of institutionalization against the cost of health services because such a comparison would not account for the state financial obligation to continue to operate partially full institutions with fixed overhead costs.id.at.it is notable for our purposes that the plurality did not envision the defense to be a rare one that states would seldom be able to invoke.see id.at.eschewing formulation of defense as one permitted only in the most limited of circumstances.
in his concurrence,justice kennedy underscored his opposition to judicial involvement in political budgetary decisions outside the province of the law.he stated that federal courts should accord deference to state policymakers programmatic and political funding decisions regarding mental health funding 
no state has unlimited resources,and each must make hard decisions on how much to allocate to treatment of diseases and disabilities.if,for example,funds for care and treatment of the mentally ill,including the severely mentally ill,are reduced in order to support programs directed to the treatment and care of other disabilities,the decision may be unfortunate.the judgment,however,is a political one and not within the reach of the statute.grave constitutional concerns are raised when a federal court is given the authority to review the state choices in basic matters such as establishing or declining to establish new programs.it is not reasonable to read the ada to permit court intervention in these decisions.
id.at.kennedy,concurring justice kennedy further stated that states have considerable latitude in analyzing the comparative costs of treatment 
the state is entitled to wide discretion in adopting its own systems of cost analysis,and,if it chooses,to allocate health care resources based on fixed and overhead costs for whole institutions and programs.we must be cautious when we seek to infer specific rules limiting states choices when congress has used only general language in the controlling statute.
id.at.kennedy,concurring.
needs of other mentally ill persons 
olmstead explains that the ada does not compel states to provide relief where the requested relief would require the state to neglect the needs of other segments of the mentally disabled population who are not litigants before the court.id.at.recognizing states need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities,and the states obligation to administer services with an even hand.
in addition,the plurality reasoned that a state may avoid liability by providing a comprehensive,effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings,and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace and was not controlled by the state endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated.id.at.it is this language that informs our decision in this case.
application to this case 
appellants,along with amici,argue that the district court erroneously construed the defense with respect to three primary factors cost constraints and consideration of institutionalized persons past progress in deinstitutionalization and planning for deinstitutionalization.
budget constraints and needs of others 
as mentioned above,olmstead directs courts to evaluate the defense in light of the state resources and its responsibility to continue providing services to mental health patients other than those seeking community care.
the bulk of appellants objections have focused on the following statement in the conclusions of law section of the district court opinion 
even if cost savings may eventually be achieved through deinstitutionalization,the immediate extra cost,and the concomitant lack of immediate aggregate cost saving,is sufficient to establish that a fundamental alteration would be required if the relief sought by community granted in this case.
frederick,d at internal citations omitted.appellants argue that the commonwealth articulation of additional costs that would attend deinstitutionalization does not automatically give rise to a defense.furthermore,appellants continue,these cost concerns do not automatically make a requested modification unreasonable.in sum,appellants urge that the commonwealth fiscal concerns,without more,can not provide the sole basis for a defense.dpw acknowledges that government agencies frequently must spend money in order to meet their ada and ra obligations,absent a windfall of.
we have not previously considered the extent to which states may assert a defense based on fiscal concerns alone,but now hold that if the district court opinion is read as focusing only on immediate costs,as appellants contend,it would be inconsistent with olmstead and the governing statutes.first,olmstead lists several factors that are relevant to the defense,including but not limited to the state ability to continue meeting the needs of other institutionalized mental health patients for whom community placement is not appropriate,whether the state has a waiting list for community placements,and whether the state has developed a comprehensive plan to move eligible patients into community care settings.olmstead,at.the court noted that section of the ra specifies that 
the and undue hardship inquiry requires not simply an assessment of the cost of the accommodation in relation to the recipient overall budget,but a analysis weighing factors that include t he overall size of the recipient program with respect to number of employees,number and type of facilities,and size of budget t he type of the recipient operation,including the composition and structure of the recipient workforce and t he nature and cost of the accommodation needed.cfr c see cfr c same.
second,at least one court of appeals and one district court have held that a singular focus upon a state fiscal constraints will not suffice to establish a defense.in fisher oklahoma health care authority,cir,the plaintiffs challenged the state decision to limit the number of prescriptions provided for outpatients with disabilities who received medical assistance,irrespective of medical necessity,while it continued providing unlimited prescriptions to disabled inpatients in nursing homes.the fisher plaintiffs argued that because the policy would require disabled persons to move to nursing homes in order to continue receiving full coverage of all of their prescriptions,the state had violated the ada integration mandate.id.at.oklahoma countered that granting plaintiffs requested relief would have required a fundamental alteration in light of its fiscal crisis.id.at.the district court entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs because they were not currently institutionalized nor did they face a risk of institutionalization.id.at.
after holding that institutionalization was not a prerequisite to plaintiffs ada claim,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit rejected the state defense,stating that oklahoma fiscal problems did not establish a per se defense.id.at.the court reviewed the legislative history of the ada and concluded that congress contemplated that states sometimes would be required to make financial outlays,even in the face of mounting fiscal problems.id.at.the court thus decided that such financial obligations did not automatically relieve the state from meeting congress integration mandate.id.because the court found that the plaintiffs may have had a meritorious claim under the ada,it reversed the district court grant of summary judgment and remanded for consideration of whether the plaintiffs requested modifications would fundamentally alter the program.id.at.
similarly,in makin hawaii,d,a class of mentally retarded persons on a waiting list for hawaii program sued the state for violations of the ada and the ra,seeking additional community placements and the development of a program to encourage movement on the waiting list at a reasonable pace.hawaii attempted to assert a defense based on the theory that increased community placements would require the state to ignore state and federal funding limits and alter its existing programs by establishing an unlimited state fund for community mental health services.id.at.the district court rejected the state defense,noting that a potential funding problem,without more,did not give rise to a defense.id.we agree with the makin court and with appellants that states can not sustain a defense based solely upon the conclusory invocation of fiscal constraints.
we do not read the district court opinion in this case as relying solely on the increased costs that additional community placements would entail,notwithstanding the sentence in its opinion that suggests a lack of alone will sustain pennsylvania defense.although the court noted the absence of and the requisite spending that new community placements would entail,it undertook more comprehensive analyses that focused upon dpw unsuccessful attempts at fund procurement through the governor budget.app.at.it recognized that dpw had submitted evidence that it had responsibly spent its budgetary allocation,overtime savings to increase funding for mental health services,and had a favorable bed closure rate when compared with western massachusetts,which is considered to be a model region for deinstitutionalization.app.at.moreover,the district court emphasized that omhsas ability to increase the number of community care placements was hampered by community opposition to further expansion in the neighborhoods where the community centers were located,app.at,and that increasing the number of community placements would eventually lead to a diminution of services for institutionalized persons under the commonwealth care.app.at.
appellants challenge the commonwealth position on cost constraints,arguing that the relief they request would require only negligible cost increases dpw could increase its community care budget by simply requesting additional funds from the legislature and dpw could shuffle its current budget to favor increased community care programs.we consider and reject each argument 
first,appellants dispute the district court factual conclusion that moving currently institutionalized persons into community settings would require significant capital outlay by the commonwealth.because appellants anticipate that the lion share of the community care costs would be offset by the savings reaped from hospital bed closures,they estimate that the additional community placements requested would have a net cost of million.appellants cost comparisons,however,are precisely the sort of reductive cost comparisons proscribed by the olmstead plurality,at,as well as by justice kennedy.id.at.kennedy,concurring.in following olmstead and rejecting appellants disfavored methodology,the district court did not err.
second,appellants argue that the district court erred by not considering dpw ability to lobby the legislature for additional funds during the budgetary process.under the budget process in the commonwealth,dpw must submit a report to the commonwealth requesting an operating budget for the upcoming year before dpw receives its budgetary allocation.the governor may then accept or reject dpw request.appellants contend that dpw does not request the full amount necessary to fund all of the community placements requested.the district court concluded that the prebudgetary process is beyond judicial scrutiny.frederick,d at.we agree.this is not an issue of legislative immunity,which dpw has not claimed,but a recognition of the realities of the budgetary process.dpw explains that it would not have been able to request the full amount required to fund all of the community placements needed because it must make its budget request pursuant to the governor guidelines,which limit the that it may request.that process is unchallenged here.we can not hold,as appellants would have us do,that dpw should have requested additional funding amounts beyond that which is permitted under the governor guidelines.
finally,appellants argue that the district court erred by concluding that dpw responsibly used its budgeted monies because dpw should have shifted money from other programs to fund additional community placements.assuming a limited pool of budgetary resources,if dpw had siphoned off monies appropriated for institutional care for mental health patients in order to increase community placements,dpw would have run afoul of olmstead prohibition on favoring those who commenced civil actions at the expense of institutionalized mental health patients who are not before the court.any effort to institute that would disadvantage other segments of the mentally disabled population would thus fail under olmstead.at.
however,appellants argue that dpw should its funds to favor additional community placements to the detriment of budget items that are not associated with community care or t
