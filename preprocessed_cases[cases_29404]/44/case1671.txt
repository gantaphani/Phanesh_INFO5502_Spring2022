this appeal arises from a telephone call that aster clem made from her fairfax county,virginia home to the local police department,asking for help with her year old husband,who suffers from dementia,depression,and various physical problems.clem told the police dispatcher that clem had stopped taking the medication prescribed for his mental illnesses and that his condition was poor he had been urinating on himself and the floor,dropping lit cigarettes on the carpet,not eating for three days,and refusing to see his doctor,move,or do anything.officers shannon corbeau and eric nelson responded to the dispatch call,arriving simultaneously at the clems home.within a short time after their arrival each officer had subjected clem to pepper spray,and officer corbeau had shot clem three times,severely injuring him neither officer suffered any injury.
subsequently,clem filed this action,alleging that the individual officers had used excessive force in violation of his constitutional rights and state tort law,and that fairfax county and its police chief had failed to provide the officers with adequate training and supervision.the district court granted summary judgment to the county,the police chief,and officer nelson on all claims,but denied summary judgment to officer corbeau on one excessive force claim and the state law claims.we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
aside from the skeletal account set forth above,the parties sharply disagree about virtually all relevant facts.the following summary generally sets forth the facts in the light most favorable to the party,here clem.see winfield bass,cir noting that an appellate court must consider the actual evidence presented viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when,as here,the appealing official asserts that the district court ignored undisputed material facts dictating entitlement to qualified immunity.however,we have also included some facts that clem disputes in order to provide a better understanding of the controversy.
after the dispatcher received clem call on november,he issued a message asking patrol officers near the clem home to render assistance,characterizing the call as a mental.officers corbeau and nelson arrived at the clems small home simultaneously.they were met at the front door by paulos yacob,a nephew who was there to assist in persuading clem to see his doctor.yacob gave the officers further information about clem condition and led them upstairs to the small breakfast nook where the clems were sitting.
it was apparent to both officers that clem was mentally ill,and,in officer corbeau words,out of it.clem has no memory of what took place during the police response the account that follows depends on the testimony of other witnesses and on available physical evidence.the officers recall that clem appearance was unkempt,and that he sat at the breakfast table smoking,with his head down,staring blankly at the floor.at one point a cigarette dropped from clem fingers onto the carpet,where he let it lie until it was stamped out by officer nelson.both officers testified that they observed no bulges in clem pockets or waistline nor anything in his open shirt indicating the presence of a weapon.in short,clem was neither responsive nor threatening but,in officer corbeau words,real calm.
the officers began talking with clem and yacob,and after a few minutes were able to attract clem attention.at first clem seemed open to persuasion and agreed to go see his doctor.judging that the situation was under control,officer nelson radioed the dispatcher to say no other units are needed.as clem kept talking,however,he apparently began to change his mind.he may also have become officers remember him making incoherent or nonresponsive statements.he complained that his chest was hurting,and that the doctors would not be able to help him.shortly,clem became agitated.
officer corbeau maintains that clem patted his pocket and threatened corbeau,saying i got something right here that can kill you.but no one else present in the small breakfast.clem,yacob,and officer hearing this statement.clem has testified that her husband neither made any threat nor said he had anything in his pocket.officer nelson asserts that clem did reach for his pocket,feeling it,but that t here was nothing there.indeed,officer nelson further testified that t hroughout the period of time that he w as in the clem home he was satisfied that robert clem did not have a weapon.as the conversation continued,clem went red in the face and stood up,raising his empty hands.according to corbeau,clem again verbally threatened him but the other witnesses testify that they heard no threat.clem remembers,instead,that officer corbeau had provoked her husband by standing right in front of him and yelling at him,insisting that he go to his doctor.
at this point,officer corbeau discharged a cloud of pepper spray that struck clem and,both officers agree,quickly disabled him.according to corbeau,clem backed up rather quickly and grabbed his eyeballs.nelson testified that clem was disabled and dismay ed,feeling the effects of the pepper spray clem made a moaning sound or groaning,and motion ed about his eyes,grabbing his face.clem,officer nelson testified,was not being aggressive to anyone.
officer nelson then went to assist clem and yacob,who had also been struck by some of the pepper spray.he led the two of them out of the breakfast area,and through the living room and down a hallway to the bathroom,where they could wash off the pepper spray.nelson then descended a flight of stairs,leaving his partner alone on the second floor with clem,and poked his head outside to spit the taste of pepper spray into the street.he called for medical assistance and a supervisor,but did not warn of any danger or ask for any backup.
when officer nelson finished the call,about two minutes after the spraying,he walked back up the stairs and found clem in the living room.before long,clem began to recover from the pepper spray and began cursing at and walking toward nelson the officers agree that clem hands were open and out in front of his body.the officers have described clem movements variously as grabbing,flailing,and waving his arms around.nelson backed a few feet away from clem,and,when clem continued walking,nelson hit him in the face with a sustained stream of pepper spray lasting several seconds.
according to corbeau,who was watching from a few feet away,clem turned away from nelson immediately.and,both officers agree,clem made either no contact at all or just brushed nelson arm.nelson contends that the pepper spray had no effect on clem,but offers no other explanation as to why clem stopped moving toward him indeed,nelson testified that although he did not punch,push,or otherwise physically force clem,nevertheless clem did turn away.as soon as he turned,clem went around a table in the middle of the room,toward the hallway that led to the bathroom.clem,who was still in the bathroom,heard her husband breathing with great difficulty,as though the pepper spray had constricted his nose and throat.
at this moment officer corbeau,still watching clem and officer nelson,stood near the head of the hallway with his inch,metal baton fully extended in his left hand.corbeau maintains that he told clem to get back and that clem only snarled and threatened him.clem,just a few feet from corbeau,recalls no such warning from corbeau,or threat from that her husband was making a noise that sounded like hah,hah,hah as a result of his breathing difficulty.officer corbeau then backed about four feet down the foot hallway until he was even with the open bathroom door.although corbeau now asserts that clem rapidly charged him,both officers originally told police investigators that clem was not running,but rather stomping forward in a very odd manner like a robot,with his hands open and waving in front of him,movements consistent with his recent subjection to pepper spray 
clem and yacob,who were still in the bathroom,saw corbeau come into view in the hall through the bathroom doorway.they next saw officer corbeau unholster his duty weapon,place the weapon in his right hand,and,without telling clem that he must stop or be shot,fire down the hallway three times in quick succession directly at clem.one bullet went through clem leg two more lodged in his intestines.
officer nelson,who was less than five feet behind clem when the shots were fired,testified that he was shocked and surprised by the shooting.it is undisputed that officer nelson immediate reaction was to call out no nelson had been following clem,more or less keeping pace but a few steps behind him.nelson had not unholstered his own weapon,and apparently did not expect his partner to do so,either his pursuit took him directly into corbeau line of fire,and nelson was fortunate not to be hit by an errant round.neither he nor officer corbeau was injured in any way,and no weapons were found on or around clem.
on september,clem filed suit in state court,alleging that officers corbeau and nelson had used unconstitutionally excessive force when they subjected him to pepper spray and that corbeau had also done so when he shot clem three times.in addition,clem alleged that fairfax county and its police chief should be held liable for failure to provide adequate training and supervision.finally,he brought state law claims for gross negligence,assault,and battery.
after the defendants removed the case to federal court,clem moved for partial summary judgment with respect to his claims against officer corbeau,and the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted summary judgment to the county,the police chief,and officer nelson on all claims.the court granted officer corbeau summary judgment on the claim that his use of pepper spray constituted excessive force,but denied summary judgment to both clem and officer corbeau on the excessive force claim that arose from the shooting.only officer corbeau appeals.we now consider his contention that he is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to clem excessive force shooting claim,but dismiss his interlocutory appeal of denial of summary judgment on clem state law claims 
the supreme court recently clarified that in excessive force cases,as in all other cases,entitlement to qualified immunity must be analyzed in two steps,which are to be considered in proper sequence.see saucier katz,d.as a threshold question,a court must ask whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.if the answer is no then the analysis ends the plaintiff can not prevail.id.
if the answer is yes,then the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established at the time of the events at issue.id.this determination must be made in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.if the right was not clearly established in the specific context of the case that is,if it was not clear to a reasonable officer that the conduct in which he allegedly engaged was unlawful in the situation he confronted then the law affords immunity from suit.id.accordingly,the answer to both saucier questions must be in the affirmative in order for a plaintiff to defeat a defendant police officer motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.
we turn,then,to the initial question whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,clem,the facts alleged show that officer corbeau conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier.at.clem maintains that the facts outlined above,considered in the light most favorable to him,demonstrate that officer corbeau violated his fourth amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force by police officers in effecting an arrest or other seizure.
indisputably,the fourth amendment prohibition on unreasonable seizures bars police officers from using excessive force against a free citizen,like clem.see graham connor,d.whether an officer has used excessive force is judged by a standard of objective reasonableness.id.at.we do not inquire into an officer motives,intentions,or tendencies,and instead determine whether a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would have concluded that a threat existed justifying the particular use of force.elliott,at citing graham,at.
because this test requires us to determine the reasonableness of an officer actions,it is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application,bell wolfish,d,but rather requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.graham,at.recognizing that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly evolving we take care to consider the facts from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,and avoid judging the officer conduct with the vision of hindsight.id.at.we must determine whether the totality of the circumstances justifie s the use of deadly force given all the circumstances of the case before us.tennessee garner,d,quoted with approval in graham,at.see also rowland perry,cir stating that courts must avoid making a rtificial divisions in the sequence of events,and should instead view the evidence in full context,with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of all the circumstances.
in doing so,we must carefully balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on an individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.graham,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.when deadly force is at issue,the supreme court has long recognized that the intrusion on fourth amendment rights is unmatched.garner,at.the intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force is unmatched.such force is therefore justified only where a reasonable officer would have sound reason to believe that a suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others.elliott,at citation omitted see also garner,at.stating that the constitution does not permit the use of deadly force against a person who poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others.
officer corbeau contends that the undisputed facts establish that a reasonable police officer in his position would have had sound reason to believe that clem was armed or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to justify the use of deadly force.review of the record evidence summarized above,however,renders this contention untenable.unquestionably,clem has proffered evidence,which,if credited,would lead to the conclusion that a reasonable police officer could not have believed him to be in possession of a weapon,or otherwise to pose a threat of serious harm to anyone at the time of the shooting.to be sure,officer corbeau has proffered contrary evidence.but the supreme court has expressly directed that in determining whether a plaintiff has stated the violation of the constitutional right to be free from excessive police force,the facts are to be t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,saucier.at,and here that party is clem.
although corbeau claims to accept saucier as the governing standard,much of his appellate argument is based on ignoring it.for example,corbeau points only to two disputed assertions in maintaining that a reasonable officer could have believed that clem was armed first,he relies on his testimony that clem patted his pocket in the breakfast nook and claimed to have something that could kill you.but clem,who was also in the breakfast nook at the time,denies hearing any such threat,or indeed,any reference to anything in her husband pocket.officer nelson,for his part,testifies that clem did not make any threat to kill corbeau or anyone else,and that,although clem patted his pocket,t here was nothing there.second,corbeau asserts that while he was en route to the clem home he received a radio message informing him that clem had threatened his wife with a knife five weeks earlier.but corbeau himself concedes that any such report was erroneous clem never threatened his wife and,in fact she had persuaded him to get in the car to go to the hospital before police arrived and that nelson,who had answered th
