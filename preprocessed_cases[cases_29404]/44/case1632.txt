deborah katz pueschel,a former air traffic controller atc,appeals from two separate judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia dismissing her respective causes of action against the federal aviation administration faa and secretary of transportation.pueschel brought suit against the faa under the federal tort claims act ftca alleging that the faa negligently and intentionally caused her to suffer severe emotional distress and exacerbated her preexisting work disability by subjecting her to a hostile workplace,sexual harassment and retaliation for filing complaints about her work environment hereinafter ftca suit.pueschel also sued the secretary of transportation alleging that the faa,an agency within the department of transportation,violated title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the rehabilitation act,et,by failing to provide her equal access to employment opportunities and awards and by interfering with the processing of her disability claims filed with the office of workers compensation programs hereinafter owcp claim because of her gender,work disability and in retaliation for filing complaints about her work environment hereinafter title vii suit.
on october,judge hilton dismissed pueschel ftca suit on the bases that it should have been brought under title vii,which provides federal employees their exclusive remedies for employment discrimination,rather than the ftca was barred,even if properly brought under title vii,by the doctrine of res judicata because in a prior title vii action brought by pueschel the faa was found not to have discriminated against her on the basis of her gender and work disability or to have retaliated against her for filing prior complaints and failed to state a claim in light of the fact that virginia employers do not have a common law duty to ensure that their employees are not subjected to sexual harassment and retaliation.on november,judge wexler dismissed pueschel title vii suit on the basis that judge hilton decision,specifically his conclusion that pueschel was precluded from bringing a title vii action asserting discrimination and retaliation claims arising out of her faa employment,barred her title vii suit under the doctrine of res judicata.
on appeal,pueschel argues that judge hilton erred by dismissing her ftca suit on res judicata grounds.she also argues that judge hilton abused his discretion by failing to construe the faa motion to dismiss,to which the faa attached a binder of exhibits,as a motion for summary judgment.pueschel further contends that she was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the faa motion to dismiss her ftca suit because the district court did not hold a hearing prior to ruling on the faa motion.moreover,pueschel argues that judge hilton abused his discretion by denying her motion to stay the proceedings and transfer her ftca suit to florida,where she presently resides.lastly,pueschel argues that judge wexler erred by concluding that her title vii suit was barred by judge hilton dismissal of her ftca suit.
with regard to pueschel ftca suit,we hold that it was properly dismissed on preemption grounds given that title vii establishes the exclusive and preemptive scheme under which federal employees can seek redress for employment discrimination.because pueschel failed to respond to the faa motion to dismiss,we hold that her argument that the faa motion to dismiss should have been treated as one for summary judgment is of no moment.irrespective of whether the motion was treated as one for dismissal or summary judgment,pueschel had eleven days under the district court local rules to respond and failed to do so.we further hold that pueschel argument that she was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the faa motion to dismiss is without merit because there is no requirement that a district judge hold a hearing prior to ruling on such a motion.lastly,we hold that the denial of her motion to stay and transfer her ftca suit did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
with regard to pueschel title vii suit,we hold that her claim that the faa did not provide her equal access to employment opportunities and awards because of her gender,work disability and in retaliation for filing prior complaints is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.we also hold,however,that her owcp alleges that the faa interference with the processing of her workers compensation claims has resulted in her benefits being improperly not precluded.although pueschel asserted in a prior title vii action that the faa was interfering with the processing of her workers compensation claims,the faa in effect agreed to split pueschel owcp claim from that title vii action by informing the court that this claim was asserted in another complaint,which has now become pueschel present title vii suit,and thus not part of that suit.we therefore reverse this part of the judgment dismissing pueschel title vii suit and remand for further proceedings.
in,pueschel became one of the first women to enter the atc program and was soon thereafter assigned to the washington air traffic center in leesburg,virginia.on september,however,the faa,pursuant to an executive order issued by president reagan,terminated pueschel and approximately other atcs for allegedly engaging in an illegal strike against the faa.prior to being terminated,however,pueschel commenced an action against the secretary of transportation in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and to disparate and adverse personnel actions amounting to gender discrimination in violation of title vii.because these alleged incidents occurred in virginia,pueschel suit was transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia where,after a bench trial,judgment was entered against her.on appeal,we reversed in part and affirmed in part.katz dole,cir.specifically,we held that pueschel had made out a case of sexual harassment actionable under title vii but found no error in the district court handling of her disparate treatment claim.remand,the district court entered an order enjoining the faa from engaging in conduct that caused,encouraged or condoned the sexual harassment of pueschel.
in addition to her title vii action,pueschel commenced an administrative action against the faa challenging her dismissal for allegedly participating in an illegal strike against the faa.katz faa.pueschel contended that she had been improperly terminated because her absence from work was due to physical and mental health reasons rather than participation in the strike.id.at.the merit system protection board mspb ruled in favor of pueschel,noting that her history of physical and mental health problems was sufficient evidence to rebut the faa presumption that she missed work to participate in the strike.id.at.pursuant to the mspb ruling,pueschel was reinstated as an atc and awarded back pay and attorney fees.
after her reinstatement in january,pueschel was assigned a regular shift during which air traffic is lower,even though atcs are not generally assigned regular shifts,because she suffers from asthma,fibromyalgia,anxiety,sacroidosis and aggravated by stress and fatigue.on august,however,pueschel filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging that she was being treated differently because she is female,has a job related handicap,has filled sic eeo complaints,and testified before congress sic and that her career had not progressed normally and her per performance evaluation ratings have suffered because she has been labeled a trouble maker and that her peers received promotions,details,and awards and she had not been allowed to demonstrate her abilities to qualify for promotions and awards.pueschel also alleged that her workers compensation benefits were improperly taxed as a result of the faa interference with the processing of her claims.id.at.after the faa investigated and denied her claims,pueschel requested a hearing before the eeoc,which was scheduled for may.
on april,however,pueschel suffered a episode after a team comprised of faa and atc union representatives approached her about the possibility of altering her work schedule.as a result of this episode,pueschel took a sick leave from work and has not returned to her employment with the faa.on april,one day after taking her sick leave,pueschel requested and was subsequently granted a postponement of her eeoc hearing on the basis that she was too ill to participate.
prior to being granted a postponement,however,pueschel filed a second eeoc complaint on april.in this complaint,to which pueschel attached a page handwritten narrative,pueschel alleged that in retaliation for filing prior complaints the faa put her under the supervision of a manager that had been previously found to have sexually harassed her destroyed her personnel records denied her employment opportunities,awards and benefits made available to other employees purposely gave her low performance evaluation ratings interfered with the processing of her workers compensation claims and discriminated against her by proposing to change her work schedule.by letter dated april,the faa informed pueschel that it was dismissing her complaint for failure to show how these alleged incidents caused her to suffer a specific injury or harm.in response,pueschel commenced an action in the united states district court for the district of columbia asserting that the faa dismissed her complaint without investigating her claims as required by law.the district court agreed and ordered the faa to conduct a proper investigation of pueschel claims.in doing so,the district court noted that the investigation should focus on whether the faa,because of pueschel sex and disability and in retaliation for prior claims,had 
included in her confidential medical file notes concerning random drug tests 
destroyed her time and attendance records contrary to her instructions 
allowed her to be supervised by someone who previously had been found to have sexually harassed her 
revised her shift assignment contrary to her doctor instructions and 
failed to process properly her claims for compensation with the owcp.
although the district court failed to list pueschel claim that she was denied employment opportunities,awards and benefits made available to other employees,neither party brought this to the court attention.consequently,the faa proceeded to investigate the five claims identified by the district court and thereafter dismissed them because the first four were untimely raised and the fifth was outside the eeoc jurisdiction.after being informed of the faa decision,pueschel requested that the district court reconsider the matter.the district court,however,determined that venue was only proper in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia and thus transferred the case.after the case was transferred,the faa moved for summary judgment on all five identified claims.in doing so,however,the faa noted that pueschel had filed another administrative eeo complaint specifically directed at the faa handling of her owcp claims and stated that the aforementioned complaint was being investigated and thus not part of the present lawsuit.id.at.on august,the district court granted the faa motion for summary judgment,finding that pueschel claims lack ed merit and that it was impossible for any reasonable jury to return a verdict in her favor on any of the theories propounded under either title vii or the rehabilitation act.id.at.we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in an unpublished opinion.pueschel slater,cir per curiam table hereinafter title vii action.
with respect to pueschel first eeoc august,faa,in a letter dated april,dismissed her complaint for failure to prosecute.pueschel appealed this decision to the eeoc office of federal operations,which reversed the faa decision and remanded pueschel complaint for further administrative proceedings.after pueschel complaint was remanded,the faa investigated the claims asserted therein and found that pueschel had not been subjected to discrimination because of her gender and work disability or in retaliation for filing prior complaints.the eeoc affirmed the faa findings and thereafter denied pueschel petition for reconsideration.consequently,on september,pueschel appealed to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia thereby commencing her present title vii suit.
in addition to her title vii suit,pueschel commenced her ftca suit in september by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging that the faa negligently and intentionally caused her to suffer severe emotional distress and exacerbated her preexisting work disability by subjecting her to a hostile workplace,sexual harassment and retaliation for filing complaints about her work environment.the faa moved to dismiss pueschel ftca suit on the basis of improper venue or,alternatively,requested transfer of the case to the eastern district of virginia pursuant to b,which states that venue for ftca cases is proper only in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred.the district court held that t he standard remedy for improper venue is to transfer the case to the proper court rather than dismissing it,and thus transferred pueschel ftca suit to the eastern district of virginia.
after pueschel ftca suit was transferred,the faa,on october,moved to dismiss the suit,arguing that it should have been brought under title vii,was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and failed to state a claim under virginia common law.pueschel never responded to this motion.instead,she filed,on october,a motion to stay the proceedings and transfer the case to florida,where she presently resides.after pueschel failed to respond to the faa motion to dismiss,judge hilton,on october,granted the faa motion,holding that pueschel suit should have been brought under title vii,rather than the ftca,because title vii provides federal employees their exclusive remedy for employment discrimination.moreover,judge hilton concluded that the doctrine of res judicata precluded pueschel from bringing the claims asserted in her ftca suit under title vii because the court in her title vii action granted the faa summary judgment on her claim that she had been subjected to employment discrimination and retaliation during her faa employment up to april,when she went on leave.id.at.lastly,judge hilton stated that even if pueschel had properly brought her claims under title vii and her claims were not barred by res judicata,she failed to state a common law claim because virginia common law does not impose a duty on employers to provide their employees a workplace that is free from sexual harassment and retaliation.
on november,judge wexler dismissed pueschel title vii suit on res judicata grounds,reasoning that he was bound by judge hilton conclusion that pueschel title vii action bars her from bringing another title vii action asserting discrimination and retaliation claims arising out her faa employment.
pueschel argues that judge hilton erred by dismissing her ftca suit on res judicata grounds.because we find that pueschel ftca suit was properly dismissed on preemption grounds,we need not address this argument 
title vii,inter alia,provides that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex or to limit,segregate,or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual sex a a.title vii also provides that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because the employee has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.id.a.as originally enacted in,however,title vii did not apply to federal employees.instead,employment discrimination claims brought by federal emp
