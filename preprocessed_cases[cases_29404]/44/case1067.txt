this case arose from a real estate investment and development scheme based on the island of croix in the united states virgin islands.the omei group omei,ocean view investment holdings,llc ocean view,lucy cheng,and mait dubois collectively,the appellants ask us to reverse a ruling of the district court of the virgin islands denying their motion for summary judgment on claims of misrepresentation brought by frank pollara and his construction company,the frank pollara group.because the summary judgment motion did not present a pure question of law and because the appellants failed to properly preserve the factual issues they now endeavor to raise,we conclude that we can not review the district court ruling on that motion.we can,however,and will affirm the district court refusal to set aside the jury verdict awarding pollara and his company compensatory and punitive damages.
a.the project that was 
omei is a delaware limited liability company that supposedly served as an investment vehicle for people that lucy cheng claimed to represent.cheng presented herself as an investment specialist and an expert in international tax matters.mait dubois was her deputy in the management of omei.cheng and dubois were also the front people for the investors in ocean view an entity established exclusively to lend money to yet another entity,southgate crossing,llc,which is said to be the owner of a real estate development known as southgate crossing.ocean view used intercompany loans to funnel money to southgate development group,llc sdg,which,in turn,was supposed to develop southgate crossing.the layers of business entities involved in this matter were avowedly meant to insulate the investors and the underlying real estate asset from liability and to minimize any tax burden 
a south carolina realtor named rick willis who is not a party to this action devised the initial plan for southgate crossing,which was to purchase acres at estate southgate on croix,it to increase the number of housing units that could be built on the property,and to then subdivide the land,build subdivision infrastructure,and sell the individual lots willis met cheng at a seminar in and she agreed to become a participant in the project.when cheng met secretly with her investors,however,she said that it was not her intention to develop the land at all,but rather to sell it as soon as possible.
in,willis was working with an architect,christopher mccarthy,who proposed putting over houses on the southgate crossing property.cheng conferred with mccarthy sometime around october of and told him that she was in charge of overseeing the project and safeguarding the investors interests.she also told mccarthy that her specialty was manipulating companies to make it look like a and run it through so many different permutations that it would come out over here as app.at.after mccarthy created preliminary schematics for the proposed development,cheng made him sign a contract that assigned to sdg the copyright to the drawings,before she would pay him.prior to signing the contract,mccarthy had never heard of sdg.mccarthy explained to cheng that the schematics were not sufficient to obtain building permits.they were,he said,just pretty pictures.app.at.
by august,cheng was making all of the decisions for the project,but willis was still involved.around that time,frank pollara,a year veteran of the construction industry,met with willis about bidding to build an entrance for southgate crossing.pollara reviewed the mccarthy schematics and informed willis that they were incomplete and that it would be difficult to make a bid based on them.pollara nevertheless submitted a bid in august and cheng called him to talk about it.she told pollara it was her money at stake and that she handled money for foreign investors.app.at.she further told pollara he would also be dealing with mait dubois,her associate.cheng later asked pollara to undertake the entrance construction job.
accordingly,pollara submitted a letter.willis told him that lucy cheng is the person who will approve any written agreement app.at.cheng,dubois,and willis all told pollara that the necessary building permits for the entrance had been obtained and that the project was ready to go.app.at.pollara heard the same thing from kima merrick,who was an office worker on the project for a time but was,for reasons unclear in the record,terminated.on september,pollara signed a contract with southgate crossing to construct the entrance for.app.at.at some later point,willis acting under cheng instructions and unbeknownst to pollara changed the contract to designate southgate development group,llc as the contracting entity.app.at.in actuality,the investors did not approve the creation of sdg until november.when he signed the contract,pollara was unaware that the project had not been permitted 
pollara began work on the entrance in september.on september,the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources the department of planning served pollara with a stop notice and a order for failing to obtain required permits for the work.app.at.when pollara called cheng about the stop order,she initially told him that we have a permit app.at,but eventually she asked him to obtain the necessary government approvals.when he informed her that doing so was outside the scope of their contract,she offered to pay for the additional work.pollara retained mccarthy to provide appropriate plans for the entrance so that he could submit them to the department of planning.the permitting process also required pollara to add electrical,plumbing,and irrigation features that were not covered by the initial construction contract.moreover,pollara had to perform additional landscaping,in keeping with the newly prepared plans.he eventually succeeded in getting an permit,a flood hazard permit,an electrical permit,and a building permit.
in october,construction hit a setback when the roadway in front of southgate crossing was washed out completely by heavy rains.app.at.cheng and dubois instructed pollara to repair the roadway,stating that they would pay for it,even though pollara could not provide a cost estimate for the repairs.after pollara sent the first invoice for his work,cheng told him to bill sdg,rather than southgate crossing,llc,because sdg was,as she put it,the company with the money.app.at.cheng explained that sdg was funded by omei and that she controlled the money.id.when pollara questioned the payment process,he was told by cheng accountant that cheng approved all payment requests because it was her money.thus,when pollara prepared the invoice for the roadwork,it read c ost of road repair as per agreement with investors and listed charges of.app.at.
at some point,dubois and cheng asked pollara to obtain the permits that would allow the development of approximately townhomes on the southgate crossing property.pollara believed he could do so because he had a good relationship with the department of planning,and he agreed to do so because cheng and dubois offered him a dramatically new deal they would make pollara a owner of the development project.the plan was or so pollara thought to build about townhouses in a gated community and to market and sell them.dubois showed pollara a spreadsheet forecasting a million profit on a million project,with pollara having a equity stake.
later,willis told pollara that the investors might want to sell a few parcels of the property.pollara became concerned that such sales would create the appearance that the developers simply wanted to flip the property,sell it off without actually adding development,which would upset the department of planning and the governor because they truly believe d in the project.app.at.cheng and pollara also exchanged emails about the lack of cash in sdg bank account and the fact that sdg required a capital infusion from cheng investors.to conceal her true motives,cheng told pollara that she was keeping sdg account empty because she feared that merrick,the office worker on the project,might sue for wrongful termination.cheng promised that she would move funds around from other accounts in order to pay for the construction work.pollara thus hired and paid for engineering and survey work on the project and also paid for mccarthy planning and design services.
while cheng and dubois reassured pollara that they were committed to developing southgate crossing,they were,in reality,planning to wait for a time and then flip the property rather than develop it.pollara stated that,had he known their true intentions,he would not have gotten involved with them.he thought that he was participating in a real project that would create jobs and develop the land.
to keep pollara involved,cheng and dubois continued to tell him that the development of southgate crossing was proceeding as planned.and,pollara continued actively working on the project,often hours a day or longer,and expending money.around december,dubois sent to cheng an email relaying that pollara was doing extra work such as completing a cost detail spreadsheet and providing model construction costs free of charge because he believed he was receiving a equity stake in a real development.dubois acknowledged in the email that he knew that cheng and the other investors simply wanted to sell the property and that they lacked the financing to proceed with the project.he also suggested telling pollara that they were underfunded,but he did not do that.instead,on december,he sent pollara another email telling him how much they appreciated his efforts and that,because the investors initially agreed only to finance the purchase and permitting of the land,the creation of a separate development company with additional financing was necessary.he admitted that the billing procedures needed streamlining and that they were unprepared for the scope of southgate crossing,but he promised that,if pollara would continue to work with them,they would all make a lot of money.app.at.pollara continued working on the project.
on february,cheng sent an email to dubois saying that she wanted to just complete the entrance and landscaping and put up the project for sale because she could not deal with pollara style or any other builders in croix.app.at.dubois responded that,even though they were planning to sell,they need ed to keep pollara moving forward especially until we get the permit.app.at emphasis in original.the next week,cheng proposed cutting off payments to pollara because sdg and ocean view were short on money,but dubois argued that,since the investor group approved the expenditures and since willis,cheng,and dubois approved the work and costs,it was not fair to simply cut off the funding.app.at.dubois went on to ask w hy not let pollara continue to think he is going to do the project and continue to be supportive of us instead of getting him mad id.later,dubois emailed cheng and willis that i would like to communicate to pollara that we still wanted to be in the deal.app.at.at trial,the following exchange revealed dubois mindset 
counsel for pollara w hy would you intentionally misrepresent to pollara that you were still in the deal when you knew you were 
dubois all i was trying to do was get the gate completed.
in march,cheng and dubois stopped paying pollara invoices for raw costs and locked him out of his office at the development site.additionally,pollara was never paid for the repair work to the roadway after the flooding in october.although there was some evidence that willis was interested in saving the project,cheng and dubois had decided to have ocean view foreclose on the property,thus eliminating willis interest and destroying any interest that pollara could claim.cheng and dubois,standing on both sides of the financing,refused any extension of the financing terms and withheld their consent to selling the development at a profit to a buyer whom willis had found.instead,they caused ocean view to foreclose on the land,acquiring the property free of willis and pollara interests.on april,pollara wrote a demand letter to cheng and dubois for approximately representing in unpaid invoices and about for repair work to the roadway.pollara placed a construction lien on the property,listing cheng and dubois as his contracting counterparties.
procedural history 
on june,pollara and his construction filed suit against sdg,southgate crossing,llc,and ocean view in the superior court of the virgin islands,alleging that they owed him under a theory of quantum meruit.pollara later stipulated to the dismissal of southgate crossing,llc and sdg.ocean view then timely removed the case to the district court of the virgin islands.pollara amended his complaint in to add omei,cheng,and dubois as defendants and to add a claim for unjust enrichment.in,pollara amended the complaint a second time to add a claim for intentional or negligent misrepresentation.at the conclusion of discovery,the appellants moved for summary judgment,arguing that they had no contract with pollara and,in fact,had nothing to do with the project,other than insofar as cheng and dubois were acting on behalf of the contracting entities southgate crossing,llc and sdg.they further argued that the existence of a written contract with pollara though they disclaimed being any part of it barred the quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims.the appellants also raised the doctrine as a defense to pollara misrepresentation claims,saying that there could be no tort claims because any misrepresentations regarding payments to plaintiffs arise out of the contractual duty to pay them.app.at emphasis in original.the district court denied the summary judgment motion,holding that the appellants could not invoke a contract defense,such as the doctrine,when they expressly disclaimed the contract itself.frank pollara,llc ocean view inv.holding,llc,wl,at.
by the time the case proceeded to trial,the parties had agreed to a verdict form which listed five subjects about which the appellants had purportedly made misrepresentations the original building permit for the entrance,the additional work for the entrance,the roadway repair work,various permits for construction of group dwellings,and the proposals for the development plan.jurors were asked to identify for each of the appellants,using a chart,whether that specific party had made an intentional misrepresentation,a negligent misrepresentation,or no misrepresentation at all concerning each of those subjects.the jury found that ocean view and cheng had made intentional misrepresentations and that omei had made negligent misrepresentations as to every subject.it found that dubois had made negligent misrepresentations with respect to the original building permit and the proposals for the development plan,and intentional misrepresentations as to the other three subjects.the jury awarded pollara compensatory damages of from all of the appellants and punitive damages totaling against cheng,ocean view,and dubois.the appellants timely filed a motion for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure,claiming insufficient evidence to support the verdict and damages,and a motion for judgment as a matter of law challenging the sufficiency of the evidence under rule b the rule b motion was the renewal of a timely rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the appellants had made at the close of pollara.they did not renew their defense in those motions,which the district court had earlier addressed in the order denying summary judgment.the district court denied the post trial motions and this appeal followed.frank pollara,llc ocean view inv.holding llc,wl.
the appellants challenge the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment and what they perceive to be an inconsistency in the verdict.we discuss their arguments on each of those subjects 
summary judgment 
the appellants argue that their summary judgment motion based on the defense should have been granted by the district court as a threshold matter,we must decide whether the order denying summary judgment is reviewable,since the appellants did not renew their argument in rule motions for judgment as a matter of law.given governing precedent from the supreme court,it has become apparent that when,as in this instance,a summary judgment motion does not present a pure issue of law and the issues it does present have not been raised and renewed by proper motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule,those issues are not reviewable on appeal.
in ortiz jordan,the supreme court observed that,generally,a party may not appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits,d.o rders denying summary judgment do not qualify as final decisions subject to appeal.id.at.rather,such an order retains its interlocutory character as simply a step along the route to final judgment.id.at.once the case proceeds to trial,the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary judgment motion.id.there is an exception to this general rule,however,for an order denying summary judgment on a purely legal issue capable of resolution with reference only to undisputed facts.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.see also,stampf long island,cir noting that ortiz leaves open a narrow exception for purely legal questions nolfi ohio.oil,cir same copar pumice,morris,cir same owatonna clinic mayo health med.protective of fort wayne,cir same.to qualify as an appealable order,a district court summary judgment ruling can not turn on what occurred,or why an action was taken or omitted,but must relate to disputes about the substance and clarity of law.winfield trottier,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,because appellants did not include their argument in their motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule,we may only review that argument now if it presents a purely legal question.
the doctrine is a theory under common law designed to maintain the conceptual distinction between breach of contract claims and tort claims.etoll,it is,arising out of the concern that tort recovery should not be permitted for breaches of contract.glazer chandler.w hile the existence of a contractual relationship between two parties does not prevent one party from bringing a tort claim against another,the gist of the action doctrine precludes tort suits for the mere breach of contractual duties the plaintiff must instead point to independent events giving rise to the tort.addie kjaer,cir.thus,a pplication of this doctrine frequently requires courts to engage in a factually intensive inquiry as to the nature of a plaintiff claims.id.at.
in pediatrix screening,telechem international,a case that preceded the supreme court decision in ortiz,the plaintiff,pediatrix,had filed a motion to dismiss defendant telechem counterclaims,cir.in that motion,pediatrix asserted the defense,but the motion was denied and the case went to trial.id.after trial,pediatrix moved for a new trial under rule,arguing that the district court had wrongly decided the motion to dismiss and that the defense should have applied.id.at.the district court denied that motion too.then,on appeal,telechem argued that pediatrix had waived its challenge to the district court ruling on the defense because pediatrix had failed to raise it in motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule.id.at.a divided panel of this court held that the applicability of the defense was a legal issue and thus was sufficiently preserved for appellate review because the argument had been raised in the earlier motion to dismiss.id.at the issue here is whether the misrepresentation claim,even if supported by sufficient evidence,is nevertheless precluded by the gist of the action doctrine.that legal dispute is clearly set forth in pediatrix rule b motion but see id.at jordan,dissenting a rule motion may very well be required to preserve an issue for appeal when a legal question depends on the resolution of factual issues,such that the legal question can not be resolved without reference to the evidence amassed at trial.
the next year,the supreme court decided ortiz,which emphasized that,when a legal issue initially raised at summary judgment in that case,qualified immunity depends on the resolution of factual questions,motions for judgment as a matter of law under rules a and b are indeed required to preserve the legal issue for appellate review.at.ortiz involved a former prison inmate who brought civil rights claims under against various prison officials.id.at.the prison officials moved for summary judgment,asserting qualified immunity as a defense,and the district court denied the motion.id.the officials filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence,but did not renew their motion after the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.id.at.the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit determined that,when a summary judgment motion is grounded on a claim of qualified immunity,the denial of that motion is reviewable.see ortiz jordan,app x,cir holding that a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to th e rule that courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits.the supreme court reversed.ortiz,at.notwithstanding that qualified immunity is frequently described as a question of law the supreme court ruled that the defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b left the appellate forum with no warrant to review the denial of summary judgment because the officials claims of qualified immunity hardly present purely legal issues capable of resolution with reference only to undisputed facts.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned that,when a litigant summary judgment motion is denied and the case proceeds to a full trial on the merits,the summary judgment record becomes displaced by the trial record and the summary judgment ruling is no longer reviewable.id.at.the message was that a litigant must ordinarily renew any objection to the denial of summary judgment through rule challenges both at and after trial.id.at.
in light of ortiz,it is clear that,if an earlier dispositive argument is not renewed through motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule a and rule b,the litigant propounding the argument may not seek appellate review of a decision rejecting it,unless that argument presents a pure question of law that can be decided with reference only to undisputed facts.to the extent our decision in pediatrix suggests otherwise,it has been overruled by ortiz.while we are mindful that i t would be unfair to penalize a litigant for failing to jump up and down or labor an objection that is already a part of the record,bohler uddeholm,ellwood,cir,it is not unfair to make litigants deal with the full record.again,o nce the case proceeds to trial,the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary judgment motion.ortiz,at.insofar as an issue has a factual component,the failure to raise the issue in motions for judgment as a matter of law at and after trial makes it inappropriate for an appellate court to address what should have been directed to the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and had the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the failure to preserve arguments in properly filed rule motions is particularly vexing when,as is often the case,a litigant is really challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.ortiz,at despite prison officials insistence that sufficiency of the evidence is not what is at stake in this case,their claims of qualified immunity implicated factual issues pediatrix,at jordan,dissenting i t seems that pediatrix is really saying that it is entitled to judgment in its favor because there was insufficient evidence at trial to establish any fraud independent of the parties contractual relationship.that is an argument that could have,and should have,been raised at trial.because it was not,it has been waived.ortiz clarified that only neat abstract issues of law fit the exception to the rule requiring that arguments be preserved in rule motions.ortiz,at internal quotation marks omitted.cases in which the facts that could render an actor answerable for his conduct are disputed or in which questions exist as to what occurred simply do not fit.id.
with that framework in mind,we turn to whether the applicability of the defense in this case presents a purely legal question or whether it necessarily involves reference to disputed facts.the district court held that the defense did not apply because the parties were not in privity.that ruling,however,was couched in the language of estoppel that is,the court essential holding was that,because the appellants denied being bound by the contract,they could not simultaneously argue for contractual protections dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber resin intermediates,cir to allow a to claim the benefit of the contract and simultaneously avoid its burdens would disregard equity internal quotation marks omitted.
the appellants argue that the district court reasoning is grounded in an erroneous belief that the doctrine can apply only to a contract signatories,in contravention of our decision in addie kjaer.see at although was not a party to the contracts,the buyers can not detach from his status as agent for premier we therefore hold that the gist of the action doctrine bars the tort claims buyers asserted against,all of which were based upon conduct that allegedly breached the contracts.it is the appellants,though,who are laboring under a misperception.they claim to be entitled to the benefit of the defense because somewhere in the factual mix of the case there was a contract,even though pollara claimed it did not govern the disputes in question and the appellants actively disavowed it.the appellants are wrong,and addie is no support for their position.in addie,we made a factually intensive inquiry into the contracts at issue and the relationships between the parties and concluded that,although a particular litigant was not a signatory to the contract,he was the sole principal and shareholder for the signatory and thus was both bound and protected by the contracts.id.at.addie does not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff who has entered into a contract is barred from bringing tort claims against a third party who disclaims the contract,nor does it suggest that whether someone is bound by a contract is a purely legal question.on the contrary,addie reaffirms that whether a contract governs a particular dispute is often a factually intensive question.id.at.indeed,that is one reason why a number of district courts in this circuit have been rightly reluctant to apply the doctrine when the existence of a contract is still in controversy 
in the present case,the existence of contractual privity depends on certain predicate facts which,contrary to the appellants contentions,were vigorously disputed.pollara claimed that the contract at issue did not extend to extra work he performed based on the appellants misrepresentations.the appellants argument,embodied in their summary judgment motion,was that cheng and dubois were not responsible for the conduct of the mortgage lender,ocean view,and the mortgage holder,southgate crossing,llc.the scope of the contract and the degree to which cheng and dubois pulled the strings of the were fact questions bearing on the issue of contractual privity,and pollara argued as much in opposing summary judgment.the district court heard those competing arguments and ruled that the appellants were not entitled to invoke the defense because they insisted that they were not bound by the contract.we are bound to note simply that the appellants failed to preserve their objections to the district court summary judgment ruling with motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule,and they thus have lost their ability to raise them now.
inconsistent verdicts 
the appellants also complain that the jury verdict was inconsistent because its finding of intentional misrepresentation by cheng precludes a finding of negligent misrepresentation by omei.as already noted,the jury was asked to decide the degree of fault for ocean view,omei,cheng,and dubois with respect to five different subjects,indicating whether there was an intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,or no misrepresentation at all with respect to each of those subjects the appellants argue that,because the jury assigned different degrees of fault to different actors,the verdict was irreparably inconsistent.
under rule,a jury may render either a general verdict or a special verdict a general verdict is a verdict by which the jury finds in favor of one party or the other,as opposed to resolving specific fact questions.black law dictionary ed.by contrast,a special verdict is a form where the jury answers only special written finding s on each issue of fact.a.the jury sole function is to determine the facts the jury needs no instruction on the law because the court applies the law to the facts as found by the jury.see portage ii bryant petroleum,cir where special verdicts are involved,the jury sole function is to determine the facts therefore,neither an instruction on the law nor a summary concerning their role in relation to the law was necessary.see also trial if special issues are submitted or a special verdict is required,it is improper to instruct the jury on the law of the case.a general verdict with answers to written questions is a hybrid form in which the jury is asked to render a general verdict in conjunction with findings of fact.b.in other words,the jury is asked to decide mixed questions of law and fact,with the guidance of legal instructions.see also mclaughlin fellows gear shaper,cir quoting requirements of rule b stanton by brooks astra pharm,cir analyzing whether questions were submitted to jury under rule a or b.
here,the verdict form did not require the jury to make special written findings as to questions of fact,but rather asked the jury to check a box indicating whether a particular defendant was liable for misrepresentation,and,if so,based on what type of misrepresentation negligent or intentional.accordingly,it is best understood as a general verdict form with special questions.see lavoie pac.press shear,cir form asking jury whether defendant was liable under each of four alternative theories constituted general verdicts on different legal theories.the district court instructions to the jury on the law to be applied to the factual findings,as well as the requirement that the jury apply the law and render its verdict,provide further support and may conclusively establish that this was a general verdict.jarvis ford motor,cir rule a special verdict rule is inapplicable when a jury is required to make a determination of ultimate liability as well as to determine facts.
our court has never expressly decided whether the failure to object to an inconsistency in a general verdict before the jury is discharged results in a waiver of the objection.in simmons city of philadelphia,judge becker predicted that,i n this circuit,it probably is necessary,as it is in the majority of the circuits,to raise prior to the jury dismissal an objection based on the inconsistency of the answers to interrogatories supporting a general verdict rendered under rule b,cir.later,in loughman consol pennsylvania coal company,we noted that we did not need to decide whether to adopt that tentative conclusion from simmons because the verdict in loughman was not inconsistent,cir.here,it is uncontested that the appellants failed to object either to the wording on the verdict form indeed,they joined in proposing it or to the responses provided by the jury before the jury was discharged.therefore,fulfilling judge becker prediction,we today join a number of our sister circuits and hold that,if a party fails to object to an inconsistency in a general verdict before the jury is excused,that party waives any objection in that regard having decided that,we choose not to consider whether there is any inconsistency in the verdict.because the appellants failed,before the jury was discharged,to object to the inconsistency they believed was inherent in the general verdict,they have waived that objection under rule 
iii.conclusion 
the district court denial of summary judgment is not reviewable.in all other respects,we will affirm th
