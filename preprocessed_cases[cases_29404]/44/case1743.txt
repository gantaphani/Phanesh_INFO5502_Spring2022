john hudson hudson was a partner at kpmg llp from until,practicing public accountancy in texas.he did not,however,have the required texas license to practice.it is alleged that kpmg llp texas license and registration were therefore improper its participation in texas market,unlawful.it is further alleged that kpmg llp managed to maintain its texas license and registration only by concealing hudson unlicensed practice from the relevant authorities.
in,a public accountant and a firm in texas brought a putative class action against kpmg llp and several of its partners collectively,kpmg.the putative class the competitors contends that,from until,its members lost business to kpmg when kpmg participated in texas market unlawfully.
a second putative class action was brought against kpmg by a group of its texas clients.this putative class the clients contends that,from until,kpmg misrepresented the nature of its services and overcharged for them unlawfully.over kpmg opposition,nc ventures nc ventures and james capital partners lp james intervened as plaintiffs.
the district court dismissed both actions on the pleadings.the court held that the competitors claim of injury is too speculative to confer article iii standing or to give rise to a claim for which relief can be granted.it held that the clients have failed to plead actual,concrete injury sufficient to give rise to a claim for which relief can be granted.the putative classes appeal from the dismissals.the clients also appeal from a ruling to strike two exhibits that they attached to their complaint.kpmg from ancillary rulings in both actions.
we have consolidated the actions for appeal.we hold that,as the district court decided,the competitors claim of injury is too speculative to confer article iii standing.the clients have failed to plead actual,concrete injury sufficient to survive dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm.
the putative class actions arise from the same factual allegations.because these appeals are from dismissals on the actions pleadings,we must assume the allegations are true and describe them as if they were fact.
the texas public accountancy act tpaa,as in force from until,required firms of certified public accountants to register annually with the texas state board of public accountancy the state board.a firm did not qualify to register unless each of its partners practicing public accountancy in texas held a texas license and certification.the state board enforced this requirement by having firms annually submit,under oath,the name and texas license number of each partner who practiced public accountancy in texas.
registration,in turn,was a statutory prerequisite to obtain a firm license.the tpaa mandated that the state board revoke the registration and license of any firm not meeting each qualification for registration.
john hudson practiced public accountancy as a partner in kpmg houston office from january,until january.hudson held a new york license,but he never held a texas license.despite hudson unlicensed practice,kpmg registered and received a license to practice public accountancy in texas every year from until.kpmg did so by concealing hudson lack of a texas license from the state board in and,kpmg omitted hudson name from the list of texas partners that it submitted to the state board as part of the annual registration process.in,kpmg included hudson name but provided his new york license number instead of a texas license number.the state board caught this anomaly and brought it to kpmg attention,which responded that hudson was in the process of applying for his texas license.kpmg again omitted hudson name from its list of texas partners each year between and.hudson retired effective january.
despite kpmg representation in that hudson was in the process of applying for a texas license,hudson did not actually apply for a texas license until.he applied at the direction of franklin maresh maresh,the managing partner of kpmg houston office.three of hudson coworkers in that richard sexton,larry evans,and sara lou hudson application as character witnesses.another of hudson coworkers,defendant jerry claiborne,certified on behalf of kpmg that hudson statements in his application were true and correct.each coworker knew that hudson had engaged in the unlicensed practice of public accountancy since.each coworker also knew that hudson application contained false statements.the state board denied hudson application,and hudson never reapplied.
from until,maresh furthered kpmg concealment of hudson unlicensed practice even though maresh had retired from kpmg.in,maresh joined the state board major cases committee,which was the state board committee that would have been charged with investigating kpmg license and registration.maresh continued to work for the state board,and he became the state board chairman in.he personally knew of hudson unlicensed practice and,consequently,of kpmg ineligibility to register in texas,but he never disclosed these facts to the state board.the state board never investigated hudson unlicensed practice,and it never investigated kpmg eligibility to register.
at all times from until,kpmg represented to prospective and actual clients that it was a partnership registered and licensed to practice public accountancy in texas.this representation was true at all times material to these appeals,kpmg was registered and licensed to practice public accountancy in texas.kpmg did not disclose,however,that it had obtained the registration and license fraudulently,or that it was unqualified under the tpaa to hold a firm registration or license.hudson unlicensed practice came to light only in,well after kpmg annual licenses and registrations for the years through had expired.
again,these allegations are taken from the putative classes relevant pleadings.we must accept them as true for our purposes today.
the two putative classes raise distinct legal arguments,and the two actions procedural histories differ.we first describe the competitors legal arguments and their action procedural history.we next describe the clients legal arguments and their action procedural history.
in the competitors action,the live pleading is the original complaint.the competitors legal argument is as follows.from until,kpmg participated in texas obtained clients who otherwise would have hired the.kpmg participation in texas market was unlawful because hudson unlicensed practice caused kpmg to be ineligible to register in texas.had the state board learned of kpmg ineligibility to register,it would have revoked kpmg registration and license to practice public accountancy in texas.see.t he board shall revoke the registration and license of a partnership that does not meet each qualification for registration prescribed by this chapter.further,the competitors allege,kpmg managed to obtain registrations and licenses only through acts of concealment and conspiracy.they contend that this conduct constituted constructive fraud,conspiracy to commit constructive fraud,tortious interference with prospective contractual relations,conspiracy to commit tortious interference with prospective contractual relations,lanham act violations,racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico violations,and sherman act violations.the competitors seek the disgorgement of all revenues or profits that kpmg generated through its texas operations from until,as well as punitive damages,statutory damages including attorney fees,and costs.
kpmg on behalf of all defendants except maresh moved to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.kpmg argued that a the state board possesses exclusive jurisdiction over this dispute b the competitors claim of injury is too speculative to confer article iii standing c the competitors claim of injury is too speculative to give rise to a claim for which relief can be granted and d injury aside,the competitors fail for various reasons to state a claim for which relief can be granted under the legal theories that they assert.the competitors responded to kpmg motion to dismiss,kpmg replied,and the competitors.
maresh separately filed a motion t
