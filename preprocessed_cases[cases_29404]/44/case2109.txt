facts and proceedings 
the mcmanuses purchased a fleetwood motor home in texas in,with the intention of towing a jeep cherokee behind it.donnie mcmanus noticed a tag affixed to the wardrobe door stating that the motor home could tow pounds,and the sales representative assured him that the motor home would be able to tow a jeep cherokee.the wardrobe door tag was titled carrying capacity and it listed various statistics,including an entry reading gtw lbs.the tag explained 
gtw gross towed weight means the maximum permissible loaded weight of a trailer or car that this motor home has been designed to tow.this can not be increased by changing the trailer hitch.
the bottom of the tag stated in large,bold print 
consult owner manual for weighing instructions and towing guidelines 
a fleetwood engineer contacted fleetwood chassis manufacturers in and discovered that,according to the chassis manufacturers,the motor homes would require supplemental brakes to safely tow pounds.for example,ford told fleetwood that its motor homes would require supplemental brakes when towing anything above pounds.the engineer concluded in a company memorandum,to assure safe operation of our products,the wardrobe door tag,owners manual and advertising material should reflect two gcw gross combination weight,one for towed loads without brakes and one for towed loads with brakes.
the mcmanuses allege that the representation that the motor home could safely tow pounds amounted to a representation that it could safely brake while towing pounds.their complaint asserts the following five claims violation california consumers legal remedies act,cal breach of express warranty breach of implied warranty of merchantability under california consumer warranty act,cal negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment.they seek injunctive relief under federal rule of civil procedure b to compel fleetwood to provide each class member information concerning the towing limitations,as well as supplemental braking equipment.in the alternative,the mcmanuses seek money damages under rule b.
fleetwood counters,in short,that the wardrobe tag was accurate because it said nothing about supplemental brakes,and because it conspicuously led the consumer to a paper trail that would reveal the relevant information.the tag directed the consumer to the motor home owner manual,which directed the consumer to the chassis manufacturer manual containing the relevant towing limitations 
the district court originally certified a nationwide class of all persons who purchased new,and still owned,a fleetwood class a motor home manufactured between and.on a motion for reconsideration to take into account spence glock,cir,which impacts class certification in cases dealing with multistate issues,the district court decertified the national class.following oral argument on their supplemental motion for certification of a nationwide class,the mcmanuses filed a motion indicating that they wished to proceed with certification of a subclass.the district court granted the motion and certified the subclass,with no apparent opposition from fleetwood.fleetwood then filed a motion for reconsideration,prompting the district court to withdraw its previous order.after considering fleetwood new objections to the subclass,the district court issued an order concluding that a subclass was proper under both rule b and rule b.as a preliminary determination in deciding that the rule class action prerequisites were met,the district court also concluded,contrary to the mcmanuses assertions,that texas law would govern the dispute instead of california law.
ii.discussion 
the mcmanuses now concede that texas law governs the dispute,so the only issue for this interlocutory appeal is the propriety of the district court certification decision,which we review for abuse of discretion.spence,at.the decision to certify is within the broad discretion of the court,but that decision must be exercised within the framework of r ule.the party seeking certification bears the burden of proof.castano am.tobacco,cir internal citations omitted.although the strength of a plaintiff claim should not affect the certification decision,the district court must look beyond the pleadings to understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.id.at.
under rule,plaintiffs must first define the class with specificity and show they are members of the class.forbush penney,cir.they must then establish all four requirements of rule a.shivangi dean witter reynolds,cir.these requirements are the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.fleetwood does not challenge the district court conclusion that plaintiffs have met these requirements in addition to satisfying the above requirements,the parties seeking class certification must show that the action is maintainable under rule b,or.b.we consider the district court decision under rule b and rule b,in turn.
certification is only proper under rule b for the mcmanuses claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability 
under rule b,the district court may certify a class where it determines that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.fleetwood argues that the common questions of fact do not predominate over individual matters.in particular,fleetwood asserts that since each of the plaintiffs claims requires a showing of reliance on the alleged misrepresentation,the district court abused its discretion in certifying the class under rule b.the mcmanuses respond that the district court may presume reliance because the same the motor homes could tow given to all of the class members.
reliance may not be presumed under texas law 
the mcmanuses rely upon life ins.of southwest brister,and reserve life ins.kirkland,for the proposition that texas law permits a presumption of reliance.in each case,the appellate court determined that the proposed class members had a sufficient community of interest,brister,at,to justify certification under texas rule of civil procedure.see kirkland,at brister,at.the result was premised on the view that texas courts should err in favor and not against the maintenance of the class action since the class certification order is always subject to modification should later developments during the course of the trial so require.brister,at.the texas supreme court has since overruled those cases,explicitly reject ing this approach of certify now and worry later.southwestern refining bernal.
the bernal court emphasized that p rocedural devices may not be construed to enlarge or diminish any substantive rights or obligations of any parties to any civil action.id.at citing civ.in a particularly instructive case,the texas supreme court held that issues of reliance defeated the predominance requirement of rule in a class action alleging,among other things,that advertising for dental office management software was false and misleading 
t he class members in the present case are held to the same standards of proof of for that matter all the other elements of their they would be required to meet if each sued individually.this does not mean,of course,that reliance or other elements of their causes of action can not be proved with evidence generally applicable to all class members proof is possible when evidence exists.but evidence insufficient to prove reliance in a suit by an individual does not become sufficient in a class action simply because there are more plaintiffs.inescapably individual differences can not be concealed in a throng.the procedural device of a class action eliminates the necessity of adducing the same evidence over and over again in a multitude of individual actions it does not lessen the quality of evidence required in an individual action or relax substantive burdens of proof.
henry schein,stromboe,wl,at.
we note additionally that neither brister nor kirkland speaks to the substantive standard of proof of the underlying causes of action those cases are concerned only with the procedural standard to justify certification under texas procedural law.since we are bound to follow federal rule of civil procedure,not texas corresponding rule,brister and kirkland are not instructive to the issue.as bernal and henry schein make clear,texas law does not permit the type of presumed reliance urged by the mcmanuses.
reliance issues are fatal to a rule b class for claims of fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentation 
claims for money damages in which individual reliance is an element are poor candidates for class treatment,at best.we have made that plain.patterson mobil oil,cir see also castano,at a fraud class action can not be certified when individual reliance will be an issue.here,it is undisputed that class members would only be entitled to relief under theories of fraudulent concealment or negligent misrepresentation if they could show they relied on the alleged misrepresentation.reliance will vary from plaintiff to plaintiff,depending on the circumstances surrounding the sale.for instance,donnie mcmanus testified at his deposition that he read the wardrobe door tag and asked the salesperson about the towing capacity.june mcmanus testified that she did not read the tag,nor did she draw any conclusion as to whether the motor home would be able to tow a jeep cherokee.the individual reliance issues are apparent even as between the two representative plaintiffs.other potential class members certainly may have read the wardrobe door tag as fleetwood reads being silent on the issue of supplemental certainly some class members may have actually known at the time of purchase that supplemental brakes would be needed.at this point in the litigation,the mcmanuses have failed to show that these potential variables are sufficiently uniform to justify class treatment,and we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in finding that questions of fact common to the class were predominant,for purposes of rule b,with respect to the mcmanuses claims for fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation.
the mcmanuses claim,under rule b,for breach of express warranty requires reliance and is inappropriate for class treatment 
the mcmanuses argue that their claim for breach of express warranty does not require a showing of reliance,thereby avoiding the variable factual circumstances explained above.we disagree.under texas law,an express warranty is created when a seller makes a representation or promise which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.bus.emphasis added.there is a split of authority as to whether that wording from the is meant to dispense with the common law requirement of reliance in express warranty cases.see charles heckman,reliance or common honesty of speech the history and interpretation of section of the uniform commercial code,case res.the texas supreme court has concluded that b asis of the bargain loosely reflects the express warranty requirement of reliance,and that therefore an express warranty claim requires a form of reliance.am.tobacco,grinnell.emphasis added.that court has recently characterized a breach of express warranty claim as requiring reliance to a certain extent.henry schein,at,wl,at emphasis added.
although the precise level of reliance required under texas law to recover for breach of express warranty is unclear,purchasers who understood the towing limitations,or who did not read or consider the wardrobe door tag,can not be said to have relied on the allegedly misleading wardrobe tag to any extent.thus,the mcmanuses have failed to show that the representations were part of the basis of the bargain to such a uniform extent that class certification is appropriate under rule b for the breach of express warranty claim.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the mcmanuses claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability under rule b 
the mcmanuses argue that their claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability,see.bus,does not require a showing of reliance.see khan velsicol chem.fleetwood responds that the mcmanuses failed to plead the claim,and in the alternative,that the claim is unsuitable for class treatment.we conclude that the claims were properly pleaded,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a class for this claim under rule b.
the mcmanuses complaint enumerates five causes of action under separate headings violation california consumers legal remedies act,cal breach of express warranty breach of implied warranty of merchantability under california consumer warranty act,cal negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment.in a section of the complaint subtitled class action the mcmanuses state 
this is an action sought to be certified as a class action pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.this action involves defendant violations of the state consumer protection laws,in particular california consumer legal remedies act and the warranty act,as well as,alternatively,the corresponding consumer protection laws of other states,in the sale of motor homes to its customers.
second amended compl.at emphasis added.the mcmanuses argue that texas implied warranty of merchantability provision is included in their broadly worded complaint as a corresponding consumer protection law of texas.fleetwood points out that the texas implied warranty of merchantability claim would correspond only to california identical statute both from the a statute explicitly not pleaded.compare.bus.with cal.
the notice pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure and case law do not require an inordinate amount of detail or precision.paul mercury ins.williamson,cir.the plaintiff need not correctly specify the legal theory,so long as the plaintiff alleges facts upon which relief can be granted.id.here,the mcmanuses pleaded a version of implied warranty under a california statute.now that it is agreed texas law applies,the most natural reading of the mcmanuses complaint would include some version of that claim under texas law.moreover,the mcmanuses complaint alleges that their motor home was not fit for the ordinary purposes for which those vehicles are used,second amended compl.at,tracking the language of the relevant texas statute.bus.ann.goods to be merchantable must be at least such as are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.
we note also that the mcmanuses specifically mentioned texas implied warranty the fact that it does not require a showing of its motion for certification of a subclass.fleetwood failed to argue to the district court that the implied warranty claim had not been pleaded properly,and the district court order mentions implied warranty of merchantability under texas law.we conclude that the claim is properly encompassed in the pleadings.
the mcmanuses theory is that the motor homes were not fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.bus.ann.in other words,the motor homes are not fit for the ordinary purpose of towing because they can not safely
