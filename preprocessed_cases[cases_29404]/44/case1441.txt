plaintiff paul feldman,who asserts that he was unlawfully terminated from his employment in retaliation for protected activity under the sarbanes oxley act of sox,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants anthony rand,james lindsay,joseph jordan,paul briggs,and law enforcement associates corporation lea.because we find that feldman failed to sufficiently establish that his alleged protected activities were a contributing factor to his termination,we affirm.
sometime prior to,feldman became president of lea,a company that manufactures security and surveillance equipment he remained president and ceo until his termination on august.in,lea founder,john carrington,pled guilty to criminal export violations involving another company he owned,and was ordered to refrain from certain export activities for five years.though carrington remained a major stockholder,he resigned from lea board of directors board and has not been an officer or employee of lea since.during the relevant time period,the board consisted of two inside directors feldman and martin perry and three outside directors rand,lindsay,and jordan.
since at least november,an extraordinarily palpable split existed between the inside directors and the outside directors,due in some part to the fact that carrington planned to sell lea without first giving feldman an opportunity to buy it,as well as the board decision not to approve a written employment contract that would have increased feldman salary.the tension deepened after feldman confirmed in december that carrington owned fifty percent of a company called safe source,to which lea had shipped some of its products in or.safe source exported these products overseas,but because carrington was still banned from making exports,feldman became concerned that the exports were illegal.
the issue of lea business with safe source arose in a december,board meeting,but the parties dispute exactly what was said and by whom.there are competing versions of the meeting minutes,but a majority of the board the outside directors adopted the version produced by mark finkelstein,a lawyer rand hired for the company,over the version produced by eric littman,another lea attorney.feldman asserts that he objected that finkelstein minutes were falsified.feldman further contends that he saw rand and finkelstein meet with carrington immediately after the meeting,and suspects that they informed carrington of his intention to report the issue to the government.on january,feldman and perry wrote the united states department of commerce about the potentially illegal exports,resulting in a federal investigation and a raid of safe source headquarters shortly thereafter.
a number of other conflicts subsequently arose between feldman and appellees.in february or march,feldman relocated lea headquarters from youngsville,north carolina to raleigh,north carolina,claiming that it benefitted the company in various ways.the outside directors viewed this act as insubordinate since feldman entered the new lease on office space without their prior approval.at some point in,the outside directors also took issue with the financial information and meeting agendas they received from feldman,asserting that the requested information was either not provided or was insufficient.at a march,board meeting,finkelstein became lea primary counsel,while littman remained on as lea securities counsel.finkelstein submitted various bills for his legal services on may,but feldman considered them fraudulent because they were for services rendered prior to march,and he refused to pay.
in april,feldman and other lea representatives met with joseph and barbara wortley,lea shareholders who were threatening to sue lea over a contractual dispute.when joseph wortley expressed dissatisfaction with the board,feldman replied that the board could do more to help the company,and that he too wished they would do more.at a july,meeting with joseph wortley and wortley son,feldman further stated that the outside directors were loyal to carrington rather than to the company.shortly after this meeting,feldman wrote a letter to the outside directors urging them to resign from the board.lastly,in july or august,feldman and perry reported to the department of commerce their suspicion that lea was involved in insider trading because several prominent north carolina politicians were shareholders.
on august,rand told perry that the outside directors planned to terminate feldman at the board meeting scheduled for the next day because they had lost confidence in him and because of the wortley situation.however,rand told perry that the outside directors wanted perry to stay on at lea.perry advised feldman of the conversation,and neither he nor feldman attended the august,board meeting.feldman employment was terminated at that meeting,and perry employment was terminated on september,
feldman asserts that in the months just prior to his termination,he successfully led negotiations to secure a million contract with the department of homeland security dhs,and that,only ten days before firing him,lea reported record income and a increase in sales.appellees counter that the substantive work on the dhs contract was done by another employee,and that lea had record income in only because they unexpectedly received an unsolicited job from the census bureau worth roughly million.aside from this particular contract,appellees claim lea was a business that was not doing well during the last years of feldman leadership.
feldman filed suit against lea,rand,lindsay,jordan,and carrington on january,asserting a claim under the americans with disabilities act ada as well as state claims for civil conspiracy and wrongful termination.perry had sued separately,and they consolidated their complaints on april.on june,feldman and perry amended the complaint adding their respective sox claims that had since become ripe.the court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss,and all that remained at issue was their ada and sox claims,perry state law claims,and a counterclaim by lea.
feldman argues that he was unlawfully fired in retaliation for engaging in activities protected under sox between late december and early may.these activities include reporting to the board and the federal government about the potentially illegal exports with safe source objecting to falsified board meeting minutes objecting to leaks of information by the outside directors to carrington objecting to and refusing to pay finkelstein legal bills and notifying the government of suspected insider trading.
the district court granted summary judgment to appellees and held that plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing of their sox claims because they did not sufficiently prove that the alleged protected were a contributing factor to their respective terminations.the court therefore found that it need not decide whether lea could show that it would have terminated feldman and perry otherwise,but noted that lea had a legitimate business reason for its actions.feldman timely appealed,arguing that the court erred by holding that the activities were not contributing factors to his termination and by failing to decide whether appellees had sufficiently shown that he would have been fired regardless.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

in order to obtain relief under sox,a plaintiff must file a complaint with the secretary of labor through his designee,the occupational safety and health administration osha.see b a.if the secretary has not issued a final decision within days of the filing of the complaint,and there is no showing that the delay is due to any bad faith by the plaintiff,the plaintiff may file suit in federal district court,which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy.b b.the supreme court has indicated that a statute requiring plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before coming into federal court may be either jurisdictional in nature or non jurisdictional,depending on the intent of congress as evinced by the language used.ace prop.cas.ins.fed.crop ins,cir citing weinberger salfi.for the purposes of this appeal,we assume,without deciding,that the requirement to exhaust one administrative remedies as provided for in is jurisdictional see stone instrumentation lab,cir t he sarbanes oxley act expressly provides a united states district court jurisdiction to entertain a whistleblower action.stone duke energy,cir section b b confers jurisdiction on a district court when a qualifying complainant files his complaint there.

does feldman amended complaint,wherein he asserts his claim under the sarbanes oxley act of,relate back to the date of the original complaint under.c,and if so,did the district court properly exercise jurisdiction over this claim 
under rule c,an amended pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in the original pleading.c b.thus,when a pleading relates back under rule c,the amended pleading is considered to have been filed on the date that the original pleading which it replaces was filed.
in this case,feldman filed his osha complaint alleging that lea had violated the whistleblower protections of sox on november.he therefore could only obtain de novo review of this claim in federal court if,in the absence of any bad faith on his part,the secretary had not issued a final decision within days,that is,by may.although feldman filed his initial lawsuit more than four months prior to this date,there is no dispute that the secretary never issued a final decision.in a motion filed on march,feldman indicated that he intended to amend his complaint to add the sox claim once it became ripe,and appellees expressly agreed to the inclusion of this claim in the plaintiffs amended complaint.
upon reviewing both complaints,it is evident that,under rule c,the sox claim raised in the amended complaint arises out of the conduct,transactions,and occurrences set out in the first complaint.feldman initial complaint details his reports about safe source and also his claim that he and perry told paul briggs,lea chief financial officer at the time,that they intended to report their suspicions of insider trading to the government.the complaint then alleges that rand,lindsay,jordan,and carrington thereafter undertook a campaign to discredit,undermine,intimidate,and retaliate against feldman for his report to the federal government and for his ongoing cooperation with the resulting federal investigations.appellant supplemental br.see id.it further alleges that this retaliatory campaign included the production of falsified board meeting minutes and leaks of information to carrington.
by comparison,feldman second complaint alleges that he engaged in protected activity under sox by,among other things,reporting his concerns about safe source to the board and the government,asking board members to affirm that they did not leak information to carrington,objecting to the falsification of meeting minutes,and reporting suspected insider trading.it can not be seriously doubted that this sox claim arises out of the same conduct,transactions,and occurrences as the first complaint.thus,under rule c,the second complaint does relate back to the date of the first complaint,at which point the court did not have jurisdiction over feldman sox claim.
however,we have previously held that the filing of a supplemental pleading is an appropriate mechanism for curing numerous possible defects in a complaint.franks ross,cir internal citations omitted.feldman concedes that he should have presented his sox claim in a supplemental pleading under rule d,pursuant to which the court may permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction,occurrence,or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.d.considering a similar circumstance,the eighth circuit has held that e ven when the district court lacks jurisdiction over a claim at the time of its original filing,a supplemental complaint may cure the defect by alleging the subsequent fact which eliminates the jurisdictional bar.wilson westinghouse corp,cir internal citations omitted.
