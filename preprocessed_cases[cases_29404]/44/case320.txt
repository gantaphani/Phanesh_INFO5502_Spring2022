angelina brought suit on her own behalf and on behalf of her deceased son on april.she alleged federal civil rights claims based on violations of the fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments and claims under puerto rico law of negligence and medical malpractice.ruiz brought her claims against the puerto rico administrator of corrections,victor rivera gonzález the secretary of the department of health,johnny rullán the chief health care coordinator for puerto rico,aida the medical director at bcc,hector mena medical doctors at bcc,including rafael pichardo unnamed nurses at bcc the unnamed superintendent of bcc and unidentified insurance companies.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss in july of and also filed an answer to ruiz complaint.during the fall of and the winter of,ruiz moved to substitute some named parties for the john doe defendants and to extend the deadlines for discovery and for identifying other defendants.with their motion to dismiss still pending,the defendants moved for summary judgment on march.on march,the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss but found that the complaint jumbles the allegations pertaining to the constitutional tort with those partaking of a medical malpractice,and imputes all defendants with liability under either legal theory.the court ordered ruiz to file an amended complaint,on or before april,to separate the factual allegations corresponding to each legal theory of liability,and also define which defendants are liable under each of the theories,and for what actions.the court also warned ruiz that failure to file an amended complaint as ordered would result in dismissal of her case.the court denied ruiz motions to substitute parties and to extend discovery deadlines.
ruiz filed an amended complaint within the time allowed.the amended complaint named several new defendants in place of john doe defendants.ruiz also moved to dismiss all claims against victor rivera gonzález.the court dismissed the claims against rivera and against hector mena.the defendants supplemented their motion for summary judgment after the amended complaint was filed,and ruiz filed a response.on february,the court dismissed the defendants who had been named as john does but were then identified by name in ruiz amended complaint.on february,the court found that ruiz amended complaint did not comply with the order to separate her allegations as to each of her theories of liability and as to each defendant and dismissed all of ruiz claims as a sanction for noncompliance.at the same time,the court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on ruiz federal claim and declined supplemental jurisdiction as to her malpractice claim under puerto rico law,which was dismissed without prejudice.
discussion 
ruiz appeals the district court order that dismissed her claims as a sanction and alternatively granted summary judgment in the defendants favor on her federal claims she contends that dismissing her claims as a sanction was inappropriate and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in the defendants favor on her federal claim.the remaining defendants,johnny rullán,aida,and rafael pichardo,defend the district court decision to dismiss ruiz claims as a sanction and argue that summary judgment was properly granted 
dismissal as sanction 
in response to a defendant motion,a court may dismiss an action f or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with any order of court.b.a dismissal entered to sanction a party for failure to comply with a court order or for failure to prosecute the case is reviewed for abuse of discretion.malot dorado beach cottages,cir.in determining whether an abuse of discretion has occurred,we must fairly balance the court venerable authority over case management with the larger concerns of justice,including the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits.id.
dismissal with prejudice,along with contempt,are the most severe penalties that may be ordered against a recalcitrant party,cir.we therefore reserve dismissal with prejudice for egregious misconduct that is measured by considering all aspects of the case,including the severity of the violation,the legitimacy of the party excuse,repetition of violations,the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct,mitigating excuses,prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court,and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.id.at quoting robson hallenbeck,cir.in addition,procedural fairness mandates that the plaintiff be afforded an opportunity to explain her noncompliance or to advocate for a lesser sanction.id.at.
in this case,the district court found ruiz original complaint wanting,but instead of dismissing her claims,the court granted her an opportunity to file a more clearly stated complaint.ruiz filed an amended complaint within the time the court allowed.as directed,ruiz separated her claims into separate causes of action,alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under federal law as her first claim and medical malpractice under puerto rico law as her second claim.ruiz alleged particular actions and conduct by each defendant,including the newly named defendants,in support of her federal claim.for her malpractice claim,however,ruiz adopted by reference all of the allegations made in support of the federal claim and stated that those acts and omissions,also amount to gross negligence fault under puerto rico law.
the district court found ruiz amended complaint deficient,concluding that she utterly failed to comply with our order of march.in particular,the court faulted ruiz for once again jumbl ing the allegations pertaining to the constitutional violation based on denial of medical care with those which would sustain a tort for medical malpractice,and unabashedly reassert ing that all defendants are liable under both legal theories.the court also found it unacceptable that ruiz adopted by reference all of the facts alleged in support of her federal claim to support her malpractice claim the court concluded that ruiz medical malpractice claim against the defendants who were alleged to have purely administrative deficiencies was patently frivolous.
to satisfy federal rule of civil procedure a,a plaintiff must allege claims in a way that gives the defendants fair notice of what the claims are and the grounds for those claims.calvi knox county,cir.the complaint must at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom,when,where,and why.id.quoting educadores puertorriquenos en accion hernandez,cir.civil rights cases do not impose a heightened pleading standard.asociación de suscripción conjunta del deguro de responsabilidad obligatorio flores galarza,wl,at cir.
the defendants counsel conceded at oral argument that ruiz amended complaint put the defendants on notice of what her claims were and the grounds for those claims and agreed that the amended complaint satisfied the requirements of notice pleading.the defendants counsel argued,however,that the district court sanction was within its discretion because ruiz amended complaint did not meet the more exacting requirements set forth in the district court order.we disagree.
in its march order,the district court required more than is necessary to satisfy the notice pleading standard of the federal rules.the district court then dismissed ruiz claims as a sanction for failing to comply with the standard.it is far from clear that ruiz failed to comply with the court order,much less that any deficiency in the amended complaint was a sufficient basis to support the harsh sanction of dismissal the court decision to dismiss the complaint as a sanction was an abuse of discretion.we turn to the alternative basis for the district court decision,summary judgment.
summary judgment 
on appeal,we review summary judgment de novo,employing the same standard that governed consideration of the motion below.see salem hosp.nurses ass n,cir.we therefore examine all of the material facts of record and resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.ins.dagnone,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the properly supported facts of record show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on ruiz federal claims and declined supplemental jurisdiction over her malpractice claim,which was dismissed without prejudice.in doing so,the court noted that machuca illness was a serious medical need but agreed with the defendants that evidence was lacking to support the deliberate indifference prong of ruiz federal claim.ruiz argues that she alleged sufficient facts to allow a jury to conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her son serious medical needs and,to a lesser extent,contends that record facts support her claim.
because ruiz son,machuca,was a pretrial detainee rather than a convicted inmate,the fourteenth amendment governs his claim.surprenant rivas,cir.the fourteenth amendment provides at least as much protection for pretrial detainees as the eighth amendment provides for convicted inmates.revere,d.generally,the standard applied under the fourteenth amendment is the same as the eighth amendment standard burrell hampshire county,cir.
for medical treatment in prison to offend the constitution,the care must involve acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.feeney corr.med,cir quoting estelle gamble,d.deliberate indifference in this context may be shown by the denial of needed care as punishment and by decisions about medical care made recklessly with actual knowledge of impending harm,easily preventable.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.deliberate indifference means that a prison official subjectively must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.burrell,at quoting farmer brennan,d.therefore,substandard care,malpractice,negligence,inadvertent failure to provide care,and disagreement as to the appropriate course of treatment are all insufficient to prove a constitutional violation.feeney,at.
ruiz primarily relies on the allegations in her complaint to oppose summary judgment,and such reliance does not satisfy the rule standard.in contrast,the defendants cite to the medical record,deposition testimony,and their declarations submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment.see.c.a party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment must present competent evidence of record that shows a genuine issue for trial.see anderson liberty lobby,d.allegations made in a plaintiff complaint,standing alone,are not enough to oppose a properly supported motion for summary judgment.horizon lines of,cir.
as presented,the record provides no evidence of deliberate indifference on the part of any of the defendants.ruiz expert witness,carlos eduardo ramirez gonzalez,criticized the care machuca received,stating that he was given ineffective antibiotics,that doses of the antibiotics which were prescribed were missed,that the staff failed to keep adequate medical records,and that the staff failed to respond when machuca condition worsened.ramirez stated that in his opinion the prison medical staff was indifferent to machuca need for care because they saw that his condition was deteriorating but failed to take any action.
the record establishes that pichardo treated machuca by draining the abscess,ordering a culture,and prescribing a second antibiotic.although ruiz disagrees with the treatment pichardo provided,ramirez opinion does not provide evidence that pichardo was aware that the antibiotic he prescribed was ineffective and would pose a substantial risk of harm to machuca.ruiz also faults pichardo for failing to monitor machuca condition after he treated him.the record shows,however,that pichardo only worked at the prison two days each week.ruiz provides no evidence that pichardo was aware that his failure to monitor machuca after treating him would subject machuca to a substantial risk of harm.
ruiz has shown only that her expert witness disagrees with pichardo choice of antibiotic and the course of treatment pichardo provided,which might be evidence of malpractice a matter on which we express no opinion,but is insufficient to show deliberate indifference.see feeney,at.in addition,ruiz,the party with the burden of proof,can not rely on speculation or conjecture and must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence in her favor.invest almaz forest prods,cir.
ruiz argues that rullán,who was secretary of the puerto rico department of health,and guzmán,who was chief health care coordinator for the correctional health services program,knew of the substandard medical treatment provided at bcc and failed to remedy the problem.specifically,ruiz contends that rullán and guzmán knew that failing to treat sepsis properly with antibiotics puts patients lives at risk and that the practice of having a surgeon available only two days each week puts patients lives at risk.she further contends that the risk of harm from inadequate medical treatment at bcc was obvious.although ruiz alleges that rullán and guzmán knew of these practices and their consequences,she provided no evidence of such knowledge.
while proof of deliberate indifference by prison officials does not require evidence that the officials were aware of the risk of a specific harm,the plaintiff must show that the officials had knowledge of facts from which the official s can draw the inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,cir.in so
