brenda langley ran into problems with her coworkers while working for daimlerchrysler corporation.the personnel problems escalated to the point that langley took a leave of absence from the company.she placed the blame for her problems on daimlerchrysler and one of her coworkers,debra lobzun.after failing to resolve the matter internally,langley sued.
the district court considered langley claims and evidence in light of the defendants requests for summary judgment.finding no genuine issue of material fact on any of her claims,the district court granted judgment to the defendants.on appeal,langley maintains that the district court erred in several ways,including overreaching its jurisdiction.
upon review of the record and applicable law,we affirm.
langley began working for daimlerchrysler as a production worker,and eventually moved up to production supervisor.langley had difficulty working with some of the employees she supervised,including lobzun.in april,langley was summoned to meet with the members of the company local response team lrt,which investigates troublesome employees and situations.the lrt told langley that lobzun had reported that someone was going to pull a daryl richardson on langley.ja.richardson was a supervisor who was beaten with a baseball bat in an incident to employees,including langley.the lrt investigation revealed,however,that no employee had actually threatened langley.the team reported its findings to langley.
after her meeting with the lrt,langley felt unable to return to her job.she went to her family doctor,who advised her to take some time off work due to the stress she was experiencing.she took a leave of absence from the company,but has since returned.
during her leave of absence,langley sought disability benefits through daimlerchrysler disability absence plan dap,which provides salary payments to employees who are unable to perform all the duties of their occupation.daimlerchrysler denied her claim.
langley then brought suit against daimlerchrysler and lobzun in ohio state court.daimlerchrysler removed the case to federal court.langley second amended complaint set forth claims against daimlerchrysler for wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy age discrimination in violation of ohio revised code and ohio public policy sex discrimination in violation of ohio revised code and ohio public policy intentional infliction of emotional distress violation of the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa breach of contract and disability discrimination in violation of ohio revised code.she also made a claim against lobzun for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
after the close of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.langley filed her own motion for partial summary judgment.the district court granted the defendants motions,denied langley motion,and entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.bender hecht dep t stores,cir.summary judgment is justified if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we consider the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of langley as the nonmoving party.mahon crowell,cir.to survive summary judgment,she must provide evidence beyond the pleadings setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.
langley dap claim 
langley asserted an erisa claim for benefits under the company dap.erisa provides an eligible employee the right to bring a cause of action against a plan administrator,but only for violating a plan governed by that statute.see a b.the district court concluded that daimlerchrysler dap was not an erisa plan,but rather a payroll practice,even though the company summary plan description spd included statements from which an employee might conclude the company represented the dap to be covered by erisa.langley argues that the district court committed reversible error.
determining the existence of an erisa plan is a question of fact to be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances and facts from the point of view of a reasonable person,which is reviewed for clear error.kolkowski goodrich,cir citing thompson am.home assurance,cir.in general,courts apply a test to determine whether erisa covers a particular plan or practice first,does a safe harbor exception apply if not,do the surrounding circumstances suggest that a reasonable person could ascertain the intended benefits,the class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and the procedures for receiving benefits and has the employer established or maintained the plan with the intent of providing benefits to its employees.thompson,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.here,the district court analysis started and ended at the first step.
under erisa,the terms employee welfare benefit plan and welfare plan are defined as 
any plan,fund,or program which has heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment,
under the department of labor regulations,however,normal compensation paid to an employee as a result of a disability and from the employer general assets does not constitute an employee welfare benefit plan,but instead is considered a payroll practice.b.such practices are not regulated by erisa.abella foote mem l,cir.
langley does not dispute that daimlerchrysler made dap payments entirely out of its general assets.nor does she assert that recipients received anything other than normal compensation under the plan.accordingly,the dap falls squarely within the plain meaning of a payroll practice.this is not,however,the end of our analysis.
langley correctly points out that daimlerchrysler made statements in its spd from which an employee might conclude that the dap was an erisa plan which is presumably why she pleaded an erisa claim.daimlerchrysler argues on appeal that it does not conflate the group insurance benefits covered under erisa with the dap,as the benefits are described in the spd.the company fails,however,to address any of the specific statements relied upon by the district court for finding otherwise.for example,the spd states that t hese plans are designed to meet the legal requirements for employee benefit plans under erisa.ja.the company does not refer us to any statement in the spd which excludes the dap from t hese plans in fact,the dap is listed directly above the t hese plans statement.id.as daimlerchrysler has pointed to no clear error by the district court,the next step is to consider whether,as langley argues,the district court erred in attaching little weight to this and other statements in the spd.
a review of the case law and record confirms that the district court did not err.although we have not had occasion to address the issue,several of our sister circuits have considered whether an employer description of a plan as one governed by erisa is determinative.in mcmahon digital equipment corporation,the first circuit affirmed a lower court finding that a disability benefit plan was covered by erisa.st cir.the company had held the plan out to its employees and the federal government as an erisa plan.moreover,the company funded the disability payments with insurance as well as general assets.the first circuit concluded that the combination of these facts weighed in favor of an erisa plan,not a payroll practice.the court emphasized,however,the limitations of its holding 
we do not hold that an employer mere labeling of a plan determines whether a plan is an erisa plan,since this also could lead to a form of regulation shopping.but where,as here,an employer partially funds a plan from sources ou
