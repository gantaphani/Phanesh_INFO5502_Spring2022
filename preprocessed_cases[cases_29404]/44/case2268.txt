railworkers robert borger and derrick atkinson sued csx transportation under the federal employers liability act,alleging injuries from exposure to hydrochloric acid fumes.for the reasons described below,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in csx favor.
on june,robert borger,and derrick atkinson worked together as engineer and conductor on a csx train heading south from troy,ohio to cincinnati.a northbound csx train from cincinnati needed to pass on the same track,so borger stopped his train in a section of track parallel to the main track.as the other train passed,borger remained onboard,while atkinson stepped off.borger says that while the northbound train was passing,he smelled an immediate sharp,strong smell like somebody taking a fire extinguisher and blasting it in his face.from where he stood,atkinson also smelled a very,very strong smell.borger eyes were irritated and he experienced a strong acidy taste going down his throat as well as headaches and coughing.atkinson experienced similar symptoms both men received medical treatment.
before the northbound train left cincinnati earlier that evening,a csx crew had conducted a brake inspection which included a visual inspection of the train cars.the crew reported no leaks or unusual smells.three crew members aboard the northbound train said in affidavits that,before they passed borger and atkinson,they were not aware of any odor coming from our train and had no knowledge that there was any leak or emission or discharge from any of the cars.one of the crew stated that he had briefly noticed a odor which he did not believe came from any of the cars of our train.another crew member had smelled an unusual odor,but did not believe that it was coming from our train,and the third crew member smelled an usual odor,but believed that it had come from the miller brewery,not our train.
after the train passed,borger reported the odor to a dispatcher and the northbound train stopped for the crew to inspect it.the crew did not detect any leaks or unsecured valves or hatches,but they did smell a faint odor coming from one of the tank cars that was carrying hydrochloric acid.later that night,the trainmaster inspected the northbound train and also did not discover any leaks.and at a later stop in walbridge,ohio,yet another csx worker inspected the train and,again,found no leaks.
borger and atkinson filed separate lawsuits against csx under the federal employers liability act,for injuries that allegedly resulted from exposure to hydrochloric acid vapors emanating from the northbound train.the district court consolidated their cases and granted csx motion for summary judgment,determining that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether csx violated federal safety regulations and that the release of hydrochloric acid vapor was not foreseeable and thus was not the result of csx negligence.the plaintiffs appeal.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.mohnkern prof l ins,cir,and makes all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party favor.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
the federal employers liability act provides a federal cause of action against a railroad company for employees injured as a result of their employer negligence 
every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier 
congress enacted the act in response to the special needs of railroad workers who are daily exposed to the risks inherent in railroad work and are helpless to provide adequately for their own safety.aparicio norfolk ry,cir citation omitted,abrogated on other grounds by reeves sanderson plumbing,d.the act requires a railroad company to provide its workers with a reasonably safe place in which to work and such protection against the hazard causing the injury as would be expected of a person in the exercise of ordinary care under the circumstances.aparicio,at quoting urie thompson.
a plaintiff may demonstrate liability as a matter of law if he proves that a railroad company violated a safety statute that establishes an absolute duty on the railroad company.see crane cedar rapids iowa city ry,d kernan am.dredging,d urie,at.if a plaintiff can not point to a specific safety statute that the railroad violated,he can still prevail by proving the traditional common law elements of negligence duty,breach,foreseeability,and causation.adams csx,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that csx violated three federal regulations issued under the hazardous materials transportation act,and.we assume,without deciding,that the hazardous materials transportation act is among those safety statutes that establishes an absolute duty under the fela.
first,borger and atkinson say that csx violated 
d examination before shipping.
no person may offer for transportation a tank car containing a hazardous material or a residue of a hazardous material unless that person determines that the tank car is in proper condition and safe for transportation.
emphasis added.section describes a inspection process,including for example,examination of the tank shell and heads for abrasion,corrosion,cracks,dents,distortion,defects in welds,or any other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation.d i x.but csx failure to perform such an inspection does not violate section because the regulation is not directed at carriers,like csx,but at those who offer for transportation a tank car.here,the company that offered the car that contained hydrochloric acid to csx for transportation was bayer corporation.thus,under section d,it was bayer duty,not csx,to perform these inspections before shipping and csx failure to perform them is irrelevant under section d a regulation that applies to shippers.
the plaintiffs also maintain that csx violated,which addresses the inspection duties for carriers 
at each location where a hazardous material is accepted for transportation or placed in a train,the carrier shall inspect each rail car containing the hazardous material,at ground level,for required markings,labels,placards,securement of closures and leakage.this inspection may be performed in conjunction with inspections required under parts and of this title.
parts and describe the required and brake system inspections.
john hamm,a csx car inspector who was on duty the night of the incident,testified about the scope of his inspection of the northbound train.the district court concluded that it satisfied section requirements because in the course of performing the ground level class brake inspection of the northbound train before departure,hamm also looked for signs of leaks on each of the cars and found none.we agree that this was sufficient.hamm testified in his deposition that he visually observed the valves,ports,discharge pipes,hatches,latches,and other equipment on the tank cars in the course of completing his brake inspection.he also explained that,had he seen anything out of the ordinary,he would have reported it to the lead man and noted it in the car inspectors work report.the work report contains no indication that hamm observed anything out of the ordinary.
the plaintiffs counter that hamm did not properly inspect the tank car on the northbound train prior to it leaving cincinnati,but they do not explain how hamm visual inspection fell short of section requirements.they do not contend that section requires more than a ground level inspection for required markings,labels,placards,securement of closures and leakage.these duties are fewer and less burdensome than those imposed on shippers,see d i x.although hamm testified that he was not trained to inspect tank cars,borger and atkinson offer no evidence that a section visual inspection requires special training,beyond the training hamm completed to become a car inspector.thus,the district court properly concluded that no facts in the record could support an inference that csx failed to comply with section.
