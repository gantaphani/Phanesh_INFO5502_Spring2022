jerry young appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of maryland granting summary judgment to prince george county and officer hines on plaintiff unlawful arrest and excessive force claims brought under and state law battery claim.on appeal,young argues that summary judgment should not have been granted on his unlawful arrest claim because the methods of restraint utilized by officer hines turned the investigatory stop to which he was subjected into an unlawful arrest.young also argues that summary judgment was improperly granted on his excessive force claim because the level of force used by officer hines was unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances.moreover,young asserts that in granting summary judgment on his fourth amendment excessive force claim the district court applied the wrong legal standard.specifically,young contends that the district court incorrectly reviewed his excessive force claim under the fourteenth amendment subjective standard rather than the fourth amendment objective reasonableness standard.lastly,young argues that summary judgment should not have been granted on his state law battery claim because officer hines use of excessive force constitutes battery under maryland law.we hold that the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on young unlawful arrest claim.we also hold that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether officer hines used excessive force when,after handcuffing young behind his back,he forcefully threw young to the ground and proceeded to strike young in the back of head with his forearm and pound his knee into young back.given that there is question as to whether officer hines used excessive force,young state law battery claim can not be properly adjudicated until such a determination is made.we therefore vacate these portions of the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
