on appeal,jonathan wirth contends that the employee retirement and income security act of erisa,et,does not preempt his state law claims against aetna healthcare aetna and,therefore,that the district court erred in granting removal of his suit from state to federal court.wirth also contends that,even if removal was proper,the district court erred in holding that pennsylvania health maintenance organization act hmo act exempts aetna from wirth claim under pennsylvania motor vehicle financial responsibility law mvfrl.we have jurisdiction to review his challenge under.
we ruled on these issues in a previous interim opinion,wirth aetna healthcare.cir.june,where we opined that wirth claims were completely preempted by erisa and,therefore,properly removed to federal court.however,we certified to the pennsylvania supreme court the question of whether aetna is exempt from the provision of the mvfrl by virtue of the hmo act.now that we have received the court opinion on this question,we write finally and precedentially to incorporate that court holding as well as our own prior reasoning on the jurisdictional issue.in doing so,we will affirm the order of the district court as to both of these issues 
factual and procedural background 
wirth was injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by a third party tortfeasor.his treatment for those injuries was covered under an hmo healthcare agreement issued by aetna wirth recovered a settlement from the third party tortfeasor subsequently,aetna,who claimed it was acting within its contractual rights,asserted a subrogation lien to recover monies from that settlement wirth paid aetna to release its lien and then filed a class action suit in state court alleging,inter alia,unjust enrichment and violation of section of the mvfrl,which provides that in actions arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle,there shall be no right of subrogation or reimbursement from a claimant tort recovery with respect to benefits paid or payable by a program,group contract or other arrangement.
aetna removed the suit to federal court,contending that wirth claims were simply to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,a b,and therefore fell within the scope of section a b of erisa.as such,aetna argued that wirth claims evoked the doctrine of complete preemption,which holds that certain federal laws so thoroughly occupy a field of regulatory interest that any claim brought within the field,however stated in the complaint,constitutes a federal claim and therefore bestows a federal court with jurisdiction.see metro.life ins.taylor,d.the district court agreed,finding that erisa was such a thoroughly robust regulatory regime,and denied wirth motion to remand.
after concluding it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action,the district court proceeded to consider the specific allegations of wirth complaint.there,wirth averred that,by laying claim to any portion of his tort recovery,aetna had violated the provision found at section of the mvfrl.aetna countered,contending that section was inapplicable to an hmo like itself because the hmo act provides that hmos will not be governed by a state law that regulates insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization.a.aetna urged that subrogation was permissible because section does not employ the term health maintenance organization,and is therefore not specifically applicable to hmos.the district court agreed,finding that there is nothing in which specifically and in exact terms applies to hmos,and dismissed wirth claims.
on appeal,wirth challenges both the district court conclusion that his claims are completely preempted by section a of basis for the district court jurisdiction over the well as the court interpretation of sections of the mvfrl and a of the hmo act.
ii.subject matter jurisdiction claim preemption under section a 
wirth argues that the removal of his lawsuit to federal court,and the reclassification of his state law claim as an erisa action,was error.because the question is one of jurisdiction,we exercise plenary review over wirth challenge.pryzbowski healthcare,cir.in our interim opinion,we held that the district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over wirth claim.wirth.at.we reiterate that decision,and repeat our analysis here 
under a,a participant in an plan may bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.wirth contends that because his claims are neither for benefits due nor to enforce rights under the aetna plan,erisa does not provide a civil enforcement mechanism for wirth to challenge or defend against aetna liens and,therefore,that the district court erred in granting removal of the case from state to federal court.
in our interim opinion,we found this argument foreclosed by our decision in levine.the force of levine reasoning has not diminished.the plaintiffs in levine were injured in an auto accident,received medical benefits from their respective insurers and subsequently recovered damages from the responsible tortfeasors.following the plaintiffs monetary recovery,their respective insurers sought reimbursement for the benefits paid pursuant to subrogation provisions of their relevant healthcare plans.the plaintiffs settled with their insurers by paying over a portion of their tort recovery but then sued the insurance companies for,inter alia,unjust enrichment in new jersey state court 
on appeal in levine,we considered,inter alia,whether plaintiffs unjust enrichment claims for monies taken pursuant to subrogation and reimbursement provisions in their erisa health plans are claims for benefits due within the meaning of erisa section a.in determining that they were,we noted that such a holding comported with similar rulings in the fourth and fifth circuits,see singh prudential health care plan,cir arana ochsner,cir en banc,and would be consistent with the framework we previously laid out for evaluating complete preemption in pryzbowski healthcare,cir designating two categories of erisa cases where the claim challenges the administration of,or eligibility for,benefits,which are preempted,and those challenging the quality of medical treatment,which are not preempted.levine,at.while recognizing that the facts of levine neither overlapped perfectly with those in arana or singh,nor fell squarely within either pryzbowski category,we nonetheless held that where plaintiffs claim that their erisa plan wrongfully sought reimbursement of previously paid health benefits,the claim is for benefits due and federal jurisdiction under section a of erisa is appropriate.such a rule comports with our earlier jurisprudence because,although not directly analogous,such claims are more like challenges to the administration of benefits than challenges to the quality of benefits received.id.quoting pryzbowski,at.
as we noted in our interim opinion,our holding in levine applies squarely to the present facts and precludes wirth argument that seeking recovery of the paid to extinguish aetna lien is not tantamount to seeking recovery of benefits due to him.here,as in levine,the actions undertaken by the insurer resulted in diminished benefits provided to the plaintiff insureds.that the bills and coins used to extinguish aetna lien are not literally the same as those used to satisfy its obligation to cover wirth injuries is of no import the benefits are under something of a cloud.arana,at.for these reasons,we reiterate the holding of our interim opinion wirth claims against aetna are completely preempted by erisa and there was no error in the district court conclusion that it had jurisdiction over this matter.
iii.interpretation of pennsylvania law 
wirth argues that,even if the district court was correct in exercising jurisdiction over this claim,it erred in finding that pennsylvania hmo act exempted aetna from complying with the provision found in section of the mvfrl in interpreting state law,as we must here,the decisions of the state h
