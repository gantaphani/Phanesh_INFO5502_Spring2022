star scientific,a cigarette manufacturer,challenges the constitutionality of the master settlement agreement of november,between the commonwealth of well as other the major tobacco manufacturers.it also challenges the constitutionality of legislation enacted by the commonwealth of virginia to qualify it to receive payments under the master settlement agreement.
to settle the states lawsuits against the major tobacco manufacturers arising from their development and marketing of cigarettes,virginia and the other states,as well as the district of columbia and territories,entered into a master settlement agreement with phillip morris,reynolds tobacco company,brown williamson tobacco corporation,and lorillard tobacco company.the master settlement agreement calls for the tobacco manufacturers to pay the states,in exchange for releases from liability for past and future damages,approximately billion over the next years,including approximately billion to the commonwealth of virginia.
star scientific,which contends that it has not engaged in the misconduct attributed to the major tobacco manufacturers and was not sued by any of the states,asserts that it will be unjustly burdened by the requirements of the master settlement agreement and the legislation that virginia enacted pursuant to the agreement.it therefore commenced this action to challenge the constitutionality of both the settlement agreement and the statute.the district court granted virginia motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.
on appeal,star scientific contends that the statute enacted pursuant to the master settlement agreement,ann,violates its rights under the due process,equal protection,and commerce clauses of the united states constitution.it also contends that the master settlement agreement itself violates the compact clause.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in,the attorneys general of mississippi,minnesota,west virginia,and massachusetts filed lawsuits in their respective state courts against the major tobacco manufacturers,phillip morris,reynolds,brown williamson,and lorillard,seeking reimbursement for healthcare expenditures made by those states on behalf of citizens suffering from diseases.by,additional states had filed similar suits.although the states respective complaints varied,they shared a common theme,alleging that the major tobacco companies had misled and deceived the public by suppressing internal research about the risks and addictive properties of cigarettes,had committed fraud and had engaged in racketeering activity through their efforts to disseminate false statements about the addictive nature of nicotine and the adverse health effects of smoking,and had violated antitrust laws by,among other things,conspiring to suppress the development and marketing of safer cigarettes.
by,after several more states had filed similar lawsuits,the major tobacco manufacturers negotiated with a group of state attorneys general to reach a comprehensive nationwide settlement of the claims.the settlement,which was known as the tobacco resolution,was contingent on congressional approval.accordingly,federal legislation to implement the tobacco resolution was introduced in the senate in november.the major tobacco manufacturers,however,withdrew their support of this legislation when it appeared that the legislation would require them to pay more money and accept greater regulatory and marketing restrictions than they had agreed to in the tobacco resolution.thus,the legislation was never enacted.
in the meantime,the major tobacco companies reached individual settlements with mississippi,florida,texas,and minnesota.and,upon failure of the tobacco resolution,several other state attorneys general initiated negotiations with two of the tobacco companies on a new settlement.on november,a group of state attorneys general and the major tobacco manufacturers reached an agreement called the master settlement agreement.this agreement permitted nonsettling states to participate if they acted within seven days.
the commonwealth of virginia,which had not participated in the original settlement discussions,decided to join the master settlement agreement and,for that purpose,commenced an action in state court against brown williamson,liggett group,lorillard,phillip morris,reynolds,and united states tobacco company on december.in its complaint,virginia alleged that it spends millions of dollars each year to pay healthcare costs caused by diseases.it contended that the tobacco companies misrepresented the health effects of tobacco while simultaneously suppressing research revealing the dangers of tobacco products.the complaint also asserted that the defendants acted in concert to suppress research and preserve their markets.finally,it alleged that the companies specifically targeted youth in their advertisements and marketing campaigns to induce such persons to start using tobacco products and increase the manufacturers sales of tobacco products.the complaint alleged violations of the virginia antitrust act,the virginia consumer protection act,and claims for unjust enrichment and restitution,and sought declaratory relief,injunctive relief,restitution,damages,costs,and attorneys fees.
after filing its complaint,virginia,along with the other states that had not already settled with the major tobacco companies,the district of columbia,and territories,agreed to sign on to the master settlement agreement.virginia litigation in state court was accordingly terminated by a consent decree and final judgment,dated february,providing that the master settlement agreement set forth therein,and the establishment of the escrow provided for therein are hereby approved in all respects,and all claims are hereby dismissed with prejudice as provided therein.star scientific was not named a defendant in that action and did not participate in the master settlement agreement.
under the master settlement agreement,the states released the participating tobacco manufacturers from all claims for past conduct based on the sale,use,and marketing of tobacco products.they also released future monetary claims arising out of exposure to tobacco products,including future claims for reimbursement of healthcare costs allegedly associated with the use of or exposure to tobacco products.
in return,the participating tobacco manufacturers agreed to conduct restrictions and to annual payments to the states.among the conduct restrictions were agreements to refrain from targeting youth in the advertising and marketing of tobacco products to refrain from using cartoon characters to promote cigarette sales to limit tobacco sponsorships of athletic and other events to refrain from lobbying congress to preempt or diminish the states rights under the master settlement agreement or to advocate that settlement proceeds under the master settlement agreement be used for programs other than those related to tobacco or health to dissolve the tobacco institute,the council for tobacco research,and the center for indoor air research and to refrain from suppressing research relating to smoking and health and misrepresenting the dangers of using tobacco products.the participating manufacturers also agreed to make annual payments in perpetuity for the damages caused to the states.it is estimated that through these payments,the states will receive more than billion through,of which virginia will receive or approximately billion.finally,the participating manufacturers agreed to pay the states costs and attorneys fees.
the master settlement agreement permits other tobacco companies to participate in the benefits of the agreement as subsequent participating manufacturers.subsequent participating manufacturers are not required to make any payments under the master settlement agreement unless their share of the national cigarette market exceeds the greater of their market share or of their market share.any payments that would be required would be tied to the subsequent participating manufacturers market shares.
because of a concern that manufacturers participating in the master settlement agreement might suffer a competitive disadvantage when compared to nonparticipating manufacturers and that this disadvantage could affect the participating manufacturers ability to make the settlement payments,the master settlement agreement includes provisions to protect the market shares and profitability of the participating manufacturers.thus,one provision of the master settlement agreement allows for participating manufacturers to reduce their damage payments if they lose market share during a given year,as determined by the firm,a group of economic consultants designated under procedures established in the master settlement agreement.in addition,the master settlement agreement requires the states to enact a qualifying statute that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the participating manufacturers experience manufacturers within such settling state s as a result of the provisions of this agreement.if a state does not enact and diligently enforce a qualifying statute,it can lose future payments under the master settlement agreement.
virginia enacted a qualifying statute in march in a form substantially similar to the model qualifying statute included in the master settlement agreement.see ann.virginia qualifying statute provides that any tobacco manufacturer selling cigarettes to consumers within the commonwealth,whether directly or indirectly,shall become a participating manufacturer and sign the master settlement agreement,or place into an escrow fund an amount determined by the number of cigarettes that the nonparticipating manufacturer sells in virginia.the amount ranges from slightly less than one cent per cigarette in to almost two cents per cigarette in the year and thereafter,adjusted for inflation.id.any nonparticipating tobacco manufacturer failing to comply with the duties imposed by the qualifying statute becomes subject to a civil fine and ultimately to loss of the privilege of selling cigarettes to consumers in virginia.id.
the escrow fund established by the statute is to be used to pay any judgment or settlement in a lawsuit brought by virginia to recover on a claim of the kind released in the master settlement agreement against a nonparticipating manufacturer.otherwise,the escrow funds are returned to the nonparticipating manufacturer either annually to the extent that they exceed what that manufacturer would have paid had it participated under the master settlement agreement or completely after years.in the interim,all interest earned on the escrow account is paid to the manufacturer.ann.
star scientific,a tobacco company that focuses on developing technology to reduce certain toxins in tobacco leaf and tobacco smoke,began operations in.it did not participate in the master settlement agreement because of the financial burden of the required payments.the company estimated that under the agreement,it would have to pay approximately million during and more thereafter.it asserts that it never engaged in the misconduct alleged against the major manufacturers by the states,and it was never sued by the states.accordingly,star scientific under comport with the requirements of the qualifying statutes.it deposited approximately million in escrow in april,approximately of which was attributable to the sale of cigarettes in virginia under virginia qualifying statute.
because of the substantial payments required by the states various qualifying statutes,star scientific commenced this action,seeking to have virginia qualifying statute declared unconstitutional and enjoined.it alleged in its complaint that the statute deprives star scientific of its rights under the due process,equal protection,commerce,and takings clauses of the united states constitution.it also challenged the master settlement agreement,arguing that the agreement is an unconstitutional interstate compact because it has not received congressional authorization,as required by the compact clause of article i,of the constitution.
on virginia motion,made under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court dismissed star scientific complaint.the court ruled that star scientific lacked standing to challenge the master settlement agreement under the compact clause because star scientific could not allege an injury that was concrete and particularized,nor could it show any legal prejudice caused by the master settlement agreement.the court recognized that star scientific had standing to challenge virginia qualifying statute,but it dismissed all of star scientific constitutional challenges to the statute for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.
from the district court judgment dismissing the complaint,star scientific filed this appeal.star scientific did not,however,appeal the district court ruling on its takings clause claim.
star scientific contends first that virginia qualifying.code ann.violates its rights under the due process clause.it argues that the statute unconstitutionally aims effectively to neutralize the economic impact of the master settlement agreement on the participating manufacturers by placing equivalent financial burdens on the nonparticipating manufacturers,who are competitors of the participating manufacturers.the statute accomplishes this end,they argue,by depriving nonparticipating competitors,such as star scientific,of their property for years either to force them to sign the master settlement agreement or to impose on them a competitive disadvantage that they otherwise would not have suffered because they engaged in no wrongdoing.
star scientific focuses on two legislative means which it asserts are illegal.first,it contends that the state deprives star scientific of its property without due process of law by forcing it to pay its funds into an escrow account for years,citing to eastern enterprises apfel,d kennedy,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part id.at.breyer,dissenting north.finishing,d.second,it contends that virginia seeks to compel it to sign an agreement settling a case to which it was not a party and for which it could not be made a party.star scientific contends that in an effort to force parties to join the master settlement agreement,virginia disadvantages nonparticipating manufacturers such as star scientific because their payments in escrow are not tax deductible.it asserts that this purpose is impermissible because it is unconstitutional for an agent of the state to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person reliance on his legal rights quoting united states goodwin,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in response,virginia argues that the qualifying statute is designed to protect the physical and fiscal health and welfare of the commonwealth and thus is a constitutionally sound exercise of the state police powers.the commonwealth asserts that the statute serves the expressly stated legitimate purpose of providing a source of recovery for the healthcare costs that it will inevitably be forced to bear.it concludes that,under rational basis review,the existence of this legitimate purpose ends the due process inquiry.the district court agreed with the commonwealth and dismissed star scientific due process claim.

the due process clause includes a substantive component that provides some protection against economic legislation interfering with property interests.see,concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust for,d usery turner elkhorn mining,d.this protection,however,is severely limited.the supreme court has long recognized that t he day is gone when this court uses the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to strike down state laws,regulatory of business and industry conditions,because they may be unwise,improvident,or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.williamson lee optical of.see also ferguson skrupa,d we have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies,who are elected to pass laws.
to comport with the limited scope of substantive due process protection,economic legislation need only be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.see,concrete pipe,at.duke power carolina environmental study group,d holland keenan trucking,cir if a piece of economic legislation is supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by a rational means,judgments about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the exclusive province of the legislative and executive branches quoting pension benefit guar.gray,d.under rational basis review,therefore,there is no need for mathematical precision in the fit between justification and means,concrete pipe,at,and the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional.it is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction,and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.lee optical,at.moreover,economic legislation come s to the court with a presumption of constitutionality,and the burden is on one complaining of a due process violation to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.usery,at.thus,i t is difficult to exaggerate the burden that a party must overcome to demonstrate that economic legislation fails rational basis review.holland,at.
the courts defer to rational legislative decisionmaking with respect to economic legislation because the legislatures are better equipped to consider and evaluate the profound and far reaching consequences that such legislation may have.duke power,at.thus,the supreme court has admonished that it is for the legislature,not the courts,to balance the advantages and disadvantages of economic legislation.lee optical,at.this deference is appropriate because the people may resort to the polls to protect themselves against abuses by the legislature.id.at.quoting munn illinois.
now applying this highly deferential standard,we determine whether star scientific has demonstrated that the virginia general assembly acted in an arbitrary and irrational way when it passed its qualifying statute.see usery,at.
the qualifying statute at.code ann.was passed with a fully articulated purpose.in the preamble to the legislation,the virginia general assembly stated that cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns which in turn present serious financial concerns for the commonwealth.it stated that it was therefore adopting the policy that financial burdens imposed on the commonwealth by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the commonwealth to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the state or be found culpable by the courts.against these background facts and the policy announced,the virginia general assembly articulated the purpose of the qualifying statute,as follows 
whereas,it would be contrary to the policy of the commonwealth if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large,profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the commonwealth will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably.it is thus in the interest of the commonwealth to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large,profits and then becoming before liability may arise.
in short,the statute stated purpose is to ensure that virginia will be able to recover healthcare costs from cigarette manufacturers regardless of whether the manufacturer has signed on to the master settlement agreement.giving effect to this purpose falls within the state police power to promote the public health of the state and do es not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition,or of some valid federal law.ferguson,at.quoting lincoln fed.labor union northwestern iron metal.because the qualifying statute unquestionably has a legitimate purpose,the only viable remaining question is whether the statute is rationally related to furthering this purpose.
the statute requires that tobacco manufacturers who have not signed the master settlement agreement place funds in escrow in proportion to the number of cigarettes that they sell in virginia,directly or through intermediaries.the funds are held to secure any claim by the commonwealth against the manufacturer for claims arising from cigarette smoking.while we recognize the financial burden that such payments might create for any given cigarette burden represented by the loss of use of significant amounts of money for note that the state surely could properly accomplish the same end by enacting a more financially burdensome form of legislation,such as an act imposing a tax on cigarette manufacturers but giving a tax credit to those who sign the master settlement agreement.under the escrow arrangement,the manufacturer receives interest currently on the funds in the escrow account and the full principal not used to pay judgments after years.this mechanism is rationally related to the stated purpose of the statute,and beyond that we must leave the weighing of interests and the wisdom of the legislation to the legislature.see ferguson,at.recognizing the social utility of debt adjusting,but nonetheless upholding a law that allowed only lawyers to engage in debt adjusting and,therefore,put out of business nonlawyer debt adjusters.stated differently,because the creation of the escrow account is rationally related to virginia legitimate purpose of ensuring that it can recover future judgments against nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers,we defer to the legislature judgment that the qualifying statute is the best way of dealing with the possibility of culpable manufacturers becoming judgment proof in the future.see duke power,at.noting that the fact that the legislation has profound and consequences provides all the more reason for this court to defer to the congressional judgment unless it is demonstrably arbitrary or irrational.
star scientific challenge to the qualifying statute is based on a rejection of the statute articulated purpose.it would rather infer that the statute was enacted to coerce cigarette manufacturers to sign on to the master settlement agreement.this argument ignores the fact that even if we were to reject the state articulated purpose for enacting the statute,we would then need only determine that the legislation has some conceivable purpose that is not prohibited by the constitution.see lee optical,at.considering various purposes on which the legislature might have based the legislation at issue see also minnesota clover leaf creamery,d noting that,in equal protection analysis,the court will assume that the objectives articulated by the legislature are actual purposes of the statute,unless an examination of the circumstances forces us to conclude that they could not have been a goal of the legislation quoting weinberger wiesenfeld,d.obviously,one of the conceivable purposes of the statute is the legitimate purpose stated by virginia and to which the means adopted rationally relates.accordingly,we agree with the district court that the qualifying statute does not violate the due process clause of the united states constitution.
star scientific next contends that virginia qualifying statute violates its rights under the equal protection clause.it argues that the statute treats tobacco companies differently based on whether or not they joined the master settlement agreement,and that this differential treatment is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.star scientific asserts first that the statute purpose is to protect the market share of the four largest cigarette manufacturers and that this protectionist purpose is illegitimate.second,it argues that even if the purpose of the statute is to ensure a source of recovery for health care costs imposed on virginia by cigarette smoking,this purpose is not rationally fulfilled by imposing the requirements of the qualifying statute only on nonparticipating members.
in response,virginia contends that the different classifications of cigarette manufacturers under the qualifying statute are rationally related to the overall purpose of providing a source of recovery for healthcare costs.just as participating manufacturers are required to make payments under the master settlement agreement for past and future damages,nonparticipating members are required to put money into escrow which is held only for assuring that the nonparticipating manufacturers future liability is satisfied.in either case,virginia future costs resulting from cigarette smoking are placed on the tobacco manufacturers who sell cigarettes in the state.
like the analysis used in evaluating the constitutionality of economic legislation under the due process clause,an analysis of economic legislation under the equal protection clause is a deferential one.in areas of social and economic policy,a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach communications,d.stated otherwise,a statutory classification that neither employs inherently suspect distinctions nor burdens the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right will be upheld if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.see,clover leaf creamery,at.city of new orleans dukes,d.this rational basis review is a paradigm of judicial restraint.beach communications,at.thus,those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.moreover,it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.dukes,at.internal citations omitted quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d.
turning to whether virginia qualifying statute violates the equal protection clause,we conclude that star scientific has not met its very difficult burden.although it is true that the qualifying statute creates distinctions among tobacco manufacturers based on whether a manufacturer signs the master settlement agreement,the distinctions are rationally related to virginia legitimate purpose of ensuring a source of recovery from all manufacturers for virginia future costs related to cigarette smoking.
for those manufacturers sued by virginia for wrongdoing,the master settlement agreement mandates not only strict conduct restrictions but also nonrefundable payments in perpetuity.manufacturers joining the agreement as subsequent participating manufacturers who were not sued for not required to make the same payments as the original participating manufacturers,nevertheless agree to be bound by conduct restrictions.in contrast,nonparticipating manufacturers are subject to no conduct restrictions,and their payments in escrow last for only years.in addition,these manufacturers receive interest on the funds while they are held in escrow,and the principal is fully refundable if the money is not needed to pay a judgment in a.thus,the refundability of the payments is directly related to the nonparticipating manufacturers future liability for losses.
thus,the distinctions between manufacturers signing the master settlement agreement and manufacturers not signing are rationally related to their status vel non as defendants,their willingness to agree to conduct limitations,and virginia need to ensure a source of recovery for all future related healthcare costs.all manufacturers thus bear responsibility in differing manners and degrees for limiting the state future liability for these costs.those manufacturers who have not admitted to any wrongdoing and who do not wish to limit their future conduct retain the ability to manufacture and market their product in the manner they pursued before,but they essentially provide a surety bond against future liability for related healthcare costs.
under the rational basis review applicable here,we conclude that virginia qualifying statute is constitutional.states are accorded wide latitude in the regulation of their local economies under their police powers,and rational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.dukes,at.see also kimel florida bd.of regents,d holding that,under rational basis review,the equal protection clause does not require states to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests they serve with razorlike precision.even though the tobacco manufacturers are treated differently,the differences in treatment are related to their different circumstances,allowing the state to accomplish its legitimate purposes.w e will not overturn such a statute unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purpose that we can only conclude that the legislature actions were irrational.vance bradley,d.this deference that we give virginia legislative decisions recognizes that e vils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions,requiring different remedies.or so the legislature may think.or the reform may take one step at a time,addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.lee optical,at.internal citations omitted.
star scientific acknowledges that providing a source of recovery for the possible harm caused to the state treasury by cigarettes is a legitimate state purpose.it argues,however,that the distinction in virginia qualifying statute between manufacturers who signed the master settlement agreement and those who did not is not rationally related to this purpose or any other legitimate state purpose.it gives several examples.
first,star scientific argues that nonparticipating manufacturers are actually treated more harshly under the qualifying statute than are participating manufacturers because nonparticipating manufacturers are required to pay more money and do more to assure against becoming judgment proof in the future than are participating manufacturers.it points to the fact that subsequent participating manufacturers who signed the master settlement agreement within days are not obligated to pay any damages as long as their market share stays within specified bounds.on the other hand,star scientific,as a nonparticipating manufacturer,is obligated to pay a fixed amount for each cigarette sold in virginia regardless of its market position there.
similarly,star scientific notes that the payments made by nonparticipating members under the qualifying statute greatly exceed the equivalent payments made by participating manufacturers to cover future liability.it explains that while all of the payments made by nonparticipating manufacturers under the qualifying statute are used to pay for future harms caused to the commonwealth,only of the payments made by participating manufacturers go to addressing future harms.to support this assertion,star scientific refers to the consent decree entered in virginia lawsuit against the major manufacturers,which provides that virginia has determined that of the payments required under the master settlement agreement shall be apportioned and deemed attributed to the monetary payment sought in its complaint.
star scientific arguments demonstrate that virginia qualifying statute does not treat nonparticipating manufacturers the same as it does manufacturers who subscribed to the master settlement agreement.but the fact that manufacturers in different circumstances are not treated the same does not mean that the distinctions are irrational or so unrelated to a legitimate purpose that they must be struck down under the equal protection clause.indeed,the distinctions made by virginia are rational.virginia initially made an assessment of those manufacturers who contributed most to its healthcare costs from cigarette smoking,and it sued those manufacturers.star scientific was not one of those accused by the commonwealth and,therefore,was not named a defendant in the litigation.that litigation was resolved against the major manufacturers by the master settlement agreement,under which the manufacturers agreed not only to make payments and pay attorneys fees but also to restrict their conduct.they agreed to limit their advertising and marketing of cigarettes,to limit their lobbying efforts,to disband their industrial associations,and to alter their research policies.these agreements are not insignificant and,indeed,such restrictions might not be enforceable as involuntary governmental bans.moreover,the payments made to the commonwealth by the participating manufacturers are not refundable,nor do the manufacturers receive interest on their payments.
the nonparticipating manufacturers,on the other hand,are not required to limit their conduct.their payments are refundable and earn interest.in addition,they are not required to pay the commonwealth attorneys fees.
in short,the distinction between participating manufacturers and nonparticipating manufacturers is rationally related to virginia efforts to redress alleged wrongdoing and,at the same time,to assure a future source for covering the costs of cigarette smoking from all tobacco manufacturers.
while the master settlement agreement resolved the litigation between virginia and the major tobacco determined by the commonwealth to be principally responsible for its also provided an incentive to other manufacturers to participate in the limitations on conduct that the commonwealth felt were beneficial to it and the citizens of virginia.thus,every other manufacturer not sued by the commonwealth was invited to join the master settlement agreement as a subsequent participating manufacturer.such subsequent participating manufacturers were not required to make payments but agreed to limit their conduct.star scientific was free to join the master settlement agreement as a subsequent participating manufacturer if it concluded that this would have been a better deal for it,but,apparently for business reasons,it elected not to participate in that capacity.
also,the fact that star scientific may end up paying relatively more toward future healthcare costs than participating manufacturers is directly related to star scientific future liability,which may be higher than that of participating manufacturers because it is not bound by any conduct restrictions.if its liability is not higher,it will receive its escrow payments back,with interest.
in sum,we conclude that the distinctions drawn in virginia qualifying statute between tobacco manufacturers participating in the master settlement agreement and those not participating are rationally related to the state purpose of ensuring a source of recovery from all cigarette manufacturers who are held liable for healthcare costs.the commonwealth decision to require nonparticipating manufacturers to place funds in an escrow account is not invidious discrimination or a wholly arbitrary act.dukes,at.rather,it is a rational system for assessing tobacco manufacturers for the costs of cigarette smoking as well as regulating their conduct to the extent that they were sued and agreed to resolve that suit through settlement.we therefore conclude that the qualifying statute does not violate the equal protection clause.
star scientific contends that virginia qualifying statute also violates the commerce clause,which gives congress the power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.this argument focuses on the aspect of the qualifying statute that assesses an escrow payment amount on each cigarette sold by nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers within the commonwealth,whether directly or through a distributor,retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries.ann.a emphasis added see also id.defining cigarette units sold as those sold in the commonwealth whether directly or through a distributor,retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries.more particularly,star scientific argues that the statute requires it to make payments on cigarettes sold by it to independent distributors in other states if the cigarettes are later sold into virginia.it maintains that,in this manner,the qualifying statute regulates transactions beyond the commonwealth borders and excessively burdens interstate commerce.
in response,virginia maintains that its qualifying statutes regulate only the sale of cigarettes in virginia.it contends that any incidental burden placed on interstate commerce by operation of the statute is outweighed by virginia strong interest in assuring its ability to recover the costs of tobacco use imposed on it by cigarette manufacturers.
the constitutional grant of authority to congress to regulate interstate commerce has long been understood,as well,to provide protection from state legislation inimical to the national commerce even where congress has not acted.barclays bank plc franchise tax bd.of,d quoting southern pac.arizona ex rel.sullivan.this negative command,known as the dormant commerce clause,prohibits states from legislating in ways that impede the flow of interstate commerce.oklahoma tax comm jefferson lines,d.the dormant commerce clause limitation on state power,however,is by no means absolute.in the absence of conflicting federal legislation the states retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern,even though interstate commerce may be affected.lewis bt investment,d.
to determine whether a state statute violates the dormant commerce clause,we conduct a analysis.distillers new york state liquor,d environmental technology council sierra club,cir.when a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce,or when its effect is to favor economic interests over interests,the statute is generally struck down without further inquiry,at.thus,for state statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce,we apply a virtually per se rule of invalidity.philadelphia new jersey,d see also wyoming oklahoma,d.when,however,a statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce but rather regulates evenhandedly and only indirectly affects interstate commerce,we conduct a fuller second a balancing test.see environmental technology council,see also,at.in conducting this analysis,we look to whether the state interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits,at.citing pike bruce church,d.
star scientific argues first that the qualifying statute is invalid per se because it directly regulates commerce occurring wholly outside of virginia boundaries.it maintains that a state violates the commerce clause if it attempts to regulate aspects of the stream of commerce that occur upstream,outside the state borders.it correctly notes that a state may not regulate commerce occurring wholly outside of its borders.see edgar mite,d noting that t he commerce clause precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the state borders,whether or not the commerce has effects within the state,at.healy beer,d.nor may a state pass laws that have the practical effect of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside the state borders.healy,at.this proposition is based on the common sense conclusion that a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting state authority,regardless of the state legislative intent.healy,at.star scientific maintains that virginia qualifying statute is analogous to the statutes held unconstitutional in and healy.
in,the supreme court struck down a provision of the new york alcoholic beverage control law that required liquor distillers to affirm that their prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold in any other state during the month.at.the court found that,while the law was addressed only to the sale of liquor in new york,the practical effect of the law was to control liquor prices in other states because o nce a distiller has posted prices in new york,it is not free to change its prices elsewhere in the united states during the relevant month.id.at.thus,the court found the law invalid because f orcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one state before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce.id.at.
in the same vein,the court in healy struck down the connecticut liquor control act which required beer shippers to affirm that the prices at which their products were sold to connecticut wholesalers were no higher than the prices at which those same products were sold in bordering states.at.the court held the statute unconstitutional because it had the practical effect of controlling liquor prices in other states and interfered with the regulatory schemes in those states.id.at.
virginia qualifying statute,however,rather than aiming at or reacting to commerce outside of virginia,specifically limits its applicability to the sale of cigarettes within the commonwealth.ann.a see also id.defining units sold as individual cigarettes sold in the commonwealth.thus,rather than regulate upstream transactions outside of the state,the virginia qualifying statute imposes a fee only for cigarettes actually sold within the state.it has no effect on transactions undertaken by distributors in other states.
to the extent that the statute may affect the prices charged by distributors,the effect is applicable only to prices charged on cigarettes sold within virginia.the statute does not insist on price parity with cigarettes sold outside of the state.the statute therefore does not have the practical effect of controlling prices or transactions occurring wholly outside of the boundaries of virginia,as was the case in and healy.thus,the rule of per se invalidity does not apply to the qualifying statute.
star scientific argues that in any event,virginia qualifying statute fails the balancing test applicable to state economic regulations that indirectly affect interstate commerce.it asserts that the burden that the qualifying statute places on interstate commerce clearly exceeds its local benefits.
the balancing test applicable to nondiscriminatory legislation affecting interstate commerce was set out in pike,at.
where the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
internal citation omitted.to apply this pike balancing test,we consider the nature of the local benefits advanced by the statute the burden placed on interstate commerce by the statute and whether the burden is clearly excessive when weighed against these local benefits.id.
as we discussed in parts ii and iii,above,virginia qualifying statute serves the legitimate state interest of ensuring that virginia has a source of recovery for future healthcare costs attributable to tobacco manufacturers who have not subscribed to the master settlement agreement and who,therefore,are not already compensating the commonwealth for these healthcare costs.thus,the putative local benefits are both legitimate and important.we also conclude that the burden of the state economic regulation on interstate commerce is minimal.
star scientific argues,however,that because the escrow payments are imposed on cigarettes sold not only by it,but also by its distributors,even when the distributors purchased the cigarettes outside of the state,star scientific is required to police interstate sales or channel those sales into contractual forms that may be more burdensome to commerce.star scientific is,however,overstating its burden.as virginia points out,distributors in virginia are already required to record the number of cigarettes they stamp with the virginia excise stamp and report that information to the commonwealth.see ann.et.because distributors already have to keep track of this information,any additional burden caused by requiring manufacturers to obtain this information from the distributors is minimal.
given the important state interest advanced by the qualifying statute and the minimal burden placed on interstate commerce by its operation,we conclude that the burden on interstate commerce is not clearly excessive when compared to the putative local benefits.see pike,at.thus,we agree with district court that the qualifying statute does not violate the commerce clause.
finally,star scientific challenges the master settlement agreement itself,contending that it violates the compact clause of article,of the constitution,which provides that no state shall,without the consent of congress,enter into any agreement or compact with another state.const.art.i,cl.star scientific asserts that the master settlement agreement is in fact an interstate compact and that,because it has not been approved by congress,the agreement,as well as the qualifying statutes enacted pursuant to it,are invalid.
