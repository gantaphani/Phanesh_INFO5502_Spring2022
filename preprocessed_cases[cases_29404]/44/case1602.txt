steven hatfill sued the new york times company the times and columnist nicholas kristof,alleging claims under virginia law for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.hatfill claims arise from the times publication of a series of kristof columns concerning the federal investigation into the mailing of letters laced with anthrax in the fall of.the district court dismissed hatfill complaint under.b,and hatfill now appeals.we conclude that hatfill has adequately pled the elements of his claims under virginia law,and we reverse the ruling of the district court.
in the fall of,shortly after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon,someone mailed letters laced with anthrax to several news organizations and members of congress at least five people died as a result of contact with these letters,and the federal government launched an investigation to identify and capture the responsible party or parties.by may,the federal bureau of investigation fbi had not made any arrests.
kristof writes a regular column for the editorial page of the times.during the spring and summer of,kristof wrote several columns criticizing the fbi investigation.from may through july,kristof focused his attention on the fbi handling of information related to a man he called according to kristof,circumstantial evidence pointed to z,who was widely suspected by other scientists of involvement in the anthrax mailings.in kristof opinion,the fbi had not moved aggressively enough against z.in august,kristof identified z as steven hatfill,a research scientist employed by the department of defense.
kristof columns expressed opinions about the progress of the fbi investigation based on factual assertions concerning hatfill.in a column published on may,kristof urged his readers to light a fire under the fbi in its investigation of the anthrax mailings since e xperts in the bioterror field are already buzzing about a handful of individuals who had the ability,access and motive to send the anthrax.according to kristof,these experts suspected one american who has worked for the united states military biodefense program and had access to the labs at fort detrick.his anthrax vaccinations are up to date,he unquestionably had the ability to make anthrax,and he was upset at the united states government in the period preceding the anthrax attack.according to kristof,the fbi had been painstakingly slow in its investigation of this person and unnamed others.
kristof repeated this theme in a column published on july,writing that the bureau lackadaisical ineptitude in pursuing the anthrax killer continues to threaten america national security by permitting him to strike again or,more likely,to flee to iran or north korea.as to the identity of this killer,kristof offered the following 
some in the biodefense community think they know a likely culprit,whom i call although the bureau has polygraphed z,searched his home twice and interviewed him four times,it has not placed him under surveillance or asked its outside handwriting expert to compare his writing to that on the anthrax letters.
people in the biodefense field first gave z name to the bureau as a suspect in october,and i wrote about him elliptically in a column on may.
he denies any wrongdoing,and his friends are heartsick at suspicions directed against a man they regard as a patriot.some of his polygraphs show evasion,i hear,although that may be because of his temperament.
if z were an arab national,he would have been imprisoned long ago.but he is a american with close ties to the defense department,the and the american biodefense program.on the other hand,he was once caught with a girlfriend in a biohazard hot suite at fort detrick,surrounded only by blushing germs.
kristof argued that the fbi handling of this information reflected a casual approach to the investigation.with many experts buzzing about z behind his back,it time for the to make a move either it should go after him more aggressively,sifting thoroughly through his past and picking up loose threads,or it should seek to exculpate him and remove this cloud of suspicion.
having called the fbi to account for the slow pace of its investigation,kristof put a series of rhetorical questions to the fbi concerning z particularly 
do you know how many identities and passports z has and are you monitoring his international travel i have found at least one alias for him,and he has continued to travel abroad on government assignments,even to central asia.
why was his top security clearance suspended in august,less than a month before the anthrax attacks began this move left him infuriated.are the and military intelligence agencies cooperating fully with the investigation 
have you searched the isolated residence that he had access to last fall the has known about this building,and knows that z gave cipro to people who visited it.this property and many others are legally registered in the name of a friend of z,but may be safe houses operated by american intelligence.
have you examined whether z has connections to the biggest anthrax outbreak among humans ever recorded,the one that sickened more than black farmers in zimbabwe in there is evidence that the anthrax was released by the white rhodesian army fighting against black guerillas,and z has claimed that he participated in the white army selous scouts.could rogue elements of the american military have backed the rhodesian army in anthrax and cholera attacks against blacks z resume also claims involvement in the former south african defense force all else aside,who knew that the defense department would pick an american who had served in the armed forces of two regimes to work in the american biodefense program with some of the world deadliest germs 
in his july,column,kristof suggested that z might have been involved in a previous attack against offices in april 
when someone expert in bio warfare mailed anthrax last fall,it may not have been the first time he had struck.
so while the has been unbelievably lethargic in its investigation so far,any year now it will the package that arrived on april,at the headquarters in washington.the package contained a petri dish mislabeled anthracks.the dish did not contain anthrax.but a navy lab determined that it was bacillus cereus,a very close,cousin of anthrax used by the defense department.
anybody able to obtain bacillus cereus knew how to spell anthrax.an echo of that deliberate misspelling came last fall when the anthrax letters suggested taking penacillin.
the choice of probably was meant to suggest arab terrorists,because the building had once been the target of an assault by muslim gunmen.in the same way,profilers are convinced that the real anthrax attacks last year were conducted by an american scientist trying to pin the blame on arabs.
in a column on july i wrote about z,an american bio defense insider who intrigues investigators and whose career has been spent in the shadowy world of counterterror and intelligence.he denies any involvement in the anthrax attacks.
on the date the perpetrator chose for the attack,a terrorism seminar was under way in the washington area and z seemed peeved that neither he nor any other bio defense expert had been included as a speaker.the next day,z sent a letter to the organizer saying that he was rather concerned at the omission and added as was evidenced in downtown washington a few hours later,this topic is vital to the security of the united states.i am tremendously interested in becoming more involved in this area 
over the next couple of years,z has used the attack to underscore the importance of his field and his own status within it.remember,he noted at one point.in examples he gave of how anthrax attacks might happen,he had a penchant for dropping arab names.
the must be on top of the episode,right well,it was told about it months ago.but says it has been asked about the incident by the 
kristof also suggested that z might have been involved with another set of anthrax hoaxes in february 
in contrast to the package with fake anthrax gelatin,the letters each contained a teaspoon of fake anthrax powder roughly the same amount as of real anthrax in.that interesting because as of,bio defense scientists were working basically only with wet anthrax,while by some had experimented with making powders.
for example,z apparently learned about powders during those two years.his resume adds something missing from the version working knowledge of wet and dry bw biological warfare agents,production of bacterial,rickettsial and viral bw pathogens and toxins.
the next week kristof wrote that z had been interviewed by the fbi four times and that his home had been searched twice during the course of the investigation.kristof noted that the army had hired z in to work with ebola and marburg viruses,even though he had previously worked with the armed forces of rhodesia and apartheid south africa.
finally,on august,kristof identified his z as steven hatfill 
it time for me to come clean on 
since may,i written periodically about a former army scientist who,authorities say privately,has become the overwhelming focus of the investigation into the anthrax attacks last fall.i did name him.
but over the weekend,z named himself.he is steven hatfill,a prominent germ warfare specialist who formerly worked in the army labs at fort detrick.hatfill made a televised statement on sunday,describing himself as a loyal american and attacking the authorities and the media for trying to smear me and gratuitously make a wasteland of my life.
the first thing to say is that the presumption of innocence has already been maimed since for foreign muslims,and it should not be similarly cheapened with respect to hatfill.it must be a genuine assumption that he is an innocent man caught in a nightmare.there is not a shred of traditional physical evidence linking him to the attacks.
still,hatfill is wrong to suggest that the has casually designated him the anthrax fall guy.the authorities interest in hatfill arises from a range of factors,including his expertise in dry biological warfare agents,his access to fort detrick labs where anthrax spores were kept although he did not work with anthrax there and the animus to some federal agencies that shows up in his private writings.he has also failed three polygraph examinations since january,and canceled plans for another polygraph exam two weeks ago.
so far,the only physical evidence is obscure smell.specially trained bloodhounds were given scent packets preserved from the anthrax letters and were introduced to a variety of people and locations.this month,they responded strongly to hatfill,to his apartment,to his girlfriend apartment and even to his former girlfriend apartment,as well as to restaurants that he had recently entered he is under constant surveillance.the dogs did not respond to other people,apartments or restaurants.
putting aside the question of hatfill and the anthrax,there are two larger issues.
first is the initial slowness in carrying out the anthrax investigation.why did it take nine months to call in the bloodhounds,or to read hatfill unpublished novel,emergence,which has been sitting in the copyright office since and draws on his experiences in south africa and antarctica to recount a biological warfare attack on congress 
second is the need for much greater care within the biodefense program.hatfill resume made claims a degree,work with the special forces,membership in britain royal society of medicine that appear false,but they were never checked.
moreover,what was a man like hatfill who had served in the armed forces of two white racist governments rhodesia and south africa doing in a army lab working with ebola 
to its credit,in the last few months,the bureau has finally picked up its pace.its experts in quantico are belatedly examining anthrax hoax letters sent in and that bear fascinating resemblances to the real anthrax letters.investigators are looking at another hoax letter with intriguing parallels to the real one that hoax letter was sent to senator tom daschle from london in,when hatfill was visiting a biodefense center in england.
partly because of the newfound energy,the has lately been enjoying genuine progress in its anthrax investigation.people very close to hatfill are now cooperating with the authorities,information has been presented to a grand jury,and there is reason to hope that the bureau may soon be able to end this unseemly limbo by either exculpating hatfill or arresting him.
as this column illustrates,kristof argument about the progress of the fbi investigation of the anthrax mailings had much to do with specific allegations concerning hatfill.
on june,hatfill filed suit against kristof and the times in virginia state court.the complaint in that case alleged that defendants false and reckless public identification of hatfill as the likely anthrax mailer imputed homicidal activity to hatfill and impugned his good name as a physician and bio medical researcher,and thereby constituted,separately,defamation,defamation per se,and defamation by false light.in addition,the complaint alleged that kristof intentional public denunciation of hatfill as the likely anthrax murderer regardless of whether hatfill was guilty or innocent constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress.hatfill sought at least million in compensatory damages,the same amount in punitive damages,and costs.hatfill never served this complaint on the defendants and instead took a voluntary nonsuit on march.
hatfill filed this lawsuit on july,asserting claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.count one alleges that defendants false and reckless public identification of hatfill with the anthrax mailings,both directly and by implication from the manner in which his personal and professional background were presented in the z columns,constituted a false factual allegation of terrorist and homicidal activity and impugned hatfill good name as a citizen,a physician and a bio medical researcher to a reasonable reader.count two alleges that each of eleven discrete factual statements in kristof columns constituted defamation per se that,in the mind of the reasonable reader,would tend to incriminate hatfill in the anthrax mailings.count three alleges that kristof suggestion that hatfill was responsible for the anthrax attacks of constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress.hatfill seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.
hatfill voluntarily dismissed kristof as a defendant in this case when it became clear that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.the district court later dismissed hatfill complaint against the times under rule b.according to the district court,count one failed as a matter of law because kristof columns,when read in their entirety and in context,could not reasonably be read as accusing hatfill of being responsible for the anthrax attacks.the columns merely reported on an ongoing investigation that targeted hatfill,and kristof was careful to disavow any conclusion of hatfill guilt.count two failed because the claims concerning discrete statements in kristof columns were not preserved in the complaint and thus are.even if they were timely,the district court ruled that none of these discrete factual allegations is sufficient to constitute defamation.finally,the district court dismissed count three of the complaint on the grounds that publication of commentary on a matter of public concern is not outrageous conduct and hatfill had failed to allege sufficiently severe emotional distress.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of hatfill complaint.a complaint should not be dismissed under rule b unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.we must accept as true all allegations and view the complaint in the light most favorable to hatfill.see papasan,at.
the district court stated that t his standard is to be applied with particular care in reviewing defamation claims.to the extent that the district court applied a stricter standard to hatfill complaint than the ordinary standards under rule b,that was error.a defamation complaint,like any other civil complaint in federal court,must provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a,sufficient to give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,conley,at.while the federal rules of civil procedure require more specific pleading in certain cases,defamation cases are not among them.see.b.thus,the usual standards of notice pleading apply in defamation cases such as this one.see swierkiewicz sorema,d rejecting the argument that a heightened pleading standard should apply in employment discrimination cases leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d rejecting the argument that a heightened pleading standard should apply in actions against municipalities we review the allegations of hatfill complaint to determine whether they state claims upon which relief may be granted under virginia law 
count one alleges that the times publication of kristof columns defamed hatfill by implying that hatfill was involved in the anthrax mailings.under virginia law,a plaintiff seeking to recover for defamation per se must allege a publication of false information concerning the plaintiff that tends to defame the plaintiff reputation.see chapin,cir citing the gazette,harris.the district court dismissed count one because t he columns are not reasonably capable of being understood to convey either an accusation that plaintiff is the anthrax mailer,or an intention by the author to make such an accusation.
the question whether a statement is capable of having a defamatory meaning is a question of law to be decided by the court.yeagle collegiate times.under virginia law,the following kinds of statements are actionable as defamation per se statements that impute to a person the commission of some criminal offense involving moral turpitude,for which the party,if the charge is true,may be indicted and punished,statements that impute that a person is infected with some contagious disease,where if the charge is true,it would exclude the party from society,statements that impute to a person unfitness to perform the duties of an office or employment of profit,or want of integrity in the discharge of duties of such an office or employment,and statements that prejudice such person in his or her profession or trade.carwile richmond newspapers.
it is not always clear whether particular words actually charge a person with a crime of moral turpitude or unfitness for employment or the like,but the general rule of interpretation is that allegedly defamatory words are to be taken in their plain and natural meaning and to be understood by courts and juries as other people would understand them,and according to the sense in which they appear to have been used.id.at.a defamatory charge may be made expressly or by inference,implication or insinuation.id.at.in short,it matters not how artful or disguised the modes in which the meaning is concealed if it is in fact defamatory.id.accordingly,we have stated that courts applying virginia defamation law should consider not only the words themselves but also the inferences fairly attributable to them.wells liddy,cir.
in determining whether the words and statements complained of are reasonably capable of the meaning ascribed to them by innuendo,every fair inference that may be drawn from the pleadings must be resolved in the plaintiff favor.carwile,at.even so,the meaning of the alleged defamatory language can not,by innuendo,be extended beyond its ordinary and common acceptation.the province of the innuendo is to show how the words used are defamatory,and how they relate to the plaintiff,but it can not introduce new matter,nor extend the meaning of the words used,or make that certain which is in fact uncertain.id.
hatfill contends that kristof columns defamed him by imputing to him the commission of crimes of moral turpitude,namely,the murders of five people who were exposed to the anthrax letters.if the columns fairly can be read to make such a charge,then they are defamatory per se.schnupp smith,holding that a charge of aiding and abetting in the possession of narcotics was defamatory per se great coastal express,ellington,holding that a charge of commercial bribery was defamatory per se.in determining whether or not the language does impute a criminal offense the words must be construed in the plain and popular sense in which the rest of the world would naturally understand them.schnupp,at internal quotations omitted.thus,while kristof columns need not make the charge in express terms,they must naturally and presumably be understood by those who read them as charging a crime.id.internal quotations omitted.
the plaintiff in carwile was an attorney who made charges of graft in the richmond,virginia police department.at.after the grand jury declined to return an indictment,the defendant newspaper reported that two city officials declined to comment on whether they were considering a recommendation to the virginia state bar that carwile be disciplined for making the accusation.id.the newspaper then reported that u nder the state code,the state bar as an administrative agency of the supreme court of appeals may request a court of competent jurisdiction to disbar an attorney for violation of the ethical code governing the professional conduct of attorneys.carwile,at.the newspaper did not argue explicitly that the state bar should take action,only that it was authorized by law to do so.the supreme court of virginia ruled that 
it is a reasonable implication of this language,read in connection with the whole article,that the plaintiff is guilty of unethical and unprofessional conduct for his charges made against the police department for which conduct the defendant suggests in a veiled but pointed way that the plaintiff could and should be subjected to disbarment proceedings while the defamatory language does not in express terms charge the plaintiff with a breach of his professional honor,yet,when aided by the innuendo,operating within the scope of its legitimate functions,it does impute conduct tending to injure him in his profession.
the plaintiff in schnupp alleged defamation arising from a police officer statements to the plaintiff employer suggesting that the plaintiff had committed a crime punishable by imprisonment.at.during a surveillance in a area,the officer had observed what he believed were narcotics transactions occurring near a company van driven by the plaintiff.id.at.the officer later contacted the plaintiff employer and reported what he had seen.specifically,the officer told the employer that he had seen the plaintiff driving a van to a particular location,that his passenger got out of the van,and that his passenger then made some type of exchange.id.at.the officer argued that his statements merely described his observation that the plaintiff was present in the van and did not suggest that the plaintiff had actually bought or sold drugs.since mere presence at the scene of a crime is not itself a crime of moral turpitude,his statements could not be defamatory.id.rejecting this argument,the supreme court of virginia held that the officer statement to the employer,unaided by innuendo but assisted by the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the words used,while not charging a criminal offense in express terms,did impute to the plaintiff the commission of the offense of aiding and abetting in the possession of narcotics.schnupp,at.
we applied this virginia law in wells,where a former secretary at the democratic national committee sued radio personality and watergate conspirator gordon liddy,alleging that he had defamed her by telling public audiences that she helped procure prostitutes for visitors to party headquarters in washington.at.during one speech,liddy stated that the surveillance camera positioned at the nearby howard johnson motel 
looked directly down at a desk of a secretary named maxine wells,and her telephone.they had a telescopic lens camera pointed at that.and that is where the wiretap was subsequently found by the d emocrats on that phone some members of the dnc were using the call girl ring as an asset to entertain visiting firemen.and to that end that they had a manila envelope that you could open or close by wrapping a string around a wafer.and in that envelope were twelve photographs of an assortment of these girls and then one group photograph of them.and what you see is what you get.it was kept in that desk of ida maxine wells.thus,the camera and all the rest of it.and what they were doing is as these people would be looking at the brochure,if you want to call it that,and making the telephone call to arrange the assignation,that was being wiretapped,recorded and photographed.
id.at.we concluded that these words were capable of defamatory meaning,namely,that wells was a participant in a scheme to procure prostitutes.id.liddy had not explicitly accused wells of complicity in the alleged operation,but he implied as much by asserting that the manila envelope was kept in her desk.
considered in light of carwile,schnupp,and wells,hatfill complaint adequately alleges that kristof columns,taken together,are capable of defamatory meaning.the columns did not describe any other actual or potential target of investigation,and they recounted detailed information pertaining to hatfill alone.once kristof named hatfill as z and perhaps even before that time,a reasonable reader of his columns could believe that hatfill had the motive,means,and opportunity to prepare and send the anthrax letters in the fall of that he had particular expertise with powder forms of anthrax,the type used in the mailings that his own anthrax vaccinations were current that he was the prime suspect of the biodefense community as well as federal investigators that he had failed numerous polygraph examinations that specially trained bloodhounds had responded strongly to hatfill,his apartment,and his girlfriend apartment but not to anyone else or any other location and that hatfill was probably involved in similar anthrax episodes in recent years.based on these assertions,a reasonable reader of kristof columns likely would conclude that hatfill was responsible for the anthrax mailings in 
notwithstanding kristof attribution of certain allegations to unnamed sources,or his caution that readers should entertain a presumption of hatfill innocence,or even his statement that the fbi should end this unseemly limbo by either exculpating hatfill or arresting him,the unmistakable theme of kristof columns is that the fbi should investigate hatfill more vigorously because all the evidence known to kristof pointed to him.just as a defendant can not escape liability for making a false assertion of fact by prefacing that assertion with the words in my opinion,milkovich lorain journal,d neither can it escape liability simply by pairing a charge of wrongdoing with a statement that the subject must,of course,be presumed innocent,see carwile,at stating that it matters not how artful or disguised the modes in which the meaning is concealed it if is in fact defamatory.
for purposes of rule b,the question is simply whether kristof columns are capable of defamatory meaning under virginia law,whether they imputed to hatfill the commission of a crime involving moral turpitude.they did,and much more forcefully than the statements at issue in carwile and wells.because kristof columns,taken together,are capable of defamatory meaning under virginia law,the district court erred in dismissing count one 
count two alleges that each of eleven discrete factual assertions contained in kristof columns separately defamed hatfill by incriminating him in the anthrax mailings.the district court dismissed this count on the grounds that the statute of limitations barred any claims other than the claim asserted in count one and none of the eleven statements is independently capable of defamatory meaning.
hatfill defamation claims are subject to a statute of limitations.see ann.hatfill claims accrued when kristof columns were may and august.see jordan shands.thus,hatfill had until august at the latest to assert his defamation claims.yet he did not file this complaint until july.
under virginia law,however,a plaintiff who voluntarily withdraws a action and recommences it in federal court within six months may toll the statute of limitations as of the date he filed the initial action.ann.e hatfill filed a lawsuit in state court on june,took a nonsuit on march,and commenced this action in federal court on july.thus,the statute of limitations was tolled as of june.
the district court ruled,however,that this tolling provision saved only the claim relating to the overall implication of kristof columns and not the claim relating to discrete false statements.according to the district court,since the initial complaint asserted only a single cause of action for defamation alleging that d efendants false and reckless public identification of hatfill as the likely anthrax mailer imputed homicidal activity to hatfill and impugned his good name,only that claim was saved by the tolling provision.
section e,the tolling provision at issue here,applies when the plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in.section authorizes a plaintiff to take a nonsuit on any cause of action,and the virginia supreme court defines a cause of action as a set of operative facts which,under the substantive law,may give rise to one or more rights of action,roller basic constr,
when hatfill took a voluntary nonsuit in his original action,he did so with respect to the set of operative facts underlying his complaint,namely,the defendants publication of kristof columns.when he filed this lawsuit in federal court,the tolling provision saved all rights of action arising from that cause of action,including the right of action alleged in count two.see odeneal thompson,wl,at.cir.thus,the district court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations barred count two of hatfill complaint.
the district court further erred in ruling that none of the eleven statements identified by hatfill is independently capable of defamatory meaning.broadly grouped,hatfill complains about five sets of factual assertions in kristof columns.first,hatfill complains about kristof assertion that he had the ability,access,and motive to make and send the anthrax.second,hatfill complains about kristof statement that he had access to an isolated residence where he gave cipro to visitors.third,hatfill complains about the allegation that he had anthrax vaccinations himself.fourth,hatfill complains about kristof charge that he failed three polygraph examinations in.finally,hatfill complains about the allegation that he was once caught with a girlfriend in a biohazard hot suite at fort detrick surrounded only by blushing germs.
taken in the context of the columns in which they appear,and considered in light of carwile,schnupp,and wells,all of these statements but one are capable of incriminating hatfill in the anthrax mailings.with the exception of the final hatfill had been caught with a girlfriend in a biohazard hot suite at fort statements link hatfill to anthrax generally and the investigation specifically and give rise to an inference that he was involved in the anthrax mailings.by contrast,the statement describing hatfill activities with his girlfriend does not connect hatfill to anthrax in any way.although this statement might be capable of some other defamatory meaning,it does not incriminate hatfill in the anthrax mailings and so is not actionable under this complaint.
count three alleges that the publication of kristof columns constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court dismissed this count on two grounds first,that publication of defamatory charges is not sufficiently outrageous conduct,and second,that hatfill failed to allege severe emotional distress.
a plaintiff seeking to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress under virginia law must allege that the defendant conduct was intentional and reckless the conduct was outrageous and intolerable the conduct caused the plaintiff emotional distress and the plaintiff distress was severe.russo white,womack eldridge.hatfill
