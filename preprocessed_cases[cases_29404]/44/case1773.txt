appellant ralph hinojosa appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city of san antonio on his excessive force and deliberate indifference claims.he also appeals the district court judgment in favor of san antonio police officer israel butler on the same claims.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city,but reverse and remand for a new trial on the issue of officer butler liability for excessive force.
background 
on september,at about,officer israel butler of the san antonio police department sapd executed a traffic stop of appellant ralph hinojosa.hinojosa failed to stop immediately.rather,having consumed at least four beers,and aware of an outstanding warrant for his arrest,hinojosa continued driving,albeit never exceeding the speed limit.after driving several blocks,hinojosa pulled over.the parties accounts of subsequent events diverge.
according to hinojosa,as he sat waiting for butler to approach his vehicle,he heard a sudden whack against the window frame of his driver side door.allegedly fearing for his safety,hinojosa kicked his door open,sending it towards butler,and attempted to flee.butler pursued hinojosa all the while striking him in the leg,back,head,and groin with his baton.butler eventually subdued hinojosa,who suffered numerous welts and bruises,as well as a broken finger.
the specific manner in which hinojosa sustained the broken finger received much attention at trial.hinojosa claims that he was simply shielding himself from butler baton blows when butler struck his hand.butler insists that he struck hinojosa hands because he observed in them an unidentifiable object,later determined to be a small flashlight attached to hinojosa key chain.butler concedes that hinojosa never attempted to strike him,but nevertheless insists that hinojosa was constantly trying to push him away.
butler arrested hinojosa and transported him to the san antonio detention center,where he was eventually charged with evading arrest.butler ended contact with hinojosa when he left him with detention center intake personnel.at trial,hinojosa admitted he never complained of his injuries to butler,but insists this was because he did not want to anger butler,not because his injuries were trivial.hinojosa also admitted that he did not complain of his injuries to detention center personnel or the magistrate judge before whom he was brought shortly after his arrest.after four hours in the detention center,hinojosa finally asked for medical attention.
hinojosa was next transported to the bexar county jail,where he was medically rejected due to his injuries.county jail personnel notified the sapd that they would not accept custody of hinojosa until he received medical treatment.hinojosa next sat in the county jail for about four hours waiting for an sapd officer to return and transport him to the hospital during this time hinojosa received no medical care.upon returning to the county jail to retrieve hinojosa,sapd officers transported him immediately to the hospital.there,he was treated for a broken finger as well as various cuts and bruises.
on march,hinojosa filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of texas against the city and against butler in his official and individual capacities.hinojosa invoked and claimed that butler,under the color of state law,violated his eighth amendment rights by subjecting him to excessive force and demonstrating deliberate indifference toward his serious medical needs.he also claimed municipal liability on the part of the city,alleging that butler conduct was in furtherance of an sapd custom or policy.the district court eventually granted the city motion for summary judgment as to both of hinojosa claims,concluding that he failed to raise a genuine fact issue regarding whether his injuries resulted from a municipal policy.thus,only hinojosa claims against butler in his official and individual capacities proceeded to trial.
butler resigned from the sapd in.during his five years on the force,butler was the subject of numerous sapd internal affairs investigations.these investigations concerned,for example,allegations that butler sexually assaulted a woman,and that he issued a speeding citation to a motorist who did not exceed the posted speed limit.other investigations concerned automobile collisions in which butler was involved,as well as timekeeping issues.four incidents in particular are central to this appeal,and are hereafter referred to collectively as butler prior conduct.in the first incident,butler submitted a report in which he claimed he was by another vehicle while making a traffic stop.the city subsequently found no evidence to corroborate butler claim.in the second incident,butler executed a traffic stop of a city employee for whom an arrest warrant was at the time outstanding.butler offered to issue a speeding citation to the driver wife,the passenger,in order to avoid having to arrest the city employee pursuant to the warrant.the third incident involved butler firing two rounds from his service weapon after,according to butler,he observed an individual aiming a rifle at him.butler later admitted to fabricating this story in order to justify firing his weapon.the fourth incident was butler resignation from the sapd shortly after the first three incidents.
butler moved pretrial to exclude evidence related to his prior conduct.the district court ruled that such evidence was inadmissible under federal rule of evidence b because it was only relevant to show butler character as a n officer who lies and files false reports to absolve himself of blame,and because the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to butler.notwithstanding the rule b ruling,the district court ruled that hinojosa could butler regarding his prior conduct pursuant to rule b that rule provides in relevant part 
specific instances of the conduct of a witness,for the purpose of attacking the witness character for truthfulness may in the discretion of the court,if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness,be inquired into on of the witness concerning the witness character for truthfulness or untruthfulness 
the district court ruled that butler prior conduct related to his problem with making things up,and therefore was a proper subject of under rule b.at the time the district court rendered its ruling,it was aware that butler planned to invoke his fifth amendment right against in response to questions about his prior conduct.that same day,however,the court ruled that although hinojosa could question butler on his prior conduct,he was required to do so outside the presence of the jury due to butler planned invocation of his fifth amendment rights.outside the presence of the jury,hinojosa asked butler specific questions concerning his prior conduct,such as whether he was honest in claiming that someone pointed a gun at him in justifying firing his weapon,whether he issued a citation to the wrong individual in order to avoid issuing a citation to a city employee,and whether the investigations into these incidents played any role in his decision to resign from the sapd.in response to each of these questions,butler invoked his fifth amendment right against.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of butler on both of hinojosa claims.hinojosa appealed,arguing that the district court reversibly erred in refusing to allow him,under rule b,to butler before the jury regarding his prior conduct,and in granting the city summary judgment on the issue of municipal liability.
ii.discussion 
evidentiary issues 
hinojosa first argues that the district court erred in preventing him from butler about his prior conduct in front of the jury.specifically,hinojosa argues that,under our precedent,a district court abuses its discretion when it excludes from evidence a witness fifth amendment invocation on the sole basis that the jury might draw adverse inferences from his silence 
when a defendant at trial invokes the fifth amendment and chooses not to testify,there is a risk that the jury will assign culpability to him by assuming merely from his silence that he has something to hide.see carter kentucky,d u nless instructed otherwise,a jury may well draw adverse inferences from a defendant silence.in a criminal trial,a defendant must pay no price for the exercise of his constitutional privilege not to testify.id.thus,a jury in a criminal case may not draw adverse inferences against a defendant merely because of his choice to remain silent.
nevertheless,while a person may refuse to testify during civil proceedings on the ground that his testimony might incriminate him his refusal to testify may be used against him in a civil proceeding.farace indep.fire ins,cir.thus,although a jury in a criminal case is not permitted to draw adverse inferences based on a defendant invocation of his fifth amendment rights,it is that the fifth amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.baxter palmigiano,d 
in general,the decision as to whether to admit a person invocation of the fifth amendment into evidence is committed to the discretion of the district court.fdic fid.deposit,cir.a trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.united states yanez sosa,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.here,the court did not give any valid reason for its decision to require hinojosa questioning,and butler invocation of the fifth amendment,to take place outside the jury presence.rather,the court appeared to conflate the standard governing a defendant invocation in the criminal context with the standard applicable in the civil context,and assumed that butler planned invocation ipso facto foreclosed before the jury on his prior conduct it therefore appears that the district court ruling was based on an erroneous view of the law,and was therefore an abuse of discretion.
this does not necessarily mean,however,that reversal is warranted.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,no error in admitting or excluding evidence is ground for granting a new trial if the error does not affect any party substantial rights.thus,w e will reverse for an error in an evidentiary ruling only where the ruling has harmed the complaining party.farace,at.as the following discussion demonstrates,although our precedent on this issue is limited,it nevertheless compels us to remand this case for a new trial.
our precedent 
three of our prior decisions guide the analysis that follows farace independent fire insurance,cir,harrell dcs equipment leasing,cir,and curtis petroleum,cir.
in farace,the plaintiff house burned down,and he initially invoked the fifth amendment when asked to cooperate with investigators.farace,at.farace submitted a claim to the defendant,independent fire insurance company,which refused to pay on the claim due to its belief that farace intentionally set fire to his own home in order to reap the insurance proceeds and satisfy his extreme debt.id.at.farace filed suit against independent fire seeking payment of his claim under the policy.id.at trial,independent fire sought to farace on his initial unwillingness to answer the questions of the fire investigators.id.at.independent fire conceded that farace refusal to cooperate was short lived,as his full cooperation was eventually forthcoming.id.at.the district court refused to admit farace invocation,concluding that such evidence was unduly prejudicial.id.at.
in reviewing the district court ruling,this court began with a recitation of the rule that a jury may in a civil case draw adverse inferences based on a party invocation of the fifth amendment.we nevertheless declined to answer the question of whether the district court abused its discretion because,even if it had,the erroneous ruling did not harm independent fire.id.at.our bases for this conclusion were several.first,we concluded that farace invocation was of little probative value as to his character for truthfulness because he,as independent fire conceded,quickly agreed to fully cooperate with fire investigators following his initial reluctance to do so.id.we also concluded that the defendant had ample opportunity to impeach its witness by other means,by,for example,introducing evidence that farace had prior experience with the criminal authorities,had previously pleaded nolo contendere to stealing several cases of beer,and that farace was in severe financial trouble at the time of the fire.id.
in harrell,a defendant invoked the fifth amendment when the plaintiffs attempted to depose him.harrell,at.the magistrate judge ruled that the defendant invocation was improper and granted the plaintiffs motion to compel,thereby requiring the defendant to answer all of the plaintiffs questions upon redeposition,which he did.id.the plaintiffs at trial attempted to admit into evidence the defendant initial invocation.id.the trial court ruled that the probative value of that evidence was outweighed under rule by the risk of unfair prejudice.id.we affirmed,reasoning that the defendant initial invocation was of little probative value largely because of the fact that he had subsequently answered all of the plaintiffs questions.id.at.without discussion,we also noted our agreement with the district court that the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant was impermissibly high.id.
the common denominator between farace and harrell was our willingness to affirm each district court exclusion of a witness invocation where the witness behavior subsequent to the invocation greatly decreased the invocation probative value.indeed,in curtis we distinguished farace and harrell on this basis.there,an individual representing the corporate defendant refused to answer various questions during a deposition for fear of.curtis,at.the district court excluded from the trial the corporate representative invocation in his individual capacity,concluding that its admission would be unduly prejudicial to the defendant corporation and of limited probative value.id.we reversed.we first explained that corporate entities may not assert a fifth amendment privilege,and therefore to sustain the district court ruling would be to allow the corporate defendant to reap the benefit of its corporate representative invocation of the fifth amendment in his individual capacity.id.at.we next emphasized the fact that,unlike in farace and harrell,the defendant never cooperated with the plaintiff.it followed that the probative value of the representative invocation was high enough that the district court exclusion of it amounted to an abuse of discretion.see id.at in contrast,in the present case,barrett never cooperated with plaintiffs.plaintiffs did not request another deposition,nor did barrett appear at trial.the district court therefore abused its discretion in excluding the evidence of barrett invocation.
application 
hinojosa provides no reason for us to conclude that butler invocation might have compelled a different verdict with regard to his deliberate indifference claim.because the probative value of butler invocation is thus weak in this regard,we can not conclude that the district court ruling unfairly weakened hinojosa deliberate indifference claim.
a review of the record,however,makes plain that the fate of hinojosa excessive force claim turned on credibility whether the jury believed that butler used excessive force against hinojosa turned on the extent to which butler characterization of hinojosa behavior,and the threat he posed,was credible.to prove that the force applied by butler was gratuitous,hinojosa sought to offer evidence that butler had a habit of dishonesty in doing his job,or in justifying certain acts committed while on the job,and therefore that his characterization of events on the night in question deserved little credence.given that there were no witnesses to the arrest,credibility was paramount at trial.butler refusal to discuss,for risk of his admitted dishonesty in explaining why he had fired his service weapon his alleged violation of internal rules in order to protect a city employee his alleged dishones
