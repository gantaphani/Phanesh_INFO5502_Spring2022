appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico dismissing as their action.that action was a refiling of their prior identical action that had been involuntarily dismissed without prejudice as a sanction for plaintiffs repeated failure to abide by the court orders to proceed with various types of discovery.plaintiffs insist that the dismissal of their action triggered the of puerto rico statute of limitations,allowing them up to a year to refile the present action.the district court held otherwise,ruling that as the dismissal was for plaintiffs disobedience of the court orders to proceed,puerto rico usual restart tolling rule would inappropriately reward them and should not be applied.we affirm the district court,ruling that even if,under puerto rico law,puerto rico restart tolling principle was applicable,its use in this situation would violate federal policy underlying.
background 
on january,plaintiffs,terminated public employees,filed an action against the municipality of comerío,its mayor,and several municipal officials in the federal district court in puerto rico,raising claims pursuant to.see,civ.jp.the complaint alleged that the individual plaintiffs were discharged in violation of the united states constitution for politically discriminatory reasons at various times from january,to june.during the litigation,notwithstanding numerous extensions,the plaintiffs repeatedly failed to comply with the court discovery and related orders,providing the court with no explanation for their refusal to obey its orders.among other things,plaintiffs failed to explain the legal theory of each plaintiff case,which the judge stated should have been filed with the complaint.as a result of plaintiffs misconduct,defendants lacked the information necessary to file a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.
on january,in response to defendants motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice.at the end of its order,the court stated that it was dismissing as a sanction for plaintiffs repeated failure to abide by its orders 
the court must make it clear that it is not a parking lot for stagnant cases it is evident that with their,plaintiffs have not only hindered defendants handling of this case,but also hindered the court carefully laid timetable for this case.the court must mention that it currently has some cases of this nature on its docket,with a total of almost plaintiffs.it can not be delaying its crowded docket and timetable with something as basic as a legal theory and answers to interrogatories without a suitable explanation.
the court agrees with defendants,and for plaintiffs repeated failure to abide by this court orders,hereby grants defendants motion to dismiss,and dismisses this case,without prejudice.
the plaintiffs did not appeal from or otherwise contest the court grounds or its order.
on december,nearly one year later and approaching three years from the alleged political firings,plaintiffs filed the instant action which,the parties agree,is identical to the previous one no explanation of the theory of each plaintiff case was provided.defendants responded by moving to dismiss the new action as,citing the applicable statute of limitations,article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.in opposition,plaintiffs denied that the new action was.they contended,instead,that the bringing of the original action had tolled the running of the statute of limitations,and that under puerto rico tolling rules the subsequent dismissal of that action without prejudice caused the statute to run anew from the date of dismissal,providing plaintiffs with an additional year within which to refile their complaint.as plaintiffs brought the present action within eleven months following the dismissal,they insisted that it was timely filed.
the district judge,who was not the same judge who had dismissed the previous action,rejected plaintiffs tolling argument.he noted that the previous action had been dismissed for plaintiffs repeated failure to abide by the court orders.see.the judge concluded that to permit plaintiffs to benefit from their own misconduct by awarding them a new term to toll the statute of limitations and thus grant them the unwarranted option of their dismissed suit would be tantamount to stripping the district court of its sanctioning power over litigants who choose to blatantly disregard court orders and manipulate court proceedings for their own benefit.id.at.allowing the new term would also unfairly prejudice the defendants who had diligently defended the original suit.id.the district court,therefore,dismissed the current action,concluding that the involuntary dismissal of plaintiffs previous action,albeit without prejudice did not toll the applicable statute of limitations and the instant action,filed eleven months later,must be dismissed as.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court order granting a rule b motion based on statute of limitations grounds,pan am.grain,cir.
a section action borrows the forum state statute of limitations for personal injury claims.see wilson garcia,d,cir.here,as the parties agree,the applicable statute is puerto rico limitations for tort actions,article of the civil code,laws ann,at see infra note.federal law determines the date of accrual,cir.under federal law,the limitations period began to run when each employee received his or her notice of the termination decision.see chardon fernandez,d.the complaint indicates that the plaintiffs received knowledge of the challenged personnel actions at least by sometime during the period from january,to june,putting aside any issue of tolling,therefore,the plaintiffs were required to file their federal complaints within a year from the dates on which each received notice of termination.
plaintiffs did,in fact,file the original action shortly before expiration of the period.the first issue is whether,under puerto rican law,the involuntary dismissal of the original action,a dismissal stated to be without prejudice but expressly imposed as a sanction for with court orders,tolled the statute of limitations so as to cause it to run anew for one year from january,the date of dismissal,making timely plaintiffs december,filing of the current action.
federal law under borrows a state coordinate rules on tolling unless they are inconsistent with the federal constitution and law,or with the federal policy underlying.board of regents tomanio,d municipality of caguas,cir fernandez chardon,cir under puerto rico tolling rules,which are based on the spanish civil law,the institution of an action in court is commonly held not only to interrupt the running of the applicable statute of limitations but,at least in the event of a voluntary or usual dismissal of the original action,to cause the entire limitations period to run anew from the date the previous action came to a definite end.weber dental,cir reporting supreme court of puerto rico reply to certified question see also rodriguez narvaez nazario,cir collecting cases wiscovich weber dental,offic.trans.
here,the original complaint was timely filed on january,leaving approximately three days to about five months depending on the date of accrual for each individual plaintiff before the statute would have expired.thereafter,the action was involuntarily dismissed by the court without prejudice explicitly as a sanction for plaintiffs repeated failure to abide by the court orders.the instant action was filed eleven months after the dismissal of the original action.thus,unless,as plaintiffs contend,the entire limitations period was renewed by the dismissal order,the instant action is.
in contending that under puerto rico law the bringing of their original complaint followed by its dismissal without prejudice renewed the prescriptive period as of the dismissal date,plaintiffs rely upon puerto rico restart tolling principle already mentioned.defendants reply that in none of the cited puerto rico cases invoking that principle was the initial action dismissed as a disciplinary measure to sanction plaintiffs failure to proceed in conformity with the court orders.for example,moa commonwealth,wl,cited by plaintiffs,involved merely an amendment to the complaint to clarify that the minor plaintiff father was seeking damages for his own pain and suffering made on the first day of trial.defendants there argued that the amendment was,but the court found that the initial complaint tolled the statute of limitations.id.at.in feliciano aqueduct sewer,also cited by plaintiffs,the court merely held that the filing of a complaint for damages tolled the statute of limitations,even though the complaint was not served within the prescriptive period.id.at.
other cases emphasized by plaintiffs similarly do not specifically relate to involuntary dismissals imposed as sanctions see garcía aponte commonwealth of.tolling produced by voluntary dismissal durán cepeda morales lebrón,offic.trans,tolling in the context of previous dismissals for lack of jurisdiction and venue barrientos of the capital,initial complaint tolled statute of limitations such that a later amendment of the complaint to join an indispensable party was timely.
the issue before us,therefore,is whether in the present circumstances,where a dismissal without prejudice was imposed specifically as a sanction for repeated disobedience of the court orders,puerto rico would apply the same tolling rule applied in more conventional cases.puerto rico tolling rules are products of the civil law.no puerto rican or other civil law precedent or commentary has been called to our attention dealing with this precise situation.we can not,without such guidance,confidently predict how the puerto rico courts would resolve this case.see wiscovich,offic.trans.at durán cepeda,offic.trans.at.
there is,however,a relevant aspect of contemporary puerto rico law that should be noted.rule of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure,like.b,governs involuntary dismissals imposed as sanctions for failure to comply with court orders.both the federal rule,which governs here,and puerto rico similar rule,not only authorize courts to dismiss an action for a plaintiff failure to comply with court orders but also provide that dismissals for with court orders will operate as an adjudication upon the merits unless the court otherwise specifies thus,had the district court dismissed the first action without labeling the dismissal as being without prejudice,the action would have been automatically terminated as an adjudication upon the merits.
here,the court otherwise specified by declaring the dismissal to be without prejudice.a dismissal without prejudice,as opposed to an adjudication upon the merits,is dismissal without barring the plaintiff from returning later,to the same court,with the same underlying claim.semtek int l lockheed martin,d.thus,the district judge,by dismissing without prejudice,permitted plaintiffs to continue with their lawsuit.defendants argue that this is all very without prejudice language avoided res judicata and allowed the litigation to continue.but,say defendants,this in no way necessarily indicates that the full statute of limitations should be allowed to rerun,given the fact that the dismissal was explicitly for repeated failure to abide by the court misconduct that enabled plaintiffs to stop the case dead in its tracks in spite of defendants diligence.allowing plaintiffs another full year to delay in such circumstances would simply reward and exacerbate rather than counteract their earlier,abusive.
in analogous circumstances,our court has held that an involuntary dismissal made without prejudice but as a sanction does not toll the statute of limitations under common law and equitable principles.see roche,cir dismissal without prejudice for failure to prosecute did not toll filing period for action under the americans with disabilities act hilton int l union de trabajadores de la industria gastronomica de,cir dismissal of action under the labor management relations act without prejudice as a sanction for employer failure to comply with discovery order did not toll the statute of limitations.
we can not say for sure whether similar considerations would lead a puerto rico court to make an exception in this case to its civil law restart tolling principle.neither the district court nor the parties have pointed to a specific,material exception in the civil law.however,in durán cepeda morales lebrón,chief justice josé trias monge mentions a footnote to a civil law commentary f or cases where the tolling rule is abused or used in bad faith.offic.trans.at.this follows a declination to discuss,as immaterial to that case,possible exceptions to the general restart rule.id.at.thus,it seems there are exceptions in the civil law to the restart rule,and that abuse or bad faith conduct would be a basis for an exception.see see also feliciano,at noting that the tolling rule does not constitute a license to delay unjustifiedly the determination of liability of a debtor inasmuch as rule of the rules of civil procedure provide s for the dismissal of the action for failure to prosecute with diligence.
here,the plaintiffs abused the court processes.they repeatedly failed to abide by the court orders and so allow the case to move forward.by their misconduct,as the court found,plaintiffs hindered defendants handling of this case and the court carefully laid timetable for this case.in such circumstances,when allowed to refile their case after dismissal,plaintiffs were under an implicit obligation to refile promptly rather than to continue for another year the very delay that had caused the court to dismiss.plaintiffs,however,waited out almost another full to file an identical,unamplified complaint,which the first judge had already said was deficient.
as noted,puerto rico rule c,like.b,expressly authorizes dismissal of a case for violation of court orders.see supra note.no less than the federal courts,puerto rico accepts the familiar proposition that disobedience of court orders,in and of itself,constitutes extreme misconduct and,thus,warrants dismissal.tower ventures,city of westfield,cir.it would seem odd,therefore,if puerto rico law were interpreted in the present circumstances to give plaintiffs,whose previous case was dismissed for failure to move forward in compliance with court orders,another full year to do nothing before bringing a repeat action.for plaintiffs to sit on their hands for nearly a full year before refiling,as they did here,might in such circumstances,regardless of the restart rule,be regarded by a puerto rico it was wrongful conduct unfairly prejudicing the defendants.see durán cepeda,offic.trans.at.
to be sure,in dismissing without prejudice,the district judge may be presumed to have meant to allow plaintiffs to refile their claim within whatever time,if any,lay within the applicable statute of limitations but it does not follow that he meant to reward them by resetting the game clock back to zero at the very moment of the disciplinary dismissal.that doing so would be wrong was the view of the second puerto rico district judge,and this,upon consideration,is our own view of puerto rico law in these very special circumstances,although,given the civil law basis of puerto rico tolling rule,we can not say for sure.
whatever the correct reading of puerto rico law,however,the egregious conduct exhibited in this case warrants our holding that federal policies underlying require that we apply in this federal case something less than puerto rico restart tolling principle.see tomanio,at.federal law under borrows state tolling rule unless it is inconsistent with federal policy underlying the cause of action.
in chardón fumero soto,d,the supreme court affirmed fernández chardón,cir,in which we held that puerto rico restart tolling rule applies in a action after denial of class certification.the supreme court noted approvingly this court conclusion in fernández that application of puerto rico restart rule in a class action where class certification is denied for lack of numerosity would not violate any federal policy.chardón,at.the supreme court specifically pointed out our reasoning there that our conclusion was consistent with the policies
