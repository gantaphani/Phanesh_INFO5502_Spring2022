brown and his parents for convenience,brown brought a negligence action against boston edison,a utility company,and the united states brown claimed that both parties were liable for his injuries because both allowed a dangerous utility pole location on the of the exist off the edge of hartwell road.
the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motions,concluding that neither the united states nor boston edison owed a duty of care to brown.the court determined that the united states owed no duty to brown because the town of bedford,and not the united states,owned or controlled hartwell road.as a result,the court concluded that the united states was not responsible for maintaining the road and its appurtenances in a safe condition.as for boston edison,the court concluded that it owed no duty to brown because brown accident was not reasonably foreseeable.brown appeals the district court rulings we affirm.
we provide most of the facts here,reserving some for our discussion of the appellate claims.because we are reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants,we present these facts in the light most favorable to brown.see rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir.
in,the town of bedford granted boston edison the right to install a pole line along hartwell road.among the poles installed was pole pole or pole the pole at issue.boston edison placed pole thirteen inches off of a curved portion of hartwell road.as the years passed,boston edison replaced pole,which was made of wood,on a periodic basis.specifically,boston edison replaced the pole in,and.so far as is known,however,the position of the pole never changed.in approximately,an unknown third party placed a guardrail along hartwell road.standing between the road and the guardrail was pole.
the accident 
at the time of the accident brown was an air force lieutenant stationed at hanscom air force base.the base is located on land bordering hartwell road that is owned by the united states.the accident occurred as brown was traveling to hanscom on his motorcycle via hartwell road.brown,proceeding at a speed of approximately miles per hour,hit a depression in the road,which caused him to lose control of his motorcycle.leaping from the motorcycle,brown chose the guardrail as an aim point for his body.the guardrail,however,channeled brown headfirst into pole.although there was no evidence that the pole had ever been struck prior to brown accident,bedford town police logs revealed that,in the eight years preceding brown accident,accidents had occurred in the vicinity of the pole.
ii.discussion 
we review a court grant of summary judgment de novo.bogan city of boston,cir.in this case,massachusetts law applies to both of brown claims.see magarian hawkins,cir soto united states,cir.
to prevail in a negligence action under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care the defendant breached this duty damage to the plaintiff resulted and the breach of the duty caused this damage.jupin kask.typically,whether a plaintiff has satisfied the last three elements is for a jury to decide.id.whether the defendant owes any duty in the first place,however,is a question of law and,therefore,grist for the summary judgment mill.afarian,the existence of a legal duty is a question of law appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.central to brown claims against the united states and boston edison is the question of whether either party owed him a duty of care.
generally,a duty of care exists under massachusetts law where the resulting harm was reasonably foreseeable.jupin,at.more specifically,where an actor is able to foresee that his conduct could cause harm to others,he is charged with a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid this harm.id.to the extent that a legal standard does exist for determining the existence of a tort duty,it is a test of the reasonable foreseeability of the harm.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also glick prince italian foods of saugus,there is no duty owed when the risk which results in the plaintiff injury is not one which could be reasonably anticipated by the defendant.with this general terrain mapped,we turn first to brown claim against the united states.
brown negligence claim against the united states is premised on his contention that the united states owned and controlled hartwell road off of which he was injured.control is the key as,under massachusetts law,it is elementary that liability for damage caused by the condition of premises commonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality,either through ownership or otherwise.underhill shactman,citation omitted see also mcintyre boston redevelopment,t he critical test is who had the right to control the property.
despite brown contention to the contrary,the record evidence overwhelmingly supports the district court conclusion that the town of bedford,and not the united states,controlled hartwell road either through ownership or otherwise.several pieces of evidence stand out.
first,a sworn declaration and a deed both indicate that the town of bedford actually owned hartwell road.the united states title expert,after examining a multitude of records including those of the bedford town clerk,testified that the town of bedford took title to hartwell road in.a deed from the commonwealth of massachusetts,while granting the united states fee ownership of the land surrounding hartwell road,explicitly excluded all public or private roads,right s of way easements now existing within the said boundaries 
in addition,the sworn deposition testimony of four witnesses leads to the conclusion that the town of bedford controlled hartwell road.a witness responsible for maintaining the grounds and roads at hanscom for decades testified that the town of bedford has always maintained hartwell road and that the employees at hanscom had never maintained or done anything to the road.an employee of the town department of public works testified that the town maintains hartwell road and is responsible for law enforcement on the road.with respect to the town maintenance of the road,this witness noted that the town sweeps,plows,and paves the road,in addition to painting its street lines and filling its potholes.a previous bedford town foreman who had worked in bedford highway and grounds division testified similarly regarding the town maintenance of hartwell road.finally,the united states title expert testified that the town of bedford installed a sewer line under the road around.
finally,the declarations of two government employees support the united states position.a civilian employee of the united states air force,responsible for overseeing the real property for the air force facilities at hanscom air force base,testified that no agency of the federal government owns or has owned or maintained hartwell road and its shoulders.a civilian employee of the united states navy,responsible for managing the navy portion of the hanscom land,testified that the road was used as a public road and that the navy did no maintenance,construction,planning,public safety,or law enforcement work with regard to the road.
faced with this substantial evidence,brown nevertheless argues that two other pieces of evidence turn the issue of control into a question for the jury.after closer examination of this evidence,we disagree.
brown offers the affidavit of a licensed attorney,who opined that the town of bedford has merely an easement interest in hartwell road and that the united states is the fee owner of the road.even if this testimony were enough to put the ownership of hartwell road into question,the distinction made in the affidavit is immaterial.as detailed above,the record evidence makes manifest that the town of bedford exercised control over hartwell road in every conceivable sense.
